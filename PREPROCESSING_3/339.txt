welcome to the hubermenlacancens th te science the science pace tos fi mandrhubermen and our proprofessor r neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today we are discussing music and your brain however thi episode could have just as easily been entitled music is your brain or your brain is music and that is because music believe it ore not is a neurological phenomenon most of us think of music as something that happens outside of us the sounds we hear the lyrics we hear their meaning how they anchor us to pieces of our history both emotional or sotial it turns out that when we listen to music it activates nearly every piece of our brain moreover when we listen to music it activates our brain in ways that our brain itself and indeed our body is well help to create that music at the level of called neurl onsambles that is the firing of nurans in other words when we listen to music our brain in our body become part of the instrument that contributes to our perception of that music today i'm going to make clear howl of that happens we will also discuss how music can be leverage towards shifting our brain states and our bodily states for instance what sorts of music to listen to in order to make ourselves happy yes studies have been done on that as well as how long to listen to music in order to shift our mood or our over all bodily state including how to process feelings of sadness many of you are probably familiar with particular songs that anchor us to particular times in our history or people in our history and there is an age old question really as to whether not listening to sad music can help us process our feelings of sadness or whether not they drive us further down the spiral of sadness and despair and indeed studies have explored this as well to day i will explain how music indeed how different types of music activ a different neural circuits in your brain to create different brain and bodily states how we can leverage music toward things emotional processing shifting our emotions as well as to enhance learning and memory and we will also talk about the use of music to enhance brain plasticity that is your brains ability to change in response to experience nocious in response to that music but rather using music as a tool to expand our capacity for neurl plasticity giving us the ability to learn far more in other contexanareas of life i condfess that in researching this episode i found myself continually delighted as to first of all how impressive the science of the study of music in the brain is and secondly how fundamental music is to all of our lives and this is true whether or not your somebody who listens to music often or your somebody that really prefer scilence indeed we will talk about whether not it is better to listen to music or remain in silence when you perform certain kinds of work it turns out that there is a very clear answer to that if you want a little bit of a hint it is best to listen to music in between bouts of work or during brief rest periods as oppose to listen to music while you work and for those of you that listen to music while you work and thoroughly enjoy listening to music while you work we will also discuss what that means about your brain in particular because it is likely that it got wired up that way it a particular phase of development and each and all of you can learn to day how to best leverage music toward productivity but perhaps equally important how to leverage music for enrichment and enjoyment of life i'm please to announce that we will be hosting three live events in australia all three events will cover science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance there will also be a live question in answer session the first live event will take place on february tenth in melbourne at the plenary theatre the second live event will take place on february seventeenth in sidney at the sidney opera house and the third event will take place on february twenty third in brisben at t a great hall to accesstick its to any of these events simply go to huberman labdoc calm slash toour and use the code huberman i hope to see you there and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science before you begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is eight sleep eight sleep make spart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity a spoken many times to before on this podcast about the fact that sleep that is getting enough quality sleep each night is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the keythings to getting a great night sleep is to make sure that your body temperature drops by about one to three degrees at the beginning of the night indeed that is how your body falls and stays deeply asleep as well in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your bodily temperature needs to increase by about one to three degrees eight sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment allowing you to fall and stay deeply asleep throughout the night and to wake up feeling refreshed i startd sleeping on an ate sleep mattress cover well over two years ago and it is completely transformed my sleep it is allowed me to fall asleep more quickly it is allowed me to sleep more deeply throughout the night and if i happen to wake up during the middle of the night something that is perfectly normal ado wonts or even twice i fall back to sleep far more quickly and i wake up feeling refreshed as the consequence my mood focuss and alertness throughout the day is greatly elevated as compared to prior to sleeping on my eight sleep mattress cover if you would to try and ate sleep mattress cover you can go to eight sleep dot calm slash huberman to save a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ssa candida u c select countries in the eu nd australia again that is eight sleep dot calm slash huberman to day's episode is also brought to us by roca roco makes eye glasses in sun glasses that are the absolute highest quality i've spent ha lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly indifferent environments roca understands the biology the visual system and as design their eye glasses and some glasses that you always see with crystal clarity originally their glasses were designed for performance that is for running and cycling and for sport and indeed they can still be used for performance they will not slip off your face if you get sweaty their extremely light waigt but i should mention that roca eye glasses and some glasses come in some of the aesthetics mor typically associated with performance glasses tho syeboard style glasses but they also have a number of styles that yououd be perfectly comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work i wear readers at night or when i drive and i wear some glasses during the day if i haven to be driving into bright light or outside in its just overwhelmingly bright i do not wear sune glasses when i do my morning sunlight viewing to set my circadian rhythm and i suggest that you do the same if you to try roca eye glasses or some glasses you can go to roca ar ok a da com and enter the code hubermen to save twenty percent off your first order again that is roca ar o k a da com and enter the code huberman at checkout ok let us talk about music and your brain and to start off i swen to take a step back and acknowledge something that is absolutely remarkable about music which is if you think about language i could describe to you a glass i could describe t you an apple i could describe to you a story i could describe to you a face i could describe to you any number of different things and you can do the same for me language is essentially infinite in the number of things that it can explain and the ways that it can explain it and yet if you think about music music provided there are no lyrics in that music cannot explain how a glass is shaped it cannot even tell you that there is a glass present in the room or on a table it cannot tell you what a face looks it cannot tell you what that person who owns t hat face did or is doing in some ways you might think well music is fairly diminished in terms of its qualitative depth compared to language and yet if you take a step back and think about what music can do it is astonishing and it actually overwhelms what language can do what can music do well even in the absence of any lyrics any words put to music music can describe an emotion in fact music can describe numerous types of emotions and it can do it with a lot of nuants not just displaying for us happy or sad but rather different degrees of happiness different degrees of sadness music can be used to convey a sense of longing a sense of nostalgia a sense of delight a sense of awe and on and on whereas music cannot describe nounds very well it can beautifully describe emotions and not only can music describe emotions with a tremendous degree of nuants music can evoke emotions with a tremendous degree of nuants now this is spectacular and it is not only spectacular it is important because as we move through to day's episode you will soon come to realize that it is very likely and indeed we have a lot of scientific evidence to support the fact that music evolved prior to spokein language moreover it is very likely that singing evolved prior to spokein language and that music singing and dance together evolved prior to language making music as well as singing and dance but really just music even on its own in the absence of any lyrics or any bodily movement as the fundamental form of human communication indeed music can evoke mpathy again we are talking about music in the absence of any lyrics d when i say music can evoke empathy i'm not soking about the sort of empathy where you look at somebody and nod and understand call cognive empathy which is important by the way in relational ynamics or emotional empathy were you actually feeling what the other person is feeling but of course you never really know what somebody else is feeling how could you you can only have a sense of what they might be feeling and you have a sense of what your feeling but let us be honest am as one of our prior guests on the hubring lawpodcast doctor carl diceroff am aptly noted rarely do we ever understand how any one else truly feels because indeed rarely do we ever understand how we ourselves truly feel and certainly with language it is very hard to explain our feelings with words in a way that can convey the way that we feel with the kind of new aunts that represents our own reality even in a state of extreme happiness or extreme sadness words fall short of explaining how we feel inside and yet as i mentioned earlier music not only can describe emotions it can evoke emotions within us and in doing it can evoke emotions that give us a sense of empathy for the person playing the music or simply for others in the world and music can do that powerfully because not only does music come in through our ears and will talk about the process of how sound is converted into what we perceive as music in a little bit because indeed it comes in through our ears and we can hear that music of course but the nerve cells the nurans in your brain as well as the nerve cells in your body can become activaded by music in a way that the firing of those nurans literally the frequency of those nurl impulses comes to match the frequency of the sounds that your hearing in your outside environment in other words when you listen to music not only is that music coming into your body through your sense organs your your hearing but your body itself is an instrument playing that music from within for instance if you listen to a piece of music that has a lightness to it that evokes a sense in you of the turning of the seasons from winter to spring has something that is ommon and certain classical music but other forms of music as well when you hear that music indeed it is coming in through your ears but also the firing of the nurons in your brain and body responding to those particular frequencies of sound is such that your body itself is an instrument playing that sense of the turning of the seasons from winter to spring within you which is why your body starts to feel lifted in some cases or it starts to feel a lightness in some cases and an entire set of emotions starts to be recruted that at least for you resemble the turning of the seasons from winter to spring now that may sound rather complex but we are going to break that process down into its component parts but what i essentially just said is that when you listen to music not only are you hearing that music but your body that is your nurons and indeed your hormons as well things oxy tosin and some other hormones in your brain and body that will discuss are contributing to a symphony of emotion from within your body and brain ocaso while music cannot explain objects it cannot describe them it can explain in a very nuonstways emotions and it can evoke emotions within us now if that is not amazing enough music can not only describe and evoke emotions it can also imply intent think for instance about drumming that you would hear off in the distance and we are not talking bout we are talking drumming of this sort dum dum dum and perhaps the cadence of that drumming changes such that as its approaching it gets more and more frequent dum dum dumwhat is the intent being implied well we know from numerous studies and from numerous movies that you have seen and heard that that sort of low frequency drumming of increasing cadence as it approach hes is implying the intent of aggression or war or at least is implying that something serious is going to happen now contrast that with a different frequency of sound played at a higer canes teentettenteenten now the second said of tones dentntenten are far less clear in terms of what they mean what their intent is but if we contrast them with les just call them what they are typically called the war drums or the drums that that convey a sense of aggressive intent dum dum dum what we create then is a juxtaposition of too different emotional states in you perhaps or maybe you do not respond to those with any robust emotional shift but we are conveying too separate or distinct sets of intent now of course spoken language can convey intent i could say for instance i'm going to help you how can i help you today or i could say i'm going to hurt you right of course with spoken language you could do that and you could change the intonation of that languague change the frequency if i were to say i'm going to hurt you it is very different then if i say i'm an o hurt you oque or if i put it as a question i'm in to hurt you oquet with language of course is also the opportunity for a lot of nuants depending on where the inflections where the accents are on a particular phrase even a particular word but with music as you recall when we convey a sense of intent we are also conveying that sense of intent through the body of the listener not just bringing it in through their ears and when we do that what we do as we start to recruit a huge number of narrl circuits that are involved not just in understanding or a sense of empathy for an emotion but rather that can recruit movement or what we call premotor circuits in the body premotor circuits re the nurons that start to fire before particular pattern of action is generated and when we hear music that conveys emotion that evokes emotion and especially when we hear music that conveys a sense of intent from the outside we too start to feel as if we need to move or respond to that music in a particular way now what i just described to you is not something that is learned in fact it is innate how do we know that well there are some beautiful studies that have explored how babies respond to music indeed how babies respond to specific types of music speciic frequencies of sound spacing between particular notes and on and on it is been demonstrated for instance that babies as young as three months old respond to music very differently than they respond to just other forms of sound scrambled in time now of course babies that are three months old are not speaking you could ask them does that sound music how does it make you feel et cetera they are not going to answer at least not with any coherence bcause they do not have spoken language yet but despite their absence of language we know that babies as young as three months old respond to music because they do with rhythmic movements of their bodily limbs and actually their torso as well now little but later we will touch on this issue of what types of music evoke movement of the torso verses movement of the limbs verses movement of the torso and limbs know i'm not going to danse for you during this podcast however there is a really interesting story there that relates to how primitive or evolved the motornerons the nurons that actually move the musculature are and how primitive or evolved the music that one listens to is but just to give you a sense of where that is headed in this study where they examined the responses of very young babies to music they found is that certain frequencies of sound evoked movements in those babies that were rhythmic where it was mostly th eir torso moving back and forth and may be their head a little bit whereas other patterns of sound different frequencies in different arrangements evoked movement of their limbs more than their torso and still other patterns of sounds evoked movement of their torso limbs and head in other words babies dancing and if you have ever been to a wedding or a party or been out dancing you will see people who include more torso verses limb verses limb and torso movement when they dance and yes of course some of this relates to proficiency in dancing comfort on the dance floor et cetera but there are some universal rules out there about how certain frequncies and patterns of sound a c music evokes different types of bodily movements starting from a very young age prior to any instruction in terms of how to dance or what music is babies are dancing to music and that highlights an important point that we we return to again and again throughout to dayis episode which is that the systems of the brain that respond specifically to movement not just sound but specifically to musical sounds are intimately tie to the nerl circuits of the body the generate movement and this is its specially important understand when we get into our discussion about music and our sense of motivation o case of the list of incredible things that music can evoke within us by way of how it activates our nervous system in body is starting to grow we have talked about how music can convey emotion how music can evoke emotion and how music can convey a sense of intent as well now as how music can generate action within us this is a pretty spectacular list if you think about it in addition music causes changes within our bodily physiology that extends beyond the nervous system althoughit has a relationship to the nervous system in particular there been a lot of studies that have explored how music changes things our blood pressure or how fast our heart is beating oure called resting heart rate and here we have made some important discoveries in recent years and when i say we i do not mean my laboratory i mean laboratories that focus on the relationship between music and our bodily physiology because we have long known that music can change various healthmatrics they'r some really nice studies and all link to one or two of the meditanalysies of these studies in the shownote captions that hive showed that if people listen to anywhere from ten to thirty minutes of music per day and by the way the selection of music in the studies ranged for everything from rockenroll to classical music to country music typically these studies would ask subjects what their favorite music is and then they would have them listen to that particular joner of music for anywhere from ten to thirty minutes per day and if you look at the medat analysies of those studies we find is that almost all of them see some sort of significant effect that is some statistically significant shift in the bodily physiology of people that deliberately listen to music for ten to thirty minutes per day not while doing anything else but just listening to that music they find for instance that theire resting heartrate is reduced if not during the perio in which are listening to the music then after the time in which they listening the music they find that theyre called heartrate variability tends to increase for those of you that arent familiar with heartrate variability having increased heartrate variability is a good thing and that is because heartrate variability reflects the sort of pushion pull ere the balance rather of the activation of the called sympathetic nervous system which is the one sometimes called the fighter flight system althoughi do not really that nomen clature the sympathetic nervous system by the way is not about emotional sympathy its what drives your heart rate higher tends to put us into activated states on where we favor movement and motion and a makes us alert whereas the paris sympathetic aspect of our nervous system is the porsion of our autonomic nervous system sometimes called the rest in digest system the para sympthetic nervous system drive states of deep for relaxation of calm in any event heartrate variability reflects a periodic breaking a slowing down of heart rate and breathing and other aspects of our nerl system function that works alongside with sympathetic activation think of sympathetic activation as an accelerateor par sympathetic activation as a break and when heartrate variability is higher it reflects the fact that our pari sympathetic nervous system is periotically engaging it is getting activated and slowing our heart rate slowing our breathing down music seems to have the effect of activating that par sympathetic aspect of our nervous system and we are pumping the brak every once and while slowing down our harrate slowing down our breathing in other words when people listen to music for a dedicated period of time each day of about ten to thirty minutes some studies looked at as much as sixty minutes but typically ten to thirty minutes what one finds is that heartrate variability increases not just during the period when theyre listening to the music this is very important but also heartrate variabilities increased around the clock in those subjects even during sleep making listening to ten to thirty minutes of your favorite music each day not just what i would think to be a enjoyable protocol if you could even call it a protocolts enjoyable to listen your favorite music that onm feels almost inappropriate to call it a protocoll because protcall sounds kind of rigid your imposing that on yourself but if you need not excuse to listen to your favorite music for ten to thirty may be sixty minutes per day and just attending to that music not while doing anything else which is what these studies had subjects do well indeed that is been shown to increase heart rate varyability around the clock which we know is beneficial for your mental and physical health more generally o case of there dozens if not hundreds of studies that have explored how music impacks our physiology and as i just mention it seems that if we listen to music that we for ten to thirty may be sixty mense to day our physiology certain healthmetrics heartray veryability in particular improof now in light of the pousive effects of steting to music on one's health there is a recent metanalysis that i found particularly interesting the title this metanalysis is effects of music on the cartyovascular system and it was published in trensin carty ovascular medicine now from the title of this paper effects of music on the cartivascular system you might think that it is just yet another metanalysis exploring how music impacts heart ra veriability in things of that sort but what is interesting about this study is that it identifies that the way in which listening to one's favorite music positively impacts the carty ofascular system and other aspects of our physiology is very likely not through direct changes on our heart rate simply by listening to music but rather through changes in our breathing and this is true even if people were not singing along with the music by the way now the relationship between breathing and heart rate is something that i've touched on before but if you have not heard me discusse thas i'm just going to briefly tell you the relationship in two or three sentences and then i'll explain the mechanism also an about two to three sentences if you have a background in biology or even if you do not this will all be very simple and very clear when you deliberately inhale with a lot of vigor or you deliberately make your inhale longer than you naturally would for instance if i breathing very vigorously through my nose something very specific happens to your heart rate it increases whereas when you deliberately exhale meaning when you exhale and deliberately make that exhale longer or you deliberately add vigor to that exhale or even a shorter deliberate more vigorous exale you slow down your heart rate and that is because of a phenomenon called respiratory sciness a rhythmea which because it includes the word a rhythmea sounds a bad thing but it is actia wonderful thing and has to do with the relationship between a particular muscle in your body called the diaphram which when you inhale our lungs fill with air our diaphram moves down and our heart therefore has a litte bit more space it actually gets bigger temporarily bigger but bigger and when it does that whatever volume of blood is in the heart is now moving through a larger space it is the same amount of blood moving through a larger space and the nervous system registers that as the blood moving more slowly through that temporarily enlarged heart and as a consequence there is a signal sent through various stations of the nervous system to the heart to speed the heart up in other words just as i said before when we inhale our heart rate speeds up conversely when we exhale our lungs empty outsome air our diaphrim moves up and as a consequence of that there is less space for the heart and our heart temporarily becomes smaller and when that happens the volume of blood within that smaller heart moves more quickly and that is detected by the nervous system which then triggers a nerl signal from the paris sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which is just fancy nerve speak for a nerl signal iss end to your heart every time you exhale to slow your heart down the well established effects of listening to your favorite music increasing your heart rate variability is not a direct interaction between the sounds coming in through your ears and changes in your heart rate while you are listening to the music that is actually what i would hove thought happened but this more recent metaanalysis pulls apart the variables in these different studies really illustrates that when we are listening to music we are subconsciously most thef times subconsciously changing our patterns of breathing we are inhaling an anticipation of certain things happening in the music were exhaling when we feel a relief of tension we get excited we may get sad we may get happy we may een just be listening to music that we do not think is impacting our physiology t such a core level but indeed it is music is able to rout into our nervous system at levels below our conscious awareness and literally turn the various knobs if you will of our cardiovascular system of our breathing apparatus the diaphram the lungs it can evoke respiatory sciness a rhythmium which again sounds a terrible thing but is actually the reflection of a healthy nervous system and heart and indoing yes it increases heart rate very bility something that is beneficial to all of us but it is doing by changing ore patterns of breathing if you have ever wondered why music can change how you feel robustly well it is doing that at a deep foundational level of your nervous system indeed at the levels of your nervous system that typically are not in your conscious awareness because iave to imagine that most of your publy not listening to music and thing oh here comes that one chorus or here comes that one melody and this is where i always exhal or this is where i always hold my breath this sort of thing no most peeple are just listening to music it is coming in through their ears they are experiencing some bodily sensations may be there move in their torseau arms maybe arms and toor maybeu're not moving it all no dancing maybe just listening within your head or maybe it is just dropped into the background below your conscious awareness at all and yet that music is communicating emotion it is evoking emotion it is communicating intent it is activating those premotor circuits that would have you move if it could and we will talk about dance a little it later but even if you are not dancing even if you are not swaying the tiniest bit your patterns of breathing are changing and through respitory siness a rhythmea your heart rate is changing and through changes in your heart rate your heart rate very bility is increasing if ever you wantit a toolor protocol that was easy to use but could positively impact your mental and physical health well listening to your favorite music for ten to thirty maybe sixty minutes maybe more per day is that protocal as many of i've been taking agy one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that thei'r sponsoring the pod c ast ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with ag one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need and it also contains adaptigencs to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take ag one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer ag one if you would to try ag one they' to drink ag one dot calm slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitemin d three k to again that is drink ag one dot calm slash hubermen hopefully it is becoming clear just how absolutely powerful music is at evoking different physiological responses within you that is within your brain and body but there is an additional one that i find particularly interesting because it addresses and indeed answers one of the most common questions that i receive all the time which is how can i get more motivated not how i andrew can get more motivat althoughof course i asked myself that question from time to time although admittedly most of time i'm wondering ho i'm just can get everything i need to get done done but i often get the question how can i feel more motivated or what can i do to sustain my motivation over time and i we hear a lot of different strategies about how to do that we hear about the n just do it strategy the incredible slogan that a nihk created and that persist to this day a has become commonplace and culture and indeed the just do it a form of advice a can be a good one but for a lot of people a just hearing just do it or telling themselves just do it is not something that can evoke action in them aother people will listen to motivational speeches they will look at motvational vidios they will read motivationl books am they may ven hire coaches in otherwords people invest a ton of time energy and money in to trying to be more motivated and indeed a number of episodes of the huberminlab podcast have focussed on the relationship between say motivation drive and the nurmodulator dopamine we have several episodes about that as well as h tool kid all of which are available zero cost at huberman labdot colm you can acts us those easily by putting motivation into the search function at hubermanlabdot colm all of that will come up time stamped et cetera but perhaps surprisingly today's conversation about music offers us a particularly potent tool to increase motivation and that is because one of the fundamental properties of listening to music is that it evokes activation of these premotor and motor circuits within our brain and body that is the nurl circuits whose specific job is to mobilize our body from its current position and state to a new position and state for those of you that listen to music while you work out or prior to when you work out you are deafly on to something for those of you that do not that is fine to what i'm going to describe now are the specific sets of nurl circuits that listening to music activates as i mentioned earlier listening to music activates many circuits throughout the brain and body that really one can take a step back from the scientific literature on this and say any time someone has done a study where human beings listen to music and people record from marticular brain area believe are not even from the oll factory system from the system in the brain responsible for smell there seems to be some significant shift in terms of the nurl firing there are the release of nurl chemicals which on the one hand might lead you to conclude that listening to music is just sort of a non specific generalized activator of nervous system function is gound turning all the lights on but that is not the case music in fact is activating different nurl circuits differently in time and space to evoke a whole set of specific reactions in your brain and body but not the least of which is the propensity for you to move and this is something that you can leveragen indeed i'll describe our protocal by which you can leverage music in order to greatly increase your state of modivation o case this is the portion of to day's episode where we are going to discuss some specific neral circuits but i want to assure you that if you are a nurobiologist you can understand this if you are not in yourobile just in fact if you took no biology ever in your life i'm goin to make it clear and easy fr you to understand as i mention before when we hear music it activates many many circuits throughout the brain and body when i say circuits i mean nuron's nerve cells that communicate with one another he sort of chains of reactions when i say respond to one another what i mean is when nurons are quotical activated they release chemicals those chemicals are called nuro transmitters things gluedoma gaba theyare also called nuromodulators sincs i dopamin ceretonan the names do not really matter for sake of to day's discussion but what those things do is they influence the likelihood that the next nuron will be active or less active case nuron speak the language if you will of electricity cause that is how they evoke release of these chemicals and chemistry they all vomidout these chemicals those chemicals thend bind to little parking spots on the next nuron called receptors and then the next neuron gets activated electrically and then to the next neron and next neron and on it is a chain of electrochemical reactions ok there is your nurl science one to one lessen for today when people listen to music there is heightened activation of the called frontal quartecs the area of your brain which is on the surface below your skull but just behind your forehead more less and that air of your brain is involved in a lot of different things its involved in understanding context what sorts of behaviors and thoughts and actions are appropria t for given environment by the way if any of you have ever been an n environment whereeverone was really quiet you thought omahasch what is keeping me from jus blurting out my name right now are saying something totally an appropriate your frntal quartex is the one providing the the call top down in ibition on that impulse to blurt something in appropriate out and by the way your thoughts about that impulse are perfectly normal they actually reflect a heighten sense of normal se ah because it means that your brain is thinking about how it is not going to do that and therefore you are not going to do that likewise if you are ever at the edge of a high bridge a please stay on the safe side of the railing but if you think omaganis what is keeping me from just jumping off the bridgeright now what is keeping you from doing that is your frontal quartax it is suppressing certain actions in a context dependent way in particular actions that are dangerous to you socially physically dangers to others socially physically et cetera now the frontal quartax in order to do that also has an incredible ability to make predictions this is the function of the frontal quartec that i want a focus on for the moment your frontal quartex is great at doing the if this then that type of analysis if i say this every one will be offended or if i say this maybe they will laugh or if i do not say this i'll be safe if i do say that i will not be safe this kind of thing frontal quartex is activated when we listen to music because within music there are some regularities sometimes these are described as motifs or melodies or choruses again this is the entire landscape of discussion that we could have and we will have with an expert guest about how the mathematics of music impacts the electrochemical signalling within the brain and the coting that is the mathematics of brain function which leads us to predict that certain things because they just happened are likely to happen again ore not happen again but let us set all that side for the moment and just state the simple fact which is that when you listen to music your frontal quartex increases in activation because it is predicting what you are going to hear next based on what your currently hearing and what you heard before now i'm from the generation that we did not have eyepods when i was a kid we did have sedeas we did have tapes but you had to vasford or rewined a casette tape or you had to skip on the ced in order to move about the album in time nowadays you can cue up different songs in different order really easily but if you are somebody who listens to album start to finish or if you me and you grew up listening to albums start to finish may be occasionally skipping a song but you will be very familiar with this phenomenon which is that right is a given song ends if you are familiar with that album you already anticipate the start of the next song in your head and that just speaks to the predictive function that the frontal quartex plays if you have a mix tape with a bunch of different song sure you do not expect one song of a given artist to lead into the next but if you are somebody who is listene to that mixed taple lot your familiar with what song comes next or if you'r listening to a given album start to finish and you are very familiar with it well then you will immediately resinate with what i'm saying here which is that your frontal quartex is always anticipating what sound is likely to come next and this is very important because one of the key things about music and its ability to evoke our sense of surprise or delight through the release of a nurmodulator called dopamine ell get to this a bit more later is because that prediction machinery is thinking oh i heard that said of cords a moment ago i'm going to hear it again and then when it changes up you arebring us oh oh hold on that was not what i expected and it sometimes does that with a sense of delight oh yes and sometimes it hear's that and go i i what is this i do notreally this that much i the opener that song but i do not really the rest i think of that is a you other certain pastries muffins in particular r really the top it is got the croms is got the berries and stuffing ke get down past the top and then you get to the middle thing i on the singis not that good o get there certain songs that for me i ways howht f those as muffin songs itis the top of the muffin is always the best wereas a doghna is great the wholeway through and now i'm going on a tangent cause i'm thinking about muffins and donnat on to take us bacto music but the point is relevant none the lest which is that your frontal quartecs is making predictions and when those predictions are broken that is a sense of novelty and when that novelty is something that you o ca sot devokes a sense of yes i that well then dopamine is deployed and when that novelty is somethng you do not typically there is a reduction in the amount of dopamein released in ae separate set of brain circuits below whatever level of dopamen happen to be their prior you call baseline level of dopeming ok when you listen to music there is a strong activation of the prediction machinery in your brain there is also activation of the circuits in your brain that register novelty what are those circuits these are things the ventural tagmental area and the nuclia secumbents i've talked about these before on the podcast again you do not need to know those names those are the names given to certain brain areas that control the release of dopamine in time according to whatever you happen to be experiencing in that moment ocase o the measa limpic reward pathway could perhaps better be called the measo lymbic reenforcement pathway for those of you out there shouting wait the measalymbic pathway does a bunch of other things is not just dopaming i agree 's also sertonants a munch of other things but for to day's discussion were thinking about the mesolimic pathway as deploying dopamin which it does when we hear something novel meaning not what we predicted and we what we here and then there are bunch of other brain centers and circuits that listening to music activates iw just list off a few again this is not intended to confuse anybody or at a lot of useless nomin clature but since i am an thero scientist and this is a a science and science in forme tools podcast i be remist ife i did not mention that we get strong activation of a brain structure you avesh have two of them went on each side of te brain called the emigdola this is a br ain area that is part of a larger set of circuits thats associated with arousal had meaning becoming more alert becoming more aware of our surroundings and the particular sensory stimulae that are coming in at the particular time such as the notes of the music or particular a set of lyrics an music also activates eris the brain such as the parohippocampal formation the quartex and the hippocampus itself brain areas that in code and store memories and this is something that i think everyone will be familiar with when you hear certain songs or even songs that sound certain songs or even songs that you swhere you have never heard before it can envoke a sense of nestalgia of longing for something of missing somebody of sadness or of delight an happiness and positive memories of somebody or something indeed i think it is fair to say that hearing particular pieces of music particular songs more than any other experience can activate a whole library of memory and emotions within us and that is because of its ability to activate the parahippocampal regions of the brain the cartax t and the hippocampus itself again on several differen brain areas all which communicate with one another and other airs of the brain in order to incode our memories our sense of self our sense of others our sense of history with those people and on and on now rather than just make this a catalogue of different brain areas that music evokes what i'm trying to do is spell out how music activing these different brain airis is creating different components of what we are familiar with as our experience of music frontol quartex prediction mesolymbic reward pathway novelty a migdula a sense of emotion and arousal parhippocampo quartec and qartec and hippocampus our memories in particular our emotional memories and our location memories associate with h particular piece of music right haven you ever heard a song from let say a summer camp that you went to when you were a kid elson youremembering the smell of the grass is that that sommer camp you remember ring how some of the kids were really great and ow some of the kids were really obnoxious remembering some things that you did rememberng your counsilors at mudis whole landscape of noural information their life information stored in your head that hearing a particular song that was song when you were what eight years old ten years old at campjust flips the lid on and it comes gaisering out remarkable now theire two other sets of brain circuits that are activated by music that deserve specific attention and deserve that specific attention now in the context of discussing motivation and music's ability to motivate us in particular ways and those brain circuits are the basil ganglia cas this is a set of circuits within the brain their associate with action initiation called go circuits and withholding action called nogo circuits but basically the basil ganglia are involved in regulating movement and the sarabellum the sarabellum is sometimes refered to his the mini brain it looks a lominy brain in the bottom back of the human brain some species the sarabellum is much larger relatives the rest of the brain but in humans is this little piece in the back that looks a little mini brain your carrying a second brain back ther es oay call mini brain sarabellum ats involved in a lot of things but one of its primary functions is to incode rhythmic timing in processing and along with its outputs to some deeper brain stemareas things the vestibular and coclear nuclie we will talk about this the parabracial nuclis again you do not need to know these names it meaning the sarabellum along with the basil ganglia creates patterns of activity in our brain that cascade down to particular circuits in our body these are call premotor circuits and motor circuits that generate the sense that we not only can move but that we want to move that we want to move in particular ways if you internalize nothing from the last five minutes or in which i've been describing how music impacts differnt neral circuits in the brain please do take away this important point which is that w hen we listen to music we think of that as an auditory experience but now that it is also an emotional experience and and this is a very important and when we listen to music it is programming a specific set of motor actions that are more likely to occur put differently when we listen to music we are more likely to move our body and not just dance not just move our torseau our limbs or our limbs an torso together in concert with the music but rather move our body from its current position to another position and this is one of the most important things to understand about music music despite being an auditory stimulus coming in through our ears evokes the activation of nurl circuits in our brain that creates a sort of inertia it creates a propensity for action across our entire body now that you understand that listening to music activates lots of different brain circuits of course the circuits that respond to auditory stimula wil cll primary auditory cortexas powerfully activated by listening to music but also circuits associate with novelty anticipation we talked about circuits in the brain sociate with memory but also circuits in the brain that are associate woulh generating movement and not just movement that is in sink with or corresponds to the music that were listening to but all forms of movement but when we listen to music that has a relatively fast cadents and we can actually tofine what that cadence needs to be and will do that in a moment when we do that called premotor circuitry the circuitry that is going to initiate that kind of inertia or that pressure for movement within the narl circuits that actually evoke movement ar all activated for those of you that to listen to music whileue exercise youare familiar with the fact that listening to great songs with a great be with particular learics or that associate you with a particular time or place in your life can be very motivating but there are datas showing that when people listen to music that is faster than about a hundred forty to a hundred and fifty beats per minute that it creates a heightened state of motivation in the body to move and the way that it does that is by way of shifting the balance between those go circuits and no go circuits of the basil ganglea ther some other ways that it does it as well for instance music can evoke the release of certain nurochemicals called the catacolomines these include dopomin but also nor epan efor an anepaneperan from centers in the brain an body glends in the body the adrenal gland that shift the body toward a predisposition of being more likely to move we wanted to still all this out to a simple actionable take away simply know this listening to music relatively faster music predisposes you to be more motivated to move and that is independent is what i find call it is independent of whether not your familiar with the song independent of whether not the lyrics of the song are motivating lyrics if they are that is just going to layer on top of the faster cadents which is going to predispose you to move but what is remarkables that just listening to that faster cadence music is creating a neuronal resonence if you will o pattern of neuronal firing within you that is going to essentially take your om and here i'm using metaphor is going to put your state of motivation from either back on your heels to being flat footed or let us sat you'r mildly motivateds r ill all that flat footed to being forward center of mass for any of you that are suffering from lack of motivation in particular to exercise but believe ar not also to do cognitive work where youre going to be still in you are in a sit down here in a read or learn or practice something listening to music for ten to fifteen minutes prior to doing that work prior to doing that exercise is one of the best ways to get motivated in order to engage in that work or engage in that exercise that is been demonstrated in the data very conclusively using avariety of different types of music and again their multiple mechanisms that converge to create that heighten state of motivation some of those mechanisms are nurral chemical the release of the socal catacolomins dopome nor up an effern an epanephran some of them are strictly nurral circuit base o activation of premotor circuitry and those are going to comb ind with neral circuits that are going to narrow your field of vision this is a good thing when ever you wane to be motiv ateo they are going literally constrict your field of vision to more of a tunnel type of vision as sopposed to more panoramic vision and that i described it as placing you into a forward centere of mass i do not necessarily mean literally a forward centere of mass unless perhaps you'r exercising running leading slightly forward what i'm talking about is using music as a way to deliberately shift your state of mind an body from one that is a motiv ated not motivat it to more motivated and it is a very simple protocol extracted from the pure reviewed literature you simply find some faster music hopefully music that you whit would be even better if it was music that had lyrics that you find motivating and listening to that for ten to fifteen minutes prior to engaging in whatever that work may be physical or cognitive on the topic of cognitive work one of the most common questions i get is what sorts of sounds or music should i listen to in order to increase my state of productivity motivation concentration et cetera on previous podcasts related to focus ind motivation i touched on the use of called by noral beats which are different frequencies of beats presented to one or the other ear this is best accomplished with headphones and they are a lot of different frequencies of by noral beats that you can get out there im if gant to get detailed about this by noral beats also i involve the differential between the frequency of beats between the two it presented to the two ears and then that difference then is heard by higher order process ing centers in the brain in any event we do not have to get two technical about it we can simply say that yes there are some decent pureviewed studies demonstrating that when people listen to called forty hurts the particular frequency of sound forty hurts by noral beats that it can enhance concentration and focus however this is important there some recent studies that show that bynoral beats sometimes can impede concentration and focus and thereby can impede c native performance on various tasks however the studies that show that by norl beats can be detrimental to performance onvarious cognive tasks did not use forty hurts by nrl beats specifically we are still awaiting more studies on by norl beats meanwhile i'll just restate what i said before is that there is some evidence that listening to forty hurts by norl beats can enhance concentration and focus there are also data showing that other frequencies of by norl beats might be detrimental to concentration and cognive performance and previously i've also tiscussed studies showing that for instance of people listen to white noise in the background you coan do the s on computer or speakers in the room or headphones or call brown noise which is essentially white noise ss all frequencies of sound or most frequencive sound combined but with particular frequencies of sounds that are ccentuated and others are notched out as it is called call brown noise rather than understand all of this that e technical level that covered that before an previous podcasks suffice to say if you go to you toben he just put in white noise background for cognave focus or brown noise background for cognave focus you can just try those if you during a session in which you are trying to read or learn or to mathematics or music or any kind of cognative work if you do not them if they do not work for you than i there is certainly no obligation to use them likewise with forty hrts by norl beats and for by norl beats you can also find those as zero cost you toscripts their number of zero cost aps that will low you to listen tof by norl beats i've use the apbrainwave for some period of time now to beosce i've never done this strict control experiment on myself of listening to the forty hurts by norl beats or not listeng to forty hrts by norl beats doing the equivalent types of tasks i im can be fairly regimented with my i work in behavior but i have not run a detail control study on myself around this rather if i want to heighten my level of focus ar rule out distractions what i will do as i will listen to either white noise or brown noise while i do work or i will listen to forty hurts by norl beats while i do certain types of work or sometimes frankly i just work in silence other times i will listen to classical music in the background of a big fan of listening to a classical piano i particular glanggould the bock variations those a very pleasant to me but and this is really important in researching this episode about music in the brain what i discovered was in the controlled studies that have been carried out as to whether or not people perform better on cognive tasks that require a lot of focus especially learning tasks that compared silence in the background to purely instrumental music in the background to music with lyrics in the background to one's favorite music with or without lyrics the data are very clear it is very clear that most people that means statistically on average people perform bast on cognive tasks or tass that require a lot of focus to perform again these are mental tasks not physical task when they are doing those tasks in complete silence that was somewhat surprising to me second best conditions are to do those tasks in the presence of instrumental music only and in that case there was a lot of variation as to whether not people referred faster cadents music a hundred and forty t a hundred and fifty beats perminute or fast or or slower music sixty beats perminute or slower i'll get back to those specific numbers later because they represent thresholds for inducing different types of emotional states either happy or sad but meanwhile it is very clear when people work in silence they perform better than when they work with music instrumentals in the background and they perform even less well when they listen to music with lyrics in the background will talk about why that is the case in a moment and then people perform especially poorly relative to their performance in silence or any of the other conditions i mention when they listen to their favorite music while doing cognive work and that to me was a bit surprising a especially since i spent a lot of my university year e's studying while listening to my favorite music ndifferent forms that listen a slower music than faster music and go back and forth and then sometimes turn it off altogether and work in silence but the center of mass of the literature around this issue of whether not to listen to music while one studies or tries to learn something the date are pretty clear the data show that it is best to study and learn either in silence or with quiet instrumentals in the background now i mention before that previous studies compared the effects of working in silence verses working with forty hurts by noral beats or white noise or brown noise in the background in those studies it was found that the white noise brown noise and forty hurts by noral beats background produce better levels of focus i shouls a heighten levels of focus and cognive performance and learning then working in silence but i've not yet seen a stdy that compared forty hurts by noral beats brown noise white noise to music directly i perhaps there is one outhere if there is please send it to me i'd be very curious to learn what the results of those are now that might seem a lot of information but tha take aways from it are very clear andit is always nice when things are clear right it is clear that if we want o focus and learn that working in silence or with white nose are brown noise are forty hurts by norl beats is going to be preferable to working while listening to music but if you are going to listen a music while you work that is du cognitive work then you are going to want to listen to music that is purely instrumental and ideally the music would be somewhat faster than a hundred d forty to a hundr and fifty beats perminete now i do not expect you to go and measure the frequency of beats perminute in the music that you listen to in of course the beats perminnte are going to change right that is an average a hundred and forty to hundre and fifty beats perminent i do not expect you to get supertechnicill break down the music that yofre listening to that is not a my goal noris that really what this podcast is about i think occasionally people think that now the the goal of a science and science pace proto calls podcasts is to optimize everything in fact i not such a fan of the word optimize because optima really depends on the situation tyou happen to be in the point here is simply this that many people out there cle myself have been listening to some of our favorite music while working but it is very clear as to why that degrades cognive performance we know for instance that when we read we are creating a semantic narrative in our own head and when we listen to music with lyrics especially music with lyrics that we recognize the semantic content of the song the lyrics competes with our comprehension of the narrative within our head from the material that were supos to be learning now it should be sort of obvious why listening to your favorite music that includes lyrics while trying to learn something else is going to impede learning it is because you got multiple scripts multiple dialogues happening in your head and in fact this is an opportunity for me to take a slight tension but a relevant one which is to say a lot of times people will ask me now how i can retain a lot of information i confess i never use a tell a promptor for podcasting i do have a a usually a short stack of notes anywhere from one to yo six or seven pages of just a bullet pointed notes that cue up things that i want o talk about and that i have research in the lertureand then of course i'll refer to papers from time to time but one of things that is been very useful for me which was taught to me by the way by professor when i was in university to read and retain information that i've read by memory is that when i read im trying to listen to the words being spoken in my head typically my own voice although sometimes in some one else's voice does not really matter i find when i'm reading yes it is the process of visual scanning but i'm also listening to the words within my head as if there being spoken some of you may be familiar with this because you do at others of you perhaps might find this a bit more foreign i'd be curious to know what your process of reading and retaining that information is whether not in includes an internal dialogue but none the less it should be very straightforward now to see wh if you are listening to words that you r reading on a page maybe even mumbling them a little bit moving your your lips sylobit why you read which by the way if youre heard our episode on language and auditory processing with doctor eadychang whose charvener or surgery it you cee s f talked about the fact that when we read any material that the brain is generating premotor activity know what premotor activity is premotor activity down to the muscles of the throat larrington's farinks which would speak those words were those signals to get above a certain level but that when we read typically the signals that are getting sent through those premotor circuits are just below the threshold of what would have us actually speak those words put simply when we read we are jushi of saying what we are reading and when i say that when i read i'm listening to the words in my head that is what i'm referring to we are starting to fundle in on some general principles of music and how it impacts the brain and how that can be leverage toward better learning and better motivation both in the contect of physical and cognive endeavors o caseo if you want to get motive ated listening to music prior to doing something that you are trying to motivate to do is a good idea that is what the day a say if you are trying to learn something that is cogniative that requires reading focus and concentration silence forty hurts by noral beats white noise or brown noise s probably best and if you are going to listen to music listening to music that includes instrumentals but not lyrics would be best and listening to music that includes lyrics that you are very familiar with would be the worst condition now with that said there are nice studies and by the way i'm going to link to a number of reviews and primary studies in the shownote captions that refer back to this point i'm about to tell you which is that listening to music while trying to do cognive tasks can be detrimental toward learning that material turns out that if you listen to music in the breaks between trying to learn certain ma terial you can actually heighten you are level of cognition and focus and your ability to learn i find this particularly cool it is not that music is bad for focus an cognition and learning it is that listening to music especially music that you are familiar with that includes lyrics at the same time is trying to learn something else is not a good idea but listening to music with lyrics especially music with lyrics that yu're familiar with that you find particularly uplifting and motivating is a cognitive and performance inhancer when you go back to doing that work in silenes or perhaps while listening to white noise brown noise or forty hurts by norlbeats many things the answer is not black and white it is not that silence is better than music or that music is bad for learning it turns out that listening to music even music with lyrics ure very familiar with can be highly beneficial for learning but that you want to listen to that music in the breaks between these bouts of cognitive work now i've done previous podcasts that talk about how long about of cognive work can or should be typically ninety minutes is going to be the upper limite before you take a break somepeople cannot work for ninety minutes without a break an by the way focs when i say without a break i do not mean remaining in a deep trench of focus for ninety minutes nobody does that actia i suppose there are a feu focs that with norchemical assistance am or just by way of training can get themselves into a deep deep trench of focus for ninety minutes or more but most people are going to focus on something and then have their attention flit out of focus and then they 're going to have to draw ther focus back to whatever is there doin that is not just typical that is absolutely normal and you should not be concerned at all if you try in focus for three minutes and find your attention jumping around two or three time string that attempt but if you are somebody who is going to do say a ninety minute or even sixty men or even thirty minute bout of work and you are going to get up for a moment and use the restaurum or you are going to i take a break in between bouts of works o may be work for thirty minutes take ten minutes or five minutes off r ninety minutes take thirty minutes off listen to music in those breaks it seems can increase our ability to pocus and to learn new material once we return to those bouts of cognive focus now when it comes to physical exertion cart vascular exercise resistance training of any kind many people including myself to listen to music while performing that physical exercise or that physical exertion the daton weather not music improve physical performance is a bit mixed certainly you can find studies that show that it improves physical output other studies will say that it does not make a difference other sies will say that it reduces physical output however this is a very important however the type of physical exercise is not very well match between those different studies this is something that i believe is going to be highly individual in accordance with the publish data i mix it up there are times when i will head out for run or i will do a resistance training session and i will listen to music usually an album all the way through or playlist all the way through that is because i do not want to be going on to my phone very often in fact these days i use an older separate phone that does not have any tex messaging or communication to the outside world but has music loaded into it or on to it ah that allows me to just listen to music that i do not run the risk of getting distracted texting and doing things that i just want a focus on my o physical exercise i should say that phone also has audio books podcast things i have down loaded to it it is a place where i can listen to things but not communicate with the outside world at least well exercising some people do very well to listen to music literally in between and during their sets of resistance training throughout their entire runs it is going to be individual you have to figure out what is best for you however one of the most interesting things about the scientific literature on this shows that if people listen to music in particular musi tat tends to be faster more up be tipiclates going to be in these studies rock and roll me usic i suppose to classical although there are some studies that explored classical and other forms of music as it relates to exercise listening to that music in between bouts of exertion in the rest between sets of resistance training or periodicly during say a run or about of cycling can indeed enhance performance in a way that at least by my read of the data exceeds that which is observed when people just listen to music throughout in other words if you find it useful to listen to music before during and after your work outs great be my guest however what the data say is that switching up between silence and listening to music and in this case it would be listening to music that you are very familiar with and that can evoke a sense of motivation and desired action in you for whatever reason the music they be the memories that it draws you to et cetera well then that is going to be useful there really is not one protocal for how to get the most out of music for sak of physical exertion but if you are interested in playing with some of these variables as they have been examined within the pureviewed literature i find it interesting and indeed i've found it useful to for instance do work out where i only listen to music in between sets of resistance training or to listen to music prior to going out for a run and then oftentimes when i do that the song or songs will be sort of on loup in my head although i confess the lot of times nowadays i listen to podcasts while i run or while i hike and when i'm in the gim an i'm doing resistance training i to listen to music as suppose to content that requires that ire really focus very heavily on that contents such as a podcast such as a book i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood andiand a to help you better

hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside trackor doccalm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off now i to talk about the use of music to shift our mood and indeed to get us out of states of anxiety this is a really interesting scientific literature with some very specific action will take ways that i think everyone will find beneficial i certainly did however i want to point out that we do not need a scientific study to illustrate for us the way that music can shift our mood and you already know why it is that listening to a sad song can sometimes make us feel sad listening to happy music can make us feel happy it is because when we listen to music there are some fundamental components of that music literally the mathematical structure of that music including the frequency of sounds the cadence of those sounds as well as the lyrics but even in the absence of lyrics that are activating brain circuits within us such that the frequencies of sound that were hearing are evoking firing of nurons in the brain of the same frequency in other words your brain becomes a bit of a piano playing the same song that your hearing inside your head now that sort of a du right you hear music in your head even if your listening to it from outside in the room but when you understand that nuron speak the language of electrochemical communication what we are talking about he or is particular music evoking the release of neuro chemicals in your brain at a particular frequency just think about that for second we know that neurochemicals such as dopomines ceratonein some of the called indogeneous opioits write these are not opioids that people take this is not relate to the opioic crisis which i m indogenous opioids that are released in response to music things exercise different types of social interactions those and other chemicals are released according to the firing of specific nuron's and we know that when you listen to music at particular frequencies arrange in particular motifs et cetera that the nurons that release those neurochemicals are firing at those same frequencies in other words that the sound is causing a sound dependent formicologic concert within your brain that fact should make it incredibly clear as to whi certain music even in the absence of lyrics can evoke certain emotional states certain sound frequencies are transformed into the neurl language within your brain that releases certain neurochemicals that create certain emotional states of brain and body just to drill in how incredible that really is a little bit further if you see a beautiful painting or the picture or presence of somebodies face in real life that evokes a particularly strong positive or negative emotion can imagine that of course it creates the release of certainaurochemicals or perhaps in the case of a negative face suppresses the release of certain neurochemicals but we cannot say that of particular frequency of color say reads against oranges or the presence of a rainbow evokes a sort of rainbow cascade of neurochemicals whereas with sound that is exactly what is happening and this isn'n diminish the value of vision in terms of its ability to evoke emotional states within us after all i'm foremost a neur scientist but under the umbrella neral scientists i started off as and i continue to be a vision noral scientist studying the visual system an its ability to evoke emotional states within us but i have to acknowledge that the auditory system and in particular the circuits in the brain that respond to music have a remarkably potent ability to evoke these emotional states which is why when surveys have been done asking people why they listen to music the responses that have come back generally resemble the following statistics approximately ninety per cent of people say they listen to music to relax approximately eighty to per cent of people self report that they listen to music in order to make themselves happy approximately forty six point five per cent of people say that they listen to music in order to process particular states of emotion well get back to what process means in a moment but more often than not when they studies have askd specific questions about what particular types of emotions people are listening to in order to process their emotions better it is the emotion of sadness and thirty two point five per cent of people report that they listen to music in order to increase their sense of concentration and we already talked about the role of music in concentration or its ability in some cases to inhibit concentration a few minutes ago now you might be asking yourself how can ninety per cent of people listen music for one thing in eighty to per cent of people for another thing and on and forth were well over a hundr per cent of people ah well in this survey and other surveys it people hade the optionr give multiple reasons for listening to music because of course most people have multiple reasons for listening to music now with that said if we are to examine this one particular category nearly half of people who report listening to music on a regular basis listen to music in order to process their emotions we can ask what does the scientific literature tell us about how certain types of music evoke certain types of emotions or help us process certain emotions can we will get back to what we mean by process is a moment but a number of studies have been done on this there some metanalysies that converge on some general themes what i refer to as the center of mass of data right when thera lot of studies in ta given area the outcomes of some of those studies conflict with one another generally in a good metanalysis what happens is different studies are considered more powerful or less powerful than others depending on how many subjects were involved the different control conditions are lack of control conditions and on an forth this is one of the great values of medaanalysies as that they do not treat all studies equally they separate outstudies based on their level of rigor and thoroughness well what we can say with confidence is that music that makes us conqote happy or tends to shift people' state from less happy to happier regardless of how they enter the experiment tends to be faster music meaning music that on average contains a hundred forty to a hundre fifty beats perminute or faster and there' some other features to conote happy music if you will that it tends to be in a major key that if there are lyrics to that music that the lyrics tend to report things that are happy or get this total nonsense in fact when the type of lyrics in this concote happy musics i guess singing about on great events in life and positive things falling in love being in love positive memories birth of children connection to friends great adventures those lyrics or i should say that music containing those lyrics was no more effective in creating states of happiness then was music of equivalent cadence again music that was a hundred forty to a undred nd fifty beats perminute or faster on average well even if the lyrcs were complete nonsense even if the vocalizations ware not actual words it still evokes the same increase in the level of happiness in the subjects than when compared to the music containing coherent lyrics around happy events what this means is that the cadence of music is no doubt the critical variable when one is trying to shift one's mood from a state of whatever could be depressed or sad to non depress nonsad or neutral to positive and on and forth but what this also explains is one hit wonders rarely if ever by the way are one hit wonders sad and depressing songs sometimes almost always these one hi wonders are songs that are very effective ind shifting people's mood from not happy to happier are we go to say happier regardless where they started out before listening to song they feel better while and after listening to the song and indeed more often than not the lyrical content of those songs is not particularly meaning ful it is not addressing an particularly meaning ful state or issue is just what some people call a party song or something that just uplifting nottious to them but to many other people which actually brings up an interesting and a future looking point which is that nowadays we are seeing the emergence of a i artificial intelligence being used to generate new songs by capturing these well established rules gleaned from nourow science of how music impacts the brain such that in the future artificial intelligence is going to be generating hit songs for us a suppose to having people generating hit songs and know thiss evokes a state of concern and fear a in many people i think that a this is of fear that needs to be matched with a i do not know perhaps a a cautious optimism am and who knows maybe their patterns of music including lyrics that human beings in their current understanding of themselves and of music have not yet been able to tap into and who knows may be a i will be generating the best music that we ever heard or perhaps music that can shift our states from more depressed or sad to o heighten levels of happiness in ways that humans have just not been able to accomplish i think it is important to balance any pessimism about a eye and its ability to generate music based on these rules of how music impacts the brain with an open mindedness after all narrow science narrow imaging and narrl recordings directly with electrodes in the brain while people are listening to music is teaching us how the brain response to that music and is giving us information that indeed human beings but also computers can use in order to generate stimula music that can shift our brain into more positive states and if that is the case would that be wonderful another established feature of happy music is get this it is ability to get people to relax the furrow of their brow indeed to raise their eyebrows and to be a bit wide eyed and not just through autonomic arousal but rather through activation of the muscles in the face conversly we know that sad music and here we can define sad music this actually been done in the literature sad music tends to be slower than average slower than sixty beats per minutes or again on average and this again is independent of the lyrics that might not even be present in the song sad music tends to activate the corrugator muscles of the forehead which are the muscles that furrow the brow and that lead to a a kind of serious look it is in it is a folding in of the face i suppose to a widening up of the eyes and a relaxation of the brow now given where we are in the course of this discussion that should not be surprising we already talked about how listeing to particular sounds evokes the release of particular nor chemicals but in a more direct fashion listening to particular sounds activates certain premotor and motor circuits within the brain enbody not just the desire to move one's torso limbs or both bob one's head or move aheadside to side but also the micro structures of the face which because one of the main rolls of the face is to communicate a motion is going to cause either a relaxation of the brow and and a lifting of the eyebrows or a furrowing or a activation of the corrugator muscles of the eyebrow and if that is not obvious and yet interesting enough well get this there seems to be a direct relationship i'm chuckling cause is still just blows my mind because it is a total du obvious when you hear it but it is still just cool that there is a direct relationship of the frequency of the sound they here either low pitched or high pitched and the cadence of that sound and here i realize i'm not using technical music theory language but whethey 're not the that particular tone is played over and over close in time or more spaced out in time and facial expressions and indeed when we listen to base tones low frequency tones set apart from one another with some distance that they are not overlapping we get the all too familiar base face what i'm referring to here is what norw scientists would call a labelled line literally a circuit of nurons that goes from the perifery in this case our ears into our brain through several different stations and then wiks out to impact all sorts of things within a states of emotion states of motivation our propensity to move but also a labelled line circuit coming from hearing low frequency sounds played spaced apart from one another that evokes a particular facial expression and again this takes us back to the earlier statement that i made which is not an original statement frankly there are people within the field of auditory processing and understanding how the brain processis music infact one of the world experts in this doctor ar jarvis at the rockifeller university was a guest on this podcast where we talked about the relationship between music movement and singing and the fact that music movement in particular dance and singing likely preceded the evolut ion of modern spoken language well er jarvis and others have argued quite convincingly that these circuits that 'm calling labelled lines to particular facial expressions and states of emotion are the most fundamental components of communication and the ways that humans have communicated about their emotional state and literally induced that same emotional state in other members of our species dating back tens of thousands if not more years one of the fun things about researching this episode on music in the brain is that there are a lot of quality studies exploring how music impacts the brain nuro imaging nurw recording data from excellent laboratories as well as a lot of studies in fact a surprising number of studies exploring how particular types of music impacts mood states and fortunately that allowed me to glean some very specific recommendations as to the minimum amounts of say happy music that you need to listen to in order to shift your mood into a happier state and indeed the numbers exist in the literature and it has been shown that the threshold for significantly shifting one's mood into a happier state by listening to the sorts of music we talked about before that fastercagents music even with nonsense lyrics could include other lyrics instead is nine minutes not ten not eight but nine and a sort of joking when i say not ten not eight but nine because of course you could listen to music for ten minutes or fifteen minutes or longer in fact or lier we talked about the benefits of doing that but when one examines the various studies that looked at how long subjects need to listen to music in order to shift their mood into a happier state the threshold seems to be nine minutes if you want to feel happier than you currently feel it seems that listening to happy music for nine minutes or more is going to be the effective approach o casenine minutes or more to shift one state to happier what about to process sombre or sad feelings feelings of loss well this raises an even bigger question and it is a question that i also get very oftenas you are noticing i get a lot of questions often in any event one of the common questions that i get is when we are feeling sad or experiencing a loss grieving at the loss of a relationship by by death or decision or by somebody i'm moving away or the loss of a pet et cetera is it better to go into that state in other words to quotin feel one's feelings or to counter those feelings now historically that is been a very difficult question for me to answer because who am i to say whether not you should feeliour feelings or whether not feeling those feelings will take you down a trench of feeling much worse or much better in fact there is an emerging literature exactly about that issue that is whether not i' the catharsis model is really bescatharcis being the expression and feeling of one's emotions as a way to strewd or get rid of those emotions or whether not that simply drives us further down the trench of those emotions that is really i'm something that we should address in a separate podcast episode and i will have experts i'm from the fields of psychaatry ind psychology to help us i'm address that question directly but since we aretaling about music in the brain and the fact that music has a tremendous capacity to evoke emotional states including sad states what has been shown in the pure reviewed literature is that when people who are feeling sad for whatever reason loss of relationship death who knows does not really matter why their feeling sad after all it is that their feeling sad listening to thirteen minutes or more of sad music that music can contain lyrics they are familiar with or no lyrics regardless of whether not contains lyrics it is going to be on average fifty or sixty beats perminute or less we establish that already listening to that for thirteen minutes or more has been shown to be effective in allowing people to quote in quote process th eir sombre feelings and to some extent to move past their feelings of sadness those studies support the idea that when feeling sad feeling one's feelings and perhaps even amplifying those feelings of sadness by listening to sad music for thirteen minutes or more can help people process those sad feelings nd while that point might seem overly reductionist ic tually think it is of real value i am certainly familiar with feelings of loss of feelings of grief and i've often struggled with this question of o cash do i trying just push it aside or to ideal with those feelings gain this is something that you really need to determine for yourself but what these studies show pretty conclusively is that when we are feeling sad matching that sadness or amplifying that sadness by listening to sad music for thirteen minutes or more can help us move through that state of sadness and one could argue this is more r less the use of catharciss of amplifying emotional expression or feeling in order to try ing move that feeling out is a classic idea of originating in frodian psychology but probly before then as well but in any event i think these data support the idea that even whene feeling sad perhaps especially when feeling sad amplifying or matching those feelings through the use of sad music for thirteen minutes or more gan you do not need to set a time or for thirteen minutes by giving yourself a period of time to just listen to that music is one way that can help you move through that state of sadness and then be able to lean back into other areas of life we have talked about the roll of music in evoking or shifting states of happiness and sadness there are also interesting data that support the use of music for shifting one out of a state of heightened anxiety and i find this especially interesting because my laboratory for a long time has worked on behavial interventions to reduce anxiety things the physiological sigh which if you are not familiar with you can put physiological sigh in my last name in to you too vebeen there is a demonstration of thad it is a breathing technique of two inhells through the nose and al long exhile through the mouth to long's empty that at this point time we understand to be the fastest and most effective way to reduce one's levels of anxiety in real time a to inhale throug the nose long to lung's empty exhal through the mouth that is the physiological sige earlier we talked about the fact that one of the main ways in which listening to music shifts heart rate and increases heart rate veriability and thereby positively shifts a number of different healthmatrics is through shifts in breathing i justify that brief vin yet about the physiological sigh as within the general contect of what we are talking about to day in any event there are data that have explored whether not spesific musical stimule can be used to significantly reduce anxiety in particular one published out of the university of pennsylvania and i't provide a link to the study ing the shownote captions which shows that people that listen to a particular song that i'll describe in a moment experience up to sixty five per cent reductions in their anxiety that is a significant reduction in anxiety and i should point out that sixty five per cent reduction in anxiety in this case was accomplished with just three minutes of listening to this one particular song and get this that particular song was as effective in reducing anxiety as one of the most commonly prerscribed benzo diazipines what is this magical anxiety reduc anx song the title of the song is weightless by marconi union i had not heard of the song prior to researching this episode i did indeed look up the song on outube and listen to the song i will provide a link to the song i the shownote captions i confess that it is a very relaxing song i also confess that i was not experiencing anxiety when i listened to the song but it was successful in reducing my level of over all auteno mac arousal i found myself more relaxe et cetera now of course what i'm describing interms of my own experience is not a pure reviewed study it is what i would call anic data meaning i'me just describing my experience but again there are pure reviewed studies exploring how this particular song shifts one's autonomic state and i think this three minutes hove listening to this one song should at least be tried by anyone that is trying to reduce their anxiety because unles you are listening to the song in some way that i'm not aware of excessively loud or something that sort i cannot imagine how listening to the song would be detrimental in any way and if you are anything the subjects in the study that they explored it could very well be beneficial and help you reduce your anxiety it is also something that you could keep cued up in your phone or on any de vice such that if you think you may experience anxiety just put your headphones in and listen to it you might be wondering whether not mrconi unions weigtless is only three minutes slong well i do not know the answer to that because when you go on you to what you will see is that clearly a number of people are benefiting from listening to the song to reduce their anxiety or at least that a number of people have listened to the song because if you put marconi union weightless into the search function on you to what you will quickly discover is that the topvidio has get this forty seven million views and it is ten hours long now across to day's episode it is been in the back of my mind that some of you out there perhaps or trained musicians that you grew up playing an instrumend perhaps sang inquire or at school perhaps you played multiple instruments perhaps you even no music theory whereas others such as myself were encourage to play an instrument when we were younger but then abandoned that instrument if act i'll just tell you a brief story when i was a kid every kid in school was required to pick an instrument my parents for whatever reason clearly they did not ask me what i want to do they ask me to play the violin in school and i got the violin i started playing the violin i took the sazuki method lessons this is where y u do not learn to read music directly a yu there is a number a assignment to the diferent notes and that is initially how you learned i was also supposed to listen to the songs while i slept this idea that some of the music and musical learning could being coted during sleep an interesting topic becaus thre's ectually some emerging evidence for that now am but at the time as far as i know there were no pure viewed studies but none the less it was thought that this works and perhaps it does well you tel you one thing for sure it did not work for me because i have one photo and truly just one from a concert that i played i must have been about eight or nine years old and within this photo what you will notice is there is a gallery of children all with violins all of whom's bows are up and my bow is down m that in addition to the fact that my fly was open in the picture and the fact that every time i played the violin either by practice or with the teacher present when we would go to these once a week sessions with a individual teacher people would cringe animals would cringe literally dogs would howl such that my parents did not encourage me to continue playing in fact they and many others encouraged me to quit playing i quit playing i confess i do not know how to play any instrument i ave attempted a few other instruments in my lifetime yes i believe in neuroplosticity it is a hulmark feature of our brain our brain can learnd things even as adults but the point i've tried to make here is that i am not of the category of kids that played an instrument and understands music theory or how to read music i simply do not and i realize that those of you ther are listening to this are watching this out there are probably in a mixed category of proficiency all the way down to what i would consider my own a relationship to music which is deficiency although i greatly enjoy listening to music and i do have a pretty good ability to memorize lyrics in any event the reason i raise this is that there are now dozens if not hundreds of quality pere reviewed studies using a variety of technical approaches that show that when children especially children younger than eight learn to play an instrument and even better learn to play multipl instruments regardless of wheather not they learn to read music that it leads to greatly enhanced conuctivity within their brain that persists into adulthood and that it facilitates other forms of nerw plasticity and learning which is basically to say that my brain very likely does not include these enhance circuits which circuits of my referring to whell there are number of different circuits in the brain thayave been shown to expand when children learn how to play an instrument as a child eight or younger and again eight is not a strict cut off and i always have to high this for give the tansion but when we say eight or younger i do not want people with nine year old children or ten year old kid or even sixteen oar old kid listening or even adult listening to think oh the window is shut for me because when one designs a study you have to have some thresholds who you include and who you do not include and some sometimes that leads to these kind of on artificial perceptions about where the cut off's are but in any event it is very clear that if you did learn an instrument when you were young or ideally even multiple instruments and even better would be to learn multiple instruments end how to sing along with instrumentals especially in an improvised manner well your brain has expanded conactivity on average relative to children that did not have that experience now the good news is that learning how to play an instrument or even thankfully for me listening to novel forms of music music that you do not typically listen to for thirty to sixty minutes per day and it does not have to be every day in fact it can even be just three days a week for thirty to sixty minutes has been shown to expand brain conactivity in ways that of course lends itself to better musical comprehension and even performance but learning how to play a musical instrument at any age as well as singing and singing especially with others in a group has been shown two enhance learning and the acquisition of new skills separate from musical learning and singing in other words it seems that learning how to play an instrument and singing are a gateway to narrow plasticity and this is again supported by norr imaging data im some of the more striking of those datare that no children that learned how to play one to three instruments when they were kid or that sang in a choir or a group or that were taught to sing solo for that matter show up to thirty per cent greater conictivity within this particular brain net work that links the two hemispheres of the brain now as soon as i say two hemispheres of the brain it starts drawing up a lot of ideas in people's heads mainly derived from pop psychology that there are left brained people in right brain people i've touched on this before but i want to make this abundantly clear again now most of what you have heard about call left brained people ar right brained people is complete and total nonsense its myth there are some functions in the brain that are lateralized to the left or the right hemisphere in particular procity they sor lilting and falling of speech and in singing is highly lateralized in the brain other aspects of language can be laterlized in the brain but really if you hear that certain people are more emotional or certain people are more logical based on right brain left brain stuff that stuff is completely false its complete garbage in fact it is not based in any real solid data when i say that learning and instrument or learning how to sing young or even as an adult is beneficial for increasing the conictivity between the two sides of the brain what that increase connictivity between the two sides of the brain which is by the way mediate through a structure calld the corpus colosum is not about enhancing ones emotional capacity or logical capacity it is really about increasing the capacity of all brain circuits or t least the brain circuits that are connected up directly with ae corpus olosum which includes many brain circuits for things cognition language learning speech mathematics oughtof people do not realize this but allot of musicians are also especially adept at mathematics and for you musicians you are polly nodding of course right because music is grounded in theory that has basis in math and in physics something tht we will address in a future episode about harmonics et cetera whend children ar adults learn how to play a musical instrument or several or to sing and play musical instruments that in crease connuctivity in the corpus colosum is essentially providing multiple highways of option for learning all sorts of things it is something that i highly encourage much that i intend to finally finally learn how to play an instrument i've got a particular instrument in mine that i've wanted to learn how to play for a very long time but based on my prior experience with trying to learn an instrument and because i to consider myself with considerate person i intend to do this more or less in isolation from people and indeed from animals as well and for those of you that do not have the time or energy or desire to learn new forms of music you will be perhaps delighted to know that just listening to novel forms of music and in particular when you listen to novel forms of music and you pay attention to that music not just letting it on play in the background that too has been demonstrated to expand the brains capacity for nurrow plasticity its ability to modify itself and make it better at learning other sorts of things both cognitive and physical i highly encourage you to listen to the music you love i certainly love to listen to the music that i delight in and have for many years but there is also strong scientific support to encourage listening to new forms of music that hopefully you will but none the less the mere forging for and listening to novel forms of music itself seems to activate brain circuitry in a way that allows for better learning and comprehension of all sorts of things today we have ben talking about music in the brain and i confess this is an enormous topic much that i had to discard with entire sets of data and discussion around for instance the mathematical structure of music and how that relates to the mathematical structurer of firing of nurons we touch on this a little bit however in the contect of certain frequencies of sounds that we hear creating certain frequencies of nuronal firing and activation in the brain a just think about hhow amazing that is literly the brain playing your nurons a piano this is not what happens when you smell a particular odour or taste a particular taste or see of particular face or visual stimulus incredible things happen within those senses as well but there is something oh fundamental and incredible about music in its ability to tappened our nurle circuitry in our nurle chemistry in ways that shift our emotional states and our motivational states we talked about ways that music can be leverage to shift our emotional and motivational states again not as a way to reduce music to its reductionist parts but rather to help us gain understanding into how the brain responds to music and how we can leverage music of all kinds with him without lyrics im how we can balance the contrast between music and silence to increase motivation and on and on for those of either ar interested in the more formal structure of music and how it relates to bring function and vice versa as well as for those of either ar interested in singing and song writing and more along the lines of lyrical content and how singing in groups and how improvization of singing and musical playing can impact brain function in plasticity i promise you theire is going to be both an expert guest coming on the podcast to discuss that as well as a solo episode on those topics again the topic of music in the brain being far too vast to cover in just one conversation with that said i hope that to day's discussion allowed for you to think about music differently hopefully it will lead you to listen to music a bit differently perhaps even leverage music for different purposes in your life and abov e all to think about music and to enjoy music either listening to it or playing it or both because as you now know music is just able to activate your brain but rather your brain contains vast amounts of real estate that are literally there to listen to music if you are learning from end ore enjoying this podcast please

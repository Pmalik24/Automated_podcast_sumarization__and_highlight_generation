donald trump leaps to a ten point lead over jobidon in t latest washington post pole general markmilly finally leaves and sener bobmananda's wont coe even if you find bars of gold under his bed i venturfur this is the vench pero show the benchvar shos monterba expressive the pian protect our on mine privacy today at if presupian di com flash men of the big e argument against donal trump as their publican nominy has historically been that he is unelectable that is been the argument against him because obviously he lost to jobidon into thousand twenty he did not when the popular vote against tiller clent in twenty sixteen and squeaked out a win against her in that election cycle and thus going up against jobidon again he is going to hit the same ceiling that hed in twenty sixteen and twenty twenty which wis about forty six per cent of the vote but if the pole stark to show that donald trump actually does not having ceiling at forty six per cent instead his ceiling is fifty or fifty one the electibility argument agains donal trump goes completely away will now we have for the first time a pole showing donal trump breaking dat glass ceiling according to the washington post over the weaken this pole shows donal trump over over jobidon by ten point that is an amazing pole infacted such an amazing pole at the washington post as already labeled into own pole an outlier saying that hoeu can take a pole this is true you can take a pole and sometimes the selection of the people who are in the pole is a little bit weird and seegetn outlier pole but the probem is this even if the pole is off by margin of error five six seven points that would demonstrate that trump is still running dead even with jobidon which again under cuts the unelectability argument against donald trump according to the washington post biden and former presedent trump appeur headed for rematch of their twenty twenty contest al thegh more than three and five democrats and democratic leading independence say would prefer nominy other than the president but bidns an bisers have argued hes still the strongest democrat for twenty twenty four it seems to me that there is the possibility that all this bad polling for bidon is leading up to an attempt to defeni straiht bidon to get rid of him to toss himout window to find somebody else who can replace him presumably that would not be one of the candidates were corneltly talking about you could see a situation in which michell oboma parissutes in from the rafters in order to sweep up the nomination by a claim one thing is for certain tjobidon running this weak against donal trump is horrible for the prospect of jobidon is the actual twenty twenty four now many according to the post ab sea pole it chos bidon trailing trump by ten per centage point but then the washing post polifies that eave the sizeable marginan trumps leadin te survey is significantly at obs with other public poles thath show the general election contest a virtual dead heat the difference between this poles and others as welels the unusual make up of trump and bidens coalitions in the survey suggest it is probably an outlier against the washington post under mining tum pole ni'm not going to do the pole unskewin what i will point out is that this is the second presedential pole in the last three the chos donal trump with an atual sizable lead against jobidon the the last pole before this was an enbysenews pole that chowed them tied at forty six per cent the pope for that was a pole from the messenger hairisacts which showed trump up five in fact there is no pole with jobidon up more than one per cent in the last oneth and a half every pole has yeither trump up one or biden up one or their tide the messenger haris expole has trump up five now this would suggest there'rs still a sizable undivided pot undecided population that is out there ammur's gon to read yiou the latest poles in this in this perticular matchrup abe snes wash post trump plus ten and be senes tie the messenger herrisac trump plus five emerson yahones morning consul tie tie tide harvard herris trump up one harvard eraspesan reports trump up for rasmeson reports biden plus one economist you go biding up one fox news trump up to to another words it is either marger of err or trump up that seems to be the the pulling tren and that is different then it was just a few months a go a few months ago there is a suggestion that that actually bidin had a pretty sizeable lead if you go all h way back to july quinnipia ha bidin up five ye had yahones would bidin up for if you go back a litlefor than that ga whonus had bitin up seven but botom line is this s a very competitive race and the reason tis is competitive race is because jobide is a terrible president why your seing in this pole is hurrific numbers for jobidon jobidins job approval rating right now according to this post eaby senes pol is thirty seven per cent fifty six per cent disapprove in that that is that is an amazing at thirty seven per cents approval rating for the sitting presidents of the united states as far as the state of the nations economy twenty five per cent believe that is excellents are good compared to seventy four per cent to believe that it is not good or poor thirty five per cent believe that the unimploymet rate is excellents are good comparedto fifty seven per cent who believe it is not good or poor on food prices ninety one per cents of people believe it is not good or poor bidon has terrible ratings on the economy and emogration as well on the economy thirty percents approval rating in nemogration twenty three per cent approval rating now again there is some aspects of this pol that ar i would se very dubeos in terms of will thay hold up for a general election just because they would be unprecedented nagain maybe the real but if they are not real that would not be a shock either because again a lot of these numbers are quite shocking for example this pole suggests the donal trump only loses my norty voters by nine points now to be fair biding one the non white vot in in two thousand twenty by forty five points you would have to assume eight thirty six points change in mynority votes between two thousand twenty and two thousand and twenty for three years ago biding one voters between eighteen and twenty nine by fifteen points in this pole trump linds those voters by sixteen points that is a thirty one point swing means are massive huge enormous swings that pole shows unbelievable swings toward trump as pointed out by isac shore writing for mediide it shows unbelievable twings toward trump among independents plus twenty six roral voters plus twenty six moderates plus twenty two urban voters plus fourteen but here is the thing even if this pole is a really bad outlier the pulling for jrobide right out is just terrible a cross the board it is terrible remember domaltrump is one of the single most unpopular politicians in mour american history and he is running dead even with a gude the mediat chose and have couted as he next coming of ftiar that says something but how bad jobidon is as a president of the united states and democrats are getting ready two hit the panic button now they cannot say their htting panic button this is the weird part the democratic party base does not want yobidon three in five democratic voters do not want yobidn but the democrtic you lead understand that what comes anaces in all out war which is why you have the useless secretary of transportation people to judge who again when ofn paternaty for two monts nobody notice p budjedge is is now attempting to avoid the implications o the bull which the jobidon probli should step acide if hes competitive adonal trumk the poll the vast majority of american people are not happy with president bidl fleedership on a range of topics and issue what do you say that the forty for per sent of americans who say they are worst off now then they wore before bidn took office woo we all know the economic pressure their americans hav felt the when the president took office the economy was flat on its back but were also getting extraordinary results more than thirtein million jobs created that is more than any presidential term in american history and yes it takes a while for people to feel tof full benefits of those results just bet it is can to take a while to build all of the infirstructure there were now under way on with the president's cenerational inforstructure tol buty got the

on behalf o jobide and that of course is hillery clinton hillodo clintond according to te ucadaily mail actually marn jobidon in a private meeting heu needed to take the threat of ma thord party challege ar seriously as you faces all time high disapproval ratings and sits behind former president onel trump in some surveys an beseen who is reported monday the clean gave the president the warning wile sho as at the white house for a sceremony alongside first lady jil bidon earlier this month clinton of course feels that she lost because it jil styna was the spoiler well now bidon is facing not just cornell west or the no label's candidate but he is facing down robin off kenndy junior who is not going to go away and probably runs as they third party candidate our orf kajunor could easily win seven eight per cent of the vote and that could mean the differente for jobidon for shore and this is all because jobidon is terrible at the job now we' we have been assuming all long thet twenty twenty four if it is between trump and bidon is can be refred amon one of the two and the safe assumption is that i was can be referen imon trump because trump obviously sucks up the headlines but maybe it is not maybe'sn't that is possible to in twenty sixteen wo is regferen amon hillery clent because people hated hilery just that much my assumption i thingk the srumption of a lot of other people is that the rough ferenda in twenty twenty for would be on trump not on bidon becaus bidon is dead now again i may still be right on that it may be that as the invictments come in as the focis shifts back t trump is trump becomes the formal momine that all the democrats come home right now whit these polls are showing is market unenthusiasm for jobidon may be that once trump is the actual momine everybody snaps back in a place in thy say we have to they say we have to stop trump that of cource os what jobidon is betting on what is amazing to me though is that the democratic party is willing to bet on jobidon in this race against tonal trump and there bunch feather candidates for sitting on the silans the problem is that that sameet washington postboll shows that there is no consents is back up to jobidon if jobidon steps out got comela hers eight per cent get p boody jecte seven per cent there is no one out there who consolidates the base this wy suggest that the can wild wild car deery is michelobomub coming in from the wings riding a unicorner something that that is what democrats probly are hoping for at this point but again jobidon he is a desperate candon he should be a desperate candidate because he is he is got problems this is wy heis now pulling out all the stops at this point on things the economy jobidon is trying to shore up his union support he is gettn go to the picket lines apparently in wane county michigan accoring to sannen yu a w union president shon fane will join presiden jobiden on the picket line tuesday and wane county michigan according to a source familiar at the situation the source provided no s pecifics about these act location the w a w however is not involved the former presideen trumps plan visit on wednesday nor havbeen in contact with his team trump apparently is gen a skip that second presidential primary debate and california which is supposed to happen on wednesday and he is expected to also head to michigan toad dress those union workers now this is something that the trump team worked hard on in twenty sixteen they tried to make reach out to a lot of the rous belt workers in that mens going and making overtures to many of the private sector unions now publicsector unions but private sector unions the u now to be completely fair to the automakers what do you a w wis asking for in these negotiations is totally while mean asking for a thirty two hour work week and defined benefit plans which is what basily bankrupt to the car companies in the first place is a non starter but in terms of the pure politics of the situ ation donal trump again this is what makes donal trup of formidabl kantidate is that donald trump is willing to take advantage of any openin rat does not matter from which sirection he will heu will take you from the left he will take it from the right because he does not actually have a set of cor principals nonal trump this means that president trumpll ill come et jobidon from the left heu will try to edge him out of his union support with the u a this now has forced jobidon to go to the picket lines in michigan to tryin shore up that you a u support that' titshappening right here according to sianen negotiations between the striking you a on fort remain very active over the week end and on monday but they are still some distance on key issues meanwhile theu a ubl you says is expanding it strike against gm and sto lantas but saide progress an negotiation with ford means it will not expand the number of four workers on the picket lines now again the fact that bidon is headed two the picket lines is pretty shocking for the setting president of the united states to actively take fight in take sizes in a labor dispute that he himself is effectively created through his electric vehical mandates which is what all tese car companies are looking at n freaking out about tbecause they make all the money off gas powrd engens and now the'rebeing told they ed to go to significantly less economically efficients e vs an these companies are selling three percent of their total groths is eves right now there being told they neetsto shift completely over to evs an next few years and muma got the u a u as pressuring them fora bigger share of the profits which thrigin a need nor to make that evy shift they are stupetin a rock in a hard place created by jobidon and now jobidon is taking sides withe u a u and the man is really a bad president he is a truly terrible president and the fact that he left the or open to donald trump to swoop in and tround graps om yu a support is pretty amazing now what is even more amazing is how jobidons economic policies hav exastrbated all ready presens sturious promensy in the american economy in flationary policy of jobidon has are y exascurbated a labor shortis that is been generated by the demographic collapse of the west in jeneral get to that momentarily first well valot on our scentuls of how much we hav to do everydays got sock or practice cience fers prepping for the holidays cot picg up my kids all the restfit the good news is you can take a big thing off your playt by putting great meat on your plate with good ranchers you care about your family eats while genes to the folks over good rangers that is whre they have spent years building relationships of local farms to sorce the best on hundred per cent american beef chicken pork and now wild caught seefloot as well the best of the land and se you can now get conveniently delivered to your door right now ther offering two years of free ground beef to anybody who subscribes that is a four hundred eighty dollar value that 's two years of free high quality ground beef in a lockin price no other meat company guarantees you one hundred per cent american meat and a lock in prices cause no one else's good ranchers he insave on your beef chicken and port locking n your price to day every single stacke house quality cut is

inter price on america's best meat for two whole years as well that is good rancher's dot com today yuse macoben there were five hundred buxs an taking subscribes to good rancers american meats delivered kas the jobiden econ omic policy is creating serious problems that thete are already exascurbated bydemographic problem that undergirds the entire wests economic stagnation and hans for the last several years according tothe walster gernal the use economy has been running in probably with an unemployment rate under forkper sent fror nearly two years this is not just to hold over from pandemic podlenicts when employers that millions o people go and then strugle to find workers to come back it is a storm that has been brewing for decades floaing at most recently in the form of worker strikes at automakers and air lines wlabor shortages are turning into a long from labor prices that could push wages and turnover higher it turns ou the when you inflate the currency in the middle of tha situation demographically or running out of young workers well you ot that isgoin to do it is in crate labor shortages work experts have warned for years the combination of baby boomeretirements low berth rates shifting emogration policies and changing worker preferences is leaving yu us employers with two few workers to fill job openings while the labor market is softening none of those factors are expected to change fromatically in the coming years total employment has been grow about zeropoing three per cent ta year until twenty thirty two according tothe labor department tat is much slower than the one point two per cent rte over the pastecade that is largely becaus the population constraints and that is going to lead to slower growth in g t p prodoctivity is probably going to drop ex gan you do not have enough young workers were coming into the work fors because baby boomers did not have enough babies the just birth rat as been falling for decades to clining by about half since the nineteen sixties when you in fleate the currency in the middle of a work or shortige what you went uplyth is waged spirals which means price spirals which means wage spirals which means e economic stagnation it all of this has ben exascurbated by again the garbage policies of the biden administration everybody knows it everybody can feel the stagnation as it bensang for a while i do not think that infltion s actually the long from threats of theamerican economy stagnation is long from threat to the american economy this by the way has one of the reasons you wouldimagion wyjobidon is actually very laysa fair about our borders because when you realize merica has a demographic problem that we do not have enough young workers and when you realize that the solutions to that demographic problem would be two for example raise the retirement age that the solutions o that demographic proble to be to stop inflating t the currency that the the actual solution to all these demographic probises to increase prodoctivity by allowing the innovative people in th united states to actually innovate and make money off of it as ppost to regulating them out of existence on behalf of government redistributionism when you realized that you wouln't have to have an open border but if you are going to keep all those bad policies and place in need a fresh supply of workers were youcan get that fresh supply of workers while jobidoning company they knowwhere and the answers south of the border which presumably is why the customs an borker patrol has told fox news that here are proximately eleven fowsin migrant in counters at the southwestern bworder in the last twenty four hours marking the single highest day in recent memory there now pictures emerging from the southern border of small children crawling trough barbed wire to get into the united states i do not see alexandero cosoprotes down ate worder protesting the border policies meanwhile j johnson the form er home land security secretary no right winger he is out there saying at the numbers are gingtg et higher and higher the administration gorter break and may every one was expecting large numbers after the end of title forty to but the empesise there was a ry way in a wong way to come to this country i have that is well in supply in a proper way thuse the a goig to reaghon a process ing senters and the migrants and the smugglers of now figured out that that that that those things do not are at not able t andle these numbers insothe working around this system again and i'm worried that these numbers going to get higher and higher march eit protend to be the peap months if fere seeing these kinds of numbers in september october i think we are in for a real ness there is a reason why jobines abuvlerating on that the border is in the twenties in the twenties which means a huge number of democrats do not how he is acting bout the border either and the media pratorian iron ocan wil protectim on us jimicosta hat on a republican congress person talking about the border and at is ralph norman republican and a and here it is jimicosta trying to somehow defend jobidans open bor policies and wel you agree with it or not the doing it for power why are they given secure to what mean by that why why what is is a their intentionally intentinally doing what where is your evidence of this were's your proof of this just hows your tholowings a ne iric around there were no basis in fact a a you can ithave you been on the bore of course i have and you seen wat's going on the rite the ya is i sopone mad nobody can can deny that borders and a they got at this sarcrises where i'll ask the question sir and the wearger is not open that is that is somee that that is a pedtle as a talking point is not true ther their offencis their walls a a there are border potro agiens o an wer o an border o can meanwhile we are having tens of dousands of encounters pretty much every week and when he says the wors not open he does not mean there is no one actiy ptroling th borer whe means it that even people at ports of entry are being given numbers nd then release ins the interior of the united states as fast as humanly possible why will not wen ralph norman says its for power that is kind of true is also becomes again the economic policies of the nemocratic party require cheap labor that cheap labor has to come from somewhere because it is not un to come from american labor because they keep driving up the inflation that keep driving up the wage price and then they fill in the galop intrms the labor shortage with wait for it eleg littlegrans balet is the haw the intire state of california runs if you ever spent anytime in california what is that it is very rich people hiring i legal emigrants to raise the children and that that is half the lost hanshclus to their cleaning that tat that literally is what is happening we are oneof the few people mear nallay who insisted on actually hiring people who have legal status in the united states but hollywood is entirely it is entirely peopled by extraordinarily wealthy people who hire i legal emigrant anties to watch their kids because that is the model society that the left is seeing to creat ishout redistributionist in the lightest in the end what t actually is is finding in new labor bas to support their way of life to support the declining population of the united states the idea is the bring in cheap labor and that is the deal leave the boar open the bor open and that that is how you support your policies sos on that to bringing all tese people because they want them to vote eventually they hope for the old vope that 've et nopp an amnisty get eds that in order to support their crap economic policies they have to have a cheap labor basher in the united states the easiest way to do that is to import cheap labor that is and people mowit which is why presumably jobiden's economic policies andismogration policies are wildly unpopular and just the secon hene get to the question of if if jobidon an on popular wy is not donal trump beating him in all the poles an ma ove this one out lider pole that chose trump up ten he really should be beating him by a lot in all the poles ca jobite his superun popular first it is fall it means cosy unihtes in with the

product it is really really excellent suff a graces this magnificent took us right this moment hat on over to tommy john dot tom at slashman get twenty per cents off everything for a limited amount of time o get meanwhile the question for nonal trump is goin to be how doyou keep the focus unbdon a that that really shoul e te question this what i'v ben asking for a while the two big questions for trump are you say the last lectirom stolen what exact measures are you going to take to prevent that from happening again that is question nmber one and yelling on truth soshlinkinto do it and question number too is how do you kep the focson bidon because donal trump likes the focus to be undonal trump bidon likes the focus to be undonal trump right now all the folcus is on bidin because frankly's sben a few weeks since an inventment can down for trump lust be real about this every time trump is in the news and the indictment is in the news he tends to drop in the poles and then every time en simen is not in the news people focus in on jobidon in an election cycle in which he is going to be in cort no less than four times on criminal charges how does he keep the focus on bidon this is the big doubt for trump going for because again he does not ave a strong pony is an incredibly weak op ponent in jobine well the the anser to that question is going to be that he is gin to have to get off truth social i mean that that is one of the answers i remember i visited the white house some time in i thin is early twenty eighteen and a i was being shown around the white house by top official there and the top officiall call me in to his offic hes and hw doyou think we are doing and i said here is by o nest answer i think that on executive policy has gett nto aminus on legislater policics you aen't passed very much stuff thand we have pass a big budget ticke at items see plus and on rederic af and he said what oul i do as he should go ins the presient's office right now he should rab hiself when his smashit with a bleaping hammer that is w we should actualyet any left as everybody knows this is true donald trump policy with out the crazy it is still president of the united states and donald trump policy without the crazy could be president of the united states again because if you just look at how the contry was running when donald trump was presiden for is how it is now running or not running under tobidon at as a pretty clear and convincing case for reelecting donal trump again donald trumps best election play is look at hol things were twenty seventeen to twenty nineteen then we got hit with with pandemic but even wit the pandamic the economy was already scy rockaning out o the pantamic by the tim i left office ar that is his best case is best caseis things ran grate until he got hit by an extraneous event an that and and jobidon has not had any of those yor ben ys had the benefit of basically lowal piece except for you cranewich wl atto in a second her he is had the benefit of of a vaxine plan and roll out that i created he had the benefit of aur recovering economy and he benefit of all these things and somehow he is run the economy directly into the ground and mans less safe lobally vote for twenty seventeen to twenty nineteen rigt that tdatwoud be donal trumps case hat's prety god case that the probem for trump a gain is going to be himself the only prerson who can relyt if he trump his trump not bidon it was truwing twenty twenty it is true and twenty twenty four as well the left is going to trot try to find reasons to folk sentrum now i wi'll say that there is one other benefit to for thatr trump has here and it is the same benefit he is hedsincs twenty sixteen i said that in twenty sixeen there is no way for hillery clintin to sully donal trumps skirt because he was made of mud one of the things about politics is tha hat you try to do as you try to make your opponent look worse what the probem is thit thow that works if you are hellery clintonin you'r trying to portray yourself as clean as the driven snow and donald trumpis thrung muddy you it is all gon istake an its can a show up really really strongly against the all white background the have painted for yourself but donald trump never had and all wite background donal trumps a mud monster he is made of mud and hen you hid him with mud is his more mud on the mud monster an he just thicker he is more mud and it is possible that all thi stuff is baked into the cake it is also possible that it is not and that as much as re publicans i're not bothered by donald trumps outsides reteric than moderate and penenvoters they may well be its over the we gen donald trump went on true social and he posted this quote they are almost all disoniston corrupt but com cast with it is one sided and vicious coverage by en by se news and in particular emas enby s often and correctly referred to his emes at dn s should be investigated for it is contry threatening treason they are enlest coverage of the now fully toamong scammed on his russia rusia russia and much else is one big campan contribution sto the radical left democraparty i say upfrun openly and proudly the when i win the presidency of the united states they and others of the lamestre media will be thoroughly scrutinized for the'r knowing lhy disoniston orrupt coverag to people things in events why should an be see or any of the other corrupt and disonest media companies be enti tld to use the very valuable airwaves of the ussay free there a truth retont omocracy ind are in fact the enemy of the people the fate mews media should pay a big price for what they have done for once great country now this is one of those aspect or i think thi's baked in to the canke i do not hink that this sort of reteric changes things for trump at all there certain things he can say that i think make it worse frommouting this is one of them i think that everybody understands courts in th united states are not going to allow donal trump to put com cast out of business or anything remotely that i also think the vast majorityof americans do not trust the called leggacy media furthe them they can throw them thereon't trust them at all son the white house tries to yis sort of school marm trump on this it does not work over the week en the white house put out a statement suggesting that the donal trump was threatening democracy n quote on the record from me president bitin sworn oaths to ut pull their constitution protect american democracy freedom of the press a fundamental constitutional right abuse presidential power and violate the constitutional rights of reporters would be n outrageous o tackar democracy in the rule of law presdents must always to fin americans freedoms never trample on them for selfish small and dangerous political purposes now again this school marming ap proach trum ankon a work this is not going to work the reason is not going to work is because there has ben no president of my lifetime who is ben less friendly to the press then jobidon you nt knows hi that members te press do does not to pres conferences uestan answer questions creenshon pier lives routinely then the notion that donal trump is somehow less friendly tho the press than gobitnes just not true he sai the sentiemy the people stuff over and over and overwhell is presinem and then you tret press in terms of comment and and content much better than jobidon evertit to that that is simply not going to work itsels an not going to work this particular attack on trump because again when you look at how americans feel about the first amendment the reality is that democrats heavy avin major problem with free speech if you are talking bout freed o the press an fre speech its democrats who ark consistently attempting censorship it is democrats r are trying to get shows this one shut down it is feople dan fight for who again was ano boma staffer going on emes and be s suggesting that shows this one should not get any listenership they are the ones who do that sort of stuff te people are truly threatening the press really arnt on the right than on the left if you look at this pull from real crepolitics brannuwpole it shows that nearly one third of democratic voters thirty four per cent more than one third sey americans have quote too much freedom compared only fifteen per cent of republicans meanwhile when read the statement i disapprove of what you say but i will defends of death to rights to say it only thirty one percents of democratic voters strongly agreed compare to fifty one per cent of republicans fully three quarters of democrats believe government has responsibility to women hate foolsocial medio posts only fifty per cent of republicans feel the same democrats are significantly more likely than republicans to state it to favor stifling free speech rights of political exstremists now this is this is not a shock again when when they try to schoolmarm trump on o my goshies af thrats of the press and democracy and free speech in all this the truth is that it is it is the left that is constantly a threat to thes sort of stuffs that that dog just ankan ohunt will get to more on this in just second first are you a few years or decades out of school and wondering what the hectat i even learn what was the point of all that schoon you mght think yourself and ofve time to learn something well if that is you they are not alone it is not too late and a not even true since eighteen forty four thillsdale college

nonal trump an all of this is that it is not really possible in the end to to sully him more than he has sullied himselfigh again is is why only the criminal dightments i think can may be nock him down in general what palling day of thiveteen in ternal poles have shown is that independent stare to swivvel a wave from trunt trump get to actually con victed of eighthing independentring n a swivel away from hi unmass that is the big danger for trump now as far as sort of no other attacks on trump oun think thergn al work inside the republican party either for example i think the trumps language with regard to hardpeo pbills lately has just been awful he he went on national te th and he suggested that rondsance did somethn terrible horrible by sinding a heartbe bill and floor to protect the lives of the unborn now that is ridiculous on tae state level signding a hart be bill if you if you can do it and ou can protect the unborn you do it whell what trump could have said is that on a federal level we do not have the necessary concensis to actually make that happen and a'll push for life as much thi can that probably ins of the fifteen week mark on the federal level it we might pencis said instead trump because again he will attack fom any angle cause he has no cor principles he says pro likefors had absolutely zero status on the subtject of abortion until i came along which i is is not correct fess for fifty two years have on talk but got nothing done i got a done there' be no talk of a six week bann or anything else without me rovers's way to lowd the killing of a baby at any time including th fifth six seven tho eighth nine month even after birth they therefore are the radicals not us tand now becaus of our supreme cor victory the power has shifted for the first time those fighting for the prolife movement thave ben given tremendous power on the tissue be fore our victory they had nothing theyw'll have nothing again if we do not win elections ronalds ragand i believin the three exceptions for rape incestan life of th mother the ave to follow your hart but without the exceptions will be very hardto went elections the six week ban on a bortion among other things his fight again social security an medicar killed the disanctist campaign well i notice that done even in his a his exceptions rape insessan life the mother does not four clothes banning abortion at the six week that is thit is umer one number too i understand these harty piviting to the je neral ther other republican candites wor attacking him over this position that he is taking i think e's are ticulating it horribly i are not the the idea that is six wee dound abortion is morally wrong in some way is absurd it is ridiculous but the attacks on by the right on him over the abortion ish re likely to fall on deft yars because what he does say at the being of this pos right he says the beginning listen' i appointed three judges to the spreme cort if a had n one thet wouldn

anniversary the pensigon's top officer general mark milly assess the carnage that had followed russias full scale invision with more than a hundred thousand soldiers likely killed or wounded on each side he said there wis window of opportunity for the combatants to hammera a deal wmilly told tan audience in new york that both parties must recognize victory ay not be achievable through military means in compare t to world wore one the decloration was classic milly taccording to college an observers wh ave worked with him the general immerstin military history alarm by the potential of escalation with russia the largest newclear power in the world was publicly advocating a position the bide administration had issued as the president and other top advisers frought to project unqualified toport few cranes of defense milly whose fouryor tener s chairman of the drowing chietes ends with his retirement this month while exicensor stage is on of most consequential an pulorizing military chiefs in recent memory notherngn ao pretend the ilititgratjrob millage onoto great job he presided over a disastrous withdraw from afganistan he openly suggested that after january six keshul called the chinese two inform them that we were not going to fire newcleator weapons to them or some such nonsense he suggested that we are in the midst of a fasious take over on januor six with which horses incredibly silly he he waited over and over into sort of hot button issues you will remember that done that milly is the guy who talht to how we needed to look into white rage in the military good riddens to bad rubbish in terms of general mark milly's tenure at the at pentagon donal trum pet out o statementang mark milly who led perhaps most embarrassing moments in american history with his glugrossly in compitan implementation of the withdrawl from afganistan costing many lives leaving behine hundreds of american citizens handing over billions of dollars of the finest military equipmen ever made will be leaving the military next week here we had time for all citizens of the uss at celebrate this guid turned out to be a woke train rack who if the fate news reporting his correct was actually dealing with china to give them a heads up on the thinking of the resident of the united states this an act told greegers that in times gone by the punishmen would have been death a wor betine china in th united states could av ben th result of this treasonis act to be continued everybody of course went totally not on donal trump suggested how dare he suggested death petlet donaltrump sas a lot of stuff as i've been saying for literally almost to decade t this point donaltrumps a man who says a lot o bleap and that is a lotostoff that that ded he says and done and disinuin take seriously his thrat to put milly up on charges of treeson no he literally gave him a presidential medal right before he left office he gave it along with anthony fouchby waylic same day january nineteenh twenty twenty one you will recall im with that sat is i good that milly is out absolutely and he was constantly straying into into political territory milly is an excellent example i've something allowed my soldier friends talk about whch i at the top levels of t pensigon brass or political actors now the american public seezs them as predominently soldiers butnest not true you become a political general very often by being a good politician that is how you rise through the ranks and prety much any army becase again any buracracy in sense bi particular behavior to get to the top of the buracracy and that is particularly true with regard to milly who very often did shift with which whatever way the winds were blowing and meanwhile the united tates sentat jus continues to be most isely i i said before the unitinations is mosizeley but apparently u an u senate also is mosisley man we really have just a stellar group of people over in the usenate we have john fedtderman who is not functional we have dion finstein who is dead at this point we have bobanende who apparently was taking bribery in the form of gold bars unet thet is actually beyond parody at this point according to the associateo press bobanendas of new jursy was charged on friday with secretly aiding the authoritarian government of egipt and trying to thwort the criminal prosecution of a friend and exchange for gold bars and cash under a an a corruption indictmen tha accuses him of using his foreign affairs influence for personal gain manendas was forced to relinquish his chairmanship of the sentat form relations commitee he said he is not going to resign from congress the indictment is the second in eight years against the sixty nineral senter and on alleges in legal comingling of manendas his obligations to avantos priorities and his private interests and cultivating relationships with wealthy business men it also incluge us charges against his wife and three nugersy business men while authorities say showered the couple with money gold an luxury carn exchanged for official favors well i'mean li imagine if the president of the united states had a son who is trafficing with u cran china romania and other countries ping up sacts of cash and his father was bice president of the united states presiding wor policy in many of these maytat would be truly bad a'm glatistus to sentor a previous indictment of manendas senming from different alligations ended in twenty seventeen with the deadlock jury now gan this is the second attempt to to get bobanendas on similar charges according to this indectment from at least twenty eighteen to about twenty twenty two manendas an his wife acceptat hundreds of thousand of dollars and bribes ranging from golbars for mercade's bens from three business men to protecton in rich then and benefit the government of egypt the last time anendas was indentin twenty fifteen who as charged with receiving gifts and six hundred sixty thousand dollars in campagn contributions from auflor to idoctor salaman melgan at heped him get reelected to the senate in twenty twelve mandas was accused of using his office to promote melligans business and personal intrists with officials of president barocabom is administration manendas said that the money and the gifts luxury travel stem from their friendship rather tan criminal relationship thatta ended in a mistrial jures are gn to have to decide whether manendas according tou ussay to day can separate the gifts and paymens from any actions he took according to legal experts the the argment is con o be that he was just taking gifts from friends and had nothing to do with his actual policy however the timeming of the gifts are pretty conspicuous in this case apparently they are going to have to there can have to prove that all these payments basically were in return for ings or promises to do things manendas for his part o saying he is not going to in and by the way wy would he m wha whell wan is the point of him resigning he he sayn h's not uners timejust wondering why anyone would think he is going to resign in pastimes in better times american prolititions would resign when face with scandal that is not how it goes now nobody nobody leads office at this point why should they if you live long enough then everybody does forgets about all this here is manendais claiming the prosecutors gett wrong in this is one of those cases the court of public opinion is no substitute for o revered justisystem we cannotset aside the presumption of inicence for political expediency when the harm is irredicable to those who have rushd to judgment you have done based on a limited set of facts framed by the prosecution to be a selacious as possible remember prosecutors get it wrong sometimes sadly i know that andw i mean is not clear o the actually got wrong in twenty seventeen i will point out that in twenty senentyen the prosecution t at came down o manendas it started in twenty fifteen that was largely becaue a pressior brought by the aboman administration against manendas to try to get him to sin ont the rondio there was obvious political maneuvering with regard to manend as in twenty fifteen hanging that threat over his head yn upcaving on the arondio by the way now many democratics sentrs are calling fr him to set down that includes fettermen include senators shared brown of ohiosand or peter welcho vermont whe nobody's ever heard of nancy blows the actually said that she thought that manendas would should probably step aside at this point manendasis excused by the way for having golbarslik sdash under is met is pretty amazing i will admit that this is this cin hileriously outum for thirty years i have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account which i have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation and cuba now this may seem ol faction but these were moneys drawng from my personal savings account base on the income that i have lawfully deride over those thirty years oh im by the way that does not speak as hidely governeencs to new jurshas ho would think it it would he is literally saying that he hid bars of gold in his house because he was afraid that the authword ers ben combursting into his room in themiddle of the night to take away his money the would in cuba im ye sound honestly a lot cuban republicans actually at this point that that is why you would vote for a smaller unless in trusive government is not why you ould be a new jersey democrat who allegedly took bribes this sors not by theway has presignifigant ramifications for twenty twenty four because i remember two thousand sex and remember there is a a re republican a mark foly and mark foly was messing around with some the mail pages and an end up having significant ramifications for democrats electoral victory in the two thousand six congressional lections a generalized perseption of corruption inside the democratic party ranging from the hunter bidan scandal too bomanendas he is can have severe ramificati ans for democrats a cross the scale which is probably why democrats are tarting to say themanen as has to go allso its to safe it is a safe place thil murphy is the governor of new jersey he is a democrat if that a republican governor which italmost was i assume many few er of them would be calling for him to go meanwhile a humiliating visit to canada by president vlodamer i zolensky of u crane zolenski has been stepping on a lotitos and because he thinks that he has the moral highground with regard to russia and i think that he does but because of that he thinks he apparently has unlimited ability to say prety much to anything bout anybody remember a year ago hofs ripping on the asralies and suggesting their not doing their moral duty by not shipping iron dome to u crane as though it was israel's duty to defend u crane and who is ripping on america for not providing enough support in the republican party because obviously it is america's duty to defend u crane but here is the deal i agree that the world should mobilize on behalf of u crane in the initial term in order to protect the territory that they are t he had i do not understand why it is the duty of the world to continue to fund a world ward on stale mate that does not seem to have any solution and then to basically suggest that zolensky can negotiate is on ticket here i do not understand that logic at all i' been saymeg the same thing for a year on this war ha thing thatiave been saying for well over yarns were likea year and a half at this point on this war is that there is no reason why exactly zolenski should be th one making the negotiation here were the one signing the check there should be a back channel that is happening between the united states and rossia and basically what it should be saying is you gos get part the nonbassi gets keep crimea the the eukranians are nockin t enternato but they are going to have security guaranski's from the westin case of a future invasion and that is the deal and then kramadown onsolensky tells e lensky the that is te deal and then he go back to is own people and he can say what he has to say which is i did not want that deol they made me take that deal it was not my responsibility i wanted to go all the way they would not let me go all the way he gets to retain his popularity wit his own people the war ends and everybody goes home i that that that is the only way this gon o end anyway and yet zolenski is you kno again i mit my sympathy for zolenski on a personal level is starting to wane as he becomes more and more brazen about his willingness to simply rannally call out countries as though they owe him something he got himself in all sort to hot water in poland recently zolensky had offered a vailed criticism of poland at the uen general assembly saying that dispute with political theatere between poland and eu krane and some our frends in europe have ade a thriller from the grane well why was this apparently it is becaus there is a band on eukranian krane tose put in place by several unations to prtect the livelihod of local farmers the r word about being under caught on the economy by the low price of u cranian grane the ou announce plans to suspand the ban last wet the poland alongslied hungry and slavakis that itwould stick wit the ban sparkin protest from eucrane they file lawsuits against the three countries and then zolensky spoke about it at do uen poland immediately condemnsolenski's comments if uen and it is formd ministry summon the ukrane ambassador t convey it strong protest hours later the pois pry minister sen n o blen social media statement the country quote would no longer trans for weapons yu krane because we are now arming poland thend he sor ave walked that back hes ta we just mean when i con to give the brand new weapons you cran will till give them our old weapons meanwhile hungary is warning that new sanctions against russia not needed he saing oere causing more harm to europe then russia at this points there bunch of eastern european countries whar deeply worried about the continuation of this war ithis been prede disastrous trip honestly west for vadmer islanki he went to adwaonterio and during a speech at the house of commons in canada apparently the speaker of the house of commons i stood up and was reckon he stood up his name is the anthony rota and he introduced i personamed yaroslav hunku he is from the public gallery he introduced him as a canadian neu cranian war hero from his political district he said what we have here in the chamber today you cranian canadian veteran from the second world wor who fought for eucranian independence against the rusians and continues to support the troops today even at his age of at ninety eight his eucranian hero a canadian here we thank him for his service thank you here is som vidio of that happening we hear here in the chamber to day you cranian canadians you cranian canadian world veteran from the second world war who fought ou cranian in dependence against the russians and continues to support the trups to day even at his i ninety eight u cranian hero a canadian hero and we thank im for alis thir thank you am a there is only one problem this guy was a member of the waffan ascess your history you now the people whoere fighting against the soviet invasion of a eu crane in wolor to those wh av been the nazzis is he not he is it occupied yu crane that is awkward again apparently he was served in the fourteenth waffin grinas ere division which served under the command of the nazzis hoops oops that is that is not that is not ideals that is an embarrassing gaf at the very very least here and of course ties in to allot of the russian talk about how the eucranians are dominated by nases that of course ties in to a lot of ussian propagan about as the russians who are responsible for the end of world wor too because they are ones who truly defeated hitler ignoring the fact that was the russians who atally allowed hitler to begin his invasion of poland in the first place bi essentially guaranteeing his eastern flank in any case the the support for the warning cranes fading and that is not a shack agan i'm in sang for long time the war in eucrane you wont cnto keep up the level interest or this level of funding indefinitely it was not going to happen because people get tired of it thats can be exasterba by new report from sixty minutes showing that is not jus military sporkloing eu crane we are funding petty much everythng else as well american tacpi is a financing more than just weapons we discoit did you acovemen fine fieds and fertilize a for you cranian famin and covering the faleries f you cranes fir respondes old fifty seven thousand dof them that includes the tane the traines this

gat again there is case be made that the mddle of invasion you have to keep the economy running to want to go completely to func i get all o that but the american publish weov be made aware of that sort of suf byton politicians if the case for you gran is neen to kep this war going in definitely even thogh we have no prospect of actual long term battlefield victory in don bassor cremia then you ave to wonder wirupanglo their bills it is one thing to say we have to pay for the re construction because wont to help prop them op against further russion invasion or or all the rest but in the absence of an en game here what exactly is the end game tobid is never spelled out the engame in fact his studiously avoided spelling out the en game he never talks about the end game and said he says wenlo do it as long as it takes with as much as it takes that is not the sun end game what exactly is your goal is your is your goal to actually push russia out of crimia and donbass of then say that thats you are go and then provide the level support necessary do that including essixtines but that is not your goal the're gos presulagus dragged this thing out no wonder even in dependence are turning against the american funning because when you do not have an and goal americans get real tired of it real fast allright time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day i tolk little babout yom kepor yom kiepor i moment for jewishbrac yon kip war is the holiest day of the year in judiism we celebrated on monday i'm over here in israel as you conceive from my backdrop for the high holidays anda it is amazing here i will say that there is something to the idea of a religious backdrop to any country that i think is good this live suggested for a long time that everybody in america should go back to church cinegogmas li america ought to re re root itself in judao christian valleys particular christian valleys in america because there can be no country without a social fabric and the social fabric in israel and yom kepr is obvious the synegog that i went to actually the president of the country i's a curzog was that that particular sinegog sher wits his security and then he sta literally all day prane an not nowlic a grippin grin these normally see by politicions in the united states were thechurk to church flike seven minutes and then they say a couple person they leave he was there literally from eight thirty in the morning until twelve thirty n the afternoon and then he came back for mencan elamariv which is the late afternoon services evening service he was there from four thirting the afternoon till seven and the entire country basically shuts down including many of the secular areas in israel f your tell of you which i t very secular arean israel everybody is still writing bicycles social fabric is really really important that is one thing to know thing numbered and in something we oughto rebuild in the united state thing number to is that yong kipor is a reminder that repentance is a corps value yongkipor is the ay at which you repent of your sins before god god knows the ignicent again but you rededicate yourself to him and his values and the idea is that you are saying to god that you are not going to do this thing any more left wing theology relies on the idea that you are not wrong god is wrong that you will not only sin god will forgive ou your sins even if you have no intent of stopping the sin and not not only that if you ever repent of your sin and move away from your son this makes you a hypocrite because we can alway siht something you did ten years ago is you suggest that you held something different ten years ago hypocrisy is the worst argument in politics perhaps you have just repented repentance is a good thing it is a valuable thing it is as necessary thing in fact repentance has the words suggests even in english repent rt you are going back to a thing repet in hebrew it is tisshueva which means to return what ar you returning to your returning to virtue the natural inclination of man is bad but man also has good aspects to him and the thing that man is seeking is what the state should be with regard to god which is allegiance to godess when you return to that it is not that your embracing something fully new it isthat you'r embracing something fully old and when you make that repentance then you merit life that that is essential the argument of yong kipor it is it is quite a beautiful day it is hard a minutes it is it is a fasttate in judism the way we fastler's a twenty five hour fast and fasting in jutiesm is no food no water iit can get you relatively difficult in terms of yo sort of what for preticaly older people in and very very young people yours if your boyers pes start fastin when our thirteent for girl as welth and i can be pretty hard on people but it is in amazing experience and reminder that it is never too late to to do repentance ok a time for a quick thing i hate now speaking of a a culture that is completely unrepentant of its sin good news agh vio max now called max has a full frontal new dating show is going to be a thing now coring the hollowad reporter it is being on tinder but much horse one of the ou case most infamous dating shows was quietly added to the max streaming service last week it is already causing quite a stur the streamer has imported six seasons of naked attraction a game show that promises you start were a good date often ends naked in each upisode a single choose or cretix an eliminates six petential dates standing on stage by scrutinizing ther fully new bodies which are gradually revealed one part at a time faces reveald last when only to potential dates remain the shud r strips out of their own close too giving the remaining to contestince the opportunityto creticue them the final couple than god on a date wit their close on it includes full fronta nudity it can come across as draw droppingly brutal in the contestan's graphic and alisis i do not her feet his member is too small at t he same time you hipstod contains intersicials of informative sex education the show clearly tries to promote body confidence and positivity thn thet all the hot or not judgments the show also includes contestance a diverse sexual orientations how how delightful how delightful we are now supposed to you judge people not as fully fledged human beings we are not upposed to judge each other andis is the natural outcome of a hetanistic society in which the only thing the matters is is sex the sex instinct is the only thing the matters it turns out that the way we used to date it honestlyis amazement the way that we used to date is that you did not take your close off until you are married that is way we used to date in society some os co still date that way when that was the case you had to fully appreciate the persons sitting across the table from you as a fully fledged human beings with thoughts and values and ideas and then later you got to the sex now get to the sex first and everything else is kinded by the waysid theres benas big argument going on on lone is really weard argument that isbeen going on including some sort of antipheminus on on the right suggesting marriage is bad because no fault divorce is led to most divorceis being initiated by women which means s risky for men to get into a marriage my answer to that is not if you marry the right woman and the way that that you are marrying the rigt woman or least have pregood security is if you date in the right way not all marriages are created equal in terms of their quality and not all partners are created equal in terms their quality this is why 's very important when you are dating do not do the naked attraction version the first date get in t sack see how it goes from that that is not howdating shoul go it should be precisely as it was in terms of actually appreciating the other human being as a potential life partner be caus gess what everythings gin a droup and bag as you get older anyway s you may as well marry somebody who shares your values ardogizes the rest of the chows

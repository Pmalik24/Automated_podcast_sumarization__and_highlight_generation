today shos sponser bakspressivete pn thousands of myliscerns already secured their nutorctata join themat expressvepianzat com slash men it is finally here the best teel of the ear fifty per cents off new daily wire pluss annual memberships now is the tame go to daily wired oc com slash subscribe to join right now the story of the current israel commas conflict happens to be extremely simple commas is a genicital jew hating organization that openly seeks the extermination of israel is makes it only the latest and most radical iteration of a radical muslin movement that has sought israel's destruction since long before israel was even born tvambission has not waned in the seventy six years of modern israels existence unfortunately vambission also happens to be the passion belief of a vast majority of muslims living in the gozas strip and the west bank israel by contrast is a democracy the world's only jewish state and has repeatedly sought to make land for piece deals with arab countries and organizations those concessions have brought israel no friends in h westbank or gosa trip far from it concessions have generally emboldened israel's enemies that is exactly what happened in the goza strip in two thousand five israel pulled out of goza in an attempt to stop the coss in blood and treasure associated with policing the area all jewish assets in the gosa srip were promptly destroyed by palicinian arabs elections were then held in the goa strip and comas was elected to lead the gozastrp they promptly consolidated their control by killing members of the palicinian authority the then stole as much international aid as they could to build rockets and terror in for structure ignoring the needs of their population entirely and then they launched repeated rock tattacks on his raely civilians for elest two and half years or as commass itself says the organization attempted to deseive israel into believing it had been detured from large skille terrorist action then on october seventh some cotora the happy estate in the jewish calender at least one thousand five hundred commas terrase and many civilian fellow travellers crossed the israely border by breaching the borderwall around gozap and killed some twelve hundred is railies in their beds at a music festival and elsewhere they raped women than murdered them or drag them in captivity back to goza they kidnapped or slaughdered babies here is vidio from the gozastrip as members of commas surrived back in the strip with their captives he cans whe this tha enormous crawds people cheering and celebrating excited at the slaughter of civilians in the kidnapping of other civilians does this slolecagate does this look a peaceful population a population seeking peace and coexistence look at the excitement look at the celebration people screaming aluaqar as hossages are driven away including the bodies of people being beaten in the streets gaza and wesbank are not filled with moderate muslims far from it gazan wesbank are filled with people who despised the state of israel and agree wholeheartedly with commasses genecidal aims this is in ascence the entire problem worthy's areas filled with moderate muslims israel might find a pece partner that piece partner does not exist as a new pole from the arab world for research and development shows seventy five per cent of those pulled in the gosestrip an westbank supported the october seventh massacre seventy six per cent suppor commass ninety eight per cent have a negative view of america seventy eight per cent believe in the total extermination of israel altogether as the old saw goes if the palicinians were t put down their arms tomorrow they wuld have a state if isrel oer t put down it is arms tomorrow all the jews would be dead if the conflict is that clear cut why does it seem complex the answer is a strategy undertaken by the radical musslin world it is far left allies some far right allies and the international media the strategy is called baffling with bulla here is hol works first you construct institutions that mur yor perspective as to create in echochamber for example you take over or create sudo human rights organizations sedicated to promoting the anti israel point of view then you trot them out routinely in order to claim that despite all evidence israel is the real threat to human rights how can you tell which human rights organizations are biased and illegitimate 's not that hard if yhou are human rghts organization presumably you should have had some pretty strong condemnation of commases assault on jews the worst assault since the holicos or commasses handling of the god's trip which is terroristic and facistic here is a partialist of those wh have been extraordinarily weak in their condemnations of commass or who have engaged in full scaled moral equivalents with israel's defensive actions in gossa yunicefchief catherin russell amistines are national a cho chief tegros cabriessis the international comittee of the red cross you an commissioner on human rights vulgor turk you an reliefen works agency save the children doctors without borders you in special reportor franshesca albanies human rights watch ox foun the open society foundations the list of such organizations goes on and on and on and of course this sort of attitude is extraordinarily common in the legacy medias we have been detailing for weeks on tis program now once you have your mouthpieces the true magic begins you begin the baffling here is how you do it you obscure the main story entirely instead you focus in on the details as to avoid discussing the main story alltogether you try to discredit a single detail from israel and then you use it to suggest that everything emerging from israel is false despite the fact that israel has a robus free press and retinely admits to mistakes and despite the even more obvious fact that israel's enemies routinely lie that is lying in fact is eigh keep part of their strategy take for example emas an buses men hassana consistently propagan to stick opponent of israel all the way back to his days at all guzera here he was last week suggesting that because the israel governments public relationsteam may have mis labald a calender in their exposa on comasses terror tunnels beneath alshiva hospital this means that israel is a totally unreliable source on everything there he is i agree with e wision blindle believ anyving haosces but why should not we bemeg what mul government sas inther your military spoton monta pointed to an arabi document and the basement of a galallan claimed it with a gaubian li on which eve retarroris rights his name but that was whole shuit it the kalanda when the dangs of the week on your calling in the priministe lof i olse gendallman pos tan behind the tin fot from a nebani short cillman clamed it with potethingin angala shaking their own injury about tweint i skito a wee clek that a endless fishenformation from your government is itnal endless to sinformation and misinformation according to madyhason endless the goal there of course is to create anequivalents between israel sources of information and kamases and tomenamas what alshefa was remember the thing he is talking about there is a calender found in a terror tunnel below alshefa hospital and this has been a bugaboo for the media for long tine they have been claiming that alshefa is not a military siht that it is in fact a civilian sight and israel has no actual military interest in alshefa other than human rights biolation why they believe that because they just listened whatever commasaz and then repeated and then when israel claims differently they legiston know we get lna hers the thing of course alsheva was a military sight it was used as sach here is survelan's footage from the day of the attacks these youwill see are hostages being ushered into the hospital by the terroris into this amazing hospital that is a pure medical sight a civilian sight these are hostages or being ushered into this hospital one these hostages by the way was in his raily soldier a femalisraily soldier whose slightly wounded theye found her body the other day should been murdered by kamas here you can see the medical personnel helping to usher these people in these people were in scrubs ushering in members of kamas with hostages by the way they drove passt a bunch of hospitals to get to alshefa this is nas a bunch of medical personnel where deeply concerned about helping the medical situation the hostages who by the way woulhd been much better off they ben left in israel which is why when yaga sinowar the head of kamass had brain cancer israel treated him and then released him in any case you can see these are members of the medical personnel at alshefa who are helping kamass and then were lying to the media about it pretending that it was a pure medical sight they were all complicit the international red cross knows about this human rites watch knows about this they all ly they all know that komas is operating from alshefa they worked with them and then they told te media lies about it andthen the media ran with that story there are witnesses from alshefa whos names cannot be reveal becaue thy will be killed talking about how the base was used as a base by hams is in cusdra anaba manshefa hospital woud be a slaughter of globa proportions but they do not do such things komases kasam fighters enter among us civilians the jews cannot get to them and nobody can tell on them when i went to shefi found kasam fighters all around this camas next to us in front of us behind us over and under us is not that forbidden in islam is not that oppression of civilians every palistinian knows shef a hospital is full of them but nobody can taw tdeath by the jews is better than death by icis the night i spent the chifa i thought would be the lasst night of my life judging from the terrible carnage that happened and the shelling around us i thought it was our day of judgment only wewere being judge on account of people who had never protected us they only protected their families and children whom they brought to save the outside of gozo or underneath us godnos were while everything always fell on us let me tell you for certain our people will bear poverty hunger and thirst as long as comas gets out of here from the day they arrived hiven durn catastrophy tas what people and gaza some of them at least actually think about comas but the will never say it and the truth is that when a comes down to it this is a minority viewpoint this a minority viewpoint but the big story obviously for mady hassan is what there israel is a seminating endless missinformation tabout a calender on the wall of a terror tunnel and whether are kept track of terrace hostage hamblers or not thatc ies many hasson plaing the baffling with botgame it is the usual sospectsitsien end too sand hen reported over the weaken that the idf in showing the media the weapon refound at all chief aquote might have rearranged weapon ry prior to exposing that weapon reac to the media the implication from siana and is that israel was falsifying something which is absurd any time the d e a makes abos and then shows the drugs on the table they have rearranged the drogs were israel to leave all weapon rean place that would be dangerous given that bouby traps ofe already killed or wounded a high number of hisraely soldiers we seen the sort of game waundered into false accusations by prol comas forces that real photos o burned babies are in fact a i generated images the insistence by procoms propagandis that if babies were mostly burned alive rather than beheaded this somehow means israel is dishones and comemoss is its moral equivalent and now most amazingly people are claiming the comas did not even conduct the massacre at all that is a contention making its way around the internet and the arbic world thanks to a report from haarits a far left disgrace of an israely publication that story from harit states that according to is raely officials commas terroris initially did not know about the music festival they ended up devastating that instead they quote found out about the nova festival through drones or from those flying in parashutes and directed terrorist to the location using their cams system the report also included a single unsource police aligation that an idea halicopt or targoting terroris at the sy quote apparently harmed a few partygoers who are in the area the police have by the way denied the report san quote the polics in vestigation does not refer to the activity of idea forces and therefore no indication was given of harm to civilians tas a result of aerial activity at the sight none the less that ho arits report has now matastisize into the pro chomas lie that israel slaughtered its own citizens on mass the most viral twitter account on twitter tweeted yesterday quote will you condemn israel now given they have admitted to haarits that is raly helicopters murdered is railly civilians on october seventh yesterday the palsin an authority this is the supposedly moderate pece partner the bi dministration is pushion announce that israelly hallacopters had killed all three hudred sixty four people at the music festival siting theroport an harets no surprise there the leader of the palsinian authority again a supposed moderate mahutabas is a full scale holicos denir the baffling with bo is not relegated to focussing on details an then blowing them up into entire false narratives it also extends teven credens to total liars that is precisely why the leggacy media claims that israel had bom the hospital early in the conflict whenit was palistinian is lomic cehot why the legasymedia have claimed each and every day th electricity was out at alshefok when clearly by contemporaneous footage it was not that israel is targaning civilians when it is not in fact is journalist dived collierpoints out the media routinely use accounts from open terror supporters for their gozic coverit doctor halled abusamra who claim that israel was shooting at those waving white flags posted that quo history is being made on october seven mahammed abusalmea had of sheifa hospital who routeenly praises terras on his social media is also routinely quoted by the press menur alborsh tdirector general of the palsening helthministry who claimed dogs were eating bodies of civilians thatgay is literally part of the camas government and there is one other elements to baffling with both pretending yead just tone now enough to make a gjudgment between israel and its enemies who knows what is true and what is not it is all just too complicated to say this alaws journalist ware supposed to be focust on truth to give equal credence to propagandis and truthtellers both sides they cry as they hostpeople who openly call for the destruction of the state of israel and valoraskmas it does not take much to turn a clear narrative into a muddy on just sum wize some lazer focus on a relevan detail and echochamber some shoulder shrugging ignorance when question and a lot of ratical and fello travellers to promot all of that bot from these elements truth can be turned to falsehood and bere

he united states if biding some how rejects that on behalf ne international leftism it demonstrates full scale the impact of a foreign policy brooted in left is nonsense meanwhile hears me lay on tolarization that of course be the transfer away from the absolutely worthless argentinian paso and toward the american dollar owev tudo ge i think there is a previous discussion about dolarization actually strictly speaking it is to get rid of the central bank the dolarization is an instrumental issue at the end of the day therefore argumentative actonsly one has to do with a moral issue which is that stealing is wrong and senerig is nothing more or less than a swindl by polititions against good people therefore lets say if we consider that stealing is wrong one of the greatest thieves in the history of mankind is the central bank the second point has to do with a technical ission because in the argentine case it is more evidenc when a product has no demand its price is zero if the local currency has no demand and thits price should be zero the equilibrium real balances aur zerona whatever amount of money e sentral banquishes to impose the counter part is that the ice level is infinite s te man then thats price should be zero thequilibrium real balances ar zero whatever amount of money is central bangwhat wants to umpose the lipside is that the price level has in finity this is correct what he is saying is who cannot just pump money into the economy and then pretend that the money is worth anything it is not he is staunchly antibortion he favors looser gunlaws he is criticized pope francis in he most colorful of terms makes muoke a piker in that particular department he used to carry around a chain saw and he symbol of his plan is the gupera its sugest the best is just the best and again here here is made my favorite melavita their bunch an their just pectacular and a if you never seen a picture of mela he looks dorky wolverine it is is amazing he is got bike the big hair and he is got mutton shobs and he is famously suggested that he is not cut his hair since high school he is that he is a very can trumpy character in in his own personal life he is 's to talk pretty openly about being a tantric sex gooru an all the rest of thiscannis of it its hysterical stuff this is the the vidio that probably of him has gone the most viral and for those who cannot see he is standing next to a white board with taped up on the white board are the names of various ministries in argentina and he just going throughit in ripping them down and saying that he is going to throw them out here we go be wea o wat his ministry ofs pors intor his an out whit ministery of culturwhat ministry of environment and sustandable vol out ministry of women gender's indiversityout whaministry of public woris he is this it un i fou is i lus lupted the bord ministry of science t acknowledg an inovation ministry of laver employment and social scurity wministery o vegetation in doctrination out ministry o transport out he ministery of healt out whaministry of social development o out in the theorya of politics is over long live dan liberty ah ach he is great now the reality is that he can do the people in america concernsli why cannot we do this here and the answer is cause we do not have a hundred and forty throe perecent inplation the reason that he is able to say the truth about government spending is because it has reached such an exorbitant and insane proportion that they have bankrupted the country no less than three times they have defaulted on their debts repeatedly which means it is im possible to raise new debt when he keep defaulting on your debt nobody wants to lend you money in the future right now the the question is hathergan to pay back the iam af the iam afhas ic a forty three billion dollar lone outtargentina right now in ore for argentina to get back on some sort of decent track they argana have to take some new debt the guarantee of that that is going to be melay's ability and willingness to cout futur government spending and this means dumping the garbage philosophy of paronism now the reason that paronism h's important for people to understand is because paronism is almost identical what the kind of economic policy tat has been pursued by the left wing in the united states parnism is not comminism paronism is not quite socialism it is really more economic corporitism it is the sort of thinger sing china pursue right now or that yous saw for example notty germany per su it is state led enterprise tso the basic ideas sure there 'll be private busiess but we will give them subsidies we will tell him how to do their business we will we will protect a few corps businesses and business sectors and we will fund them all of our friends well get super duper rich and if this sounds a lot the democratic party policy on economics and part ofthe re publican party policy on economic frankly that is because it is it turns out that whether you are right or whethr you are left subsidies to political friends in ord to protect particular industries not cor national security industries but its industryes the you think are special to protect certain segments of the population it turns out their bankrup the country if you go back to the originist is the original paronist philosophy of quan peron who was the left leaning argentinian who ran argentina until his wife took over in then they wrote a musical about her with modonon all the restment paronis philosophy is dominated argentina for literally decades and if you go back in uushu work at the principles of paronism they sound very much the modern democratic party quote a trudemocracy is that in which the government does what the people wants and defends only one interest the peoples paronism is essentially of the common people any political elete is anti people end thus not paroniss rites the populous leftwing movement a paronist works for te movement woever in the name of peteronism serves in a leat or leader is a paronist in name only for paronism there is only one class of person those who work working is a right that creates the dignity of men it is a duty because it is fair that everyone should produce as much as they contume at the very least and then paronism toks about how essentially you need to balance the right of theindividual and society as an economic doctrine a social market putting capital to the service of the economy in the well being of the people anybody who ferred by the way right or left talk about the idea that capitalism is really a tool rethere th ta th for the markets ought to work for the people not the other way around that philosophy is in essence a paronist philosophy is not the job of quonk markets to work that markets are not in instrument of the government markets ar description of relations between human beings markets our description of how people traded with one another and under what conditions suggesting that the markets sou were for the people is a rusonian way of describing a vague general will and then directing government power at achieving that supposed general will and what an ends up with is massive amounts of that in in reality it amounts to tremendous economic in efficiency redistribution of resources tremendous economic controls on industry and as always huge dat back an october writers reported on the be problems for argentina they point it out that the six hundred billion dollar economy has been engulf by deep crisis that involves runaway inflation a dirth of eostola reserves and an electrit with little trust in its currency the country could be in danger of defalting on that forty three billion dollar program with the international monitary fon that ashould be argentina devulting on its that not for the third time in the last coplodeca s but for the tenth time over all the government keeps on spending and spending and spending they keep on just blowing out the debt the te bellooning debt pile is enormous you right now the total outstanding government debt as he twenty twenty three is apbout four hundred billion dollars and is rising rapidly mela is gin to have his work cut out for him since nineten eighty thev ben spending drunken sailors they have been monotizing that debt by simply issuing more pessos and then the have been defaulting on that debt and now mela is gin to comehat have to com in with that chanto he is really not can ave a choice but to do that and watch as the left kickson screams in the united states also because they su its coming they sho its coming the reality is that once you hit the situation that archintina has now hit you rnt nof a choice but to go for the chansal best of luck to hovier mela and again the west ought to be embracing this gy it is it is an incredible judgement on the media an o on the west than many of them are more comfortable with lulad sylva in brazil than they are with with hovyan meley an open ally of the united states who ise desperately seing h etter relationship wit theunited states the fact the media find it easier to sympathized with lula tells y everything you need know about the media and our modern left wing political leadership melae is precisely the kind of leader the ronalds riggan was begging for during his presidency a democratically elected classical liberal who is seeking economic openess in freedom and to pay back the country's debts and he met ar i do notkno tis kasing's kenna crazy sgess him's too roht to what you'r hearing him describe as ananarical capitalist is a far right character om i notice that archinsena has one hundred and forty three per cent in flation because of the program you guis now 's time to try

dok com slash black friday ow can meanwhile elan mosq is now at war with a huge swth of the lafe that includes of course the antad afimationtly that is been true for a long time but now with media matters media matters for thosewho do not know was a group that was founded by hillery clinton's close adviser david broch it was specifically designed at the time to be an anti right wing messaging machine designd to wrab any sort of rightling outlet of advertisers and profits that is what it was designed to do it' been very effective in that goall anda and theyve been going out for elan mosqu hammer and tonguin then peticularly rationing things up over the course of the last few mons because elan is active on twitterand as we talked about a little bit last week elan em broiled himself in controversy because again he is very active onswitter and he sor retweeted and restated another tweed from somebody then many people then accuse t being antismatic and the he obviously clarified to dlissen 'm talk bat the eight yell i'm tungue about left wing jews who have been very big on open borders and then suddenly are very big on not open boarders the minute that it turns out a lot of people got imported ha jews and keavus who is not talking bout the intired rers community or all jews are anything remotely that that is not who elon is man know ulon just a little bit but the implication that elan mosq i's antismatic the implication down trump is antismatic i find it very weird that many of the people who are jumping on that bad wagond people mediu matters are very saft on actual commoss fans if you are fan of comos if you are if you are a person who is from the rever to the sea receeted to leep place media matters will defend you it if you are a person who actively promots terrorist entities who actively sides with those terrors verlinda sar sore or something then media matters your youre the bast and you are rate butif your elan mosk and all son th what th at says to me is ulterior motive thet hadialon mus bis elon ms just does not murror the wok priorities of the left what we saw last week was yet another attempt to unperson elon mus which is not going to work because he is incredibly rich nens cincredibly famous and he is incredibly valuable to a a wide variety of human beings ranging from testal owners to the federal government with regard to spacact and now they been tempting to under caught him with advertisers on tuitter now known as acts and elon is now pushing back on all of that he is pushing back o all that in a few diferent ways first of all again theve the implication that ela muskes an antisemite is to me quite absurd based on the reck a based on the record that is currently available an he he literally tweeded out just three days ago quote as i said earlier the week d colonisation from the river to the sea and similar uphamisms necessarily imply genniside clear calls for extreme violence are against our terms of service and will result in suspension that seems a lot more pro jewish then a huge majority of the people on the left qhare ripping on on elan musk will now he has said that he is going to go neucleer on media matters accoring to poltico musk set on saturday he will fioly thermonucleator lawsuit against non propet watch struk media matters andothers as companies including disny apple and ibum reportedly have pause to advertisran an x amin anti semicism storm around the social media platfom again disney apple i bam they ill continue to advertises on amas and be see which does cover forcomas on a daily basis presumably media matters a uascroup thet describes itself as a progressive research and information center published earlier this week research showing that x had posted ads appearing next tutenieo nazy posts exy yolinda acreno previously said brandster nowt protected from the risk of being next su potentially toxic content on the platform bot musk said the split second court opens on monday x corp will be fioling a thermo nucleor lost against mean media matters and all those who colluded in this frauge lonce attack on our company he posted a statement the headline stand with acts to protect free speech and here is what he said quote this week media matters for america postod distory that completely misre presented the real usar experienconacts in another attempt to under mine freedom of speech and mislead advertisers above everything including profit ex works to protect the public's right to free speech but for speech to be truly free we must also have the freedom to see or here things that some people may consider objectionable we believe that everyone has the right to make up their own mines about what to read watch or listen to becaue that is the power o freedom of speech despite our clear and consistent position ec as seen a number of atacts from activis grups media matters and legy meda autlets who seem to undermine fredom of expression on our platform because they preceive it as a threat to their idea logical narrative and those of their financial supporters this of course is one hundred presentrue his wisy caras wisher spending every waking moment of her life going after elan musq going after os mark zuckerburg before any social media platform that does not murro of the priorities of carus wisser becomes a bad social media hour that must be hit with t advertiser boycots cure the facts on media matters research tis what elan says to manipulate the publican advertisers media matters creat and al turnit count and curated posts and advertising appearing on the accounts time line to missin form advertises about the placement of their posts these contrived experiences could be ply to any platforms another words mediu matters cratit af false account then they proceeded to alga rhythmically figure out which tweets would be the most likely to appeare in their twitter feed if they kept the accessing pro nosy tweets and then when adds reserts then they then screem cap that once they curated their feed he says they repeatedly refreshd their time lines to find a rare instance of adds serving next to the content they chose to follow aur logs indicate they force he scenarea resulting in thirteen times the number of ad serves compares the median ad served to an accuser of the five poin five billion ad im pressions on accesse less than fifty total adum pressions were served against t all of the organic content featured in the mediu matters article which is an insane rate of success if your hoping to pro hibit advertising content from appearing next to really discussing post for one brand show case in the article one of thets adds ran adjacent to a post two times that add was seen in that settng by only two users one of which was the author of the mediumatters article for another bran show case in the article two of the ads served adjacent to two posts three times that add was only seen in that setting by one user the author of the mediu matters artcle and other words they totally created an accounts just to manufacture a story that this is a thing that is happening all over twitter when in fact its happening because medium matters basically gamed the system to achieve an end where they can then say to advertisers that if your hondu your risk of apearing next to a neo nosy post medium matter's article pilots nine post they believe sould not be lod on ats upon a valuation only one of the nine organic post feature in the article violater our content policies we take an action on it under our freedom of speech not reach enforcement or posh here is the summery ax will protect the public strites for expression will not allow ajenda driven actives or even our own profits to detur our vision every one has a chice on axs tuser and bran control an acs is superior to a year ago and data winds over allegations medium matters is not reflect the user experience on axs he is now filing this lawsuit against mediu matters presumably for what he is going to accusamof is is som sfrom form of fraud ome legal form of fraud in attempt to artificially interfere of business contract eu tortious interference with with contract would probably be the basis the lowsuit here in this parton parcel a broader attempt to d platform musk from his own platform this why they were angry when twitter got taken away from jack dorcy when musk bought twitter at the expensive twenty billion dollars that is just down the toilet mean that the twitter is now worth may behalf of what it was when musk bought it at the men going price theare now tempting to essentially destroy musk over all of this by claiming falsely that he is in antisemite and again yo you have to consider the source you have to consider the source when you see people on amasand b c who are hot and bothered over elon musks supposed antisemitism and the very next segment theyre having on some wyold anti israel prognosticator accusing israel of genicide ind war crimes and making excuses for commoss you have to wonder what is the real atender there it does not feel the real agen has anything to do with jue hatred perse ocane just one second we will get to the actual latest news in t israel the whoothies are ramping up theyre attacks from yamon because gen a ron i's baing all sorts of trouble in the region first what thanks giving just a

terrible at their jobs this particularly torun israel of course it they claim destratives the biggest hebline of the day that israel was about to strikes some sor of cease fire deal with commoss in the gosistrip than they to walk that back es was denied by both israel and the united states it turned out not to be true this giant paus now the bide administration is trying to push the idea that theyre getting closer to a del but te relishon't be talking about anything if it deal isabout to happen wags out they we talk about any of that publicly john finer who is the deputy national security adviser he was saing a national tov ei ther etting closer to a deal what is that even look wise he talking about that lake this is not how negotiations typically work what is the state of negotiations as of this morning is ther dol imminent a thanks jak i think you heard a probably the priminister pruter speak to this earlier to day a they have been extremely close a obviously at to tese negotiations have wee as we have a united states has been a following this minute by minute our by our up to a the level of the president for whom this is a a major a over riding priory a obviously inpart becaus there are number of americans to in this herrific situation what i can say about this at this timeis we think of that we are closer than we have been a perhaps in any point a since these negotiations began weeks ago a that there ere is of difference ain disagreement that have been narrowed a if not a closed out entirely a i'm wis dung mat that publicaly nobody really really knows meanwhile these really ambastdors to the united states mankel herzok zik were not imasees fire why would wo do a sease fire when we are literally atstempting to tract down our hostages in real time and again tape was released yesterday of the hostagres being dragged into all shifo hospital the tape is t absolly sicaning we showed at earlier on the show when the fact that there still people in the internatinal media who believed that israel has some sort of responsibility to commoss under thy circumstances is insane absurd in disgusting primesternetna who set aposint combat is exactly what hamas wants they can rsi want to e sinio thin ay pos fo o tays in ord e to get us is o tis and sis i fie til is o si ti sis i wr ges sis fir because that would ther alo hams to e thin pou togrop toe ou an trike agan but it wouldt be a sis fire for a few days this is there is that that differiously toabout ther posin tefitin to fo tas to we can get the hosage us but all ti tot i sis fa because wewi othin to push ages mas to dislatto ther main fostu to and the therein fo tato were not gon to that meanwhile uranian a backd who these in yamman have now seised a ship in the red sea this stuff is really dangerous beausewhen you start in dangering the the worlds choke points in terms of trade that is a major problem tit led to the to us cannow crise of nineteen fifty six for example the traiht of hormoos or another example of the place where oil ships out and if the aranians were o make serious trouble over there that be a real probe for the world economy foks who our isolationist on foreign policy seem to forget that there there is in fact a globe and on that globe there are certain choke points in terms of trade and when those choke points ghat owned by nivarious powers their priceis at the grocery store go up their jobs may go away in flation its we have a very inter connected world economy and the simple fact is that it does make a very large diference to you exactly who owns those choke points in how thos chokpoints get run yesterday a cargoship ut partially owned by an is really business person was highjack by gemmin thothe rebels in the red sea on sunday the cargoship the mohomats flaggs galasy leader was leases from a brish company partially owned by an is really name de romi unger to a japanese at company the ship left a port in turkey was headed for india who selling under the mohamanian flag ther apparently twenty five cruemembers of different nationalities including crenians bulgarian philopinos and mexicans there are no is railies on board no crue members were ingered but it did receive minor damage the prime minister's office condemne the seizur highlating teship was not is raily or owned by is railies the hothies have been attempting obviously to attack the water is surrounding surrounding the persian gulf theyve been attempting to create naval problems in these areas that is aron that is obviously aron now all of this is contributing to a larger sense of democratic panic why woll because the medi are pushing this idea tht unless jo bydan swivels and becomes wildly anti israel that he is going to lose the next elction i love to see the data that support the idea that if he swivels on behalf of commas that suddenly heis going to win the election trobina's on popular becaus jobidon is deeply un popular brannew pulling out yesterday shows that jobidons approval riting is down to forty per cent strong majorities of all voters disapprove of his handling of foreign policy now it does say that they also disapprove his handling of the israel comas war but what is weird about that particular question is that that means up bunch of people who are on the writ mean peoplwho love israel very often a lot of those people disapprove of his handling of the israel comss war but but they do from the right son on the words to suggest that everybody is mad at bidon because he is to pro israel is to ignore the reality which is that by the same pole of all entities in the pole ranging from israel to comass to jonal tromp to jobidon s the republicans in congress thes singlemost popular entity in the pole was actually the state of israel be very weird for for example jobidon two sort of a bandin israel in the face of all of that again by this same pole that showing jobidon on popular it shows that israel has a plus twenty three riting ucrane still has a plus twenty one writing and then he gets to the politicians nicke haleis at minis four mi johnsons at min is nine tohn trumpsant mind is sixteen jobidnsant mines seventeen palistine is a mine is eighting russia is at mine is seventy four and comass as at minis eighty if the implication there is that jobidin is supposed to swivel on behalf of comass i'm not sure exactly how you make tatcates predictalisisi something i neat silver the dee polster has pointed out none the less jobidon is seeking to starto milla tate be tween two positions this for example is why president bidn his now said that he is going to issue viza bands on quotting qhat is really extremest attacking palistinians in the west bank unclear exactly who he is talking about obviously no criminal shuld enter the united states if somebody is comitting a criinal act ju or not ju they should not be entering the united states period end of story by the idea that there is this vast criminal under class in the west bank that is pursuing extraordinary acts of violence is not actually tolds out by the data there are some people who r doing that and they should be arrested then the notion this is anywhere on par with a a massive problem ther hundreds of that ten thousand eight thousand eih hundred people or temting the emocrate from israel to the united states after conducting criminal activities againsthe aerabs in wess bank wik those numbers do not exist it is a very weird taken is mostly directed toward public consumption at this point meanwhile you can tell it that the the democrats are deeply fearful biding he celebrating his eighty first birthday he clearly is not with it any more you can tell this because essenel is finally turning on jobidon which is shocking when when essenel turns on jobidon he is got a real problem because essenal they have been mistashing bidon the e missoshing the democrats literally for thela basely since two thousand ate since brakobom became president they have made it their permanent fultime job to missoch democrats now they are finally starting to knock bidon that is it that is bad news for him obviously smay urbor jue oastarted u to keep things on the rails on ta reed from the teleprompter a o great meaning with a president roman numeral eleven ers me porsate she ash meanin was a total wind

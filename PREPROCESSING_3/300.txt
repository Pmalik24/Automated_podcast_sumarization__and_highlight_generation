actually did change their lives i mean tis i went to prom i soft morinjuerears and it was a daance it was a prom it was nice it was fine to get all dressed sup but it was the prom that tate lesson was it just it became our cars and clothes and woret important and family an friends and it taught it a big lesson about humada to i fakes everybody there everybody could had e new perspective of life walking out of that prom i you morent a whole different world oh just have fon when actually outside i side tolly oposte people are in the bacements stuff fallen down houses are gone no people are actually losn stuff and we are in the prom still dansom when the tornana hadson after a hancs were still just just free of everything s still haveng a good time it is tolly different when you walk ouso i you you step out of o sitesoyou go into another world reality his prom does not usually shap roning into the world quickly suddenly a lot of kits in hoisington have to act grownups well is

been dreaming about prominint for years they lena that is in a minute from c cogoboblagradio when our programme continues this this a mericang life from oura glass heu yo ten a program of course we chose some theme bring your a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to days programm at the very end of prompseason stories about the prom we aearrived the at two of our programme at two save the last anse for me again pretty ind pank and carry a back the future the cosby kids buffyan too many other movies in heevhe shows to name they all eventually and up at the prom but why why the prom why is it om the present well for answers we turnd two franseen pascal who has written or invented the plot lines for seven hundred books in the sweet valley high series which of course is the adventures of elizabeth and cestica week field twins and well seemingly permanent high school juniors she spoke to s from our home in france well i have to gay that the prom it probably the crin tothink o glory of high chool it the moment tha come po to the romantic dition of life i think it it it repeatet again only one other time and that would be marriage i mean it it tat important in in the hig school life in the teanatur life in that pre life before a dol thas yout you think as in a traditional a drama where where you were you would want the characters to end up in marriage if youre writing about tean agers all you have got is the prom hit tat e bout it that rite and ot of the ceven hundred book coll i probably rom i mention did it le five hundred of them but i would pay the probably a made your go in o thirty thirty five you you mean thirty five or books actually take place at the prom theres an actual prom in them and dery ta prom a the lot go or a very important part of the plot i can give you te fidea of it ta it thei can cin a feckon book ah i did a plot about to who ul goin o by te king and queen of the prom and tere would fena rigging the election and it hen i jut to give you an idea a pot on no getting a dat for the prom obody who had no date for the prom the romdate for the rom the romday to cor that life for the prom and i know do it a prot about the poor girl a brother had to take her amin that permanent prom and et a the oter thing with i the money for the prom drat an did the one about you think you could afou bul at ome one ell at every i mean when you are when you are invover i many plot es i am ah they they begin to fall into fom categories and erthings the tat plot thoug tho what plod ebet waiter a waiter bet plot or the pledge plot ah where ar you ifthe boy have to girl on a bet to go to the prom or to pritis ye hav a the we popular girl in in the class to go to the prom and then shou find out and thend he really want to go with her but it to wike ir furious in that to tak the whol bookto fettle dell it seems one of the common prom plots is tat the prom forces a choice between potential dates and often it will be the good looking unattainable boy or girl is one possibility and the smart funny best friend is the other possibility exactly exactly of you that sort of thing et do not for i to perfect to beca thoug the people are not going to be living for their o the live an not legally narriterything but they do have to make that firt important choice of the perthon they are going to pend that momentit evening with te and if if some of fo many marriage kind of choice in book number one forty two in the sweet velly ceries of a strai clled the big nighte you have not one not to not three but four characters who went up switching their dates at the prom and one girl tries to kill her date e te o it ata tha ye that mut been a ye a triller the a court cordiny tries to pusom tod off of the off of a boat riling anto into the water and elizabeth is in a speed but following ye yet rit yet o i tat ju to variation on a theme that all you have to do something lightly different with them a when you are no hundred and forty listening to you talk about this it seems what the prom a does and what it gives you as a writer is it gives you a natural om erena where there can be a comflict over love and an aom om and without the prom you would have to invent some situation which would feel it has waihe wereis the prompjust has the wat exactly becaus the prom is it e natural it comes filled with all kinds of emotion just the mention of the prom you do not have to create something and build it up and give it terribly important you do not have to do any of tho thing did you got to prom yourself i never went to my own prom i do not interestit trangely enough i i did not hig cool very much at all it funny that i handet up writing much about it and what did you think of prom i really whet not interet i i i felt that i was to fiticated and mature for that fort of ta and i i itn't a i never i never really partifipated beyond writing feature for the political cande they can be on a newpaper that what i but beyond that i dicudn't have an int you never care to go to the promince of you now somehow fatos put you in a situation where youv had to re visiter of e thirty fi imes it ye my funishment tat i it if

woud hands down say prom because it is the highest rated anything in town and that is a good way to judge people's interests of what they are watching on tvay promise everywhere are all about heipe and it is no surprise that once you have a prom that the teevy show that the writings would be hipe to to the cable company's commercial says that sixty thousand eyes for watching the prom but by that the actually mean thirty thousand viewers two eyes purviewer and really even not number is just a guess for sure one person who was not watching the prom is carston havscape i spoke with her underjob at desmon's form aware that tuxida rental store at the ragen sm all it is also safe to say that curston was the only person in them all that night who was reading playd as phadress for fun i'm rereading it a slessthan yo red in school and just whet when wa i on t reading it else onpictse my greek ou did not i prompt no know i did not prom is a beautiful illusion people here indulge in that in the thought that may be there not in the place that they are wer seen is not a glamorous place and a i ma i know i'm i'm part of it if youre someone who hates the pro there is no better way to refuel yor hatred that my working to toc shap hure ston says everyone at thestora despises the prme the worst part beg when e cads pring their at e sees back sometimes look come look stuffd into a little grocery bag tidally tight ind yet t bou disinpect the whole thing and pick it up very slightly a the foss her got unk fung us in ng ther finging helse if i feeling aso sox he gant sees on li ranstan no e a ras few mud tor people let say that prom ise there that for people to feel special once it lives i do not know about that i mean find me one high school senior who really needs an egoboos it is hat it is the time to be cocky and a prideful and i think that it is kind of indulgence of hat and if they sey that they feel a celebrity it does not surprise me at all caus they they do they do et treated celebrities even though they the personality might be was the beautiful and i'm certainly glad i did not take part in it to truly enjoy the raseen prom and maye me to enjoy any prome he have to be the sort of person who enjoys the height leaning up to it is act certainly did for basically his whole life iave been watching promontalivision every every spring every every may

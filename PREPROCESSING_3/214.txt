a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the show if you pre fer a beep version you can find that at our websight this american life dot o work hi ther america wen jus get the selection over with already we have a enough excitement right more than enough pot twis president getting corone of iris rute better ginsburg dying the hopfirst debate the lleged contents of hundr bidons hard drive wich erather totally un convincing or deeply urgingly important pending on yo point of view we fint i got to see the president's tacx records after all these years and beare we sem to make a det in anything mialicia plottit s could not the governor of michigan and then after that the president's followers chanted lock her up the president joking not joking told is supborders in orth carolina to go out and try to vot twice and then after that the attorney general declared on seanan to wolf blitzer the voting twice might actually be wegal i do not knowht the lw in the particular state sa celfo twice i do not know what the low in the particular state sas on when that vot be comes fine any state that sas you can vot twice well ther shul ar you can ot maybe you can change your rod up to a particular tarm i do not know what the wa it shall not it lat he was sturning general william barr looks masinly relaxed as he says al this calm nothing's out of the ordinary nothing to see her officer watching him it is hard not to think is this really happening i get the same feeling looking at photoes the president's ralliys where even now his packing people in cons of people with no maffs not following cedysey god lines hes doing this even after he his wife his son his pre secretary his campaign manager the chair of the re publican national committee white house housekeeping in military staff members of the vice president staff stephen miller celly an comway and hop hixs all got corone of iris even tough cases are an all time high and on the rise looking at the not cial ye distant's crowds at's is this really happening and now coming out is coming tuesday rather than have an election with the queer winter or apparently the votabe contested the contest election seems possible because the president keep saying over and over his way ahead in the poles and the supose that we are always saying on the new saying tha his way behind those are fate and if he loses he says i's only one possible explanation teotlhe way we can los n my pinion is e maa fraut e apeny we cuns all over the country you seeing it thowis s an tous ans a ballat thotwas monday in ountown here he is an osh cosse was consim be cause the only way what get lose us alecton as if the election is reg to remember that isthe only way way git los u elec and we cannot let that happen here is no evidence for any mass of frogligs talking about wen talks about mailand ballats being a problem which he does nearly everywhere is no evidence for that either lots more democrats in the republicans are voting with mail and ballats this year here is the president on sunday in new hampshire calling this ballats in to question the other way they sad bidions a ballats we do not know whose sending on we do not know we ther going we do not know whose bringing a back we do not kno side at it should not be allowed and the demicrats no its a hok and we should not let it happen te this tuesday he might fight this ballats and we might find ourselves in a big no holds barred season fanalic ntestad election constitutional national melt down we both sides arguing over whether to count mail and ballats and ballats hat arrive after november third and if the happens people on both sides of publy take to the streets to protest and who knows where that might wead and then of course there are the cenarias where the whole thing gets thrown to congres said the supreme court to decide many different ways as could play out where whichever side loses red or blue the probably never be able to see the final decision as fair in legitimates of one half of the country will not accept who the other half puts into office or may bethat will not happen maybe somebody is going to win decisively that is whe we are a world is either about to slip into utter chaos or the lectionwl go just one and things to be find that is the unreality of now there are many things right now that make it fel the ground underneath us is thin as a cracker with moltonlava underneath many things is hard to understand this is real this is really happening and to day in our programme wif people w trying to get their minds around that have to say that is much on the mood as we had into the simpson's hollowing special of an election day theb b you be easy chicago siys american life on mera glass stay us tha one wouldyou to come up to first class the journalist e gene caroll has been in the news this week when a federal judge ruled that the president can be sued by carol caroll says the back in the nineteen nineties ton le trump raped her in addressing room in th departments store bergderf good men he says she is lying she suing him for defamation she is one of dozens of women who accused the president of sexual assault or harassmen the president denies all of their aligations the stories have been widely covered and everybody is used to them at to caroll if fellow get this point they were just being agnored it iseem con om incredible to her a begramto day is aby people feeling is this really happening and she definally felt that about this it killed her that these stories just somehow did not seem to matter and thes summer she decided try to do something about it shehad a bunch of conversations with other women who acuse the president and publish theme in a series of stories in the atlantic and oer idea was most people only have a vague sense of these stories and do not have much of a sense of what these women say actually happened and by diving into the details of these stories she would restore them to human size in full color she is adopted one of the articles that she wrote for us it is with one of the president's accusers name jessica leeds wanting about content before we start this is a frank conversation about sexual assault here is e gn carol let me set the sea midsummer twilight and jessica lesanare letting down wit is left of our hair jessicas in her elegant crib in the blue ridge mountains i'm in my little shack just off the appellation trail and we are rezumin two old screechells discovering how much we have in common which includes our love for mister paul neman our age in our height are you now well i m i'm five seven now i was bive nine at li i a lost to interest ei lost yo atom i do not know where they goni lost om i love being tall when i was working i was always thankful yet matur i was tall about forty years ago when jessica is working as a sails person for a company that sold news friend to publications the washington post she sat down next to down trump on an airplane let me just say that if youve never sumed with a silver haire swoniay seventy eht year old woman who describes what it is being strapped in a seat on a brannoth airolines with a future president of the united states tryine to fasten his lips on her a six foot to sucfish well in m y opinion you have not lived let alone zoumed at all but before we bored that flight av refresher jessica was one of the first women to publicly accused trump of sexual assault in two thousand sixteen it was on the front page of the new york times i knew if the story did get it in e attention that the first thing trunk would say it tat i was not pretty enough you mi i knew i knew instinctively that that is what he was going to say how did jessica now because jessica is an old bat old bats are the best even better than screechelves i'm an old bat myself we old bats do not kit ourselves and in fact one day after the new york times published the story about what happen to jssica on that plan in nineteen eighty trump yammered about her accusations at a rally oh i was with onal trump in nineteen eighty i was sitting with him on an aroplyn a ye want after me on the ple i ma negwift believe me she would not be my first choice that i can co you do not know that would not be my first yuce i told jessia the same thing happened to me i knew was cuming tew i knew at a person and he said about me she is not right i it is a running pictures of me when i'm seventy five years al right ais not fair it' say i iciousin e as i loked you and i clock tons of shit because were older wen it for the honor of jessica leads and old bats everywhere jessica is a beauty now and she was a beauty forty years ago when she got on that flight to new york and as she remembers it it was a brana flgh brannaph was the shek aroline erse would have been full grain leather her flight attendant would have been clad in hauson and her plaing it would have been painted in perse screen mercury blue or sparkling burgund it what were you warin you remember when you got on that en out i had my best suit was was a brown sweed oh i loved that suit and and was jacket and and a skirt it was a fabulous outfit it really was i never wored again after that day though i hung on to it for quite a while but i never wort again i know exactly what she means it was the same for me with the dress i had on it bergdorf i didn one e thrown awags as a beautiful don i carin i knever sot away at i could not put it on because bad thags hap yet s exactly o has is nanage win muchin com o i you were not tell me what havin yet on the plah i get on the plan and i had i was sitting in the back and i remember watching the stewardess come walking down the isle and she saw me in sheate said would you to come up to first class we have we have space never occurred to me not to say yes i gathered my my purse and i went up to first class that did happened before ye as having to me you yet i kind of axcepted the fact that it was entertainment for the be conchose up in first class now i do not understand people understanbe wer tolling about but that is what they did they chose te gow he got hrest heo one put him up in first that is right what were talking about is how things used to be binar ticket but non our best clothes hoppin on a cocktail party heading for new york or chicago on miame or any jasy city ouessay and this party zip unless somebody very rich or very pretty was present many first class with size up the female passengers before bording and hold a brief conference with a check or alternately a helpful flighter tendant with simply stand in the isle waving people away and rearranging the seeding chart that an extremely tall chap for instance with black hair grease felt could have the spot by me which is what i told jessica had happened on a jumbo jet to ella after the plaing took ot following the meal the chap shows me a photo of his private plan then he shows me a photo of his rols roice then he shows me his erection it wu never currd to me to callin nany sa anything e wot expecting men to make a pass that i was not surprised i expected it fom men i jessicat you and i were born during the second world more o he did not report we expected it and we last ut you kno we were wrong we were wrong we should have spoken up ha tan doing now well we we were thankful though a no to have te tacking job tet oh absolutely oh my lord the flod af tenant escorts jessica to the front of the plan she sits down in the isle seat beside downald trump is i recall he introduced himself the man meant nothing to me it would not have this was in nineteen seventy nine nineteen eighty etet jessica was not a native new yorker bt withif she was not yet aware of all the levels the ranks of spears of new york society of the trump a young rat out of wheings was chewing his way throughout he was very good look here night you day do you agree well i got a very attraction a nihto nig yet he was very pretty ye i guess i i he was notly i can remember i do not remember my my reaction i he was perfectly reasonable when i first sat down i ye wis blond tall good size man that sort of stock but i i do not remember being overwhelmed by his looks or hes ass you abaut yourself what did we talk about we talked about him wi remember we took off bond they served this wonderful meal and then they they came and they picked up everything and within a short amount of time all of a sudden he is on me a wet blanket he trery kiss you first yes yes she glances away from the screen with he revolted wince e was such a shot it was all of a sudden he 's on me jessica is ladylike therefore allow me for i have experience with trump to say in plain english what i believe trump is about to do i believe he will go straight for the trotch just he brags on the access how i would take this man who to day clans that he has never kissed or groped a woman without consent it is it is got for extrahands becaus he is grabbing my grass he is trying to kiss me i'm trying to get his hands off of me and this com of struggle went on for a little while and then it is w an he started to put his hand up my skirt that i got a jolt of of strength and managed to wheel myself out of of the of the seet jessica grabs her purse and storms to the back of the plain no wa did he make it all theway t your panties or not now no because you had by that time sar to stand up right right was there anybody else wut i gothe was thinthere was the guy across the isle whose eyes were about the size of a saucer and i kept thinking a hat why do not you say something or where is whereis the stuwardius on this whole thing now why does not somebody come and rescue me and that is when i realize there as only me that was going to rescue me i that is when i a why wi dou thought of i tut te se some wonen freeze in this situation yes yes i no you did not freeze no no but i certainly did not say anything i i i did not screee m did not no i laugh did you l o no i do not recall laughing no i i took it seriously i mean i i this this was a real physical attack and not an attack in a saull ye although we talk about trump groping woman most people do not understand how brace an trump really is because no one knows what groping means it is one of the reasons i wanted to talk to the trump accusers who knows what the heck trump is actually doing or on what part of the female body he is doing it why of trumps accusers described for me trump putting his hand up her scirt an on to revolver and she used the plain english it was a squish she said a squeeze and she made him motion with her hand squeezing a rubber duck that is groping why does trump do it jessica and i ponder was try to finger this out the man question is he nows he is notking to be able to have intercourse as you on the plan he knows tes why das he do this why what did he think he was glento gan did it was not sexual dhin he you turning him o just such an extand that he could not stand it what was it well i personally i cannot i the i thought he was bore o nothing happening yet iso let us let let us let us crab a little pussy here you kno s it such in inside to me this is such an insight got it but it it goes along with his holly would take and know it gen he has no attention spa no no was he reading it all beforehand no no his paper no who get a fla id nit e aty without a tel im mi newspapers a walst exactly an he had nothing to read no i sot he was born that is an insight that i think it really sends it o because some people have claim he does not for power i do not think it has anything to a power well could be i but i i i really kindi just chalked it off to he to being bore the trump grabs one woman then he grabs the next woman and the next woman and pretty soon we start thinkin rump grabin women is normal then trump grabin woman becomes normal is borin it is old news and there much that he is done but jessi as't not old news were the mos curen thin we tried to warable we tried to wan america this is nwho he was and now we seemed toe been forgot weve been pushed oy been i nor and this drives me crazy this is wh we are doing this redoin e knot between now and te election that is our duty to once again tell america what this man is wife well some people may have forgotten us but who is not forgotten us the men who are voting for trunk because he gratten us because heis mot jo because trunk proved he can paul any woman he wants and who else is not forgotten women jessica and i we will never forget how often did you think about this between then and two has not tifching what he came to the for again i probably would not have had it emblazed in my mind if it had not been for the galla and sax fo favinu the gala at saxis a this is a year or two after the flight and it is a benefit for the humane society of new york an a few other charities jessica is the assistant to the presdent of the humane society and is handing out table assinence i had this fabulous dress o was it amer mery mac fadin r apleaded all these little pleats in a taxi cab yellow and i show up its sacts

by the state and there was not enough time to train pulworkers properly but rick in the folnstaff say most of the troubles in the primary were really about the pandemic many applications for mal and ballast came in the female system crashed and then some of the staff got covet it slowed their operations and they had to close the elections office to disinfect it then close to primary election day

welcome to the hubermanlaponenc discus science scienc pac to c for life i may drhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing ways to improve your fitness in particular we are going to discuss tools that you can incorporate into your existing fitness routine that will allow you to make significant improvement without having to invest a lot of ex or time most all the tools we are going to discuss to day were glean from the six episodes that we did with doctor andy galpin we provide a link to those full episodes in the shownote captions of course now those episodes included a very large number of protocals everything from how to build a fitness routined how to enhance recovery nutrition and supplementation exercises and routines aim specifically at strength or hypertrophy or endurance or building anerovic capacity what iave done is to select key protocals from those episodes that i myself have started to incorporate into my existing fitness routine and that i think will be especially beneficial and frankly fun for you to incorporate into your fitness routine now a little but later in this episode i review the key components of any fitness programme that is the number and type of cardivascular training sessions and resistance training sessions that are esential for every one to include as a templet or a foundation for their overall fitness programme now little but later in the episode i will be sure to review what are the essential components of any fitness programe the number and type of resistance training sessions the number and type of cardivascular training sessions as well as some of the elements of how those are arranged to insure proper and adequate recovery between session that you can continue to make on going progress however the bulk of today's discussion is going to focuss on tools that you can use again very easily very quickly in some cases even saving you time during your fitness regiment in order to improve all aspects of your fitness your endurance your muscular endurance your anerobic capacity your recovery your strength your hypertrophy and in describing these tools to improve your fitness it also provides an opportunity for each and all of us to step back from our existing fitness routine and ask whetheror not it is really checking off all the boxes that are necessary as well as where we can be more economical with our time an our efforts in order to reach our specific goals relate to exercise and performance by the end of to day's episode you can be sure that you have at least one and as many as twelve tools that yu can incorporate into your existing fitness routine again without adding much additional time or effort that are sure to accelerate your progress before we begin i'd to emphasise that this podcast is separate from my teaching t e research rolls at stamfort it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and signcs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponser is element element is an electorolice drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium and potassium the electrolytes but no sugar having adequate electrolites is absolute critical to seller function in particular the function of nurons in or for your nurons to function properly you need electrolytes in your system and you need to be well hydrated there is a lot of research to support the fact that if you are even mildly dehydrated that your cognition suffers your physical performance suffers and your sleep can also suffer getting adequate electrolytes and hydration as key and element allows you to do that i typically mix element into sixteen to thirty two ounces of water and drink that first thing in the morning i'l also drink another one during exercise and sometimes another one afteor exercise as well especiallif i've been sweating a lot or its a particularly hot day if you to try element you can go to drink element doc com slash hubermen and that spelled el m nd t doccom slash hubermen and you can claim a free sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doccom slash hubermen to claim a free sample pack day's episode is also brought to us by helick sleep helick sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are the absolute highest quality i've talk many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance and i say that because when we are not sleeping well or enough all of those things suffer conversly when we are sleeping well and we are sleeping enough all of those things improve one of the key elements to getting a great night's sleep is to have the proper mattress helicks mattresses are different because they are customize to your unique sleep needs if you go to their website and take a brief two minute quiz they will match you to a mattress that is ideal for your sleep needs the quiz ask questions such as you sleep on your back your side your stomach perhaps you do not know that is fine too whore d you ten to run hot or coald during the night things of that sort that allow them to math you to a mattress that will give you the best possible nights sleep i've start to sleeping on a helicks mattress a few years ago and it is vastly improve my sleep if you are interested in upgrating your mattress you can go to helick sleep dock calm slash hubermen to take that two minute sleep quizz and the will match you to a customized mattres can also get up to three hundre fifty dollars off any mattress order and two free pillows again if you'r interested you can go to helick sleep dock cam slash hubermen for up to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows let us talk about tools to improve your fitness before we do that however i just one of briefly remind everybody what constitutes a core or a foundational fitness program now what i'm about to describe is not for the astly that is trying to just improve one aspect of fitness or sportsperformance for instance if you are a power lifter and your maingoal is to move more weight on the core power lifting movements or if you are somebody training for a marithon it is likely that your cor fitness program will differ substantially from what i'm about to describe however the vast majority of you are almost certainly trying to have some level of cardiovascular fitness the ability perhaps to run a mile or more certainly to be able to walk up a flight of stairs with out getting winded you almost certainly want some degree of strength the ability yo to perhaps pick up a havy load of grocereason carry it in one arm as you carry something else in the other arm you want the ability to help move furniture you want the ability certainly to not injure yourself when performing daily tasks and perhaps you also want to be able to go out and play a pick up gameo basket ball or socker or to go out on a long height with the family without feeling sore that you have to rest in bed the next day an optimal fitness programm of the sort that was covered in the optimal fitness protocalls episode that i did is therefore one that checks off the major boxes that sise tells us are important for hell span and for life spand and that can also help us improve various aspects of performance and improve various aspects of esthetics whether it is fat loss or muscele growth if we choose without going into that programm in a lot of detail the cor elements of it are that it include at least a hundred and fifty minutes and ideally more two hundred minutes per week af called zone to cardio i'll talk a litle bit more about zone to cardio lobit later in the episode but zone to cardio is for those of either do not know the type of cardiof ascular exercise that you can do while maintaining a conversation without getting winded but that if you were to push a little bit harder that you would find it hard to complete your sentences in general zone to cardio is the sort that you can do while purely nazal breathing unless you need to talk of course as perfectly find o talk while doing zone too cardio and again the scientific research tells us that we should all be getting at least a hundred nd fifty minutes and probably more two hundred minutes of zone too cardio per week now in addition to that a foundational or optimal fitness programm for most people is going to include anywhere from two to four cardy of ascular training sessions that are separate that is right separate from the zone too cardio as well as two to four resistance or straingth training sometimes also aimed at hypertrophy or muscele growth training sessions now we have to ign nowledge that most people are probably not going to hit the upper threshold of all of those three things most people simply do not have the time and or discipline to get two hundred minutes of zone two cardio per week plus for resistance training sessions plus four carty ovascular training sessions that are separate from the zon two cardio as a consequence the optimal fitness programm that i described in that episode and by the way it is the program that i've essentially followed for the last thirty years or more includes three cary ovascular training sessions one longer duration sor typical endurance type training this wo be a long slow jog or along hike one day per week as well as a shorter carty ofvascular training session of about twenty five to thirty minutes moving a bit faster getting the hart raghe up a bit more breathing a little bit harder as well as one very short cardiovascular training session that would fall under the category of high intensy interval training things sprints which do not necessarily have to be done running coul be done on a rower could be done on a bike et cetera three carty ofvascular training sessions as well as three resistance training sessions i want to acknowledge that resistance training can be done with body weight can e done with weights with machines i talked about the differing virtues of one approach verses another but none the less three resistance training sessions one focussing specifically on leg training one focus specifically on torso training that is right che sholders and back altogether as well as some neck training for important reasons that were mentioned in that episode and then a third session that was aimed at somewhat smaller body parts bisepts trisepts calves and some other small body parts that ten to be neglected and that are important to train if one wants to encourage muscular balance both esthetically and structurely to avoid injury and have excellent posture those were the cor elements of that foundational fitness programm and i mention then and i'll mention again now that that programm is not a mandate it is not an absolute requirement for any one to follow it was simply meant as a templet from which people could avaluate their own existing fitness programme perhaps modify it somewhat or a lot or if you were interested in trying that specific fitness programme that you could do that and we have provided a link both to that episode in the shonote captions but we have also provided a link to a table or chart the describes that foundational fitness programme it provides examples of different cardivascular training and resistance tygpe training sessions and it describe some poetential exercises in the rational for those exercises and the rational for selecting particular repetition ranges and rest between sets all that information is available completely zero cost you do not yeve need to sign up for anything you simply go to the linkth that we provided in the shownote captions and there is a downloatable bhe di f there for you to explore now in addition to the solo episode that i did about optimal fitness protocals we did a six episode gueft series with doctor andy galpan who is a professor of physiology at calstate fillerton in a world expert in all aspects of exercise and muscle physiology that episode described a lot of the science and in particular science back tools for improving everything from long distance endurance to anerobit capacity strength hypertrophy speed power recovery neutrition supplementation and ways to develop a yearlong programm that will insure you on going prograss in that series doctor andy galpan provided an enormous amount of valuable information such that any one and everyone meaning the person who is just interested in starting a fitness programme or improving their existing fitness programme or the elete athlete whose interested in improving their springtimes or their jump height or their power lifting or their marithon time could clearly benefit from some are all of the protocals that he dess cribed now because that series is extensive in terms of its depth and breath again providing much value at zero cost thanks to doctor andy galpan's expertiece but it thes s ame time because it might be a little bit intimidating for many people out there to try and figure out which protocals to incorporate into their existing fitness regimen i thought it'l be fun and very beneficial to talk about some of the key tools that were described throughout that series that one could consider incorporating into their existing fitness routine now that is what this episode is really about it is about the tools that i personally glean from those discussions and that ive found to be of tremendous value in improving both my cardyovascular fitness my strength and hypertrophy training my recovery and other aspects of my over all fitness protocals and when i say beneficial i mean in terms of improving my cardio ascular fitness improving my strength and hypertrophy training and that have improved the various metrics of fitness life span and health span which include things heartra veriability resting heartrate blood pressure the otoo macs as well as some of the fitness matrics that were described during that episode series with doctor andy galpin such as performance metrics the ability to jump a certain distance the ability to run a certain speed or to run a certain distance at a given speed the ability to move waights in good form for certain number of repetitions again all of the matricks of performance and health are going to very tremendously from person to person depending on where your starting how long you been training and other aspects of your health the tools described in to day's episode are designed for everybody again these are simple tools that you can put into your existing routine that should really move the needle forward in terms of improving your overall levels of fitness and health oce let us talk about the tools to improve your fitness the first tool is to mesh your zone to cardio with your daily activities for those of you that do not know zone to cardio is the type of movement that we typically call cardio exercise that elevates your heartraht somewhat increases your breathing somewhat but that still allows you to carry out a conversation without having to paus or to gasp in order to complete your sentenc es that is a general rule of thumb for zone to cardio now for those of you that you'se a fitness tracer you can monitor whether not you are in zone to cardio very precisely but if you are me and you do not use a fitness tracker it is very easy to know if you are in zone to cardio because again it is that level of output that puts you right below or somewhat below the threshold where if you were to exert yourself with any more intensity that you would not be able to complete your sentences ow this could of course be evaluated by jogging with some one or walking with some one or hiking with someone and carrying out a conversation if somebody is not available you could of course do this by trying to speak out loud and have a conversation with yourself or if you want another way to monitor whether not you are n one to cardio without having a use a fitness tracker you could simply ask yourself whethe or not you are maintaining a level of output that increases your heartrate in your breathing but that allows you to maintain purely nazal breathing the entire time any of those approaches will tell you more or less whether not you are inzone to cardio now the scientific data tell us that we should all be getting anywhere from a hundred ad fifty minutes to two hundred minutes per weak minimum of zone to cardio forsake of carty of askcular health cerebrovascular health and a number of other aspects of health that are important essentially to everybody for healtspan and life span now many people including myselth schedule zone to cardio into their weakly fitness regiment for me i have one day a week for me it falls on a sunday where i go out for a jog that lasts anywhere from sixty minutes to ninety minutes it is a slow jog i can maintain nasal breathing the entire time or have a conversation with somebody else or myself the entire time if i or sometimes it consists of a heike by myself or with other people and sometimes those heikhs extend anywhere from an hour to four hours depending on the circumstances et cetera i will mention that wheneve r possible i try and do that once a week zone to cardiosession out of doors because i being in nature and i getting someligkt and i getting fresh air now during the discussion with doctor andy galopin i explained how i get my zone to cardio and i acknowledge that that once a week session does not always allow me to reach that hundred and fifty minute to two hundred minute minimum threshold of zone to cardio per week sometimes it does sometimes it does not and his response to that was very reassuring what he said was look if you want a schedul zone to cardio and had out for a long sunday jog or hike terrific if you want to schedule zone to cardio as two or more sessions on the tredmill or on the bike great but that he does not actually think of zone to cardio as exercise at all and to that i gasp and then i was a little bit deflated i thought on greatlyim doing all this zone to cardio and yo only man consider that exercise and then what he said it was very reassuring and i think it is going to be very reassuring to all of you he said first of all one to cardio is absolutely critical to our health for a number of reasons that i already mentioned but in addition to that zone to cardio does not impede and in fact can inhance our other aspects of fitness for example our strength training our hypertrophy training or any type of speed work or other types of cardiovascular training one might do and that the best way to get zone to cardio is o k if you want a schedulite schedulate as a session but that to simply increase the amount of walking and in particular walking at a rapid pace that one does and to increase the total amount of movement that one's getting throughout the week taking groceries in and out of the grocery store running round with the kids taking a walk with a co worker while having a work discussion taking yourecalls for work while pacing in the office or going outside what he imprest on me is that zone to cardio can be mashed throughout the daily activities that i and everybody else gene nly have to do and this was of great relief to me because i as many of you are an extremely busy i do not have time to schedulein more cardio per week or at least i do not see the way i could o that without reducing the amount of sleep that i'm getting or without reducing the amount of social connection that i'm gettng with family and friends both of which are extremely important to our mental health and physical health the basage tool here is yes get two hundred minutes per week minimum of zone to cardio ad knows i said two hundred mentes not a hundred fifty minutes to two hundredments i'm an a set the higher threshold of two hundred minutes per week minimum of zone to cardio but that you do not need to schedule that as time on the treadmell if you want to great but what was communicated to me from doctor anty galpin is that zone to cardio is immensely beneficial it is not going to impede and in fact it is going to improve other aspects of fitness and that it does not ave to impede and it d in fact can improve other aspects of our daily life our ability to engage socially our ability to have a great out put at work in whatever type of work you do the message very simple get two hundred minutes or more o zon to cardio per week and the messages also a very reassuring one which is that that zone to cardio can be spread throughout your daily activities and that if you are doing enough of it you probably do not even have to count the total amount of zon to cardio that you are getting if you simply make the effort to move around a lot more during your daily activities and to mesh that zone to cardio with your daily activities you are going to hit that threshold of two hundred minutes per week minimum now that is a great message for me because i'm already doing the three resistance training workouts per week i'm doing what now i can just call the two other cardyofascular training workouts per week because now i do not even count that long sunday jog or sunday height as exercise i just consider that movement out of doors on the week end and in doing it is also allowed me to really enjoy that a lot more there is something about considering something a fitness training programm that shifts it from just recreation and enjoying life to training and i of course love training i love training in the gim and i love training out of doors i love running i love lifting weights i love all sorts of physical training i know many people do i know many people do not but if one looks at zone to cardio as just part of their daily life you are far more likely to get that zone to cardio in and all the benefits that come with it and you are also opening up time for work for social engagements and to do and pay attention to other aspects of fitness which is what we are goingto talk about next the second tool that i've incorporated into my fitness regimen and that i believe can be of great benefit to frankly everybody is to start including low repetition pure strength work now some of you may already be doing low repetition pure strength work but i believe that most people do not most people who do resistance training are using either machines or free weights or some combination of those or perhaps are using body weight and they tend to focus on repetition ranges from about five and usually more six repetitions out to about ten and perhaps fifteen repetitions now of course doing resistance training in repetition ranges of five to fifteen repts per set provided it is done at suffitiont intensity either to failure or close to failure of course in good form is tremendously beneficial it can help build strength it can enhance hipertrophy there is tremendous value to training in those repetition ranges but when i sat down with doctor andi galopin to discuss resistance training specifically he made it very clear that at least for some portion of one's yearly training cycle perhaps eight weeks or ten weeks work in the case that i adopt it twelve weeks there is tremendous benefit to training in the three to five repetiion range and may be even lower the second tool of training specifically for strai gth and this three to five repetition range is something that i started to incorporate after i sat down to record that series and i'll just tell you a few of the benefits that i've experienced and then i'll tell you the specific protocol that makes it very easy to do this the most obvious benefit to me was that i got much stronger and that that strength persisted such that when i went back to using higher repetition ranges typically i trained with weights or machines in that six to ten repetition range sometimes a little higher sometimes a little lower but never before had i specifically trained in the three to five repetiion range exclusively for a period of ten to twelve weeks and when i did that i of course gained strength but that strength stayed with me such that when i returned to hirer repetition ranges i could use more weigh in good form and that of course enhancs strength and hypertrofeet further in addition there was another effect that was at least to me very unexpected which was that my cardyof vascular training improve significantly now why would this be because typically a three to five repetition set does not elevate the hart rate for long enough that you would consider cart vascular training and of course the rest periods between those sets is pretty long as well even of hartrate goes up during those heavy sets it is going to go down during those long three to five minute rest periods between those sets but what i noticed was that my over all posture and my ability to maintain cart ovascular output while using good running form or good rowing form was also vastly improved and the logical interpretation why that would be is simply that the muscles got stronger and those same muscles are being incorporated into the carty ovascular let us call it endurance work that i'm doing on other days and therefore i can carry out those carty ovascular training sessions in better form for longer periods of time actually felt much stronger during my carty ovascular training as i got much stronger moving these heavier weight loads for low repetition sets and then the third specific benefit that i noticed is that when training heavy for three to five repetition per set i did not get sore and this to me was an incredible benefit because typically when i train in the six repetition to fifteen repetition range and i take those sets to failure or near failure i do experience some soreness the next day ordinarily that soreness is not intende that it prevents me from doing any of the other sorts of workouts that i do and for those of you that have visited that foundational fitness protocol that i hit each major and minor muscle group once per week directly as well as once per week indirectly that is the over all structure of that program in order to allow sufficient recovery between those resistance training workouts to be able to make continual progress now by training in this three to five repetition range that doctor andigalopon suggested i was able to improve my strength im prove my cartivascular output reduce soreness ia'lso just felt better over all i had a lot more energy after those workouts than i typically do after my resistance training sessions when i use higher repetition ranges or just a number of different things that made me feel wow this is really a powerful protocol and of course moving heavier weights in the gim feelds good too it feels good to get stronger at least there is a positivey back there for me and i think for most people and i should also mention that for those of you that are averse to doing heavier resistance training in the three to five repetition range because you fear that it will make you too big or too bulky training i the low repetition ranges is actually more gear towards increasing strength and is shifting away somewhat from increasing hypertrophy or muscle size that is a great benefit for those of you that want to be strong and also want to maintain cartyov ascular fitness but you do not want to add muscular size and of course for all you that want to add muscular size it is well establish that increasing your strength will allow you than to return to patterns of hypertrophy training thatwil allow you to use hav your weights and therefore induce greater hypertrophy there are owe many reasons to incorporate these strength training protocols the way that doctor andy galpins suggested one do it and s the way t i did it its use as three by five protocol the three byve five protocol is very straight forward it involves doing three to five exercises per work out noc if it is to work out for legs three to five exercises if it is o work out for some upper body muscle three to five exercises three to five exercises for three to five sets per exercise three to five repetitions per set and three to five minutes of rest between each set in addition he emphasized that one can do those work out three to five times per week although i'm going to put in astricts next to that last statement because i found that i could not do the three bye five protocall say for legs specifically three to five times per week i realize that might be possible for some people but i'm somebody who many of you out there either does not have the time or does not have the recovery capacity to train my legs three to five times per week even though i acknowledge that there are probably ways to do that would that would still allow me to recover it just simply start you impede into other areas of training it starts to impede other areas of life work and family and sleep and all the rest what i did and what i'm suggesting you try is for any existing resistance training that you are doing to take a period of eight or ten or ideally twelve weeks and do the vast majority if not all of that resistance training in the lower repetition range that is designed specifically to induce strength adaptations and to not pay attention to whetheror not you are hitting that same muscle group three to five times per week rather if you train your legs once or twice per week to simply do all of the work for your legs in that three to five repetition range if you train an upper body muscle or muscle groups chest shoulders back once per week or twice per week to just stay within that three to fi ve repetition range for those work sets right warm ups can include a few more repts and then to adhere to this three to five exercises three to five sets per exercise three to five repetitions perset and three to five minutes between sets now the one exception to this that i incorporated was that for very small muscle group for instance the rear deltois or for neck work or for calf work to not rely purely on three to five repetitions but maybe to work in a range of anywhere from five to eight repetitions still fairly low repetitions but not low that it restricts you to three to five repetitions the reason for that is that i and i think a lot of people out there find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions however for big compound movements presses and squats and dead lifts and glut hamraises and things of that sort maybe even extensions and leg curls which are isolation exercises of course to really restrict oneself to those three to five repetition ranges that take you two failure or near failure i listed off the benefits of doing that that i experienced and i'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits just remind you hat some of those benefits are you get stronger which feels great that occurs within your weight work outs but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions i also noticed that when returning to higher repetitions for resistance training after twelve weeks shifting away from three to five repetition ranges and going back to training in the six to ten repetition ranges mainly occasionally up to twelve or fifteen but really mainly restricting to six to ten repetitions that you can move much have your waights in good form and thereby induce more hypeortrophe while still also continuing to gain some strength and another benefit was again reduce soreness compared to when training with higher repetition ranges and more mental freshness as i guess the only way to describe it when training in those lower repetition ranges i doft kno about you but when i finish a really hard hour long resistance training session done in the six to twelve repetition range there is a certain type of mental fatigue that even if i eat properly afterwards even if a hydrate properly that it tends o sap a bit of my mental energy later in the day but that the training at the three to five repetition range did just the opposite it actually enhanced my focus in my cognition my over all levels of physical energy which is great because it allows you to do all the other things that were require to do throughout the day and by the way itould also allow you to get more of that zone too cardio if you want more details on the three by five protocol again that is time stamped in the relevant episode on strength and hypertrophy that we did with doctor andy galopin i'll also provide a link to that specific timestamp in the shownote caption to this episode do want a point out that you do not just jump right into heavy sets of three to five repetitions you need to warm up adequately for some people that warm up we will be higher repetition set say ten to twelve repetitions with just the empty bar or a light wight and the atting low bit aweight in doing eight repetitions and maybe six repetitions and then you are work sets as they are call the three to five repetitions or perhaps you are me and you prefer to do low repetition warm up this was also something that i discussed with doctor andy galpin and that for me has made a tremendous posiive impact on all my resistance training regardless of whether not it is low repetition or higher repetition and that is to do a brief warm upset that is t somewhere in the range of six to eight repetitions very light just to get familiar with the movement than to do a second warm upset that include some load on the bar or the freeweight or the machine and then a second warm upset gand this can be freeweights or machines that it corbrates a bit more load but still keeps the repetitions low in the four to six repetiion range and then maybe especiall if it is a the beginning of the work out and my corbody temperature is not elevated yet i'll do a third warm up but that third warm up which of course is going to be progressively a little bit heavier than the first or second warm up is still going to fall within the low repetition range just two to four repetitions for me including e few more warm up sets with progressively heavier weight on each warm up but still keeping the total repetition count low somewhere in the range of two to six repetitions has been very beneficial for improving my work output during the called work sets regardless of whether not i'm training in the three to five repetition range or whether not i'm training in the six to fifteen repetition range i know for some people this might be kind of surprising how is it that my work sets are actually higher repetition than my warm upsets or put differently how and why is it that my warm upsets are lower repetition than my work sets and that is because i fall into this category of people that tends to fatigue pretty quickly when doing resistance training for me keeping the repetition count on any individual warm upset pretty low has allowed me to really improve my strength output and really improve my straength and hyperturofe training when i shift to the called work sets i already listed off a number of important documented benefits and benefits that i've certainly experience by incorporating low repetition pure strength work in to my yearly training cycle for periods of eight to twelve weeks in addition to that during my conversation with doctor ainto galopand he said something very important for everyone to hear and understand he said when you look at the data on aging and performance in particular muscular performance you see some very interesting patterns within the data he said for instance that for every year after age forty there is a one per cent drop in muscle size that can be offset by resistance training but that if you do not do resistance training that you will not offset and during that series we also talked about the minimum requirement for six and probably more ten working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size not just age forty in beyond but even at younger ages caye that is muscle size one per cent decrease per year unless you do the right thing and the right thing is get six to ten working sets per week in order to offset that decrease and if you train properly for hypertrophy yes you can still increase muscle size past age forty in addition he said that there is a three to five per cent reduction per year for every year past age forty in strength and power now that is a very important metric because what it is telling us is that the drop off in strength and power is significantly greater per each year after age forty then is the decrease in muscle size telling us that we have to do something to offset that decrease in strength and power in addition he mentioned that for every year past age forty there is an eight to ten per cent decrease in speed and in explosiveness and if one is interested in maintaining speed of muscular movement and explosiveness of muscular movement something that is perhaps important to a number of you one also as to incorporate training specifically gear toward maintaining or improving speed and explosiveness now i many people are not interested in speed an explosiveness i know they have their utility but i am interested in maintaining muscle size over the course of my life perhaps even adding some muscele to particular muscle groups i'm also very interested in at least maintaining and ideally even gaining some strength in certain muscle groups throughout my entire life span and that is not just for performance reasons that is also because we know that maintaining or improving strength of our muscles is very important across the entire life span but especially in the years spanning from forty until death which i think for must by will fall somewhere between fifty sixty seventy or ideally out into the eighties nineties or hundreds that is what we are all seeking is to die later in better health and in order to do that we have to dedicate some very specific training protocols in order to maintain or build strength to sunrise in addition to all the positive reasons to do dedicate its straingth training that i mention before it is highly recommended that you do some dedicade strainh training for the purposeis of offsetting the age related to cline in strangth that occurs agan three to five per cent per year past age forty which is a pretty significant decline but the good news is if you do the three to five protocol for say twelve weeks per year and then you continue to resistance train using other repetition ranges gur tords hypertrophy and strength or perhaps even muscular endurance the good news is you will maintain your strength and perhaps even build your strength offsetting that natural decrease that would otherwise occur i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitement mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs i've been taking athletic grens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by gup microbioda that communicate with the brain the mun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiotics and athletic grens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste ript if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemend three c too again that is at let it green stock calm slash huberman to get the fivfry travelpacks and the year supply of vitemindy three k to the next tool him about to describe relates to your cardyovascular training and it is a tool that can greatly improve your cardtyofvascular fitness with a limited amount of time commitment bthat is not to say it is easy what i'm referring to is the called sugar cane if you listen to the series with doctor andy galpin you may recall our discussion about the sugar cane which is named after our friend and expert trainer kenny cane and it is a very efficient yet somewhat brutal way to increase your cartyofvascular output the sugar cane is the type of protocal that you would incorporate once in the period of a week but certainly not every week it is the kind of thing that you might throw in once every two weeks or once every four weeks as a replacement for your other high intensity interval training the sugar cane involves selecting some form of exercise that you can do at high intensity safely that of course will differ between individuals for some of you it will be a stationary bike for others of you it will be a road bike for others of youl be running and for others of you it will be rowing the exact form of exercise is not important what is important is that you can generate a lot of intensity youre going to be doing some sprint work although not all out sprints except on the final round i'll explain where all this is going in a moment but again you need to select a movement that you can do without injuring yourself while still performing a movement at high intensity for me that woild be running for you it might be something else the sugar cane is pretty straightforward in structure it involves three rounds after a brief warm up of course see can to do three to five ments of jogging or jumping jacks or skipping rope something to get your corbody temperature up that you are prepared to do the high intensity work and then there are only three rounds of high intensity work and they go as the following in round one you are going to take two minutes you will need to set a timer for two minutes and you are going to go the maximum distance that you can in that two minutes run the maximum distancethat you an for two minutes or cycle the maximum distance that you can for two minutes where verse a climber the maximum distancethat you can for two minutes whatever you select you are going to do that as far and as fast as you can for the duration of two minutes depending on the movement and depending on your level of fitness that distance might be four hundred meters six hundred meters eight hundred meters et cetera whatever distance you travel in that two minutes you are going to mark that distance down in your mind or in your phone or on a piece of paper and then you are going to rest two minutes two minutes a work then rest two minutes then in round two you are going to go the same distance that you did in round one and you are going to take as much time as you need to do that distance as fast as you can if you went six hundred meters in two minutes for round one in round two you are going to go six hundred meters and it is going to take you however long it takes you chances are if you really did the best you could in round one you are at maximum output for the first two mnutes that in round two it is going to take you longer than two minutes to travel that equivalent distance however there is the possibility that it will take you less time but for most people it is going to take you more time stayng with his example of six hundred meters in two minutes on round one in round two youre going to go six hundred meters let us say it takes you two minutes and thirty secones you then are going to mark down how long round two took you in this case the example is two minutes and thirty secontes then you are going to rest another two minutes and then in round three you are going two go all out again as fast and as safely as y ou can for the same duration that you did in round two and your goal is to go at least as far as you went in round ne and if there is still time left you are going to continue to go all out again as fast as you safely can until the entire duration is completed it is really just three rounds with two rest periods in between round one and round three and then i highly recommend the after round three that you do some sort of dedicated cool down instead of just flopping on to the bench are the floor of the one that you walk around slowly until you recover your breathing the reason i the sugar cane as a tool that one implements once every say two to four weeks as a replacement for one's typical high intensthe interval training is several fold first of all if you provide the right intensity in round one and round to and round three it is sure to elevate your heart rate substantially and in doing improve your view two macks which is correlated with all sorts of important metrics related to health spand performance and life span second of all it gamafise things a little bit it pits you against yourself in the sense that if you go out at maximum speed again performing a movement that you can safely perform at maximum speed in round one well then you have something to compete against in round two and round three and that makes the high intensthe interval training first of all very intense but also it makes it kind of fun in a way that lets you forget just how painful the whole thing is the next tool to improve your fitness is called exercise snaks and as the name suggests this is a fun one and was suggested by doctor andi galoping as a way to either inhants or maintain your fitness depending on how your core or foundational fitness program is going s when i say core i do not mean your abs i mean whether not you are getting your regular cardio in your regular resistance training if you were to add one or several of these exercise snacks per week it can further improve things vio to maks muscular endurant ts et cetera i'll talk about the specific snacks that you will be doing in a moment however as doctor any galopand also pointed out there are times in which we happen to not be following our foundational fitness program either because work demands or family demands or re traveling were simply not keeping up with our basic routine and under those conditions exercise snacks are a terrific way to maintain the fitness that you have already built and developed and you do not lose any ground in a week say where you get particularly busy now exercise snacks can take on a variety of different forms but for sake of simplicity and clarity to day we are going to divide them into two major categories the first category are exercise snacks that are going to improve or maintain your carty of ascular fitness your ability to run or cycle or row some distant say twelve minutes or longer ocay but keep in mind these exercise snacks are very very brief they do not require that you do them for twelve minutes or longer what they are going to do is either maintain or inhance the type of endurance that allows you to continue in an activity for twelve minutes or longer the second category of exercise snack relates to muscular endurance muscular endurance is a very important aspect of fitness and even those some people are already training for muscular endurance its something that most people are not doing enough training for muscular endurance is your ability say to maintain a wallsit or to maintain a plank or to do the maximum number of pushups that you can do in once saction the sort of u no drop to the floor and give me as many pushups as you possibly can type of thing or as many situps as you can type of thing muscular endurance translates to a number of other aspects of fitness and it is something that we should all be working on and again many people just do not make space for it in their regular routine now we have these two categories of exercise snacks one gear towart enhancing or maintaining your carty of ascular fitness as it translates to longer duration endurance activity twelve minutes or longer and then the other category is purely muscular endurance which is essentially some bout of exercise that is going to be fairly brief anywhere from a minute to two minutes but certainly less than twelve minutes okas let me give you an example of an exercise snack for enhancing your long duration endurance twelve minutes or longer and this is the sort of thing that if you are going to incorporate intor routine and a highly recommend that you do can essentially be done any time with no warm up a good example of an exercise snack of this type would be to suddenly stand up from your desk and to do a hundred jumping jacks now depending on how fit you are and how fast you do those jumping jacks and how wide and tall you do those jumping jacks meaning ou are you oing these kind of little things where your hands ston'e actually meet n you are hand parting your legs just a little bit or you doing full jumping jacks are really jumping and a setting your feet outs as wide as you comfortably and safely can and bring your hands together it could take you anywhere from thirty saconds to ninety seconds ocaye in the case of jumping jacks you maynd upt doing this for ninety seconds but the point is to simply do a hundred jumping jacks or if that takes too long you couln even do just twenty five or fifty jumping jacks the point is that it is going to get you moving your muscles it is going to get your heart rate up even if you are very very fit if you are doing these fast enough and you are doing them with proper form it is going to get your heart reight up and then you are done you can set thack down to your desk or you can continue ot to walk through the airport yes i've done these in the airport typically not while walking toward my gat but at the gate but occasionally i'm feeling lethar jake or i have not have the opportunity to train that day and perhaps i will not get the opportunity to train i'll do something a hundred jumping jacks while you will facing the window i'm it feels a less awkward facing people while you are doing them and of courseyou do not have to do jumping jacks and equally effective type of exercise snack is to find a starewell and to simply go up that starewell as fast as you safely can for twenty to thirty seconds perhaps just find the bottom of a starewell and go up that starewell as quick ly as you can and perhaps go down as quickly as you can and just keep doing that for about twenty to forty seconds and then you are ssentially done you could also op to pick some distance away from your car in the parking lot insume you are not carrying any heavy bags or anything and simply run to your car twenty to thirty seconds of not inassurely all out sprinting you do not wan to injure yourself because again this is done without a warm up these exercise snacks are design to be inserted into your day and into your weak essentially at random you could plan them if you want but any time you feel inspired or perhaps any time your feeling you do not want to do one you could simply do one of these exercise snacks and of course doing jumping jacks or running to your car or taking the stairs very quickly up and down or just up and then walking down for instance ind doing a feu jumping jacks things of that sort of course can take on a near infinite number of different variations if you do not any of the variations that i just presented you can easily come up with something else againd the purpose of these exercise snacks is to get your heart raded up it is of course to do this while not getting injured and it is entirely compatible with an existing exercise programm it in no way is going to impede your performance in strength or hypertrophy or other forms of long form endurance or hig intensy interval training quite to the contrary everything we know about these exercise snacks is that they enhance various aspects of your physiology in ways that promote both recovery and performance in your other types of exercise and you'r other types of athletic endeavors no reason to think that they are going to be problematic for your training but of course do not trip do not fall do not undertake a movement that puts you into a range of motion that has you hurting your back your knee or any other part of your body yo start off slowly and find somethn that really works for you these are very easy they take very little time they are fun to be honest and as was discussed i n the conversation with doctor anty galpan they are also very effective the second category of exercise snack are the exercise snacks hat enhance muscular endurance muscular endurance is the type of endurance that allows you to maintain a fixed position for some period of time usually somewhere between one and three minutes but these endurance abouts are never going to last twelve or more minute unless you are exceptionally evolved in terms of your muscular endurance abilities what iam talking about here or things planks wallsits maximum number of push ups things of that sort and this is an aspect of fitness that translates to other aspects of fitness in a very important way and again this was covered in the exercise series of doctor andy galpin i doft want to gointo any of the details now because it was all covered there it is very easy to look up because its time stamped but just in brief muscular endurance allows the build up of more microvascular supply to muscles and connective tissue in a way that allows delivery and removal of more neutriance and waste products now i realized to the physiose things nutriance in waste products as far too broughd a category but what were tilg yu it hears the ability to deliver more fuel and oxygen and to remove waste products of muscular effort or to be more specific nurro muscular effort this is a great thing because it can help you in hance your strength training an hans your hypertrefy training and hanceyure long distance endurance and your middle distance and even your short distance endurance and these exercise snacks for building muscular endurances are exceedingly easy to do and you can even do them while talking on the phone especilly if your using head phones or if you have your phone on speaker a good example of an exercise snack for muscular endurance would be a thirty to sixty second or perhaps longer wallsit remember walsits walsits are as the names suggests where you put your feet out some distance from a wall youe squat down into a seeted position but there is no chair there and then you maintain that seated position and that is harder to do over time a you could lean back against the wall of harder if you wanted to gain some extra support and continue but the idea here is that you are going to go not ncessarily to muscular failure but to the point where you cannot continue to sit in that wallset position ou culd also simply do this as an air squat down to the bottom position where you are comfortable and then you do not want to rest down there mean you want to maintain some tension and your quadruceps and other muscles of your lower body that you are actively trying to support yourself in the seated position but without a seat below you that can be done again while on a speakerphone conversation that can be done at random throughout the day you can just decido cam n to a wallsit now andi'm n a time myself i'm to see how long i can do this for or you could decide to do a plank i've done this wll on a phone call sarry if it was you that i was talking to but i but the phonon speaker and just gotten into a plank position and then ill just have the conversation in the plank position i do not fight to maintain that plank position pass the point where i could continue ove a conversation again this is a type of exercise that one is trying to incorporate into their daily routine if you wanted to dedicate a specific ommount of time just to doing these exercise snacks you could but it is far more reasonable to assume that people will incorporate these into their daily routine more regularly if you can incorporate it truly into the other aspects of your routine work you do this whell watching tevy or listening to a podcast one form of muscular endurance exercise snack that is really terrific and is a bit of a challenge that is fun is to just simply see how many push ups you can do and we talked about proper push up form during the episode series with doctor any gallping but hear what we are talking about is chest all the way to the ground it touches the ground then pushing up till your arms are completely straight that is one push up and then continuing in piston fashion meaning ou're not pausing at the top and taking a bunch of breaths are youre not going to a plank position in other words but continuing to do as many pushups as you can to see whether not you can enhance that number over time and in any case just ast simply get your body working to engage the muscles of your chest your shoulders youre tricepts and your core et cetera a and to do that every once in a while instead of needing somebody say drop and give me twenty just see whether or not some point any point throughout the day and get into push up position to your maximum number pushops and just mentally note that number to yourself again these exercise snacks serve multiple rolls theire design to get you moving to get your heart reight going to maintain or enhance your fitness in other domains of fitness and this is very important to not take too much time out of your schadual in fact zone to cardio right being the type of movement that you are just going to do a lot throughout the week caring groceries et cetera as we discussed earlier these exercise snacks are design to be incorporated into your daily life and i must say that having started doing these after recording the series with doctor andy galopin i've noticed two things first of all including these exercise snacks at least once a week and more three to five times a week for me s that is one exercise snack done three to five times per week has definitely correlated with improvements in my fitness in other domains of fitness strength hypertrophy long distance endurance et cetera now i've changed a number of other things as well as a consequence of that series with doctor andy galop and i cannot say for sure that it is the exercise snacks per say that are causing all those positive shifts have to imagine that it is not just the exercise snacks but they have become an important part of my routine and that relates to the second point which is that the exercise snacks are design to be fun and easy and i really enjoyed doing them much that if i do not do one for a couple of days a start to crave them a lbit canalice the other kind of snack the next category of tool to improve your fitness relates to breathing or respiration breathing in respiration is an enormous topic in anof itself in fact i did entire episode on breathing and respiration and this is a topic that my laboratory works on extensively as it relates to anxiety control and some other aspects of mental health as well as to physical performance for to day's discussion i wanted just review a few tools that one can incorporate both into work out ts and around work outs that can greatly inhance fitness and recovery the first one is the type of respiration tool that you use between sets of exercise again here weare talking about resistance training but we could just as easily be talking about rest between rounds of say high intensy interval training for instance between bouts of sprinting on the track or the biker the treadmiller the rower a great pattern of breathing to incorporate during rest between sets is something that i've talked about before in other contects which is the physiological sie the physiological size is a deep inhal through the nose to maximily or near maximally inflate your lungs and then a second very brief inhal and it is necessarily brief cause your lungs are already breefull to maximiliinflate your lungs and to make sure that any of the little saxill aviably of your lungsthad hove collapsed during the exercise exertion will reinflate and then a long exhail until lungs empty si'll demonstrate it right now as i've done many times before but if you have not seen it or heard it before it is two inhals followed by an extended exhaile in it goes this you will notice that the inhals were through the nose and the exhale was through the mouth that is the ideal way to do it for a number of reasons check out the episode that i did on respiration physiology a a breathing if you want more details on why that is but two inhales through the nose and a long extended exhaile through the mouth the caled physiological side not named by me but rather named by physiologists in the nineteen thirties is as far as we know the fastest way to shift your nervous system from called sympathetic drive to more pari sympathetic drive from a state of greater alertness to a state of greater calm now the reason to do this between sets of resistance training is that the more that you can shift yours lf from sympathetic drive to paris and pathetic drive that is from alert to calm in between sets the more energy and focus you can devote to exertion during your work sets it is to one way to do this that is very convenient and very effective is to consider the last repetition of your set a physiological sige bwhich is not to say ocan i want to be very clear which is not to say that you should do the physiological side during your set that in fact i recommend you do not do that but rather if youre doing six repetitions of a given exercise and you what is a fail on the six thore you do that six repetition andyou are just close to failure because again your workset should be too failure or close to it most of the time then set down the weight and then you are going to do the next repetition as the physiological size meaning you are not going to do the movement you are going to think of doing a physiological size as the last repetition of every set not juring the last repetition of the resistance training movement oqu the physiological size something you do at the beginning of the rest period immediately following a set if you' rather thing about it that way because it is more convenient than thinking about as the last rep of a set be my guest whatever works for you but what you will quickly find is that if you do a physiological side right after completing your last repetition you will calm down much more quickly your heartrate will come down more quickly and you will recover more completely in whatever designated rest period you have allowed yourself whether or not its thirty seconds which you be very short frankly or it is a five minute period of rest between sets if you do one truly just one physiological size the beginning of the rest perit you are going to effectively shift your nervous system in the direction you want it to go during those rest periods and of course of your training hard during your work sets you run zero risk whatsoever of feeling calm that you do not feell mot of ated to do your next set i promise you that it will allow you to relax more at the beginning of the rest period than you ordinarily would to shift into a state of rest iu theire differing opinions about whether not you should walk around or stay still during your rest periods i to walk around of it and stay standing i'm not one n these people ta ond of collapses into a sea shape on the bench and between sets i to stand up and you'n breath normally walk around dring lw water et cetera in any case doing a physiological sie the beginning of each rest interval between work sets of resistance training is a very effective way to enhance your focus and your output during your worksets now the last respiration tool to improve your fitness is again a tool glean from the discussion weth doctor ande galpin and that is to include a three to five minute period at the end of every single workout does not matter if its hintency interval training or its resistance training or it is a long run of some sort at the end of every workot to take three to five minutes youl want to set a timer and to do some form of paris sympathedic that is calming promoting breathing in order to shift your nervous system from a state of heightened alertness and output into a state of recovery because as you all well know by now you get fitter not during your work outs but rather after your work ots inbetween workouts you stimulate the adaptation during ae workout but you get the adaptation you get the actual improvement in between workouts and a common mistake that many people make and i made this mistake for years was to finish a great work out and then you 're your texting on your phone or you are talking on the phone you are driving home it certainly not as intense as the workout that you just did maybe you are even feeling really calm from a nice long jog or you had a particularlys good work out that day and your feeling really happy you are enjoying the high to speak well but when you do three to five minutes of what is often called down regulation breathing after a work out it allows you to recover and to induce the adaptation that you have been after the one that you actually train for much more quickly i cannot tell you how many people i know who start to incorporate this into their workouts find that they recover far better from their workouts which might seem a little bit surprising now i would it be that just three to five minutes of some activity would enhancs recovery to such a reat degree and that is because typically people do not book end their workouts they finish their workouts and of course they are not continuing to lift weights are run but they move about their day in their life even if it is preparing a meal in a way that the level of stress and therefore stress hormones things cortisall a drennalin things that by the way are excellent to elevate during the work out things inflammatory markers which by the way are great to in hance during a work out that actually happens during a work out you have a massive increase in inflammatory markers which might seem bad but all of those things are enhancing the adaptation that you are seeking but as soon as those workouts end you want to shift into recovery mode and this three to five minutes of down regulation breathing is a terrific way to do that their couple different patterns of breathing that will work best but all of them emphasize exhales can wonna repeat that all of them emphasize exhales for instance you could just choose slow deliberate breathing how does that emphasize exhales well ordinarily when we breathe we inhale actively and we exhale passively whenever we deliberately breathe more slowly we are actively exhaling active exhales wreathly promote the calming response in brain and body the other thing you could do which many people are now doing is to do a repeated round of physiological size the double inhale through the nose long exhale through the mouth but repeated foresay three minutes that is another version the other thing you cal do is simply to notice your exhales and to emphasize your exhales make them longer and more vigorous then you are inhales now you doft want to turn this into a breathwork session where you are youe doing proniamar cumdelini breathing or something of that sort the idea is to calm down any time you are extending your exhales your actively exhaling you are trying to slow your breathing down over all you are going to shift yourself in the right direction rather than complicate this type of tool the best thing ou can do is just focus on those exha ls slow your breathing over all use physiological size if you want or simply sit in your vehicle or if you have to drive home well doing this extended exhale type of down regulation ideally youwoud take a couple of minutes and to shift your whole system by not driving youn closing your eyes in jo sitting in your car stationary of course do not drive with your eyes closed or bike with your eyes closed just simply calm down extend your exhales and shift from the work out to the recovery mode which is where the progress is going to arrive i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood

tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off the next tools to improve your fitness are sichological tools and there really gear towart enhancing your focuss during your workout and separating or segmenting your workouts from the other parts of your day of course work outs are naturally segmented from the other parts of your day unless your running around all day long for you'r lifting weights or other heavy objects all day long but one of them wore attractive tools that was presented during the series with doctor galpan that i adopted and found to be really effective is this concept of the line the line is this concept that you have a physical location say at the entrance to a gim or at the start of your run or your biker may be it is around the stationary exercise divice it use for which once you cross that line you are all about business ey you are not socializing or at least not too much you do not wnt to be rude to people but youre really focuset on your workout this is especially effective on days when your little bit distracted or you did not sleep that well the night before may be and you got something going on in mine to your in an argument or your cited about something else but if you care about your fitness which i hope everyone does and your gol during any workout is to stimulate a particular type of physiological adaptation strength hypertrophy long distance thedurance et cetera and you also do not want to get injured that you coan continue to train for your entire life as regularly as possible the concept of the line is fantastic because what it does is it forces you to compartmentalize the portion of your life that comes before the work out and after the workout and also to really enjoy your workouts this is something that is not often discussed but nowadays with the advent of smart phones theres a lot of infultration of other types of communication and information while one is supposed to be exercising and our life has become far less compartmentalized then it used to be before the advent of smart phones owof course martphones are wonderful they provide all sorts of wonderful tools and benefits and of course i use one and i'll talk about to incorporate the smartphone a very specific way to enhance your workouts in just a moment but the idea of a line is you picka location it can change each work out but ideally it would be at the threshold of where the physical location to the workout begins and once you cross that line you are all business you are taking care of business bwhich is not to say that you cannot enjoy your work outs in fact you absolutely should one of the best pieces of advice that i ever got about fitness was given to me when i was a tean ager and i started lifting weights and the person who is teaching me how to do that said one of the best things that you can do and you absolutely should do for your fitness now and forever is to learn to enjoy training hard and that really stuck with me i really do enjoy training hard but tat was something that i learned how to do over time i took on the mentality that i'm here by choice i'm here for my own good and my own fitness to enhance my life i'm going to enjoy training hard i'm going to enjoy training effectively and of course their days when i train a little less hard where i back off quite a bit i even take rest periods of know a week every once in a while every say twelve to sixteen weeks i'll take a week off in just do some activities highking in things that sort i talk to all about extended lay off's meaning a lay off of more than two days during the apisode that i did by myself which is the optimal fitness protocals episode but in any case learning to train hard and enjoy training hard and really making the work out something that is separate from the rest of your life is one of the most gratifying things that you can do doenhance your over all fitness because it really teaches you how to designate your mind in your body toward this one specificset of goals while you are there and to really enjoy the process because fitness can be a truly enjoyable process even when you were exerting yourself especially hard and for you massacusts out there it can be especially because you are training hard that it feel good in any event the key is to set some sort of boundary and know that when you cross into that boundary you are training and when you cross out of that boundary you are done training bwhich also lends itself to more adequate recovery and the decompression type breathing exercises that we talked about before i'm not gongto tell you whether not you need to do the down regulation breathing at the end of your work out within the line or after you cross the line that is up to you i do not think one needs to get that specific now another tool that is wonderfully effective not just for your workouts but for all areas of your l ife is if you are going to bring a smart phone to your workouts to set some boundaries around what you are going to listen to and do with that smartphone during your workouts i see people texting i see people doing selpies i see people having phone calls i see people i presume listening to music or podcast looi am not the smart phone police nor are you and everyone has a right to use their smartphone in the way that they chooses best for them in order to distract themselves or focus themselves or enrich their life look it is a free world course or for s ome than for others but you can do what you want with your smart phone however if your goal is to improve your fitness one of the more powerful things you can do with your smartphone is to decide before you cross the line into your workout what you are going to listen to or do with that phone or not for me i to designate a playlist of music for that particular workout and then i just stick to that playlist i might repeat songs that i a lot or some one talks to me while the musics playing i might go back and restart a song if they distracted me that sort of thing although i do my best to not get into too much cial chitchat during workouts but i'm friendly and you on't's nice when people come over and say hullo i some nies work out with other people which case i do not use hedphones i do not use us martphone but setting a playlist or to designating a podcast or to designating an audiobook or to whatever it is that you are going to listen to to really decide what that is going to be before you do your workout the reason i say this is that i observe a lot of people and frankly have i've observed myself under conditions where i'm suddenly in a tex communication or i'm bouncing between albums or between podcasts or between whatever it is on the phone to the point where rest intervals are not being controlled well to the point where focus juring sets becomes harder to achieve at the beginning of a set because in between sets o focus on a conversation not on training i'm a big believer in making your exercise fun making it accessible meaning not expensive or geographically difficult to achieve that you do not do it or that it starts to interfere with other areas of life this is really important ou want fitness to be blended with the rest of your life but you do not want it blended with the rest of your life that the rest of your life starts to impede your efforts or and this happens cquite often for a lot of people that work out start to take an hour and a half two hours when they could easily be completed in forty five minutes to an hour if you were just more efficient with your time and of course you do not need mee to tell you this but smartphones can be one of the major bleeds on our focus and efficiency in fact it can cause you to hemridge focus and efficiency what i'm suggesting here is not throwing away your smart phone although some people do benefit from just leaving it in the car or at home when they are training but rather to designate podcasts books music playless for that particular work out and to just stick to those for the duration of your work out and once you cross into the line that is what you are listening to an only that or nothing and of course once you cross back over the line as you finish your work out you can decide to continue to listen to the podcast or continue to listen to the audio bookor to the music that is up to you although i highly recommend that you do in corporate that down regulatien period of three to five minutes minimum the last category of tools to improve your fitness come from the discussions about nutrition and supplementation and recovery in the series with doctor andy galpin now the list of tools i'm about to describe is not exhaustive meaning it does not even begin to come close to the total number of tools that one could glean from the discussion about nutrition and supplementation that i had with doctor andy galopin on this podcast but they are the major ones that are definilly worth knowing and those include supplementing with omegathree fatiasids now mego three fadiacids are found of course in foods things fatty fish and crill of all things certain forms of algy et cetera but most people do not get enough of called e p a form of omega threes and for that reason i and many other people choose to suppl ement with a minimum of one graham per day and in some cases as high as two grahams per day of o megathrees in supplement form typically one would get to one to two grahams of e p e by supplementing their nutrition their diet that is with fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil there are many different sources of these that was discussed in an episode that i did with doctor rona patrick i find that its most costifficient to get that one to two grahams of e p es from liquid fish oil despite what you might see on the internet i do not have any relationship whatsoever to a liquid fish oil company you just one to make sure that you go with a reputable brand i the ones that are flavored with lemon that it offsets the taste of fish oil am and i'll take a table spoon or two of that per day and if i'm traveling and even if i'm not i will often use fish oil capsuls and their a variety of different sources of those as well getting sufficient amounts of omegathree has been shown to be important for mood hisso is a way to offset depression but also for enhancing overall mood that probably relates to the omegathrees effect on nerro transmission not just for nermodulayers ceretonan in dopomine but for all narr transmission and nerro transmission of course is essential for nar muscular performance and the omegathries have been implicated in reducing the inflammation response hardy of ascular health et cetera i realize that there is some debate about omega threes but when i look at the bulk of literature about the omegathrees i's very clear to me that getting one to two grahams of e p e form of a mega three per day is the right thing for me to do and many others find that as well the second tool to enhance your fitness under this category of nutrition and supplementation is creatine now again creatine is not just found in supplement form its also found of course in foods in particular red meat however the amount of red meat that one would have to eat in order to get the amount of creatine that one would start to see a real performance inhancing effect is just far too high you would be in jesting far too much of other things in red meet that you would not want that much of and for that reason i and many other people will take creatine daily we now know there is no need to call load creatine in the old days as it were old days by the way meaning midnineties in two thousands we were all told that we had to load creting we had to take hydose creatine for four five days and then you could back off to a maitenance dos now it is very clear you can just take a daily dose of creatine and that it really does not matter when you take that cretie you could take it postwork out as many people do you coun take it creework out it really does not seem to matter i happen to take it postwork out just as a matter of habit but again you coul take t any time of day now the point i want to make about creatine is one that is a bit different than the other discussions out there i have no issue with the majority of what is discussed about creatine out there for instance that creatine monohydrate is the most effective form fortunalli creatine monoydrate is also the least expensive form of creatine that sold out there i see no evidence whatsoever that the other forms of creatine are superior to creatine monohydrate but what you will usually hear is that taking five grams of creatine monohydrate per day is ideal for everybody and that advice is simply not well informed by the scientific literature if you are a larger person forince as i way a hundred kilegrams o thats about two hundred twenty pounds well it turns out if you look at the literature on creatine and athletic performance and if you look at the literature on creatine and cognitive performance because as some of you already know creatine is a fuel or the phospho creatine system is a fuel system for the brain as well and if you look at the studies on cretine they almost always gauge the amount of cretine to give an individual based on their bodyweight you do not hove to get really specific about this but if you weigh say a hundred an eighty five pounds to two hundred fifty pounds you can get away with and probably should be taking ten grams or of creatine per day which is what i do ereas if you weigh less than that five grams are maybe even three grams is sufficient now i discuss this with doctor andi galpin during that series and one of the things that i've started to do since the closure of that series is to take more creatine per day now i'm taking ten sometimes even as much as fifteen grams per day of creatine again this is powdered creatine monohydrate my stomach tolerates it very well but frankly i do not ten to get stomach eggs or gastric distress from pretty much anything unless it is asome form of food poisoning which is exceedingly rare for me some people out there find that creatine really distrops they are got and they need to take it with food or they really need to slowly in crease the amount of creatine that they are taking each day i find that i can put ten even fiftein grams of cretine into a you knowa weigh protine chake or into some water with a lobit eleven juice just to make it taste a less chalky drink that and i do not have any gastrict distress from that s you will need to find what works for you but the point here is if you are going to take creatine you do not just want to quotitake creatine not one sper day you really want to adjust the amount of creatine that you are injesting according to your body weight and i would give you a very specific formula of ex grams of creatine pur kilegram were pound of body weight but belie it are not no such specific recommendation as ever been published in the scientific literature at least i could not find it in a way that is consistent with all the other papers meaning you see a lot of variation what i'm talking about here is if you weigh a hundred and eighty five pounds or ga pluserminis five pounds out to about two hundred fifty pounds ten to fiftin grams of creatine per day is probably more appropriate for you than is five grams meaning 's going to be more effective for enhancing physical performance and perhaps again perhaps even cognave performance as well and if you are somebody who weighs you a hundred and eighty pounds down to say a hundred and thirty pounds five grams of creatine per day is probably sufficient the point here is if you are taking creatine again not every one has to take creatin tere's no law that says it you have to take creatine some people do not it i know some people fear its can to make their hair fall out we already talked about that in previous episodes and the lack of data to support that idea but i realize some people steer aweig from creatine for whatever reason but if you decide that taking creotine is right for you a just the total amount of creetine that you take according to your bodyweight the next supplementation basetool for enhansing your fitness is a rodiola rosa now this very esoteric sounding supplement is one that i learned about both from doctor lay norton when he was a guest on this podcast expert in nutrition and frankly training as it relates to resistance training and from doctor andi galpin rodiola rosaa is a supplemen thit is gaining increasing attension because it is what is called a cortisal modulator it does not necessarily suppress cortissol it is not increase cortisal it is a cortisall modulator and frankly the mechanism by which rodiolo rosaa modulates cortisal is still under investigation i hope to do an episode about it in the future at least make it part of an episode because the hypothesized mechanism that strying to emerge is really interesting as it relates to nurons in the brain that control the stress response and glands in the body the adrinos that control the stress response and that secrete cortisal regardless there is a growing body of research that t has explored rodiolo rosaa supplementation nd one's subjective perception of fatigue or output during high intensity training of various kinds both resistance training as well as running and endurance type training i started taking rodiolo rosaa about six months ago in response to conversations that i had again with doctor ly norton and with doctor andi galpin and it is he supplement that i take before high intensity workout do not take it before run because frankly my runs either very long and slow or their very brief a high intense interval training session and i find those to be pretty easy to recover from even though they are very intense i might take a rodiolo rosa supplement before doing a thirty minute hill run that is very intents but typically i only take it about ten to fifteen minutes before any sort of i intensity resistance training session in particular my legday which falls on day too of my exercise protocol or the torso day or the small body parts day again here i'm referencing the way that i train across the week and you can find that training protocau as a downloadoble completelye zerocost pety eff if you but i realize other people are using different body part splits and different combinations of resistance training and endurance training the reason i mention rodioo rosaa and this episode is that i realize that while some people might not yet be supplementing omega threes they might not be supplementing creating there are many of you who are already doing those things and your looking for additional tools to give you an edge again the rodiolo rosaa would not fall into the category of foundational supplements certainly get your nutrition r i get your sly bright get your sunlight all the basics first please before youvebeen thinking about any supplements however once you get into the category of supplements that can enhance fitness rodio rosaa does seem to have some good research to support it in the contects of lots of different forms of high intensity exercise now i cannot tell you whether not its purely subjective or whether not objective and subjective but my experience has been that when i take rodiolo rosaa i definitely notice that i can exert myself harder without feeling i'm bringing myself to the brink of fatigue either during the exertion or afterwards in other words i feel i can do more work without feeling exhausted and i feel as if i'm recovering from my work outs more quickly in particular across the day after my workouts in fact if i had to sight one specific subjective effect that i've experience from taking rodiolo rosaa before very high intensity workouts is that prior to taking it i would often find that three or four hours after the work out having eaten a good meal takin a shower et cetera and i was tired i have a real dip in energy but now i noticed i have a lot of energy throughout the day even after these very high intensity sessions in the early part of the day and frankly i have not changed anything else about my supplementation or my nutrition at least nothing major i personally am going to continue to take rodiolo rosea before these high intensity work out for me that is about two or three times per week however if i forgot to take rodiolo rosaa before work out i have no reason to think that that work out would go much worse this is a supplement a's designed to sort of give you an edge to be able to exert more focus and intensity during your work outs with less perceived exertion and to enhanse your recovery the typical dosage of rodiolo rosea that you will find in most supplements is one hundred to two hundred miligrams and of course any time you are going to take a nuw supplement you would be wise to figure out the lowest effective dose from that supplement that is just logic right why spend more money taking more of something that you do not need more of if you could get away with taking less of it and it is just as effective maybe even more effective i typically will take a hundred to two hundred miligrams of rhodiolo rosaa about ten to twenty minutes before a work out however i've taken as little as a hundred miligrams on a consistent basis and frankly i do not really experience much difference whether i take a hundred miligrams ar i take two hundred meligrams before work out lately i've just defaulted to taking a hundred miligrams of rhodiolo rosaa before any high intensity work out now the final tool that i want a review for improving your fitness comes from the category of nutrition idone lots of episodes about nutrition already on this podcast we have done episodes about interment in fasting i did a long interview episode with doctor lane nortan where we discussed all the ins and outs of nutrition as it relates to fat loss mussl gain fitness in general life style in general to chick out that episode where you will learn his philosophy on nutrition which frankly is the one that i largely subscribed to of course obeys the laws of thermodinamics calories in calories out being fundamentally importan but also gets into all sorts of details about which sources of protine are most effective and bio available how much protine you can in corporate into your muscles after training et cetera all of that is included in that episode with that said the series on exercise with doctor indy galpan also included an episode on nutrician and while having the discussion for that episode and then listening to that episode again i realize that while certainly i've gotten a number of things right about my nutrition across the years there are few areas where i could probably do better without much effort in ways that could really enhance my fitness and the thing that i'm referring to is that for me my first meal of the day lay on somewhere around eleven a m maybe twelve noon sometimes i'll ead an earlier breakfast but most typically i hydrate and calfanate and train in the morning and then i eat some time around eleven or twelve and then i eat my last meal the day some time around eight thirty or nine and as some of you already know i tend to organize my meals such that meals during the early part of the day ten to lean more toward proteene and fibrous carbo hydrates things meat and salid or chicken an salad fish in salad and may be a little bit of starch and the meals that i eat later in the day tend to be more starch focused and more vegetable focus of things posta rise et cetera later in the day because it helps me sleep and the architecture of all that is really about energy and focus i find i can focus a bit better and i have more energy throughout the day when i have my first meal an around eleven or twelve and i keep the total amount of carbo hydrates that i ingest uring the day moderate not low but moderate now there is an exception to that which is if i do a high intensity resistance training section early n the mornings they train legs or train torso or even small body parts early in the morning then i make sure to incorporate more starchy carbo hydrates and some fruit some simple sugers as well into the first meal of the day that i can replenish the glicagen than i depleaded during those high intensity resistance training sessions however after talking to doctor andy galpin i realized that i really should not worry about or be afraid of eating something before training if i'm really hungry in the morning what i'm referring to here are the time s in which i wake up and i want to train but i personally to train fasted and caffinated yes i do recommend that people delay their caffin intake ninety two hundred twenty minutes after waking if and only if you have trouble with an afternoon crash you o real fatigue in the afternoon then it make sense to delay your caffine nine need two a hundred twenty minutes after waking however the exception to that is that if i'm going to train early in the day i do in jest water to hydrate as well as electrolites and kaffine prior to training and sometimes that means i'm drinking kaffin within thirty minutes or sixty minutes of waking try to be clear about this in previous episodes but i think a number of people have come to think that i always delay my kaffine and take ninety two a hundred twenty minutes after waking that simply not the case if i'm going to train in particular if i'm going to do hig intensy resistance training or a long run i will in jess kaffine sooner than ninety two a hundred twenty minutes after waking and in addition to that yes i tend to eat my first meal around leven a m maybe twelve noon but if i wake up and i'm very hungry i will eat a small meal that includes typically some protine an some fat some brazil nuts may be a couple scoops of waprotine would be typical for me or maybe even a litle bit of vote meal way protin not a lot of food in my gut but after talking to doctor any galopin wut i learned was for some people training fasted feels best i would consider myself one of those people you may be somebody in that category as well or you might be somebody who really feels as if you run best you resistance train best when you have eaten say ninety minutes or a couple hours before you do that there are basically no specific rules as it relates to whether not you train fasted or train fed except what you can handle in terms of gastric distrass you will want to make food choices according to that and try and avoid of course gastric distress but basily the thainge that i've made is if i wake up and i'm hungry i'll eat a small meal or if i want to work out in the afternoon or i have to work out in the afternoo on and i have lunch it say twelve or twelve thirty or eleven a m and the only opportunity that i have to train is one p m or even twelve thirty i will go ahead an train and that is a new thing for me typically i tried to keep my meals at least three to four hours prior to any training bout and of course if you are sleeping all night you are not eating and thn if you wake up and you do not eat and you train in the morning that iscertainly longer than three or four hours unless you are sleeping very very little frankly essentially what i'm saying is figure out what works best for you do you prefer to train fasted or fed for some of you you might prefer fasted befor cardio and fed befor resistance training for some of you it might be fasted is always best again i put myself in that category for some of you it might be fed is always best again this is highly individual and that is another point that i'm train to make here which is doctor gallpon really impressed upon me that there is no harden fast rule about training fasted or fed and this is the second point that having some flexibility in weather not you can train fasted or fed allows you to incorporate your fitness training sessions more readily into a shifting scadual and that is a really overarching theme of everything we have been discussing to day which is yes it is wonderful and important to have a cor fitness program something that you are really striving to do each in every week and for me that is three sessions of cardio three resistance training sessions and a day where i'm doing thermal strest training which is jus fancy language for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure however real life happens travel work illness family all the sorts of things that can impinge on an exercise scadul and make it less likely that one would complete their work outs to day we have been discussing tools to improve your fitness which are brief easy to incorporate scientifically supported and that are shown to improve the various sorts of exercise atdaptations and recovery that will allow you to get the most progress from your schadual while the tools that we discuss s to day relate to breathing they relate to nutricion they relate to supplementation they relate to specific set and rep patterns and cadences and rest periods et cetera all of those specific recommendations are within a larger container that i hope has become clear which is the best tools to improve your fitness are the tools that of course are going to be effective in improving your carty ofascular and strength and hyperchevry training et cetera whatever it is that your goals are but also tools that are going to make it easier and more likely that you are going to engage in your fitness programm with enthusiasm with effort and with focus and as with any episode to this podcast i covered a lot of information and there are a lot of different tools that one could incorporate by no means do you need to incorporate them all although if you choose to that is wonderful just even in corporating one or two of them say in corporating this notion of the line and the exercise snacks or justing your level of flexibility as to whether not you train fasted or fed and the line or trying a twelve week cycle of purely training for strength when you do your resistance training but whether not you pick one tool or all the tools or somewhere in between the key thing is to actually implement them and i to think that during to day's discussion provided a number of tools again largely gleaned from the episode series of doctranty galpins and again if you have not seen that series that is linkedin the shownote captions those episodes are long there are six of them but they are a wealth of information of every aspect of fitness during today's episode were relyjous talk about the

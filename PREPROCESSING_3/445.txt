welcome to the hubermanlaoscience science space to i may drew hubermen and 'm a professor of neurobology and optimology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to talk all about how to optimize your work space for maximum productivity indeed that means to heighten levels of focus to increase levels of creativity to improve your ability to tasks which and this con be forsake of school or for work creative endeavors personal endeavors this really extends to everybody most often when we hereabout how to focus or how to get the most out of our wor sessions we hereabout the biology in the psychology of that we heareabout dopomin and we hear about ceratonan and we heare about caffine and indeed those are topics that iave covered a lot on the huberman ladpodcast to day we will touch on each of those but we are mainly going to focus on how we arrange our physical environment and indeed how we arrange our selves in that physical environment in order to bring out the best in our neuro biology that is how to put ourselves into a heightened state of focus by virtue of things as simple as where we place our screen relative to our eyes at a given time of day believe are not there is excillent research on this and there is excellent research for instance on whether not you shouder should not listen to music whether not you should use things by noral beats and if what frequency of by noral beats we are going to cover all of that and by the end you will have a checklist of things that you can do to optimize your work space on any budget i will mention various products and apts that some of you might find useful for optimizing your workspace but i want to emphasize at the outset that none of those that i mention are any products or apts that we have a financial relationship to and more importantly you do not need them i'm going to explain how for zero cost you can arrange your work space in wayse that makes you maximily productive maximily focus and allows you to adapt your workspace to different environments whether nt your travelling working with others working alone et cetera just to give you a little hint of where we are going i will mention a zero cost ap that wi'll deliver bynoral beats at a particular frequency that pure reviewe research has shown can enhance certain types of learning and memory however pure reviewe to research also shows that it can diminish performents in other types of tasts stay tune will go into all the details that you canoptimize your work space for zero cost and get the most out of your efforts and endeavors before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and scince related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens ath letic greens is an all in one viteman mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve m delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and th reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i mig have in addition it has probiotics which are vital for microbium health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentally with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain envody without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will gve you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wor getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien invitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three c to to days episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar o talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodiu magnesium ind potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimised if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatios of electrolytes if yu to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement doc cam slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase thei'r all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok cam slash hubermen let us talk about workspace optimization this is a topic that is entrigued me for a very long time because my undergraduate adviser my graduate adviser and my postoc adviser had many things in common including being great scientists being kind people in terrific mentors but they had another thing in common which always perplexed me which is that their offices were a complete disaster they had mountains of books mountains of papers mountains of all sorts of stuff and yet all of them were extremely productive and could remain extremely focussed in that incredibly cluttered environment now i'm somebody who does not clutter i find a very hard to focus ind cluttered environments and indeed there is tremendous variation among people as to whether not they can re main focused or whether not they struggle to focus in physically cluttered environments there is no righter wrong to this but the question we should ask ourselves is why were they all able to be focused and it turns out that the reason they were able to be focuse is that they all captured one single and yet fundamental variable of workspace optimization and we will talk about what that variable is in fact we are going to talk about what all the variables of optimizing a workspacear things vision things light things noise in the room whether not you listen to music or not whether not you use noise cancelling headphones or not we are going to talk about all of that and we are going to do that in a way that you can optimize your work space regardless of whether not you are at home whether not you are on the road et cetera because the last thing i would ever want to do is to create a situation where you find the optimal workspace and then you are a slave to that optima workspace that is just not the way the world works what you want to do or my goal for you rather is that you will have a short checklist of things that you can look to any time you sit down to do work and you can think about the underlying variables that impact your brain and your body and allow your brain enbody to get into the optimal state in order to learn in order to be productive and indeed to move through your work abouts in a very relaxed and pleasure ful way while maintaining focus and while pursuing any of the number of things that you are doing the first variable we want to think about in terms of workspace optimization is vision and light owon a previous episode to the humran labpodcast devoted all to habits i talked about the importance of dividing your twenty four hour day into three different phases and for those are you that have not heard that episode i'm just going to briefly summerize what i described from the time you wake up in the morning until about six or seven or eight sometimes nine hours later your brain is in a unique state it is in a state of high levels of dopamine a nouramodulater and high levels of epineperon as well as hormons cortis all and forth without going i to the biology of those things they set your brain into a state of high alertness and this is true retheren are not you indulge in caffin or not i know some of you say oh i really do not wake up until the afternoon at much more alert and focus in the afternoon we will talk about that phase of the twenty four hour day in a moment but that early part of the day is a time of day in which for sake of work space optimization being in a brightly lit environment can lend itself to optimal work through out the day not just during that early phase and while on many episode to this podcastive also emphasize the importance of getting morning sunlight in your eyes within thirty to sixty minutes of waking not as often but now and again i will also mention that it is important to light youre daytime environment as brightly as you safely can if you are going to be doing work in this early what i call phase one portion of your day you want to have as much light and indeed as much overhead l ight shining on you as safely possible of course you do not want it bright that it is glaring and you have to squint et cetera but you want as much light as is safely possible and you can do that a couple of simpleways one is if you do own were you are in in and environment we have overhead lights turn on those overheadlights what special about overhead lights for setting alertness is that the nurons in our eyes which are called melenops in gangling selvles that is the fancy name melinops and ganglin cells are mainly en riched in the lower half of our retinas in our eyes and view the upper visual field those inar on send little wires to an area of our hypothelmus right above the roof of our mouth that creates a state of alertness now early in the day we want to be as alert as possible and this phase one of our circadian cycle is when we are best at doing analytic detail type work we are goin to going to other aspects of workspace optimization that are important for phase one but during phase one again within zero to about eight or nine hours after waking bright lights in your environment in particular overheadlights are going to facilitate pocus they are going to facilitate further release of things dopomine and norepinefferon and healthy amounts of quartisal and we want that to happen early in the day for a variety of reasons for instance we do not want that cortis all peak to happen to late in the day that is i shaly associate with depression and insomnia and a number of things that we just do not want one of the things that iave done for my work space is to make sure that when i wake up in te morning i do go get my sunlight if the sun is indout i turn on as many bright artificial lights as i can manage or tolerate and then i go get my sunlight exposure but once i set out to do some work that all the overhead lights in that rumor on as well as lights in front of me and that' again to stimulate heighten levels of focus and further release of these nermage layers i mention before dopamine nor up anefferon in epinefferon now the way that one could do that could be a very low cost way of having for insas the desk lamp and those overheadlights if you are somebody that wants to take this to the next level you can purchase a ring light which is i think those are mainly made for people doing selphy type vidios a in o for instergrampost and things of that sort ringlights can be pretty cost effective and yet theire very bright and they have the sort of bright blue light that is going to optimately stimulate those melanops and ganglin cells some people i know will have a blue light or a bright elydy on their desk in front of them and indeed i have one of these i do not use a ringlight i use a light pad the particular light pad i use ibought on amazon ii can mention the brand but again i have no financial affiliation to them this is the artograph light pad its desine for for drawing and it is it says on it nine hundred and thirty lucks lucks is just a measure of brightness i place that on the desk in front of me and i turn it on essentially throughout this phase one of the day even if i walk away from the desk i tend to keep it on it does not consume that much energy and in that way i'm constantly being bombarded with photons that keep my levels of alertness up because the early part of the day is when i do the maj rity of that focust work again you do not need the light pad you can use a ring light or you can simply use any kind of other lights that you might happen to have artificial lights for those of you that can place your desk near a window and even better to open the window that would be really fantastic i do not have access to that why would i say open the window while it turns out that sunlight is going to be the best stimulus for waking up your brain and body through this melenops into hypothalimous system and by looking at sunlight through window it is fifty fives zero times less effective than if that window were to be open mostly because those windows filter out a lot of the wavelings of blue light that are essential for stimulating the eyes and this wake up signal all of this is rests on the premise that we need to be alert in order to do our work in particular focust work and iave talked about before in the habits episode and i'm saying again now that first phase of the day that first seven or eight or nine hours of the day is really the time in which oure neuro chemistry is primed for getting the most amount of focust can of challenging work done where a lot of precision in detail is required you want to brightly light your work environment during that first phase again from the time you wake up trying get sunlight but then even if you are going to get exercise o do other things you want to get as much bright light in your eyes as you safely can and then you want to light your work environment now in the afternoon starting it about nine and continuing until about sixteen hours after waking you want to start dimming the lights in that environment now you do not want to make it dark because you o want to get sleepy at two ofclock in the afternoon unless you are ging to take a brief nap which i do and is perfectly fine as long as it does not interfere with your night time sleep but the ideas that in this called phase too of the twenty four hour cycle from about nine to sixteen hours after waking you want to bring the level of lights down a bit and when i say down i literally mean down having lights that are in front of you is fine but overhead lights at that time are not going to be optimal for the sorts of neuro chemical states that your brain wants to be in that states that i'm referring to are a shift from the dopamin and nor up and efferon that is highest early in the day to increases in things light ceretonan and other neuromodulators that put your brain into a state that is better for creative endeavors or for more abstract thinking now as we will soon see there are other things you can do to improve creative thinking and abstract thinking and in fact thorre things you can do to improve analetic thing we will talk about those things that are distinct from light but right now we are just focussing on light what i recommend doing in what i personally do is i will turn off over head lights in the afternoon it is not completely dim it is not completely dark but i will start to reduce the amount of overhead light and just simply keep the light pad on and whatever other lamps i happen to be using now one thing we have not talked about is screen brightness this is highly individual people have different retinal sensativities what i mean by that is everybody differs in terms of how bright they can tolerate their visual environment and their screen and whether not you are sensitive to light or not will depend on a lot of factor some of it as i color indeed people with darker color eyes generally can tolerate more bright light than others i have green eyes i am very very sensive to light if i'm out doors at a cafe or something in the table has any kind of reflective properties and it is a sunny day i can barely see the person across the table for me unless i'm wearing sun glasses some people other members of my family for instance have dark brown eyes and goun just sit there and have a conversation without the need for sun glasses at all that is there is tremendous variation there one or the other is not healthy or advantageous necessarily just understand that you never want to be in an environment where it is painful to maintain looking at whatever it is that you are looking at if something is painful to look at it could be damaging to your eye you do want to protect your eyes now and this second phase of the day since most of us are working indoors but even if you are working outdoors you want to try and get the amount of light reduced over all but in pretue o that overhead light and you also want to start reducing the amount of blue light that you are being exposed to somewhere around four or five p m which for me is about twelve hours after i've been awake or fourteen hours after i've been awake i will turn off that light pad and start to transition the lights in my environment to more yellows and reds now i cannot always do this i have friends that actually have converted their entire homes from blue light early in the day to red light laht in the day that is really cool and fantastic i have not done that it is ther's a cost to doing that and it is optimal in terms of optimizing productivity and sleep and forth but it is not feasible for a lot of people but what i do as i simply switch to using yellow lamps i will turn off that eledy in the later afternoon again around four or five p m and i tend to wake up around six a m or i'll turn those off and what i'll try and do also as i'll trying dim the screen that i'm working on that i can still manage to see everything that i need to see but it is quite a bit dimmer than it was early in the day that is pase too if the day and that is how we want to think about light and then i'll just mention because i know there are peoplewho are working in the middle of the nights there is phase three which is about seventeen to twenty four hours after waking and i realize that for shift workers or for people that are pulling all night ers or for students often times you need to be awake in studying i the mill the night i myself in somebody who for years would pull anywhere from five to ten all night ors pareer i still pull in all night are now and again because of dead lines and forth i do not recommend it if you can avoid it great but many people just simply have to do this for sake of shift work or because of impending dead lines or procrastination ore all of the above if you are going to be doing work in that third phase of your circadean cycle you really want to limit the amount of bright light tha you are getting in your eyes to just the amount that allows you to do the work that you are doing because if you get light in your eyes that is any brighter than that you are going to severely toplete you'r meletone and levels youre going to severely shift your circ atian clock and it is effectively let travelling to another timesone if you stay up from three a m until six a m or two a m until four a m working on a term paper or something of that sort you are etting bright light in your eyes you are effectively flying six hours two a different timeszon or t least that is what your body registers it has and it can really throw your sleep in your metabolism and a number of other things out of wack now there is an exception to this which is if you really want to be awake it can often be beneficial to flipping on all the lights in the room and eeping them really bright one of the hardest things to do is to stay up all night studying when you are in a dim environment you have to determine the trade off between whether not you want to shift your clock or wither not you want to get the worked on and i would say the ideal situation is to sleep at night and to do your work during the day and in the afternoon but if you do have to be awake in the middle the night do understand that yu want to dim those lights over all you would not want to use that el d you would not want o have overhead lights on unless your really struggling to stay awake in which case you want to get as many bright lights on as possible there are couple tricks to all nighters i do not really want people pulling all nighters unless they have to but there are a few things that you can do without taking stimulants in order to stay up all night that can be beneficial that maximise on your biology one of them that is a little less a commonly known is you can drink thirty two ounces of water and commit to not going to the bathroom for ninety minutes at least turns out that there is a circuit that goes from your bladder literally nurons that go from your blatder to your brainstem and when you have to urinate it makes you very alert as many if you have proudly experience is that you will wakes us up in the middle o the night when we have to use the bathroom is this circuit for alertness that goes from full bladder it is signal by the ladder being full to the brainstem and this is the circuit that is desrupted in kids that have bed wedding issues and there a number of cognat behaviourl approaches to that sometimes bed wedting in very young kids is because the circuit has not develop yet most adults fortunately are not bed wedding but you can increase the amount of alertness in your system and remain awake in the mill the night by drinking a lil bit more water thend a you normally would and then refraining from going to the rest arom that certainly will lend itself to alertness how difficult it is to fall asleep a when you have to use the restarom for instance that is one tool the other thing is again to flip on ass many bright lights in the environment as possible and then of course people will rely on stimulants cafian or even more a aggressive stimulants that is not something i necessarily recommend a youlleach have to determine that for you but if you do in fact have to use a all nighters for any reason you can maximise this bladder to brain approach and the bright light approach o case of that more or less covers how bright to keep your over all environment and how bright to keep your screen if you really want to get nurty about this there is a free ap called light neater where you can start measuring how many lucks how many phautons are in a given environment it is actually measuring reflectance of phatons and on if you can look up what a luximeater does if you ligkt i do not necessarily recommend doing that i i do not want to set a critical threshold by which for instance we say once your environment is more than fifteen hundred locks than its two brighte or not bright enough et cetera everyone as different rentinal sensitivities everyone will find that different levels of brightness will cause them to be alert different levels of dimness if you will in the room will cause them to feel sleepy you really wanted just modulate across the twenty for our cycle where its very bright as bright as safely can be early in the day that you are alert you can do your focus detailed work in that first phase and then in the afternoon as you move into more creative type works are abstracthinking or working with other people in kind of a brain stormy mode that you would shift to dimmer lights yellow lights eliminate the blue lights as much as possible now that is light but there is another aspect of vision that has been shown to be critically important for how alert we are going to be and how well we can maintain that alertness and that ask to do with where our visual focus is in a given environment not thim but over all brightness what i'm referring to now is simply where you place your phone or your tablet or computer screen or book whatever it is that you happen to be looking at there is a very under appreciated and yet incredible aspect of our neurology that has to do with the relationship between where we look and our level of alertness and it works in a very logical way we have clusters of nurons in our brainstem and those clusters of nurons control our eyelid muscles and they control our eye movements up and down and to the sides and indeed if you were to look at an eyeball looked a lot of eyeballs in my lab o matichneranatomy we do this from time to time we would see that there are six muscles attached to your eyeball now four of them or located at the top the bottom in the two sides of your eyeball that they twelve ofclock six ofclock three ofclock and nine ofclock of your eyeball and those muscles can move your eye in the socket from side to side and up and down and then we also have some muscles that can actually pull the eyeballs at angles oka there is we have different muscles that can move the eyes at different angles as well tha's why we can look up into the side or down into the side noth as from side to side or up or down now the nurons that control those muscles have a very interesting feature which is that when we are looking down toward the ground or anywhere below basically the the central region of our face the nurons that control that eye movement or intimately related to areas of the brainstem that release certain types of nuromadulators in nuro transmitters and they active a areas of the brain that are associated with calm and indeed even with sleepiness and there is an active inhibition or provention of nurons that increase alertness now the opposite is also true we have nurons that place our eyes into an upward gaze above thes or level of our nose and up above our forehead literally looking up while keeping the head stationary or if you tilt your had back and you look up these nurons are still active those nurons do not just control the position of the eyes and cause them to move up they also trigger the activation of brain circuits that are associated with alertness now this is a fundamental feature of the way that our eyes and brain are wire together and how they relate to what we call autonomic orousal and ther bunch of details there we will actually have a guest in a few weeks who has learned to exploit these nurons and the fact that they control these different states of calm or alertness in order to generate hypnotic states to place people into very a typical states in which they are both very alert and very calm save that for a future episode but the importan thing to understand is when you are looking down below the level of your nose you are essentially decelerating your alertness youre reducing your amount of alertnes it might be subtle but it is happening whereas when you look straight ahead or in particular when you look up you are increasing your level of alertness now this has some obvious implications when we get sleepy our eyelids tend to close and we tend to nod down when we are wide awake we tend to be wide eyed are we do not tend to blink is often and we tend to be chin up and kind of on vigilance and alertness this has a evolutionary or at least an adaptive component to it this can be exploited and indeed it is been researched in terms of how it can be used to optimize work environments contrary to what most people do which is to look down at their lap top tablet or phone if you want to be alert and you want to maintain the maximum amount of focus for whatever it is that your reading are doing you want that screen or whatever it is that your looking at to at least be at eye level and ideally slightly above it now i have not seen many work spaces that take advantage of this very hard wired ner biological fact what should you do with this information well if you are somebody who sits down to do work and start to feel sleepy or simply unfocused unable to attend to whatever it is that you are doing i highly recommend that you take your lap top or tablet i do hope that most people are not doing serious work on their phones because it such a small visual window and we can talk about why thats an issue later and the idea would be to place that screen of your tablet or your laptop or other computer and try and get elevated at least to nose level your nose level or even higher now realize that can be complicated to do i've long just used to stacka books or all sometimes take a box and turnd up side down and set it there i do use a mixed standing seeto desk all talk about that in a few minutes there are nomber iferent ways that you culd o this you could wall mount a moniter i think many people are working with lap tops it is a littlebit harder to to do that with a laptop some people though will configure a second screen yu have to decide what is right for you in your budget but again in addition t having a brightly let room to be able to focus and attend to whatever it is your working on you want to have that screen position high in your visual environment now you would not want it on the sealing necsessarily o that uld be pretty cool ah you but you do want above you now there are couple solutions to this that do not involve a wall mount or stacking books or boxes for instance you could be one of those people that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa and get your screen up above you by putting pillows on your knees i usto actually do a lot of my writing in work in the mildl of the night i do not do this any more an i do not recommend it but i use to do a lot of work from bed now i no longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom i just really try and keep the bedroom for sleeping or whatever else but in terms of lying down on the couch it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you can han a slide underneath that screen and get typing but there is a problem with that and wi'll talk about this selubit more in a moment but it turns out that your posture literally the position of your body relative to gravity also has important implications for how alert you are ideally you would be standing or seated i would say that ideal would be standing second best woill be seated and your screen will be either directly in front of you or slightly above you or if you wanted to get really fancy you could create a situation where it was above you and slightly tilted toward youse that you actually had to maintain ad of proper neck posture this accomplishes a number of things in addition to making you more alert you lso get away from the called text neck people are starting to look more seas now days tha the shape of the letter see becaue we are constantly looking down i do every once and why sees somebody whose texting in public with it at eye level it always looks a little odd that they are doing that but i always admire their posture at the same time we should not give them a hard time this is another feature that you can arrange into your physical work space again whether not your seeted or your or your standing throughout the day try and get that screen elevated now with reference to posture therrr beautiful data illustrating that when we are standing up those same nurons in our brainston locust serulious nurons which release i should mention things nor up and effering an epin efferong those nurons become active when we are standing they become even more active when we are ambulatory when we are moving and we will talk about tread milling and cycling at your desk an forth in a little bit but when you sit they become a little less active and when you lie down and indeed any time that you start to get your feet up above your wast or your head tilted back those nurons fire less and nurons in your brain that are involved in calming and indeed putting ou to sleep start increasing their level of firing it is a really beautiful system beautiful in fact that there are studies that show that as you adjust the angle of the body back you actually get a sort of dose dependent increase in sleepiness and calmness and dose depended decrease in alertness and as we were all told to sit up straight or even better to stand up straight and now i'm also telling you to get that visual thing that your attending to screen or otherwise up in front of you r or ideally above you those things combined to generate maximum alertness you can think about how you might work this in to various aspects of your home work environment or offis work environment but as i describe this many of you are probably thinking what i'm thing which is gosh most of what we do is in complete opposite direction to all of this nerbiologically grounded advice most of us are looking down at our lap top will seated or we are lying down which is going to make us more sleepy or we are positioning our computers in front of us but we really are not an environment that is bright enough and on and forth as you can tell we are strying to lay or in the various things that you can do first brightness in the room second get that screen up and trying to put yourself into a posture for work that lends itself or promotes alertness if indeed you want to be alert for that work if you goal is to take a nap yet your feet elevated about ten o fifteen degrees above your head men be put a pillow on ar aney that lie down and take a nap but that is not what were tolkin about to day were toing about workspace optimization and i suppose you culd also exploit that all night or trick a that i talked about earlier is she did this when i was an undergraduate solbit massacistic in this way i would drink coffee and water at fairly high volume i was not in a force drinking or anything that but i actually would not allow myself to get up and use the bathrom except on a timer i think the longest ever went s three and a half hours it was cont of excruciating i shally tone thing that is necerely a healthy advices but again you can use slight i mention slight over consumption of fluids in order to generate alertness that was just me really trying to get as much work done as i could i had a very very demanding class schedule and it was just the only way that i con get work done if i was getting up every few minutes use the rest rom my found at hard to re engage in that work in maintain focus which is what i just want a briefly mention now i talked about this in the episode on focus but one thing that is completely unreasonable and tht you should never ask yourself to do is to sit down or stand up an immediately focus on something unless youare stressed about what youre looking at or your very very excited by it if youre very stressed about some sort of information or a dead line or youre very very excited about something you w'll fin that you can focus instantly just within a moment and that is because of the deployment of nor cemicals dopemen in noripe and efferind that bring about our levels of alertness however most of us including myself will go to begin a work about and will find that our mind does not quite engage at the level of depth an focus that we would riht off the bat i've time this and other studies have time this in a more rigorous way mine is just what we call anic data but i've time it for myself but their studies that have looked at this and the data point to the fact that even at our most heighten levels of focus most people can only maintain focus before switching tasks for about three minutes which is depressingly short period of time however you can extend that period of time and i've talked about that in the episode on focus but more importantly when you sit down to start a workbout of any kind any kind expect that it would take about six minutes for you to engage these nerl circuts you wouldnt expect yourself to walk into the gem an do a p are left or start running and do your best sprain towar just head out the door without warming up at all a lo walkjog at first or a feu warm up sets anand that is we expect that we are not surprise that we need that and yet we sort of expect that our brain should be able to lock on and do work in a very focus way immediately and that is just ridiculous assumptions os none fair assumption i should say assume that it will take about six minutes to engage in your workabout and that those norchemical systems will take some time to reve up and inand engage the other things that i'm describing about lighting and screen position and imposture those will also help maximize your focus and will limit that ramp up time into a focus state and i think what you will find is that as you maximize your workspace thet time the latency as we say to get into that focus will start to shorten itwill specially starch a shorten if you use tools to limit distraction we will talk about distraction but things freedom which is an an apa a free ap that allows you to lock yourself out of the inner net or turning off your phone for instance but even if you are doing work on your phone or that involves your phone or the internete as many of us including myself do expect there to be a ramp up time for you to focus there is another aspect of our vision that is absolutely critical for optimizing our work space and thet ask to do with this really interesting feature of our visual pathways in that it has two major channels those two major channels have names although you do not after remember the names the first one is the called parvo cellilar channel which is involved in looking at things at specific points in space and at high resolution or detail and then there is the called magnacellar channel that is involved in looking at big suaths of visual space and at lower resolution sou can think of the parvocellar system as can of a high pixl density think about your most modern smart phone the recent smarvfon with the best best camera andthing about the magnacellar system as being lower resolution cond of an older smart phone lower picles et cetera you might ask why wat you want a system thats you low resolution well the low resolution system is better at things detecting motion and not much at detail and vice versa ow again you do not hafe tor remember the names what you do have to remember however is that you are going to create the maximum amount of alertness in your system the maxim amount of a bility to focus when your system is in that parvo cellar mode when you are bringing your eyes to a common point what we call a vergence i movement v r g nd c e i've said this before on the podcas and people said virgin i moveit no vergents i movement as in convergence bringing your eyes to a single point in space we will create a narrower aperture of a visual window meaning your your visual world actually shrinks at least perceptually whereas when you relax your eyes and dilate your gaze you can do this now by whatever environment your inchine and c without moving your head off to the side above below you as broadly as possible may be you can dilate your gaze much you can see yourself your body in that visual environment you will notice tht your res solution of vision is not nearly as high as when you do that vergenside movement fergents i movements are incredibly powerful for creating heightend states of alertness and focus and indeed they create heightened states of cognition of thinking and that is because your brain follows your vision in terms of focus when we say i cannot focus what we often are experiencing is an abilit and inability excuse me to not focus visually whereas when we are in a very focus state we are in a stae often where we can focus visually now we can also do this with our auditory system or to touch et cetera but right now we are just talk about the visual system now terms of work space optimization what this means is we never really want to be looking at a square or rectangle or target area for our work that is too far beyond our ears how far is too far really you want to try and keep the blinders on or i should say the invisible blinders that whatever you are looking at falls within the region of visual space in front of you that is present if you ware to cup your hands and put them right next to your eyes now this is a rough estimation but i'm doing this now for those who e their watchg on you to bi'm doing this now and trying to simulator a horse with blinders on for those you ae listening just imagine me looking silly with my hands cup near my eyes but if wer are to for instance look at a screen that is very very big and weare too close to it or even if wofre standing back from it it is going to be hard for us to attend to everything within that screen space this is actually support for the idea of using a phone or a tablet or a laptop some my laptop is about fifteen inches in diameter i think is the one that i have some are thirteen some are seventeen some of you to use big moniters make sure that whatever it is that you are looking at if you want tom remain focus it does not extend too far beyond where your eyes are of this the sides of your head that is just thing blinders on a horse and actually that is the reason they put blinders on a horse that they 're not looking off into the prifery horses unlike humans do not have the same shaped pupil they do not have a visual system that is organizing quite the same way they mostly see in panorama in magnocellar vision and those blinders of design to keep their visual focuss straight ahead they physically restrict it now some people will actually go to lengths to further restrict their visual focus they will do things putting on a hoodie or wearing a hat for instance to restrict their visual window and indeed that works quite well but as we will talk about in a moment when you really restrict your visual window down to a very very narrow portion of visual space that actually changes the types of information that you are best at processing and well talk about that in terms of something that is called the cathedral effact in a few moments but for now here is the principle make sure that whatever youre looking at is directly in front of you and does not extend too far out to the side once you get out to say six or twelve or certainly eighteen inches on either side of your eyes you are dilating your gaze by definition your dilating your gazes completely subconscious and it becomes ver y hard to maintain attention now the coviat to this is that if you are going to look at a narrow space a narrow window for any period of timewhether not i's a book or a lap top or a tablet or a phone those virgencs i movements not only create alertness but they also require energy and they also can fatigue the eyes because there is a process called accommodation whereby the shape of your eye literally has to change that the lens can move s that you can focus of that location accommodations incredible process but it is a demanding one and that is the reason that your eyes get tired when you focus on something for too long here is a principle extracted from the opthemology ind narrow science literature that you can adopt for every forty five minutes in which you are focussing on something a phone or a tablet or a book page or your computer you want to get into magna celler panoramic vision for at least five minutes and the way that i suggest to do this is ashly to take a walk ideally outside where do to talk about ambulation about movement and about how that can maintain a lertness throughout the day for every forty five minutes or try and get five minutes of relaxing your eyes this is something that is not often done especially in to days homeschooling and where people are a were kids are going to school by zoome and adults are working by zoome this is a serious problem people are getting i fatigue they are etting headaches indeed some peopler getting my grains there having all sorts of issues neck pain much of that if not all of that in some cases can be alleviated by this forty five to five rule for every forty five minutes of focust work that you do get five minutes where you get outside or if you have to be indoors where ou can dilate your gays now some of you may be saying well that spits in the face of your ninety minute rule you are tryin you have told us before that we shuld focus for ninety minutes i would still want you to take breaks within those ninety minutes if your looking at a narrow piece of visual world meaning at a phone or elaptop or forth and again the best way do this would be to go outside just relax your eyes look off into the distance looking at a horizon will automatically trigger this panoramic gaze which is very relaxing to the eyes and will allow you to go back into a focustd work about the one thing you absolutelutely do not want to do is to go outside and check your phone becase ofyour outside checkingyour phone or youre taking a break and chaking your foniar still in that vergence i movement oke this is very very important because virgencs i movements increase focus an attention and you can exploit that to increase focus in attention when you want to but you absolutely need to relax the system again for every forty five minutes in which you have been in that focused mode you want to get at least five minutes of panoramic vision if you can take a fifteen minute walk even better next i to talk about an aspect of workspace optimization they can actually byas whether not ar brain and nervous system are better suited for detailed anolytic work or more abstract work in fact there is a way that you can arrange your work environment or i should say there is a way that you can place yourself into certain environments that will allow abstract thinking creative thinking and indeed expansive thinking to emerge there are other environments that you can put yourself in that will make your brain shift towards more analytic work toward more detailed and precise types of work now i just briefly want o mension something that was covered again on the habits episode that i did a few weeks ago but again you do not need to see that episode in order digest this information it goes back to this issue of three phases within the circanian twenty for hour cycle fase one which as i mentions about zero to eight hours after waking face two nine to sixteen hours after waking and face three seventeen to twenty four hours after waking fase one the ideal for analytic precise detail types of work face two better suited for most people for creative can of abstract thinking expansive thinking brain storming et cetera there are some exceptions to that but most people follow that pattern because of the different neuromodulators and h hormones and forth that are released into the brain envody at those different phases when am about to tell you is a way in which you can use your physical environment to further shift your brain and nervous system into a mode that is either prime for analytic or abstract and creative thinking what i am about to describe is called the cathedral effect the cathedral effect has been discussed whele really for many many decades may beven hundreds of years but formerly has been discussed ince the early two thousands in which it seemd that people who were in high cealinged environments hence the phrase cathedral would shift their thinking and their ideas to more abstracting creative lofty type thinking literally higher cealing loftier thinking higher aspirations that this was observed in terms of the language that they use but also f the sorts of ideas that they would generate and conversely that people that were in lower ceilinged environments would be more oriented toward using language that was more restricted literally more detailed analytic about things in their immediate space now this seems cun awild on on the one hand but actually if we go back to our understanding of the neurobilogy the visual system and the way that our brains anbodies ivolved in different environments it actually makes a lot of sense we do not have time to go into a long lecture about evolutionary neuro biology but we ifto remember that are nervous system has a number of features that are adapted to different environments and indeed we are able to go from big open prairies or mountain tops or large cathedrals or concert halls into small environments and everything scales with it when we are outdoors in a big expansive space our vision tends to go long we tend to be in panoramic magnacellar vision our hearing tends to extend long even for having a conversation with somebody we tend to als uld be attending somewhat to the on the screech of of hawks off in the distance or to the rush of a river whereas when we are in small spaces everything our vision are hearing and indeed even our physical movements become more restrained even if we can still extend our hands out as far as we want what do i mean by that let say you are in an elevator that is a small space compared t outside on a field this has been measured over and over again peoples the the sizes or the amplitude of people spontaneous movements actually scales down in small or environments even if they are not completely restricted from extending their limbs all the way whereas when we are out doors we feel im a natural impulse to move further away from our ar body ar torso with our limbs this is just feels more appropriate behavior and when i say appropriate i do not mean in any kind of a social contect necessarily is itually a reason for this the visual system and the caled vestibular motor system are intimately linked and i can just tell you briefly a one way in which you can test this and observe this and even use this it is a loff topic from to day's episode but let say you have a certain amount of flexibility you can extend your arms off wings is what i'm doing for thoes either listening not watching off to your sides with arm straight and yet you reach a maximum a positioning of flexibility you can do a quick experiment where you sit still you would bring your arms in for a moment you con put them on your knees if you or in front of you and you can move your eyes very far off into the perfery of your visual fields soectually omen to do this now t looks connisily but moving my eyes without moving my head off into the perifry all the way to the right a all the way left all the way up all the way down but especially all the way to the left almost looking over my shoulder without turning my head all the way to my right and you will find that you actually can extend your arms further back subsequent to that and that is not magic wit has to do with the ways in which your serabellum tas you means many brain and your and your eyes your visual system are connected and the way in which your cerabelum controls some of the spindles and other aspects of the neuro muscular architecture of your nervous system cas your nerves control your muscles and allow those muscles to move further out for those of you that lack flexibility you cannet tuly exploit your visual system for this now that is again a bit of a tangent but it is a fun one that relates back to this call cathedral effect the cathedral effect is a way in which our thinking becomes more restricted and restrained in tighter small or more confined visual environments or if the seling is higher we are in expansive space with a lot of a thistance above us or space above us and out to the sides may beven out on a field are thinking goes into these more broad a abstract and an loftier a future thinking in particular this has actually been measured i's a really nice paper i will post o link to this the the authors are a jone miers leavy and rui and then perenthe shes juliett zo i can assume that they go by juliet the title of the paper is the influence of ceiling height the effect of priming on the type of process ing the people use and i will not go into all the details of this paper but what is really cool about this paper is they looked with very rigorous statistics and they have a a fair number of subjects and everything about this paper look solid to me at the difference in cognive processing an abstract thinking and detailed analytic work that people are able to perform in environments that have a ten foot ceiling verses and eight foot ceiling which is not that much of a difference is just two two foot a difference there and what they found were significant effects whereby high ceilingis active a concepts related to abstraction whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts but are promote the kind of detaile thinking that that lends itself well to sort of spread sheet type work or a counting type work whereas abstract creative work was supported by these higher ceilings and the way they analyze this was really interesting again we do not have time to go into all the details but they ask people to a generate word sets f relate to particular topics sports a and people talk about salk or football baseball gall et cetera and talk about someof the equipment and other things and then they had aa kind of a challenge ar cognive challege where by people had to link different concepts along different dimensions that you depart from the dimension of sport and you start thinking about yow sports that involve teams are sports thinvolve a ball et cetera and in the same conditions you can except for the fact that the ceiling height is differen eight feet or ten feet what one finds is that the kinds of language and the kinds of associations that people start to create are vastly different and they there actually two experiments in this study you are welcome to go look at it a was not just about sports there were some other a things that were analyzed as well and in the references of this paper it also points to other examples now of the cathedral effect which i find very interesting because as a vision scientists and somon who spends his life thinking about and indeed talking about the nervous system we know that our cognition follows our vision for low vision or blind people it will follow their mostly their hearing and to some extent their touch but fromost people who are cited as most people are cited ore cognition follows our visual environment what is this mean for work space optimization well most of us have a fixed ceiling a level in our in our home but you might have rooms in which the ceiling is higher and rooms in which the ceiling is lower if that were the case i recommend if you want to to creative work during phase to the nine to sixteen hours of ah your circadian cycle nine to sixteen hours after waking that is that you do that in the high ceiling room or maybe even out doors out on a deck or on a patio cause the highest ceiling of courses is the sky whereas if you are going to do detailed analytic work in i would suggest doing that during phase one of the day but even if you are going to do it during phase too of the day for whatever reason scheduling or other sorts of constraints that you do that in the lower ceiling environment now if you are interested in controlling your the height of your visu al world but you do not have control over your of the ceiling height of the environment that you are in there is another way to do that and i iase to observe this in the cafes in an round stamford in the barea where you would see somebody who a despite the weather would be in a hoodie may be with a baseball cap or other form of hat or some sort of blinder above their eyebrows which is actually another way of just lowering the ceiling height very very low and restricting your visual feel not unlike blinders that we talked about before that one would put on a horse or one would put on them themselves by restricting their visual angle of oaf focus to directly in front of them but not too far out beyond the sides of their head these cathedral effacts i think can be leverage toward doing particular types of work best and again the lower the ceiling or the lower your visual environment the more that one tends to do or pi should say performs detailed analytic work accurately and the more that one's thinking is oriented towards detaild sort of correct answer type work whereas when the ceiling is higher or there is no ceiling the more that the brain and the rest of the processing tat we call cognave processing is related to abstract reasoning brain storming and indeed can pull from broader swaths of memory resources because really what abstract reasoning is is its taking existing elements in and maneuvering them are arranging them into novel ways youcou thing about notes on a piano am playing a particular song learning scales that is very analytic there is a there is a correct answer that your trying to arrive at or generate whereas writing music or a writing poetry or generating a new material of any kind involvs taking existing elements rihte younucanese words that you do not have committed to your memory thatyou 're not aware of and arranging them in novel ways i think the cathedral ffact can be leverage and again you do not need to move into a different home or build a slanted roof and work at one side of the the room at one part of the day in the other side o the room the other although ey if that is the way you a you want a swing it that is great a most of us do not have that flexibility but it is very clear that the hight to the ceiling of the visual environment that werein has a profound effect on the types of cognive processes that we are able to engage now i'd to shift our attention to the auditory environment or the noise in the room or the music in the room or the music or noise in the headphones because it turns out that there is a lot of quality scientific data out there that speaks to weather or not listening to particular sounds can enhance our cognition and indeed the answer is yes but there are very particular types of things to listen to under very particular types of conditions that allow one to do that first off i want to say that people very tremendously the extent to which they can tolerate background noise for work in fact individuals will very tremendously from one day to the next or even within the same day the extent to which they can tolerate background noise i've experienced this myself there ben times in which have been working at home and i felt for whatever reason i just could not engage in focus and what worked to generate more focus for me was to go to a cafe or to a library or some place whe threis actually more commotion more people moving about made even more noise made even music in the room and we have to all be in touch with when we want more background noise or when we want less background noise there is no harden fast rule if you look across the literature for studies that involve complete silence or white noise or by noral beats or music or classical music are rockan rol you can find results to support any type of environment as being more beneficial however as well talk about in moment there are few types of environments to really avoid and a few types of sounds that really can enhance the cognition and your ability of focus in your work space environment across the board that really seem to work for all people let us talk about background noise to avoid and here we are talking about background noise to avoid because it actually can cause a pretty severe defisits in cognition there is a paper first author jordan love cool name a last author alexander francis the the title of the paper has to do with psychal physiological responses to potentially annoying heating ventilation and air condition noise during mentally demanding work which is a mouthful but basically what this paper identifies is a large datea set in which work place an environmental noise mostly the humming of air conditioners that is very loud or the humming of heaters that is very loud and on going just incessant does not let up can really increase mental fatigue and can vastly decrease cognive performance and if you'r interested in look in the cognive performance data the authors are banbury and barry two thousan in five that paper o is the one that supports the fact that cognive performance is worse when there is just the hum of an air conditioner in the background or the hum of a heater and otherwise complete silence there is also evidence which i descustd on the episode about hearing which is that in young children white noise can cause some mparments in the development of the auditory system now i do not want parents to freek out and if you are exposed to white noise as at as a sleep aid as a child which i know many of you wore a do not freak out but it turns out that white noise thet specially if it is loud white noise can caust some disruption an the auditory maps the representation of different frequencies of sound in the brain that can lead to some defisits in auditory and even language processing we really have to be careful about long term exposure extended exposure to white noise were and of a air conditioning noise that is really at a high level i would not worry if its in the background and shutting off and am turning on again as the thermistat kics oft and on but really chinavoid work in loud fan filled or ventilation a generating or heat generating environments because it really can cause damage to the auditory system long term and as we describe it can empair cognive performance and overall increase fatigue i think we have all experience that whenyou are in a room and there some on going background noise in oll son it stops and you just feel this enormous relief and the reason for this is that our auditory system has a parallel to or visual system in our visual system that light entering the eyes triggers the activation of those melonops and cells which trigger's activation of the hypothalmus a particular area of the hypothalns which generates alertness generates the release even of cortis all a stress hormon in the auditory system when there is on going sound your auditory system hear's that even if you are not paying attention to it if your pay attention tof something else it still registers those little haircells as there called in your inner year are fluttering that year drum is beating and in concert to that a to that sound frequency and thereis a brainstem mechanism that generates alertness and a kind of vigilant when you have a sound that is on going in the background it shuts off all sen you experience that pece which is the turning off of those brainstem circuits that are associated with vigilance the locus serulius which we talked about earlier which release apinefran and nor up in effrnt and generate that heighten state of alertness in your brain abody those narns then can turn off and you experience that is relaxation does that mean that we should not listen to white noise or pink noise are brown noise while were working certainly a lout of people do in fact ifyou want to know what white noise pink noise and brown noise are there just different constellations of auditory frequencies that are played together most of us think of white noise as the s on a screen in all the blacken and nwhite pictles going all around they call visual snow am but pink noise has certain sound frequencies notched out taken out brown noise has others it has diffent frequencies that are that are included at higher implitude at cetera you look the stuff up on you tob if you want egujust but brown noise none of its sounds terrific does not sound music ats literally just noise mixed frequencies and no particular rangement there is some evidence that playin white noise in the background or on headphones or pink noise or brown noise can facilitate cognition but it is mainly through an increase in this over all alertness as a consequence of areas locust serulias an other brainstomarias that are associate with autonomic arousal from that noise it is a lot the air condition or effect and i think done in a restricted way meaning not for ours and hours but maybe if youre focusis waning an your having a hard time engaging in work you might put on some brown noise or white noises or pink noise and work that way for forty five minutes or before you go to your paneramic vision walk and get some sunlight that should be fine thereis really no reason to suspect however that those particular patterns of noise are going to optimize particular mental functions what i'd to turn to next or particular patterns of sounds that indeed have been shown in purereviewed studies to optimize certain types of mental processing because you can incorporate these into your optimize work space en vironment through head phones or through speakers whatever mechanism that you want in order to get more out of your work efforts if you were to search for aps or go on line and try and find sounds that can improve thinking or change your emotions youare generally going to find three types one are called isochronic tones these are tones usually of a common frequency it might be a a beb and ten a pause nd then beb of the same frequency and then bebp forgive my aterrible beaping a i do not know what good beaping would sound but a contrast isochronic tones with monoral beats monoral beats would be repetted if almost prercussive beats delivered just one ear tuntutuntuntudududdududdudud this kind of thing that you can find aps that can deliver monoral beats you can find also aps that deliver called binoral beats can also find youtu scripts that or channels that will deliver binoral beats binoral beats as the name suggest are beats delivered to the two ears one pattern of kind of procussive beat to one ear and a different pattern that or at least a pattern that is out of fhaes that is not sinchronized delivered to the other ear on one ear you hear tududuududu and in the other ear you have got tunutu and what happens is because of the way that the auditory system converges in the brainstem and generates what are alled intereoral time differences i'll explain wit that means in a moment interoral time differences the difference between the two patterns of beats that are heard by the each of the two different ears leads to a third pattern that the brain in trains to and can a maps on to and generates particular types of brain waves ok i without going to a lot of detail interoal time differences are the ways in which if you were to hear something off to your right i just snapped my finger just to the right of my right ear that a signal arrives in my right ear before that sound signal those soundways arrive and my left ear there is an intereoral between ears time difference and there is a brainstem area in which signals from one ear and signals from the other ear converge and there is literally a math done by your nervous system that sas this signal arrived before the other signal and the difference between those signals is the interoral time difference if i were to snap my fingers on both sides on my left and on my right side at exact sime time and they arrive at the same time the nterol time difference s zero whereas if one goes first on the right and then the left of terrible snapping on the left it is a weak snap but it was there then there is a delay in the interold time difference has af particular value o ket you get it it is almost ridiculously simple binoral beats have been generated in wavs that create a particular pattern of interol time differences that then cascades up to the rest of the brain and puts the four brain and other airs of the brain that are involved in cognition and action into a particular rhythm and some of the rhythms or waves of brain activity ar ones that you may have heard of things alpha waves or thata waves or gamo waves now i do not to get to attached to particular brain waves as excellent for particular kinds of thinking this a something that was really popular in the nineties and two thousands when waves of measuring brain activity non invasively a with electrodes on the outside a enabled people to identify that indeed alfa brain waves are associated with alertnoss states and summar other brain waves that are kind of larger amplitudes slow waves ou now delta waves are associate with kind of sleepiness or relaxation but in general the way that the brain works is that different brainwaves are generated in different structures at different times in those combine to give us a sense of happiness or give us a sense of focus or give us a sense of creativity none the less if you look across the board at the studies of by noral beats and you ask what sorts of by norl beats appear to be useful for people to enhancs theire brain function for particular times of task we arrive at some very interesting answers will review what those are now the frequency of by noral beats that appears to bring about improved cognive functioning at the level of memory improved reaction times and improved verbal recall seems to be forty hurts now is it exactly forty hurts we do not know but if one wants to look up a great reference on this the reference coll zato c o l z a t o at all two thousand seventeen describes in herum i'm quoting o thas direct quote the present findings are in line with those of a recent study which also found faster reaction times in participante that listen to by nral beats of forty hurts and you can find many examples of this in the literature where by noral beats of about forty hurts or exactly forty hurts in some cases somehow brought the brain into a state that made it optimal for learning for memory and for certain types of recall including verbal recall math learning et cetera for those you that are interested in by norl beats a there are number of free aps out there are not in oa recommend any in particulary just have to search for one that om that you happen alike one thing tat you will find is that many of those aps superimposed by noral beats on to rain drops or ocean sounds or that rather they superimpose ocean sounds and rain drops on to the by noral beats that does not appear to be as effective as pure by noral beats there has been an exploration of lower frequency by noral beats for instance seven hurts which is tade up by noral beats done for thirty minutes with an overlay of rain sound or rain sounds only that is been analyzed and believe it are not that showed immediate recall memory with significantly decreats oci that is a negative effect of by noral beats on memory the idea that by noral beats are just great for us across the board i think is wrong it does appear that the higher frequency by nral beats as one moves up toward forty hurts are going to be the most beneficial there are instances in which for instance fifteen hurts by noral beats increased response accuracy on a spacial verbal memory task this is a complicated working memory task working memory is the kind of memory of rememoring a phone number if i say a for instance of fornine three two ninethree one and you have to remember that number keeping it on line is what we call your working memory it is likely tat you would forget that two or three days later you can get improvements in working memory with fifteen hurts bynorl beats whereas the other control conditions five hurts and ten hurts by norl beats all decreased accuracy of working memory however when i look at the literature and i examined a number of different studies whatei always seem to come back to was that forty hurts or plus or minos five hurts seem to be optimol for generating improvements in cognition in math performance ind even in our various types of memory recall and even in musical performance you might wonder well how can people two musical performace thetre listening to bynorl beats here is another surprise many of the studies that i looked at did not have people listening to by norlbeats while they were doing the tasks the memory task or the music learning et cetera they would do it beforehand for thirty minutes there were instances in which people where listening to by norl bets during the task but if you decide to employ by norl beats i recommend this forty hurts as a great place to start i do not recommend doing it for all of your workabouts i think there is it good reason to believe that you could attenuate to it but if you are going to try it you might try it both ways you might try listeng to bynorl bets for about thirty minutes while doing something else and then may be eating lunch or something in that sort or taking a walk and then going in to the workabout because remember the moment that you start listening to these by nolbeats the brain does not immediately switch into a particular pattern of oscillation or brainwaves it take some time norl circuits again take time to engage the only norl circuits that are going to engage instantly are going to to the ones that are of a sort of reflective sort you step on a sharp object whand you have to retract your limb or you suddenly are stressed by a the distressing tax messange or your suddenly delighted about a a delightful text message but when it comes to shifting your whole brain state toward optimizing work it takes a little bit of time again forty hurts binorl beats many many aps many you two scripts out there probably other resources for by norl beats hopefully zero costs you can acts ess those without any a need to to shell out any money if you fie one that you particular may be put in the commen sections o other people can find it that you too would be the best place to do that feel free to put a lancor just a description that would be wonderful and again you do not need to listen the by nrl beats at the exacting time that you are doing the work although that could also enhance your ictivity some of you out there might be craving a little bit more mechanism by which bynorl beats can influence things focus or reduced reaction time this is actually been explored this forty hrts by norl beats pattern seems to have an effect on what is called striadal dopomine we have dopamuis the normodulator of course involved in many things in motivation sashing bold in adaptation to light in the retina something that most people do not know but it is involved i movement which is why people with parkinsons who have a depletion of dopaminurons if she have movement depisits and on but stri itale dopamine is closely related to motivation and focus and forty hurts bynoral beats appears to increase stridal dopamine release and this is actually been measured indirectly by what we call spontaneous blink rate i've been accused and various instogram posts and even on this podcast of being a non blinker let us call it or a minimal blinker and as an important aside there is no evidence whatsoever that people that do not blink very much our sociopas or lie also you will hear that people who blink a lot our sociop has and are lying there is absoluly no evidence that blink frequency correlates with anything except alertness now longer blinks are associated with less alertness as we get tired we tend to blink longer and longer until we take the long blink that is sleep i gets the long blink would be death but the long isblink would be sleep but it turns out that the more firing of stridal dopamine nurons that is occurring the more frequently we blink and it is associated with a resetting of our visual window that is what happens when we blink and thereis a whole relationship between blinking and time perceptionthat we covered in the episode on time perception but here is the bottom line for sake of this discussion forty hurts bynoral beats appears to increase spontaneous blink rates because it increases dopamine transmission in the brainstem and in the striatum in several locations in fact and the way in which these by noral beats set a rhythm in the brain recruits dopamine release that dopamine release leads to heighten levels of motivation and focus wy motivation focus well dopamine is actually the substrate by which epinefern is made dopamine the molecules actually converted into epineferent adrenolin and they work together close cousins dopamine an epinferan in order to put us on a path of movement or if we are doing work of mental movement toward a goal that is a low bit of mechanistic meat to explain at least part of the reason why forty hurts bynoral beats can enhance our focus reduce our reaction times and improve indeed learning in memory next i'd to talk about the roll of movement in optimizing our work space and whether or not standing sitting lying down treadmilling or even believe it are not cycling can enhance our work output and performance before we do that i want a touch on two aspects of optimizing workspace that we will come up at some point in your work or school life alas there is not a lot of science around this but i think they are worth mentioning and i think i can offer a little bit of advice in terms of how to navigate these in a way that would be beneficial to you the first one is interruptions un if you go on line an you ask about a how to avoid interruptions people o say oce well if you ove kids at home or even if you do not or at work you have a light a cording wrecording is on were were busy now or have a sign on the door that says bother only in a case of emergency or find to knock or do not knock at all i've used the different policy throughout the years i an somebody who works pretty hard to control my time and focus but of course as e laboratory director i have people coming by and who want to talk about things and of course we have phones and we have computers and people's opportunity to reach us interruptions really are deadly to our ability to generate focus and it is notious about the distraction that occurs of say a minute or two minutes or five minutes when we were interruptiv it is also about the additional time to get those brain circuits re engaged to a mode of focus it is really kind of a double wame now none of us including myself want to be harsh or cruel or shut off from the world and oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insights and people are providing suppourt and very useful things that are essential to my workday ind presumably to your workday in schoolday as well but there is a simple method that i learned from my graduate adviser that works very very well igan no pure view dayto support it this is just my experience but this is somebody who had immense powers of focus had a very very demanding life a long commute to children stensive laboratory et cetera and what she would do was if i came by and asked the question or if any one came by and asked to question she would acknowledge their presence but would not shift her body toward them she perposely did not position her computer facing the door which i think is a deadly a ashes a deadly to focus o way of positioning your work space her computer was facing the wall the door was a perpendicular to that non't comeby in us i have a question soud say yes sheu acknowledge my presence but she would not actually orient her body toward me which told me that this conversation was not going to last very long and no matter how long i stood there what i asked she woul ever orient toward me which generally kept these conversations very very short we had other designate meetings were we would a be face to face the other approach which a i confess a colleagues of mine have used before a nocessarily at stamford but elsewhere is to a simply say no to everything that is somebody requests or comes by if some one knock on the door they would ja shout no through the door or if some one say can i bother you for a second they would say no or some one say i have something i want to tell you they would just say no and they would just continue doing this until the person went away that was actually very effective these were some of them most productive people i know not always the kindest people but some of them were very kind the other approach that i've seen and actually this is an approach a that was used by some one whos been a guest on the humorman ladpotcast some one who is immensely productive was that he som constraining the the who this might be by saying he he actually despite having the option o have a very large officse would place himself in a work space that was literally a coat closet cleared out with the desk small lamp completely dark this violates everything that i've talked about before a or prior to this everything about high ceilings bright light et cetera and would work still works underneath a desk lamp in a completely dark closet minimal ventillation this is my definition of hell and yet is one of the most productive people on the planet also very very hard to find actally know where his closet is not turns out he has several of them that he migrates from in order to avoid distractions i mention these this kind of extremes i thing that most of us exist on the other extreme and that is why i mention it which is that most of us some social engagement and and a welcome or at least set our work environment in a way that welcomes interruption and we have to be very very careful about this now in the digital realm i already mention of few of the things that we can do as practical tools to limit interruptions one is to use the programm freedom the other would be to simply turn off the wify if you dyou need to be on line and navigating you are doing research of any kind that is not going to be possible turning off one's phone i've at times put my phone phone on airplaine mode if that didnt work i've locked it in a safe i've done that i've left in the car outside it all depends on one's levels of self discipline which as you probably know from your own experience tends to kind of wax and wains sometimes we are better at avoiding these distractions than others if you find yourself in a place where it is very hard to reduce those distractions you may needy to go to on more elaborate lengths i will say that a graduate studen in my lab who was immensely productive in focus have the habit of coming in each day she would take her phone i do not know she turned it on off or not and show just place in the door excuse me in a drawer and would then go star doing experiments wet you experiments all day attend courses engage in discussions avidly with the rest of us and then would take her phone out at the end of the day and leave and i do not think that behaviour was not correlated with her immense productivity i think the ability to untether ourselves from the phone is going to be the way in which many of us are either going to succeed or fail in our various pursuits i'm somebody who engages on with the phone on a regular basis throughout the day for veri eus reasons but i do try and have large swaths of the day in which is either on airplain mode or it is completely physically separated from me n when i mean large swaths i might do every other hour with the phone on eir plain mode or even a two or three hour about where i just im simply not engaged with the phone at all is it better to sit or is it better to stand when doing work at least as it relates to focus in productivity and the answer is both been a number of systematic studies exploring what are called sit stand desks these are dests that can be set to a height that makes standing the best practice and then they can be lowered to a height that makes sitting the best practice or the easiest practice i should say and it turns out that just sitting is terrible for us and there is a enormous number of studies out there they pointod the fact that people who sit for five or six or s even hours a day doing work have all sorts of issues lay to sleep neckpain cognition sufferers there nmber party of ascular effects even digestion there may even actually be some almost pressure effects on the pelvic floor and things of that sort depending on the chairs that one uses but that people who stand are in a slightly better situation where many of those halthmetrics improve but that people that do a commination of sitting and standing at the same desk throughout the day or moved from one desk to another if they do not have a commination sit standesk that is going to be best the good news is its very easy to convert a sit desk into a standeskyan just stacks on boxes have done this at times or stack books there are allso some pedestals an things that you can purchase if that is o your preference in order to set your computer at a particular heighten of course there are desks that have motors and their ones that have cranks and their all sorts of variations both o in terms of the types and whether not they have motors as well as the costs to these things they can go from very low costic placing boxes or books as a to create a standing desk om to very high cost in some cases now what is interesting if you look at the scientific literature is that people who decreased their sitting time by about half each day they took let say they were working for a seven hours a day three and half hours of the that day they decide to stand and it is not even clear that it matters tat they do all those three hours in one bout or they divide that up into shorter bouts of a half an hour and then sit for half an hour at cetera alternating back and forth showed incredibly significant effects on reduced neck and shoulder pain increase in subjective health vitality an a work related environments and perhaps most importantly for sake of to day's discussion improvement in cognive conditioning and the ability to embrace new tasks and cognive performance there are several studies that if one wanted to explore they could a explore this and more detail i'll put a link to this as well a the article that i'm referring to is called effect of work place sit stand desk intervantion on health and productivity and i this paper because many of the papers out there focus on the effects of sit stand desks on health in tryng to get people to jburn more calories improve their posture relieve neck pain slumped over at cetera but not on productivity and this particular paper focases also on the metrics of productivity it has its own study and allso references ha number of important studies what does this mean for you and me well i've long used a standing desk or some variation thereof what this means is that we should probably spend about half of our work time standing and about half of it sitting but not all sitting or not all standing if you had to do all one or the other standing is going to be better than sitting what happens if we just stand well that can also generate some postural issues in terms of stableisation and fatigue ow i ihave a good friend a whose in the movement and a physical rehabilitation and physiology spaces in is kelly starett o these very impressive and all those tom domains and he always says s we were not design to sit all day but we also were not design to stand all day and i think that is true if we wern t look back at our species over on tensor or hundreds of thousands of years wed find that indeed we did sit down we did lie down it was not that we were standing all day long that said most everybody at least in the you ask is not getting sufficient cardy of ascular exercise or movement throughout the day and standing at one's desk can improve some of those health metrics and again can improve productivity probably because of those posteral effects thi talked about earlier that when we lie down there tends to be less alertness in our in our brainstem if you will there is less activation of those brainstem circuits involved in alertness and indeed the circuits that involveike kind of a calming effect on the body get activated and as we become upright standing or seat or sitting but especially standing then those brainstem circuits for a lerkiness kick on which are going to make it easier to remain focust if you are going to start standing for half of your work time you will notice that it takes a few days to adapt you will knowice a lot of shifting from side to side deffling on were comfortable shoes people do this on a wooden floor other people feel un comfortable lest there on carpet you have to figure out what works for you but it can take a litlebit of time to adapt av to say after now about ten years of working at a sit stand desk i find i cannot sit for two long before i one a stand and my standing bouts can be anywhere from thirty minutes to two hours sall thot twoughours would be aloul bit long and then i catch myself kind of leaning on the desk off to the side again the ideas to stand but not be leaning on the desk obviously for typing or your writing they will be some leaning involved but that is what the literature support there is also a literature on whether not physical movement under your desk meaning treadmilling or in fact there are now bicycles that allow people to peddle cond of a unicycel thing although not a unicycle under the desk can be beneficial for workplace performance let us take a look at what those day to say the study that i'm referring to has a first author fraud sham f are o d s h a m fraudsham at all this is a research article published in ploss one and the tytle of the article is does type of active work station matter a randomize comparison of cognitive and typing performance between rest cycling and treadmill active work stations the maseon the people do the science lonthng it is great where else would we get pure review data on these types of questions first things first there were no significant differences between cycling or treadmill work stations on any cognitive or typing out comes it does not seem to matter whether r not people are treadmilling under the desk these would be a stationary treadmills its a little convey or that people are walking on sometimes very slowly i i'm guessing some bye walk more quickly the new yorkers probably treadmill quicker the californians protly treadmill ill slower te californian i can make that quotinco choke but none the less there were no significant differences between that and a cycling station where people are sitting and peddling as they type away or as they work or as they are on phone calls et cetera really does not seem to matter if you are going to embrace these active work stations if a as they are called just decide what you would prefer to use it does not seem to mattern terms of outcomes now this study involved looking at a hundred and thirty seven young adults they had multipl cessions where they at first completed cognitive and typing tasks of these tests have different names and you'r welcome to look those up if you om as well as flanker tasks of these are tasks of attention and things of that sort and then they either engaged in treadmill or cycling and then there was a comparison and the statis were run and basically what they found was there was ay statistically significant improvement in attention and cognive control scores during any kind of active cession as opposed to just a mere seated session ciso they compared seted to cycling to treadmilling however verbal memory scores actually got worse during active sessions all repeat that treadmilling or the cycling wor stations improved artention and cognive control scores as compared to people that were just seated an workin however verbal memory scores got worse during the active sessions and again just to repeat there was no difference between cycling and treadmill work stations this is interesting i suggest that as the author say that active work stations whether walking or cycling are not only useful to improve coloric output and physical activity circulation and on but particularly when completing tasks that cognim tasks or task that require focus that do not require verbal memory recall now why verbal memory recall was negatively impacted and we do not know could be because people are breathing a little bit harder could be that there is something about walking in talking that seems a in compatible in the nervous system although i'm not aware of that i know nober people who can walk and talk at the same time but if you are going to explore these treadmills are you aregoing to explore these cycling stations you probably would not want to do that for highly verbal work maybe more for mathematical work or for analytic work or even creative work but anything involves very percyse or detailed verbal recall sitting or standing seems to be the better option and if you are wondering why cycling or treadmilling would enhants various aspects of cognition we can speculate i've talked before about this but any time we are generating forward movement through our own actions our own efforts typically if we are outside were not on a treadmill or were on bicycle or running or even on a motor cycle or in a car we have what is called optic flow and that optic flow is known to quiet certain areas of the brain that are associated with vigilance and indeed feare this is the basis of things e m d are i movement to sensesation reprocessing however the mere act of engaging what are called our central pattern generators the nurons in our brain st eminen our spinal cord that engage repetitive movements also can reduce some of the areas the brain their associate with anxiety and vigilant one pure speculation but none the less grounded speculation would be that tread milling or cycling at a desk would reduce anxiety that would allow performance to improve the other what i think is more likely explanation is that any time we are in ambulation we recruit the the release of neromodulators apinefrin dopomine and things of that sort that further increase over all levels of alertness i think that is the more likely explanation because it is hard to imagine how just a reduction and anxiety could lead to these improvements in cognition in a direct way whereas the subject in the study i just mention on average experienced in increase in cognive performances merely by movement nd and this does not include any optic flow because its stationary the tread mill or the cyclist stationary and we can rule out that optic flow and that points to the idea that when we are in movement we recruit noromodulators associate with the called particular activating system the striadal system and forth that would place the brain into some pattern i we do not know we h only can speculate some pattern perhaps its gammawaves or some other wave pattern that would engage heighten levels of focus and attention none the less treadmilling cycling at a dusk does improve cognition we have been discussing work space optimization with the understanding that you are not always going to work in the same place every day what have tried to do is give you a set of high potency tools that can improve your focus and cognition and to place that within a frame work for particular kinds of work let just re view some of the basic elements of what we cover to day first of all in the first part of your day that zero to nine hours after waking you want bright lights especialy overhead lights as bright as you can keep them without feeling uncomfortable or certainly not without feeling any pain in your eyes or elsewhere in your body bright lights make for the maximum state of alertness in addition try ind place whatever it is that your focusing on directly in front of you but not have it extend too far out to either side of your eyes trying generate a fairly restricted visual window as we call it and if you can trying place whatever t is your focusing on at least at nose level or above it might take some engineering or some a ingenuity in creativity in order to figure ow to do that but that is going to be most beneficial try and avoid reclining try nd avoid sitting try and stand for at least half of your workday that is a good goal and it may take some time to work up to that goll in addition if you are going to use sound as a stimulus for increasing focus and alertness try and avoid exposure to white noise pincnois of brown nuois for extended periods of time for more than an hour or that might actually be damaging to the auditory system and at the very least is kind of stressful even hough you might not notice it its kind of a background level of anxiety in stress that is not going to serve your well rather if you are going to pursue particular types of sound frequencies consider using forty hurts by norl beats not monorl beats but forty hurts by norl beats done juring a particular work bout or for thirty minutes prior to that work bout i would not rely on by norl beats all the time every day i think that could cause them to lose their potency just because of the way the auditory system attenuates and actuallyofve experience that a tenuation the mere fact that you can go into an environmentwhere there is an air condition or blowing blowing blowing that it stops and you feel that relaxation but you were not thinking about the air condition r before tells you that your auditory system had kind of attenuated to it and yet it was still impacting your system you were sensing it we would say but not perceiving it there are other things that you can do to improve your work space optimization such as standing for half the day as i mention before but if you are interested in this or you feel it suits you to treadmill finest stationary treadmil that you can walk on i've never tried this before i maybe after this episode given what i've read in the pureviewed research and its pretty compelling that treadmilling seems an interesting a way to a increase alertness and cogna of performance i'm not sure that would do the cycling method si cannot imagine just cycling and typing the same time that sor feels the youknow i ecsou can do the rob your tummy pat you top your head cun a thing but a it still feels a low bit of a a a sort of a cognative motor collision for me a for whatever reason but that is just my bius i do know how to wride a bicycle but anyway you pick your preference some other things that you could do in order to improve your work place performance would be to consider the cathedral effect if youre going to do analytic work for any part of the day fase on or face to as i describe them but really in any time of day that detailed analytic work for which there is a correct answer learning scales of music learning mathematics trying to figure out the solution to a problem where there is indeed a solution in could be an into personal problem as well then trying get into an environment with a relatively low celing if you do not have access to a low ceiling environment you might consider using a brimmed hat or even a hoodie or even just facing down or even putting your hand above a above your eyes as you will as a at the level of your of your eyebrows inother words lower the ceiling that is the basis of the cathedral effects of on analytic performance in contrast if you are interested in doing brain storming creative work you are writing new things youre creating new things of any kind art work consider getting into a high ceiling or no ceiling environment or if you are wearing a brimmed hat or your wearing hoodie may be peel that back again the data within the pureu literature are there to support these sorts of practices and f you would to start layring these protocals by all means please do that there is no reason why you could not do one or just two of these protocals there is no reason why for instance you could not use by norl beats and trying get into a low ceiling environment to do detailed work a couple times a week but you could also employ all of theats now of course there are an enormous number of other things that you can do to improve work performance and productivity and i've talked about those in previ s episodes in particular in the episode on focus and thepisode on motivation there are supplements you can take that can increased dopemine for instance they are or tools that you can use to increase your focus for instance focussing your visual attention on one location for thirty to sixty seconds prior to entering at focus work about this has been shown again and again the work from emily balsetis at and why you in the episode on focus i sided a number of studies where this is actually been tested and deployed in various schools having kids do a focus task where they look at a particular visual target for thirty sixty seconds then doing some mathematics and seeing pretty impressive improvement in focus and attention even in people that have attention epis at iper activity disorder and on there is no reason why you cannot and should not combine the sort of practical work space optimizations solutions that we talked about today with the kind of nurl optimization solutions that we talked about in the episode on focus and the episode on eighty eight in the episode on motivation by all means layr those together that is how you are going to achieve the optimal focus bouts that is hat you are going to achieve the optimal creativity abouts i do want to acknowledge again the fact that i realize people are showing up to this challenge of work space optimization with different budgets with different constraints some be life kids at home there are lot of interruptions some people do not none the less i hope that the information i was able to provide to day will allow you to make subtle or may be ven drastic rearrangements in your work space environment there is one other point related to that that i did not cover and that i to cover just briefly which is that there is nothing to say that you have to always work in the same location all the time you can move from house to cafe if that works for you you can move from offis to home you can also move from different locations within your home i have a brief anecdote about this i to attend a lot of scientific meetings when a lot of scientific meetings were in person and there were always a few individuals that seem to stay engaged throughout these very long meetings you were talking seven eight hour days sometimes evening sessions and sometimes these meetings would go on for youfour five even six days these ware long meetings and the quality of talks very tremendously and iways notice the individuals that man sho stay engage and awake for the entire meeting and i notice that people that could maintain high levels of alertness in this one conference room had a habit of moving to a different seat after each session sometimes even between talks and i actually discuss us with one my collegus who as doing this i said is this conscious are you always moving from place to place in s a yef is just stay in one place andi just look from this one particular visual angle at the screen i find after one or two talks regardless of how interesting the talks are that i start tic and of drift my mind is't does engage in indeed sometimes can fall asleep and i started this practice of moving from space to space or i shoulds a seat to seat within an auditoryment it works quite well nd i think it works quite well because again of the relationship between our visual system driving the majority of our con gnition right our visual system drives ar thinking and that novel visual environments are going to lend themselves to heighten levels of alertness i do not want things to be novel and scary or threatening or anxiety provoking or loud that they draw your attention away from your work but i think this is part of the reason why turning on music or moving to an office or a cafe or an outdoor environment from an indoor environment or vice versa theye even within a single day can bring about more heighten levels of productivity i'd also to acknowledge that what i covered to day is most certainly not exhaustive for all the types of workspace optimization tools that one could create for that reason i love for you to suggest any of your work space optimization toolsthat you found useful please put those in the comment section on you too that woill be the best place than other people can see them also read through those and perhaps in a future episode i'll call about some of the ones that i have tried on the basis of your suggestions if your learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribed

jobidin travels to elaska for nine eleven while sinding he six billion dollar give way to the eronian mullas the fifth circuit smacks down the white house for interfering with free speech and re publicans seek new ways lose the house of representatives i'm been shpure this is the menscuro sho to day showsponser by express at vipian thousands of my lissters have already secured the nt rotata join them express pe pianza cams lashman jobidon not a god president not with it and his plan on nine eleven was somewhat puzzling he was invy at nom and he want to fly back to the united states instead of presumably delaying the the rest of his nine eleven sort of tribute remarks he decided to fly to alaska from veatnon because the shorter flight and hen he was going to do some sort of memorial for nine eleven in alaska which is really related to nine eleven in idena that there is no relation he is an alaska and say decided that he is going to do inevent in alaska at this event an alaska he paid tribute to john maccan which again i mean that that is nice but i do not know what that has to do with nine eleven persa and then he tried to do th by partisonship rotine which is kind of amazing considering tht he is called half of americans the kind of people who wish to overthrow the democracy but sure here as the president of the united states yesterday on an a day of national unity for nine eleven wat they always mired abour com pusa he put duty to contret first taska i purperay did apo party apo politic apon is ou perso tes ta reminds us fe must never lose that sats of nastor utity sslet that be the comben caus abour om bu us o suptemper eleven by re knowing our faith in one another let us remember who we ares idation it is true he did put duty first just as what jobinn was doing during the ve unonmore he receive five student draft ot to fermen's first as an under graduateat the university of delawareand the later as a law student at sircuse university and then after a metical examin april sixty eight whichwould hav made him eligible for the draft he received in one why classification which men he could only be drafted in a national emergency why because he had childhood ouse maso i' just ta a quick contrast there between john mccane who jobidon ran against remember jobidon was the vice presidential candidate for barokobama in two thousand eight i nowit is now decade an a half ago but that is a thing that actually happen and during that campain jobine was not supernized to john mc canbut put aside all of the mccan the the real thing here that that canna sticks in the craw is jobidon talking about national unity because he is not even remotely unifier he is not some new cares about unity hes some who pretends to care about unity but the reality is that he his pursued the furthest left to genda of any president of my life time andthat actually includes barokobama the stuff that he his attempted to do in restructuring for example student lones unalaterally from the executive branch the stuff that he is attempted to do in cramming down vaxines on eighty million people the osha the insane levels of spending he has pursued post covit the the insane a mouns of money that heis poured down the rat hole of environ mental causes while in flating the currency and all the stuff is dramatic expansions in terms of the size and scope of government and he is bothen on form policy as well plushe is just an insult a i have to say jobidn istrust an insulting person i mean i know that a lot people an left to look at donal trumpet tas sas donal trumpets an insulting person he insults the intelligence and he is vulgar and he is rude and all this kind of stuff jobidon is humiliating in the different sort of way jobidon is humiliating because jobiden is a corrupt politician who lies regularly he lies all the time went when jobidon opens his mout the lies flow forth bobbles from the mouth of mosthenys an he jus the the only thing that comes out of his face hole is untruth yesterday during nine eleven he was talking bat he jst cannot help himsulf he starts talking about hout he was out the round zero site the day after nine eleven that is clearly not true even jo jurshall be bushton go to ground zero until nine fourteen soe just making things up here becaus this is what he does and he knows that the mediar never an hold him accountable because when he was younger the meht if held him accountsable when there are other democrats who is running against but now he is the president of the united states and the rule is that if you are a democrat who is the president of the united states nothing you say wi'll ever be used against you it is the opposite of criminal justice an anything you say can or will be used against you well i mean for jobidon one youre the presidents of th unitedstates in yor s democrat nothing you say we will ever be used against you in any contect here is jobidn just tongu lies about nine eleven broser your i remember ste nex te looki at the gilde out dot out lookin through the g to hell i look tevist i the ware o tar to what sten oh you mean tolook bad nine eleven and he knowex ust to o i suppose the rest of us who saw images of nine eleven and all it but and this is who jobidon is now all of this we just becan normal political garbagio all this wujust be me except for the fact that on the anniversary of nine eleven jobidon thought this woul be an excellent time to sin he six billion dollar check to the aronian mullas now the juxta position of nine eleven in that is pretty awkward not because the aronians participated in nine eleven not because all kito was shee a they are not their soone terrogroup but because the over all thesis which is that if you give money and resources and sucker to is lomateris tht eventually that is going to come back and bite you in pretty significant ways that is one ofh big messagers of nine eleven if not be biggest message f nine eleven and on that day the president who e handed afganistand back to all kita that is what he did handed at back to the taleban and backwal kita is now hading six billion dollars to the leading provaca tours in the midleeast the greatest terresponsors on the planet in aron that is what he did on the anniversary of nine eleven me just for optical reasons youwould think that he had a brain in his head to think it may baish waiht a week but no he had to do it now because jobidon wants a deal wit te aronians a broader deal with the aronians why lesse can put it on his resma in the same way that he wanted to pull out of afganiselic a mooreon becaus he wanted it on his resmade not because thought would act to be good fer the world tnot because gesshe hat a plan he did not but because he wanted to say that he was the guy who got it done never put it above politicians never put below politicians for them to do things just out of pure egotistic desire they want it on the resimate an s they just do it it is not because they have the best interests o th country at heart that is clearly noth caseere jobidon does not have the best interest the country at heart when send to six billion dollar check to people who have ben responsible for the death of literally thousands americans and midlest remember during the rock war it was ouronian sponser shate malitias they were killing american soldiers an jobidon is signing those you will six billion dollar checks on the anniversary of not eleven well paying tribute to the heroes of nine eleven it is just it is beyond

what is this deal that jobidan apparently signed yesterday according to the washington post the bidonadministration has now issueday waver for banks to trans for six billion dollars in frozen aronian oil funs without fear of your sanctions a keys step and securing you release of five american citizens detained in oron people familiar th matter sed a's part of the arrangement the administration will release five aronian citizens detains in the united states it just to make this clear hi's not even a straight up trade of aronian citizens detain in the united states because we believe that they are involved in say terrer activities for americans who have been wrongly detaineds in er on its im di strap trade it is that plus six billion dollars i got a say jobidon's record here is lookin alolic y the g am of the yurk jats at this point e e e's triting britny griner for the merchants of dath and now he is trinting six billion dollars and five aronians we are holding here for five american citizens i just ave question what exactly would be the incentive for terro scroups not to take american citizens tostage at this point that the the sucker in the white houses gen a sign you over the bank if you do tha the central principle of do not negotiate with terrus obvious there is play around the edges their sixh certain situations where negotiations are necessary but one of the key elements here is you do not acturally n go shit wilh terrorists to the tune of six billion dollars pluss five detainees in the united states for five people wrongfully detained in aron that is crazy talk congress was notified of the move on monday it is likely to come as releef yuus prisoners families in supporters say the washing ton but well is nothat nict a meant listen i want those people back as well also the united states has national interest those national interest you nonvolve giving six billion dollars to the worlds leading terroresponsors my god it is also expected to come under harsh priticism from re publicans in congress ippose to any agreement that allows for the release of frozen aranian funds money that is now being transferred from south caree to cutzar and limited for the purchase of humanitarian goods fooder madicon i kyt that is the part that isalizes there saying i's goin to be for humanitarian purposes there is only one problem the aronians immediately said none no you would understandwhrt ont use whrever we please according to enbisinews aronian president ebno hum r iisi said his government will decide how it will spend six billion dollars in previously frozen funds do to beg do to be released in a prisoner exchange sat itwll be spent quote wherever we need it oh you mean you aregoing to spend it to murder people because that is what you do becauseyou would rather thatyour country be impoverish and you'r people unhappy then that you actually stop with the terro crap and start building that is what you would rather do if you are the the evil regime in teheron in a exclusive interviewn tatron raasy suggested the americans held in eron would be coming home soon saying the us aron prisoner exchange yot will be completed into time that the american detaineese were in very healthy condition under the arrangement tawteron will be granted access to the roughly six billion dollars in aranian oil revenues tyous officials are lying and there saying onor no they are only go gt use it for food recks that iswhat they do if you had money to dictatorial ruchimes tho hate your gots probably they use it exactly where youres if there is one thing about the aronians its that we can trust them they have never a natgonadyall ever if for example tey say they are developing new clear power for peaceful purposes despite the fact that here one of the great oial producing regions on planet earth tyou probably have to believe them that is frolly they would never deceive say the i i they' never ever do that sort of thing i love that rai se s just saying the quiparte out loudy's yat no where using it whatever we want that is how little the aranians even respect jobidon thelike yah you give us the money and then you go lid your people and you tell them that we will use it for for good purposes food or something and not then i'm going to say publicly on american t v i'm no use it however i want screw you old man am that is that is effectively what thits is rasy said aron would have authority over how the money would be spent quote this money belongs to the aronian people the aronian government the as lonic republic oferon we will decide what to do with this money he was ask directly by lesterholt if the money would be used for other purposes a part from humaniterianes and ar acy said quote i whoov this youmanitarian means whatever the aronian people needs this money will be budgeted for those needs and the needs of the aronian people will be decided and determined buy the ronan government oh that that is a classic right there that is such in amazingly i a kind of lov it because it is blatent that is you give e a craticard and you tell me m i'm i'm working for daily ware you gim meat dailyware creticart you tell me i need to go use it for daily wire resources riton what you mean is you want me to go down to the local to the local office deebo than pick up some paper an ank and mike oh for dailywire resources perfect that credicard belongs to me i'm going to use it for whatever resources the daily wire deems necessary and who deems it necessary will be me tan sude is gone pot a lambo on the credicard tht's effectively wit they'r doing except in rawn for the government a lambo is just a bunch of shoulder fire missiles that that is that is what it is the prisoner exchange calls for the release of five american citizens held in aron and return for five oronians under tention in the anited states and again gives them six billion dollars the five american prisoners were placed under house arrest august tenth as a first step in the agreement the mine dministration waited until of coure september eleventh to inform that just the optical this this is what happens when you have a white house that legitimately does not care what the american people think and believe that the medea will cover for them to matter what they do crap this on the aniversary of not eleven assuming that everybody will just shrug an maybe the're right maybe everything is baked into the cake in's the polarized cake that nothing can outrage the american people at this point i do not acthiething that is i a mazing bat i think jobidon made that bet on af kannistan and it is sunk his approval ratings into the lo into low fort es high thirities and he is been their ever since 'sidthing the sortis of candamage jobidon i know that he thinks he is invulnerable because he is likely to run againstonal trump for president and there is some truth to that that means a durable forty five percent of the american public will certainly vote for him but forty five ainht fifty sees playing a very risky game here by the way speaking of a white house that clearly does not care about american defense according to politico president jo bidon would veto a rightling to fence funding bil tat's slated to be considered on the house floor this week according to his administration what makes it right wing what makes a right wing that the republicans are saying we do not want tax pair dollars used to fun peoples travel to other states to get abortions cas last i chact when i pay for military buget typically when i'm paying fort is the basic medical care of the people or serving the american military they can go an break things in kill people that american needs to breakin kill in ord to maintain its own security b that is what it is for but the white houses nenno unlessyou can to spend that money on abortion in the military were jus not con asign it where sicon a sign it i'd rather under fun the militaryif its not ounto pay for abortion is the white houses position here theadministration says including to visive policy provisions within the repropriations bill also dramatically increases the threat of a continuing resolution which rd further damage america's national security again all that was here is that house republicans included provisions to block funding for the pensagon's policy of allowing troops to travel for abortions as well as surgery and hormone treatments for trans military personel the the therepublicans are one increase the military pbudget you now to spend on military things but here is ar not paying for you to take your babies where nother state to kill it and you to cut ff your those othe things were noct con to pay for t her'sa complete list of things were nt con to pay for and hewite houses no you will pay for people cutting off they are they are balls that is a thing you will pay for or there will be no restock ng on the black hawks which which partycares bout national security in the situation'm jus wondering you are clearly holding hostage america's national security see can cut the balls off dudes that is what you are talking about right here which is nuts i'm sorry by any moderate stretch of the imagination that is crazy and as far as the abortion policy if your parent dies out of state and you go out of state to visit your your grieving mother becase you are dad died the military is not gon a pay for that but if you go out of state to take your baby twa to a in abortion clinnic and get it killed then jobiton says that must be paid for by the merican taxbat now re member for most of jobidon's cueer he is big backer of the called higdt amendmen which band legislation that use tax pair funning for abortion he is decided that is no longer the case now you ought to pay for that abortion again thes in the person them sell paying for tyou it is you paying for the abortion it is mepang for te abortion and th media of course play this as thugh it is the right word tendings the tending tilt of the of the spending bill the right were tilt of the spending bill they apparently the bill is a non star with senet democrats it is just it it is incredible it is absolutely incredible this is what they are holding up clearly in ad ministration tht cares deeply about american national securityes hinning six billiot yes see yes six billion dollars to the eronians no money 's the military unless it is also going to pay for a woman to have a facpinus soed to her clear our priorities are absolutely clear here and just one second we will get to the fact that again jobin is inhudibly vulnerable and the offenceis of him by his allies are gowing weaker and weaker when we talk about abortion here and the fact that democrats want to fundit we should point out that abortion continues to rage across the united states by some numbers is actually elevated this year becaus there is many people hore free to out about the possibility they will not be able to abort their baby that they are trying tactic do it right now but there is a way that you can help prevent this and that would be by giving to preborn preborns network of clinnics experiences over two hundred miracles per day preborn gives women ith un plan pregnancies free alls for sounds introducing them to the beautiful life growing inside herwom one she heares the hartbeat the chance of her babies life doubles becase of your generosity preborn can do all of this for just twenty eight bucks per altrasound all gifts are tacteductable and go entirely to saving babies some day you might meet a baby that yourescued maybe they will save a life the way the you have to day one thing is for sure you are not on rogret saving a life because life is indeed mericale and can do it for not a lot of money il ef to do is donat by diling poundy fifty and sa keeword baby that is pound two five zero baby orgle to preborn dot calman slashmen that is preborn dot calm slash benyurno can do anything remotelyas important adaygo t preborn dot calm slashben and give generously ocaso give in the fact that this administration is in fact a bleapcho and most that bleap is is is apparence in the forn policy rom the met'sic policy's bad enough but you can spins master policy on on a foreign level what american is in favor of sinning chint checks the uronians what america and what it what american is in favor of putting american national security it ris som person with generat is foria can be shot up with testosterom what what exactly is that is the balance there that americans are in favor of well the defences of biding are now coming fast and fierst when you are defending your losing the someming both partie you remember by the way the republican partis remember this with trump if you spend the rest of the election ychle tdefending trump you are going to lose because again if everybody's talking a how bad your guy is and you just spend the entire time talk about how he is really not that bad ou gana los and for democrat's th same thing if you spend the entire election cychle talking about jobidon is not that bad we all know he is to here is anan of our trying to do work on h behalf of the bide administration talking bout it it is all is al fac it is all in your head this is one i favorede approaches from the genius is over the view is stuffty you can clearly see happening in front of your eyes is not real becaue anan of ar says tit administration has really gotn a ton of very difficult by part of ton legislation throug in a divided congress whet the very difficul fana make up o fiftificty by part of ta infostructior about by part of ten fath communitys ac first major cn legislation an thatcate you as a novation and competition a by part o tan climate heal caran tacpapige fithful resposabilitiac and the list is long whan o they ne to focas on mani to focas on the on tenible job bidon is old and thats the narrative that ben created to cas panican acful and that is o what the fecon part of that naritiv job bidon is old and comla haris is unprepared i'm a that is not a narrative jobidon is old and jobiden is also terrible at his job he is terriblit is job it meanwhile they are trying to clear the field against any potential democrat might run against jobide mexs agan he is intensely vulnerable here is the thing that that if you were truly a rebel as for example alexander o cosequetas believes she is if you are truly a rebel then you would run at yobide from his left you would cay know alexandra ocosocretas she is thirty three years old i believe that she would be theo ratically ello able for the precidency the truth is that she could easily pick up the ball where burniny sanders left off and run against jobden from his left because he is really really vulneral but none of them are doing it why beause the democratic party is in fact a vehicle for radical leftism this is the difference between the right and the left in troms their parties rewingers do not trust the re publican party beause they do not believe it is vehicle for their ideas democrats trust the democratic party because they do believe that is a vehicle for the principles that is why ther all standing shoulders shoulder behind the old man meanwhile that old man is using the white house as ha military weapon again social media wll gets that momentarily first we have a great dog his name is happy he is incredibly cue oneof the best things about happy is that he really allows my kids sojest ghat rub

mydog thirty three that is eight threy three my dog thirty three o ga meanwhile the bine administration for fraudtog about the doing on the foreign front on the domestic front what the bine demnistration has done with regard to social media is one of the most creepy and tyrannical things that i've seen in my lifetime an extends the truth is beforebidon i di the governments use of its powers to cudgel social media into doing what they want is utterly insang this is something that the fifth court c explicated over the weak end on friday they limited the scope of district cort ruling ther re stricted communications between goverment agencies and social media companies but they found that several agencies likely violated the first amendment this should be top of page news and in en ero where the media actually cared about freedom of speech which they cleadarly do not at this point of would be top of the page news and whent when when donald trump was saying things the preson the enemy the bala anemall we go was this an attack on the first amendmentits unamerican how can you say that the're not enemies of the meanwhile you have actual government agencies going to social media websites and telling them to shut down fully certain stremes of information andthe metis because if the mainstremedia agrees with a thing it becomes truth if the mainstremedia disagrees with a thing it becomes falsehood and it would be good if that thing were supprissed well here is the thing makingthe argument the social media is a private entity and can make its one rules that carries only far as the government is not pressuring the private entity into doing the thing one toory government agent you cannot do that thing if the govrment puts guns your head and tels you to do a thing you are now a government agent that means that whatever you do is attributable to the governments of the government ghose to social media and they say to them either you regulate to speech or we regulate you which is effectively with democratsmen saying sinceabout twenty eighteen if they say that sort of thing this turn social media companies into operations of the government once their operations of the government then the pressure that government brings to bear is in factiviolation the firthe first amendment which is exactly whit the fifth circuit court of appeal says according to s un b s the ruling will make it easier for several federal agencies to communicate with social media companies still officials who remain subject to the modified injunction including goes in he white house must reman careful their discussions with the platforms will not be construe as coercive a three judge panel of the fifth circuit court of appeals concluded that the white house surgeon general's office and f bey likely violated the first amendment by coercing social media platforms into moderating posts on their sigts it also said that the sed c likely violated the first amendment the appeals court decision says that some federal agencies will not be subject to the injunction but they did say and it isthat it is a pretty amazing ruling they did say that the pressure brought to bear on social media companies by the federal government is a violation of the first amendmentwhich it clearly is and that pressure is obviously continuing here is the thing once that yu neas out a battle the campy undone let us say that the cedycy is not pressuring any more but the messages arety out thare the pessure exists the threat is already out there if alcopone threaten to burn down your bar because you would not pay the protection money and he did that a year ago if probly sook in to pay him the protection money even after a court says heu really should not do that andthat is effectively its happening right now according it to the washington post threads is currently blocking searches on the topic of covid and vaxines instogram's texbase social platform threads which is supposed to be the anserts you twitter rolls out it is new search function but not even twenty four hours later the company was in brldin controversy when users went to threads to search for content related to covit and long covid they'r ment with a blank screen that showed no search results and a popa linking to website of the cedy s nowt i's about government pressur habout the government pressuring social mediun to shutting down actual social media posting an just linking directly to the governments that is e're welling in crap meda acknowledged in a statement to the washington post that threads is intentionally blocking those search terms and seid other turms are being blocked as well the company did not give a list but those words include sex newed gore porn o case far i suppose all right and then corona biraspacines an vacination those are blocked now you will be delegate you w'll be directed explicitly to government sources the search functionality temporarily does not provide results for cuers that may show protentially sensitive content is owt potentially sensitive content because god forbid you should get the non government side of the stors since the government was absolutely honest with us during the coved rgine i men there are there being stonest with us now now that youve got the white house promoting masking again amazing stuffhere and and the fact that that is not a national scandal tdemonstrates more han anything how korupt the mediar these again the media yououd imagine would be profirst amenment well not much ok you' imagine that all this would be wind in the sales for republican's going into twenty twenty four after all this is terrible governments this is terrannical use of social media the american pople are not up for all this all republicans have to do is be not stupid well oops republicans always have a way of a of doing dumb things all the talk right now about how kevermc carthy is going to be basically deprived of his speakership i'm just wondering what is the upside i kep askness a'veben asking the since there is the original rebellion against mc carthy it is one thing to leverage mc carthy for more consessions the conservative side of the ow that is fine that is a strategy the haft people land the plan it is not a strategy what if we get rid of mc carthy and then we have no one to back him up what f we yus have a randum speakership fight people can get ontevy this sort of stuff is deeply un helpful according to politico cev mc carthy is facing the greatest peril to his speakership since he clawed his way into the jobate months ago with multible factions of his party futing and a looming revolt ahead during a battle to fun the government altora con servative members of the house coppe are talking in unsuttle terms about turning on mocarthy aif he does not take a hard line in negotiations with the senateand the by deministration at let me just point out here jo biden in the senate all they have to do as say we are willingto negotiate in the not negotiate in order t win this battle they made a crucial tactical blunder during the last round of these negotiations jobidon pre committed beforehand to not negotiating that gave mc carthy rooms say that he was the negotiator and eventually by n had negotiate the rule in these sorts of political bringsmanship situation is that the american public our pro which ever party shays thel come to the table and you say y will not come tot table then alike you if you are already starting off with were not coming to the table and the unless is something that you are certainly not going to get from the democrats well then the democrats probably win that in the battle of public opinion mc carthy according to politico is a political survivor even his critics cannot and i his skilled nature as an accommidator his persistence in winning over even his most doget t criticts but interviews h more than two dosen shuup he members an ades reveal hitwold take only a few rogue law makers hell bens on his downfall to risk mc carthy's fatin an entirely new way sending ther party spiralling into new periotive cass even if those tefectors failed to actually eject mocarthy some ofthe speaker's confidence privately conceided there may be no way to recover according to bob good is avocal mc carthyte totractor he says the speaker faceis two choices he stares down the senate stairs down the white house forces them to cave in is a transformational historic speaker or he can choose to make a deal with democrats not let me just be clear about this there is no situation which he deals not cot wit democrats you do not won dtor why because the president is a democrat is the senate what is amazing to me is it i am morefiscally conservative than virtually every one in congress i also happen to live in this world called reality where you do not get to unia latterally dictake the terms of engagements when the other side hold most of the cards the president has vedo power the presidenthasi the entire media on his side an can fight this battle you can say whilliug now the president really should cave on this and should really cave on this and you might beable to price certain consessions away from bydon they are able to do this last time they got some small concessions from him but if you are talking about affectuating large scale change with a democrat president and a democrat senate good luck to you by the way would have been really helpful here is winning that would been superhelpful if you actually want to effectuate large skall change noft be great controlling the house of representatives cguies that be asum zollin folk is on running good candidates in swing district hell why do not we focus on nominating the most electable republican for president lizzinghan drive out democratic turn out that might be away to actually effectuate large skale change or is the idea here they just yell at your leadership class and in and if you yelled tom long enough than magic happens i i do not know but honestly it is it is one of these bazar tweets where the logic goes something step one yellow your leadership step too dot dot dot step hree fiscal conservatism wy the dotottot is the whole thing guies you need to figure out exactly what your strategy and your play here is again i'm not saing you count leverage mc carthian to bein more can servative i'm fined with that i think that is good i think pressure from his right is a good thing the point i makingis tat if you start off with a series of demands that are utterly unrealistic and and if theire people in the conservative egosystem and te conservat immediate egosystem who suggest that government shut downs are goig to be a wave toward political victory here with a democratic senet and democratic president when at deal as can get sign i do not understand what exactly the upside is what republican all republicans need to provide right now is a sense of sobriety is the sense that they know what they are doing all i'm asking for as always is a plan that is it give me a plan a ah i do not any republican strategy that is not a strategy at all its an impulse if t if the if the impulse is yell at mc carthy until good things happen that is not a strategy and it is not a plan if the impulse is nominate whomever and run them against biding without any plan for victory what is the plan if the plan is shout that the last selection cycle was stolen and then have know plans to actually reverse that or explain even how you would attempt to do that is not a plan that is an impulse impulses do not make for political victory no democrats have continuously plans it is what they do professionally for example according to politico in he past nine days state and federal judges through out two congressional maps and help the democrats of what a worse case inareo in ohio kicking off an unusually busy redistrict an calendar heading into the election year all told a dozen or more seats across at leas six states could be re drawn in creasing the likely ho democrats could chip away the five seat geop e housematrorty through re districting alone democrats could pick up an extra seat including in florda allabama and louisiaing teir deep bred states perhaps several more in new york wrepublicans could still pic up as many as forceats o north carolina but the recent rulings put democrats in a position to offset some of those losses and then sum again they are finding judgis who are overthrowing these districts that are drawn and then they are basically creating democratic districts that is what they are doing right nout that is a plan when republicans by theway play the game they can win his the other thing is this notion out there that republicans cannot play the game ics the game is riged bet an when it comes to balla harvesting yes republicans can play tat game and they can win that iswhat happen in florted during the last election cycle yes the judiciary was rigged against republicans and then republicans created the federal af society and spent thirty years building up an entire bench of judicial nomines and then too control the suprim courk yes you can do this but it requires actual plans i understand that the easiest thing in politics to think for to day and maybe for to morrow but never for ten years for now that is not going to achieve it and and here is the big question what exactly do expect mc carthy to do mc carthy's actually giving us what we want i say us to conservative not from o spending which is not capable of doing and no one's capable of doing anby the way i do find it ironic that many of the same people who are shouting by hamocarthy is not sufficiently conservative unspending our talking about the wonders of of for example president trump who says we should not restructure social security medicar ormeticade which are the biggest spending programs in american life barnon but put that aside mc carthy is in fact moving toward n im peachmen inquiry if that something you care about mc carthy's doing it according to fox news ceve mc carthy will tell house republicans to day beginng an im peachment inquiry against bidon is the logical next step the house jop conference plans to hold the meeting on thursday morning for a kee committe chairs to lay out their latest findings and the status of the investigations into the bitdon family house judiciary committe chairman at representive jim jornaf ohio and house over sye comitee chairman t representive jim's comer of kentucky are expected to lead the meting at the meeting mc carthy is expected to say in in peachmean inquiry is the logical net step for the republican majority that will obviously launch this into hire gear two hundred eighteen lamacs would need to supportn impeachment inquiry against bidon is not certain that actually the house republicans have the votes to do it there is several jeopee lamakers including ken buck and don bacon of nebraska have voic skepticism aboutin peachmen which is interesting because buck is af fiscl conservatives also pushing mc carthy from the right in terms of spending saids cut it is come from weird bad fellows here but mc carthy is very pliable to his own membership the problem is if you do not give many options he is got no options how about this how about folcus on the measures that are likely to lead to elect to r victories you can actually effectuate change tthere is been the ever since i've been following republican and conservative and and dem politics it all which is fourteen thirteen years old i've noticed in an extraordinary tendency among those in the act of his base to simply say over and over and over that they wish a thing to be and then if the politicians do not make the thing happen then the politicion to fail what if the thing thatyou ar wishing for is not possible under the curren circumstances but might be possible with a little bit of actual forethought a gain just one second we are going to get to crime at probes of spinning out of control in washington to see again democratic overnance is inidibly vl norble right now the stuff

end after the defon the policemo men remember its goin t be kumby ya i mean washington d c actually wrote black last matter in giant letters on the street and if that will not solve crime i frankly do not know what will they created a george floid square it was it was it was the moment the moment that all crime was goingtond in washington d c and then num yet it turns out washington deces a terrible fet a place filled with out crim according to the washington post a shaken washington copes with surging violencs this is not normal oh is not it though according to the washington post stephany heyschman a north west washington vent planner nosoe may sound almost absurdly causious as she describes how after a regular sunday dinner at a friend's house fi blocks away she travels by carninstead of walking home she has her reasons a yearago shos wacken by gun fire outside her adams morgan partment building and from her seven floor windo saw car speeding away and algest after a night out with a friends for uber driver ouldn't reach her building because police had blocked offic stree where bullets had just killed two men in fitally wounded a third it is ridiculous heyshman said on theother hand i d't want a rannam we get chot viling crime as longbeen part of washington life the worst of it during the early nineteen nineties when drug traffican propelled the annual homicide told nearly five hundred and d c earned an in glorious reputation as americas at murder capitals as shou during this period that washington d c had to rename its baskebalt im mou'll recall that washington d cs baskeballteam in the nineteen eighties was called the washington bullets and then they had to rename themselves because oops and that is hen they became the washington wizards as though gand office walking the streets of washington d c the volume of carnach these days not nearly as hi most c reviden residents are unlikely to ever be a victim of violences but a sharp rise an rime over the past year punctuated by our ports of homicides at brazen shotings in car jackings by armtea najers is rattling a city already struggling to recover from them pantemac that up ended its rithms on ravage it is once thriving downtown i i wonder how this happen oh maybe it was that you guises decided that the police were bad maybe that maybe that would be it the spike and felanies homicides in raberys erup twenty nine and sixty seven per cent from the same at time period last year according to poleice stafts is not the only dateof causing alarm the number of juvies arrested for car jacking has increased slightly since last year forty one of the sixty four charge between the ages of twelve and fifteen as of august thirty first eighty one miners have been shot in the city this year who while a preponderance of violance o cursewhere adoffin has in the poor neihborhoods stafts showed the geograpy of crime has become more diffuse with prosperous areas less immune than before well i'm an equity equity suggest thise is necessary ovics to the richer areas also have to suffer from people being shot on the regular that that is that that is exciting stuff in washington to see keep voting democrat its working out grat for you t same thing happening over in philadelphia by the way there is nuvidio tha is emerged from philadelphia showing attics on the street in a trance state passed out on the sidewalk of the city's multiple homeless encampment i mean if this is not horrifying thurdwold crap i'm not sure what is this is kensington areas in philadelphia for those cannot see tho idio i's people literally just lying on the street just in middle a broad daylight legonbeet out just people youwould think that this was some sort of a horrifying play it is not there is a homeless man who is just standing there on a street corner i mean this creepy is all living hell jus people zonkd out obviously drug users are seene according to the daily mal hunched over with no control of their limbs others are sprawled across the garbage covered streets large groups have taken over the sidewalks turng them into homeless encampments were many people live in their own filth many of the attics living on the sreets are force to turne to crime in theft to sustain themselves one local actvis said businesses are using booby traps sprinkler systems to keep a drug attics away from their sore fronts business is and abthrowing soapy water on the ground it is wet and it is not a comfortable place to sit down there is businessess that isat a sprinkler systems as well crime day to reported by the philadelphia inquirer shows kensington has one o the highest drugrates in the city apparently one of the m one of the worst drug's on the street right now is is a drug known is trank for those who do not know that is a potent animal tranquilizer called zilazine is a powerful sedative and a people mix it with fentinel to make that even deglier and worse that 's something new yourk time'sbeen reporting on for a while back in january thereis entire story about this sey zilassine causes wounds that erupt with a scaly dead tissue called escar untreated it can lead to amputation in induces a black out stuper for hours rendering users vulnerable to rape and robbery when people come too a high from the fentinel has long since fated the immediately crave more because zilazine is a setitive not an opioid it resists standard opioid overdos reversal treatments more than ninety per cent of philadelphia's lab tested dope samples are now positive at ferzilazine it is too late for philly said shawn at westfall outreage worker with provention point philadelphia thirty yerlds health services center in kensington philly supply is saturated if other places around the country have a choice to avoid eit they need to hear our story a study published in june has detecteve zilaine in the drug supply in thirty six states as well as dcee in new york city zilasin has been found in twen ty five per cent of drug samples but the saturation is certainly greater and this is scary scary stuff the drug exists in a legal grazown it was improved fifty years ago by the ft a as a veterinarian prescribed the anal jesic it is not lis it as controlled substance for animals are human sot's not subject to strict monering but it is started of course with them prescription opbioids when tho those came hard to come by people started moving on to trank this is what we have done to large swats of our population its it is all working out grat by the wayguises all all this is working out beautifully probably a little bet wmere left wing polices will fix these cities el maybe may we have some needle exchanges for the trank that will that will definitely help one maybef we get rid of the copse cas really the prome here in systemac racism yow as i said oralear when i came to te republican congress yelling at bad things in life is not a solution to the bad things and yet that seems to be the policy that is being followed in these cities i do not trank is not a solution to drink i do not home lezombies on the street is nt a solution to homelizombson thestree you knot's a solution ore law in force me not's a solution manitory drug drying out you notsu in actual solution in voluntary commentment from mentally ell these oure actual solutions the re quere actual funding and they fix the problem but that may require somemody actually have the courage to see that in an area wore s not popular and more than that is not about courage my politicians it is about voters coming to grips with reality at a certain point camplin the politicions any more if were not cutting our dat maybe it is because we do not want a cut our det lem politicions much as you want or we can lame the fact that people have no capacity to think second order when it comes to politics already folks time for some things at that ilay al retty well one of thngs we here at the menspirshows burstcold than one of our biggest sponsor is obviously and we talk with them averes offen about the state of the economy joining us on the line wright now as fill a patric a precious metal specialist from bersgoll philip let us talk about the state of the economy i mn right now jobine is claiming we have strong economic growth in flation is coming under contral how to ou see it ye i mean le you can chery pick the numbers an sertainly make that argumen but i think its o mistake to sik ist just on economic gros an the real question i think is is how is the economy working to mace americans in the numbers really do not the good o for the lost two an a harf years licat to riceis at home up twenty per cent electricity up twenty one gastlyng priceis up seventy two per cnt let us tic of people's bikust expense riht am housing ren payments race twenty fice per sand median mortgae payments up eighty five per cent and very importanty wage trace is trailed in flaction consistently an in al ther words if its not just our imagination vust tirhty everyesensial is more expens iv to day then it was before bidin got in office and wag just just have not kept up i cansumat dat is recenly hid an old time iover trilian dollars for the first time o i think peoplet desperately trying to maintain their living standits in the face of by d not make sli tin tat's to reality for most americans to day despite how we tring dress up the number phillip one o the thingsthat their claiming now is that they have brought inflation under control the fellow res arve obviously has increased intereust rates to sky highrates is why mortgages are now clarking in at seven eight per cent now the reality is that by historical averages the interestrate tarns actually all that high et this point but also the the inflation rate is not all that lowl at this point is a lat a talkwriht now about the inflactiu ran being under control but the usually tirrng it two per cent it is its well an access of three per centsils ar still fifty per cent too high but they are till claiming now that may theyr an a stop with the increases in the interest raye yet the loinflation generally as good good news ri but this a couple of points to remember first of all inflation is cumulative r i detend per cent inflation ra one year followed by five per cent next means that everything cost fifteen per cent more easing inflation does not mean a return of purchasing powerits just destroying it more slowly now the other side of things which i think is very important is the feds preferred measure of inflation which is corpc personal con sumption expenditures they have been more than double as you mention the two per cent tarket for years now the only thing that is really been driving that headline inflation number down as been energy plators and of course their starting to cree upic and oyal heat ninety dollars a barel just a few days ago it is particularly concerning to letting what is showing us now that is i inflation is becoming intrenched in the economy and i think this two per cent tarket the fed have may be a pipe dreem for the foreseeable future its proving particularly sickly at the moment in thold one of the things that is become patently obviaus really since two thousand seventy thousan ates how much power the central bankers have over the economy and there used to be a time s now decades togo where legislatures really had sort of the chief control over the economy and you could hold them responsible if the policies were bawd there is still an interest in some level of thisical discipline because you couln' just print dollars will enilly in then pump them ins the economy or below the debt off for a couple of generations o ve sess not true any more and that means that the central bankstem can given us extraordinary power to controll how much you are dollars are worth particularly ones you vary pay taxidone in tere in the bankaray ye i meneed's absurd the power that the federers ave have ays is really showing itself in to days economy and the reality is as you mention theire an unelected body we really cannot hold them accountable and this federeserve has a problem as well that the tools that they have available i think of very limited their ability to ras rate significantly enough to crush inflation is limited thet to what they did to the banks earlier this year and ou know the ability to fix the economy by lowering rates and stimulating all very limited as well they have got their hands tiged behied their back but but i agree with you the feathers as a body the power that they have over the economy is concerning when theyre unelected and and unaccountable missming te thil pateric's a precious metal spectualist and ispokesmen for burce gold groups ol thol i get the question all the time that in in a really sort of uneas e economy this in a really is uneasy no one knows obviously where where to put their money it looks to me the real estate market is going to have some sort of sell off here just because the mortgage rates are high as lost stickiness because people do not actually want to sell their homes beause then teyll have t take a new mortgage that is not goin to be at two point five peresentis can to be at seven per cent but it some point people will lose their jobs theyll lose their savings than there gan a have to sell those houses the same things happening in commercial real estate i' ben talking with people in commercial real estate and the occupancy rates are ar dropping fairly rapidly at this point and thet themmings the underlying value is is really going downthe lostr journal has widely reported this meanwhile when comes to the stock market a lot of uneasiness there new i pios are doing a fraction fwhat they ware doing just a couple of of years ago and and meanwhile if you if you put your money into a money market account you might be earning the best return it is a very confusing economy n obviously of a vested interest an with birch goald but what do you recommend in terms of things precious metals is a hedge against all this the githing precious metals were very very well inclimates

is going on in israel riht nowis actually quite astonishing om the supreme court of israel is claiming that it has the ability to strike down literally any law includingwhat they call the basic law in israel for violating the declaration of independence for israelso let me put this in contect and it this has ramifications for the united states because this is the way that the left love to see courtz rule in the future and inhow the courtz of ruled in the past basically hears the way works the united states is worlly lucky be ave written constitution which means that the very least you can refer to that document to determin what exactly quarts cannot do and cannot do in terms of striking things down whale lage well legislatures canaccannot do israel is not have anything that israel has a declaration of independence which is not a piece of law it is a isesy statement of broad purposes about how israel shuld be jewish and democratic but's pretty much what it is it is not law there is no constitution there because the is reallies could not come to some sort of agreement about how exactly the government should work what laws we in bounds what what was constitutional what was not s they basically just a reed to disagree that means that every often they pass wat they call a basic law a basic law is a piece of majoritarian legislation that then carries with it in inability to override that law except with sort of a supermajority these basic laws exist that been created throughout is raily history the supreme court of israel typically has used basic law in ore to strike down non basic law sin the same way that the sprime court of the united states will use the constitution to strike down particular legislation the same thing sort of happens here in israel the sprim court historically has used the basic laws as it as a way of striking down non basic law now in the nineteenineties there is a seizure of power by the supreme court and they decided that from now on they could basically just reasonableness to strike down a variety of executive actions and legislation well be binityn ow whose crrent colition thy said the upreme court has to much power r do not want them to do that any more senarigan have to site something that is not reasonableness if you an a strike down legislation and they want o make the sabasic law are they they vactiin coted this in a basic lawsing this will now be the law of the state o israel and it is considered quasi constitutional one of the questions the big question that is now come up before the supreme court is whether the supreme cort of israel can strike down a basic law in the name of in tnhame of lic again normall in the united states yuse the constitution to strike down at badpiece legislation in israel the basic law is the quasi constitutional highest law how can te supreme court site something else to strike down a basic law the argument that is currently happening at the supreme cort level is wheter the supreme court can use the declaration of independence to strike down a law tay that imagine if the supreme court of the united states went back to the declaration of independence and sad that because the declaration of independence says the you have the pursuit of happiness that means that we can strike down anything we want we' all go wo who gave you that power that is not that is a prett vague sentiment free to strike down things but that is pretty much what israel supreme court is now declaring tey're now declaring that becaue they do not the current legislature of the state of israel they have willy nilly power to strike down anything they want in the name of an incredibly vbague documents the declaration of independs of the state of israel which is not in fact practical law it does not spell out how the state of israel isposed to work it does not spell out how the cannetset is suposed to work it does natspell out virtually any of these things it has a bunch of sort of base line statements about what they hope the state of israel will be i talking about ow it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of its inhabitants and will be based on freedom justice and pieace and will ensure complete equality of socioal and political rights and will guaranty freedom of religion conscionse language education and culture but those are pretty vague statemens to strike down a piece of legislation that simplly says the supreme court does not have the ability to say that something is unreasonable and then strike it down if the supreme court werd do this its constitutional crisis in israel is effectively what they are saying is that elections can be overitten by the upreme court anytime that any time a basic laws establish which again is supposed to wou be is though the congress of the united states and various state legislatures passed te constitutional amendment to the constitution and the supreme ourt then stepped in and said in the name of the declaration of independene we strike down this constitutional amendment by well you cannot do that no one gave you the power to do that that is basically was happening right now according to the timesof israel during fraught exchanges between the court and the attorneys defending the legislation one justice indicated israel's democracy was at stake again i have to say the irony of people speaking in the name of judicial tyranny saying that the're doings on behalf a democracy is really galling it is really really galling basically the supreme court right now is arguing there should be notelic name your limits what are the limits on te supreme court of israel there are none according to the supreme court of israel and according to many of its supporters they lost in election they do not let the results of the elections o now they are going to use the supreme court tobasically establish that there are no limits at all you lon bonback is the attorny represending o the government the argue the justices are empowered to interpret the legislator's words there is no legal or constitutional basis for them to review basic laws in response justice alic stine askebon back what is the source of the connacit authority to legislate laws bonback point to to i nineteen fifty supreme court ruling stin noter tha theconnessit was form before that the original power source was in the declaration of independence well yes in the sense that it says there sould be elegislatturpreted does not havlic specific provisions on how lists o work all that was established later other justices also challenged bonback indicating that in their views since the declaration of independence to finds israel as a jewision democratic state the cannesset cannot legislate laws even basic laws thet are rode israels jewish or democratic character which means that the high court contimally strike down whatever it wants to sign strike down which is pretty amazing stuff again the declarasioment dependence ofth state of israel is in fact a basic document but that does not mean tha it empowers the supreme court to override anything in the name of the declaration of independence any more than the supreme court t of the united states can use the declaration of independence which they far more important document to the western civilization to to strike down law the supreme cortamost never sites the declaration of independence because there is no purpose to doing it is not a piece of legislation if if the supreme court n israel does that it is going to be a a rather large mass cause a huge percentage of theserealy populationse an believe that elections basically have no consequences at all unles you are on the left in which case they jus run rough shot that is really negative stuff and i've i've railed in the united states against people in the united states doing this routine where if the bad guise whin that means the democracy is over there dring it n israel to it is really bad for any civilization ar digize the rest of the show is continuing right now in oconormisit we will be talking about our educational system wich apparently is rifely thomnt some rather perverse

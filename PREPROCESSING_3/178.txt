insisting that rachel not baccs made his grand kibs her children he called it murder when she pushed back he would ridicule her made the stop talking to him she did not father telling her father when she her two youngest kids and jacob all got covit in the fall of twenty twenty one even when jacob went into the icy you for five days and the doctors told her to pray she still did not reach out to her dad for support four days after jacob was finally released from the hospital and back home with rachel in the family recovering at about midnight my brother sent me at's taxet that said i've been two distraught to tell you but dad passed away to day at two forty too p m becaus a at text ye a text telling her that her father had been dead for hours she figured car accident she knew he would been driving a lot looking for work she called her brother peter komacho junior i said peter what has happening what happened and he explained that they had gone to a funeral ne thai i never should have let dad go to the funeral with all the s vaxed people vaxineeted people her brother believed that covid vaxines weren' just dangerous for people who got the vaxene vaxin eeded people were dangerous to be around if he were unvainated him and his dad they lived together they would been living together for years and i was can even begin this argument i'm just gon to listen and he goes i should never have hugged and he named a cousin and he said shoud never have let my dad hug and he named the same cousin they are all vaxed idiits he did not say nad had covin always he is just saying oke iright he just starts what they never should have let him go to the funeral to hug vaxinito people he said because of all their shedding they shed the virus and i it stopped me in my tracks in that ni just was lit what happened he had covid and he said no no a but he he was having trouble breathing if he had n aumonia peter all of his symptoms are covid you'r saying had shalla breathing you'r saying he was fatigued you are saying he would he would lacked the strength tat even eat at one point he was just sort of trying to poor mill art not milk sorry soup into the corners of his mouth and spraing him with water to get some level of hidration and he said that his bad was covered in sweat and then he said dad would stare off and i'd slap him and then he would look at me and that he just he he would say hey dad or you o kay and he would go an till the last time and he did not and he said dad's eyes were just wide open an i i slapped him and he was gone an rachel was trying to take all this in trying to get information without letting loose on her brother whose plainly grief struck om having just watched their father die in front of himlet he was telling her he had watched their father die in front of him for days he did not take him to the hospital did not call nine on one did not call rachel to tell her their father was sick he could barely speak then another thought hir i said peter you have been his nurse this whole time how do you feel and he said wo i mean we both probably got sick around the same time but i'm healthier than dad and i said peter you understand you definitely have covid can you take a deep breath i need you do take a deep breath for me and he did and i goka how do you feel he was that was i'm tired and tht's when i just lost it and i scramed at him nd i said if you do not you are his older sister yamis older and only sister and i said peter i can forgive you for not taking dad to the hospital i can find forgiveness somewhere an me but i swear to you if you do not go to the e are right now i will not forgive you when you die you are going you are ding i need you i need you to go to the yar right now rachel stayed on the phone with her brother heard him get into the car the door slam e engine turn over she finally relaxed a bit when she heard peter go inside the hospital and chuk and he was forty four years old six wud for too twenty never smoke did not drink tlifted waights when cobid it he would been on a clens he had help insurans through medicow california's met kade system but peter had not had a full time job in years he depended on his father edn't have his own bank account his first text exchange with rachel from the hospital was about money he asked how much was jakesbill meaning how much was rachel's then partner jacob's medical bill when he had covit she texted back i said as seriously i's the last thing you needd be concerned about right now am jus please it does not matter i'm proud of you for taking care of yourself peter he said a hundred and three temp oxygen levels low said yep jacob was at eighty three when i brought a men that is really really bad and he said they just better not put me on a venilater i said peter you are a fighter i need you to meditate on your living on surviving this he te says thanks for getting me going on this i was not going to get any better at home and i said no you were not if they want to put you on rem does suffer ask them to parrit with allumiant it is a game changer rom dessever and illumiant was the commidation the doctors had given to jacob the week before that is how rachel knew about it she had just been through all this if it is not emmonia yet they need to put you on the monaclona anabodies says you saying all this tames at this to him and he said i do not these guised peter did not the guise at the hospital because they wanted to swab his nose for a piecy artest to see if he had coved he told rachel he thought the swabtests for a scam thet doctors got a fifteen thousand dollar bonas for every swab they did that led to a positive covid result i said i love you peter let them help yu get better he said i love you too minutes later positive for covet within three days to rachel's great surprise and relief peter told her he was on the mend he went home to rest and she made plans to go out to sanna anna california where he lived and where th two of them had grown out peter asked rachel a couple of times after he left the hospital whether their father's cause of death had been identified yet she said covet even though she had not seen the decertificate because it seemed obvious to her and she would turn out to be right when rachel got to san anna along with one of her older kids peter asked them over the phone not to come in the house said he still felt too vulnerable because they were vacinated he believed again that bacscenes make people shed the viris and therefore vacinated peopl our especially dangerous to be around for the unbacinated rachel decided to give him some time they would see him before they left they could do it outsided in masks in the back yard she did not push he sounded tired she was not surprised after she would had covic she would barely been able to open ajar for a week rachel kept checking in be a taxt and phone calls she was handling the paper work and to tales of their father's death she was dropping off food at the front door food le gistics love you hungry can i pick you up anything i'm close i'm two blocks away he says cannot think of anything right now those guys ever contact you i say i calld yesterday thas said the're superbusy in the papercl ssent to the crematorium on thursday that is one of their last texts peter died a week after rachel got to san anna she never saw him ow long time neighbor found him rachel learned from the coroner that her brother had not made a quick remarkable recovery and been discharged from the hospital to go rest at home as she believed he had checked himself out of the hospital after two and half days against medical advice ii was stone i did not i mean what it means is thit he was lying to me he knew what to say he knew what to hide i just i mean i was iy was floating through my days it felt my brain had been white rachel was dumb founded by how much she did not know about her fathers and brother's last month of being alive everything was gone all the answers she put off trying to get from her brother about why he had not hosed for help for their father gone her brothers recovery fakhe some kind o her foremente she had no idea what he' been thinking as he was fading away but he would been doing instead of telling her the truth and then rachel made a discovery a record of peter's final bays and she found out exactly would happen part one black box covid caught us while we were busy each person at found and each family was in the midst of their specific unfinished business theyre pre existing fault lines in hisconnections the fault lines are what me here this is a story about a family and what covited to them what it destroyed but also what it revealed rachel lived thousands of miles away from her father and brother and she was used to stretches of relative silence with them but those quieter periods were always part of a rhythm that swung back even an angry silence was never permanent now the fact that she did not have any idea what happened at the end rachel was tormented by this not knowing the pain propelled her she was not quiet with grief she was vibrating with it she had questions the first person she called after talking to the coroner was her and peter's cousin rachel and her brother were only year and a half apart and the cousin was right round the same age mid forties the three of them had grown up playing together her cousin seemed just as bafuled as she was by peter's death by the fact that hed left the hospital against medical advice she asked him a terrible question the coroner had asked her and he chanced this was intentional had her brother been suicidal rachel didn thinks but she also felt bhut thet'll do i know she says her cousin said no way no way peter wanted to live at the house where peter and her father had lived rachel gathered up old phodoes and looked through them these are all great fellows and i want these but wonder if they had any fellows of themselves ik iiven know they looked in the familiers i do not know ano ay start o charging their fones and then i heard llubublublu message message message unlike oh god i do notthing about there is people checking in on my brother a a started reading rachel looked at a text from the cousin she just talked to his last text to peter on the day peter died he said yeo jacks please answerme man and then before that are several tiktokling s is i owat ar these that i'll have the apem ii i do not really now hot operate it i'll be let us a not intereset i it and then i just scrolled up an i just cadn't help but just be invested and their conversation rachel kept scrowling up and up and up through the texts between peter and their cousin until she was back in october when peter was still alive and was texting with their cousin about what to do about rachel and peter's dad who was sick with covit at that point he was having trouble lifting his arms the cousin guesses that peter's father might have my ocarditis peter thinks maybe it is abacterial infection of some kind the night before peter's father dies of covid peter text his cousin and says do you or your mom or any one in your house have antibiotics a minute later the cousin writes back no and asks peter how are you feeling peter twenty minutes later definitely not well yet a fever that keeps springing back to one o three agitating dry cough and the squorts again my dad has the same cough only a hundred temperature and his shallow breathing pretty fast i'm thinking the fever keeps coming bck because it might be bacterial thing the cough is horrible i'm beeping that because he wrote f and then a bunch of asterisks the cough is horrible cause it waits till we lay down to go to sleep and it becomes very itchy and we cannot go to sleep because of it we an am coughing all night we are both very sleep deprived cousin fuck that is bad cousin a few minutes later i'll case of to morrow i'm going o bring you guy on when heel you guies peter o man burng it cousin i will i just got o run to the store tomorrow morning and by ingredients and make it i also hav an immunity kit that i just ordered fror my old job peping it behind glast and case of emergencies s time to breake the glasts peter sounds good to me i'll tell pops fifteen minutes later peter texts about him ind his dad we ere already detoxing any way too week's prior i thought our bodies were just following through in its own me we gave the bad food we were eating every day even coffee coffee due yes even that creamer and then the comes on it is we try to do it right nd then we get cousin damn it you guyes were too clean rachel saw over the course of her father's last day peter describing their dad hallucinating coughing grunting losing control of his blatter and bowels peter giving invitemens and probiotics the cousin dropped off ha final round of soup on the porch in the afternoon seeing how her father's death had unfolded was awful how he would suffered but rachel also read those texts and everything peter in her cousin wrote going forward ith the helpless awareness of somebody watching a greek tragedy knowing with the characters do not all the horror that is to come it is the black box after a plangrash it is hearing ghosts speak of themselves i man i just respoded with absolute rage and heartbreak she saw the text exchange between her brother and cousin at the moment her father died peter i believe he is takin his final breaths and then a minute later he is gone cousin what peter what peter i seriously do not know what to do now this is when rachel saw herself enter the conversation when her brother texted her that their father was gone she saw in the texts how the shock of their father's death had opened up a window of opportunity with peter and in that window peter had texted her and she convinced him to go to the hospital or as he put it in a text to the cousin rachel demanded that i go to the yars i'm going to the yar theire cousin texted back keep me posted that was what i understood that there were duel conversations being had and that one was my ad tempt at saving my brother's life and the other one was my cousins version of an attempt at saving my brother's life rachel and peter's cousin did not respond to my texts letter and phone message requesting an interview with him i'm not naming him because of that and because i do not want strangers harassing him over this story rachel has not spoken to him since she found the text between him and her brother and he hasin contected her peter in these text back and forth with each of them is clearly scared for his life and i do not know what people do in countries that have a functioning healthcare system but in the united states a lot of us may be most of us seek out advice from friends and family in the midst of health crisis the friends and family guidance is often supplemented by the internet and then were faced with the messy pile of anecdotes jargon and sailes pitches to sift through that messy pile may be all a person has if they do not have a primary care doctor peter did not but he did live close enough to a decent hospital that he was able to make it in time to be offered possibly life saving care at which point he began to worry can i afford this peter's mis trust of the medical system revolved around money in his text with this cousin even before he in his father got sick peter kept re turning to the idea that he did not believe in the covi tests and treatments because people were getting rich from them he believed there was a government plan that gave hospitals and doctors financhelansentives to kill people and blame covit peter was afraid of the wrong things with covit he was just incorrect but the over all idea that the us medical system is shaped by profit seeking than his often at odds with good patient care that is a fact no one in america is wrong to be afraid of medical bills in light of that reality and in light of peter's earlier texts it is a sign of just how scared he was when he text rachel from the hospital and says thanks for getting me going on this i was not going to get any better at home and it was hard for rachel to accept as she was reading through the texts that only forty minutes after he wrote that to her when he finds out the hospital will be giving him a nasal swab peter's resolve starts to falter and peter text their cousin they pe se arred me cringimogy too sick to get up and leave no response from the cousin an hour later rachel text peter i love you peter let them help you get better peter writes back i love you too an hour later the cousin texts him did the test come back yet peter positive of course peter text the cousin that he is just been given some steroids in his ivy it was an antian flammatory dex him at the sone and inexpensive generic for any one counting at home a month earlier before peter's father he would even gottn sick the cousin had texted peter that quoe hospitals get a twenty per cent bonis for administering fouche is poison rom desevere now the cousinm texts peter what was the steroid called and a couple minutes later oke i just red room desvere is not a steroid few peter texts the cousin and hour later saying ra hel said if they want to put you on rom desever asked them to parrot with olumian it is a game changer no response from the cousin the cousin two and half hours later fuck that do not take from desevere fifty four per cent chance it will shut down your kidneys several hours later peter texts the cousin they finally brought in a bag of rom desevere and i said i'll hold off on that and he said o ke that is fine no problem with the nurse assistants and the nurse but soon as the doctor comes and makes a decision it is the once the cousin a minute later no no no room desevere peter texts temiphoto of an ivy bag the cousin asks they are giving it to you peter no i told them all pass the cousin o ke i know you are tired but keep an eye on those fuckers whatch everything they are putting in those lines i'd offer him advise id see him goter a cousin to get the second opinion am and he would jus always derayall those efforts it is just the most unfathomable obsurd conversation no watch happen peter tecs the cousin a photo of his dad at that family funeral he told rachel about they are dad is hugging a relative who was vaxinated as he would mention to rachel he captions the photo the day my dad was killed the next morning peter tets the cousin temp finally down ninety eight point eight still on oxygen because my oxygen levels are week the cousin i'm glad your strutting to improve the sooner the better they will not have a chance to kill you againd the cousin did not respond to my interview requests one of the things i know about the cousin the very little i know from reading the full thread of his texts is that he is a father two of the family members who live with him are in their seventies and he worries about their health he is a man with multible heavy responsibilities who is also up late and early for weeks worrying about his cousin petere checking on him i also know from rachel that about ten years ago the cousin lost another cousin jenifer who was a little sister to him after she went to the hospital unexpected it did not make sense she was a youngest of the for of us cousins and her her bltter had been nicked during i ssserian and she atsepsus and she was young un hav his babes and than she died and the whole family was crushed rachel and peter too genipher was thirty two years old and rachel says that for peter this medical error was one seering event in a lifetime of smaller moments they gradually transformed him from someone who would never trusted authority figures in general and did not go to doctors he believed he could take better care of himself with exercise and nutricion than some doctor to some one who saw doctors and hospitals as dangerous and later as actively seeking to deceive and harm and even kill people for their own gain the day before he leaves the hospital peter texts the cousin the doctor finaily came down and asked why i will not take rom desever and he said you are not vaxinated and i said that is correct he said bax the only treatment we have for covid and that my lungs are going to deteriorate with the oxygen they keep ordering for me if i do not take the rem desevere i said i'll think about it and he said oket and left i'm desevere might have reduced peter's need for oxygen concentrated oxygen can harm some one's lungs over time especially if they have been damaged by for instance covid the cousin tex back a few minutes later bulk that rom desevere is going to deteriorate your organs especially your kidneys you have been pumping i be prophin all week he is just trying to scare you he can get his twenty precent bonis for using rem desevere that same doctor will tell you the baxene is good for you which makes no sense cause now that you are confirmed tht you have covid and youre covering it seems you will have natural immunity for life you will not need boosters just pray your oxygen level improve you can get the hell out of there as rachel is reading the texts she keeps glimpsing these movints here and there over the last weeks of peter's life when peter acknowledges this is covit but the idea of covid is a balloon that cannot stay aloft peter texts a bit later all i have to do is jog a little i'll get my oxygen back up sitting in a hospital bed isn' doing anything oxygen wise the cousin do the termaric and mently lung inhaling exercises at home ye you are not goin to continue to deteriora he is a bucking lyar a few minutes later rachel text peter and they go back and forth about his oxygen levels and whether he has 'nough energy to eat and if he has a phone charger rachel asks him if he is heard and estimated time line for them to discharge him peter texts they made it sownd soon possibly today or tomorrow rachel holy shit o kay i've talked to rachel a bunch of times and from what i've seen she does not to let untrue things slye she really does not it but in her tex with peter i can see her trying hard to be careful with him trying to encourage him support him tell him what she thinks his important in her big sister way but not argue with him this deliberate with holding of her fold forcefulness is part of their relationship rachel feeling protective of peter is built into her earliest memories he is been physically bigger since he was fifteen but she is always been tougher peter later that afternoon texts with a cousin and again brings up the idea that maybe this might be covid peter can you look up safe treatments for covid the cousin rites back hang in there i'm checking frantical ly and then the cousin texts moniclonal annybodies convalescent plasma or ivermecton the first two oxions are usually only given while in the e are once you are admitted the protocal changes to remdesevere they only treat the baxinated with ivre mecton that way when they recover they can say see the vaxine kept you from dying mother fuckers the evidence about ivrmecton is now overwhelming it is not effective as either protection against coid or treatment of it and whill we are here natural immunity for life against covid is not a thing and baxenes do not cause people to shed the viris but let us talk briefly about remdesevere i' spoke with the few doctors whof been treating covid patience sence the beginning in clinex and hospitals they were unanimous rom desvere has revealed itself to be not octually a very effective treatment against covit it is not harmful and all the ways peter's cousin kept saying it wased that was from desevere's strength it was generally safe studies did confirm it is modest usefulness in some patients but is one doctor put it from desevere was a tol we used because we had few tools even the drug combo rachel recommended from desevereplus ollumiant one careful studies showed patience who bout the combo were less likely to dive than those who got from desevere alone but only bout three per sent less likely to die for in advanced severe case of covid here is no consistant game changer the medicine of covit has been genuinely confusing we cannot know if peter would have survived even if he did stay at the hospital but it was probably his best shot two doctors i spoke with told me how important it was in their experience to just let a patient talk if they were reluctant to get treatment for anything do not try to convince them just ask them hat has this been for you then listen but the doctors were also frankh about how often with covit they did not have time for that conversation or energy before covit they would seemed plenty of people who were afraid to be hospitalized we did not want specific treatments but with covid those conversations were different people ware not just reluctant manyu were hostile some got a gressive one doctor said she had the experience over and over of patient she known for years seeing her in a mask and instantly distrusting her the doctors both said that simply asking of a person was vaccinated would often stopped the conversation cold and each persons reasons for not wanting a particular covi treatment were bespoke their own tightly held bundle of beliefs and fears that were extra resistant change a doctor might be able to tease out and address the contents of that bundle fast enough to help the person or they might not anyway we know what happened this time t when rachel started reading tforg her brother's text she knew he had left the hospital against medical advice she found that out from the coroner but you do not know how it happened now she saw peter text his cousin at three thirty in the morning i'm starting to wonder if they are everno let me out and my cousin says they have to release you upon r quest my brother says i hope that is true and then my cousin sen em discharge against medical advice stran cap from very well health dot com thit states a discharge against medical advice usually just called an ama requires tat yousinaform agreeing that you wish to leave but that your physician things it is a bad clenical choice for you to go it says legaly they cannot keep you there that is considered false imprisonment and my brother responds half an hour later how should i say it quot i need to be discharged un quote and my cousin says are they currently giving you any medications my brother nothing yet to day actually all they ever gave me were stelroyd's an anabiotics my cousin ok do you have an ive trip peter n out just had me on oxygen my cousin hum is your oats o still at about or above ninety five my brother it is offright now i was around ninety four all i know is i'm not getting any better in here he he says to me thank you for convincing me to be here i was not going to get any better at home and tells my cousin i'm not going to get any better i'm not getting any better an here in the hospital my cousin how does your chest feel peter feels better than it did when i first came in which is a sign of the treatment working that last bart is not in the text it was rachel venting her frustration as she was reading through on this again she could barely contain herrage by the end of this next part she was sneering my cousin yah and the fact that gave you an a baotic that mans again it was bac teron emmonia not viral and the steroyd helpse of the inflarmation that is why the fever went down and your longs irritation went down as well now it is te matter of getting over the cough wit jus goin a linger for a few weeks but you can probably haddled at with ha copser because all they ever gave me was anabiodics and a prescription for a strong cofserup two minutes after i believe you are out of danger now fuck their pertercall it is time to get probiatics back into your body from the time peter left the hospital he lived another two weeks all that time rachel was in a fog of coming to terms with their father's death and she thought her brother was recovering most people who get cova du but peter was texting with their cousin about his blood oxygen level a reading between ninety five and a hundred is considered normal but on different days peter says he is at eighty eighty eight ninety one eighty five ninety three eighty two ninety fluctuating from o k but on the low side to worryingly low rachel had no idea peter did not tell her and she did not press him a few days before peter dies their cousin texts yo you good my brother does not respond twenty three minutes later ouch right in the slice meaning asracats ther language for that anhy sens it yet another tiktokling peter's response ten minus later is garboled he is describing his own actions but it comes out sounding more a transcript of bleary half thoughts try to make things easier let us not go back on forth for anything go straight to the kitchen stay in that chair keep thinking of what you need that way while you are doing all this she might get fully wended major most important thing of all is the chair in the kitchen is a roller chair the roller chair is an office chair peters using to get around in a few days rachel is gin a find that chair in the kitchen soaked with urin one last thing rachel seeson peter's texts is that she was not the only person trying to get him to seek medical hel one family friend was texting information just about every day about clinics he could go to a nurse who would talk to him we also do not know what the cousin was saying to peter in phone calls with him and he did tell peter in one text after peter told him his blood oxygen reading was eighty that peter needed to go back to the hospital then peter texted that it went back op to eighty eight which is still too low and should have sent him to the emergency room but the moment passed peter's neighbour was checking in and leaving food on the porch for him four days before he died peter text the neighbour i was exhausted looking at all that food the naighmor writes back due you should go to the hospital call and ambulance peter oh that peter's last text to his cousin is a sad emogi about the death of the actor william lucking who start an sons of anarchy the next day the cousin texted how you do in peter and got no reply the day after that he wrote yo jacks please answermneg man rachel told me once about her brother and father and covid that it was they fell overboard during the pandemic and swim straight to the bottom thinking it was the surface when she finished reading the texts she read them again her brain kept combing through them for weeks she could not settle on any thought or any feeling i would go from not being able to speak or to crying or to making fun of my brother there is the survival mode personag just onts to clown you the deep depths of my hood niss where i'm from that particular street i came up on we will clown you for how you die cause youreficking clown leek you played yourself o me and i i would ud kills the ititsan strangers toto bring them back you't all or would i i do notknow i guess as one of those things are you just haggle thinking who you wuld trade out on the street toget o marshot am you shat your fack and shot to rachel's a poet at does not really cover it though rachel is a tractor beam i can easily see how a person could hear her read her poetry at some event and then marry her four months later which happened i can understand a person wanting to tat to her words on their arm which also happened a lot of rachel's writing is about her childhood family her her father her brother the first poem in her first book is titled epically i forget who i set it to but i remember how afterwards they looked at me as though i had driven a stake knife through their mother's hand the poem itself goes i love my brother he had the exact same childhood as i did but he does not get credit for it he is not the writer i am the star of the violence i expose my peter when he marries i will be sad no girl in the world deserves him but me i see that poem which i love as the little box rachel is daring her readers to open rachel's always seen her place in the world and part in releasion to peter her younger and only brother her responsibility still somehow she had not lived near peter in almost twenty years but far away is still somewhere it is nothing gone what do you do when you have lost something important you retraced your steps rachel remembers where she and pete er started and now she knows where he ended and she is going back over would happened in between things she saw because she was there and the things she is finding out happened later out of her sight what did happen in between what life did covedland and that is next time in part too if we were three nancy up dat et just say o i posod to things get complicated their relationship the three of them you can hear that whit now or i gues after you finishsning to our shew aun get that

watching pebies and i remember from time the time they would have specials on about ot the silver rice movement and my mam and i would sit down and watch it together and i remember one time they were talking about the freedom writers and my mother told me that we were a part of that the freedom writers act of this who borded brayhound besses and rod them all ofer the south in nineteen sixty one black and white people sitting defiantly side by side to challenge segregation looking at the footed of people being yelled an and people protesting and waterholes is ous kinali wayway wany sec and what do you mean an shwe played apart in the freedom wrides you knows wo how did what happened and i had never known any one of my family o veribly or physically be fllaun act of this that tome off gard but it was never talked about too much which gamal says was typical for his family they do not to talk about the past even basic things he always wondered how his family ended up where they did a neighborhood he sometimes hated to jamalt it was just blank then his grandmother died and he learned more she was the majorec of the family superbelov it the funeral was held at a big church and boston in my aunt tory was speaking about my grandmothers she as san my grandmother's a freedom riters she played a part in history you kno finding for the writes of of black amaricans o shes prout as she talked she held up his zeroc's copy of an old photo of gimal's grandmother gamal had never seen the picture before it looked it was taken at a bus station his grandmothers wearing a black dress white feathery hat triple string af pearls its just her and seven of her kids gathered round her gjaml brought that zeroc's photo home it seemd it might have been clipped from the newspaper he pulled up his laptop started googling her lea la mad williams i looks a night i was i was surprise to find the photograph or mine and is a gua lik in this e she is here is my unclein is my aute and this looking at the fot of fulls on mazy a's a gua loo o that and it is said reverse freedom rits and is a waynes sicon this is not the freedom ries sis something else the reverse freedom writes for a wild chapter in history that had been for gotten i got fascinated and started researching at a coupleers back the reverse freedom writes happened in nineteen sixty two they were a retalliation against the freedom writes by white segregationists in the south they used the same weapon as the civil writes actofis the grayhou bus they used it to send black people north whoheits kind of what is happening now with republican governers loating migrants on to busses and plains and sending them to democratic states i thought it is just the reverse freedom writes all over again some are actually being put uppe in barracks on the same military base the gold to day is basically the same as it was then to tic it to northerners and make a political point here is one of the segregationists back then amous guthridge he was a lawyer from arkan saw who helped come up with the plan we are goong to an at he a people it with he kit kennedy really do hav whet iv prefin te ta old people all really do have o or or e rol ian a devad a heelp i tl boa pat her we ar throu wut the fo abat a yol at tan and i tak too wa too mat to year baber pin you wen could get you a fel a white people up there e tel segregationist lurd people on to the busses with big promises of housing and jobs said everything would be provided for i they went and that president kennedy himself would welcome them up north they targeted people who might be seen as a burden poor families people just released from prison single malms with lots of kids jamal's grandmother sheis raising a levin kids and arkan saw they did get on abus but it was not the freedom rites thes a too different evints an an i think i spoke to my mam about it and she did not know what it was about she she is a know we'r freedom rites tha's agnot this says reverse freedom rite ince she a donnow anything mother verse freedom rites most people do not i found out more from arcives and old t v footage there were stories about jamal's grandmother and there and from what we can tell here is what happened gothridge the segregationist perestonally picked up the william's family in his station wagon the drove them from their farm to the bust terminal and little rock a couple hours away he got them ice cream and rubier there wers a quick press conference and then they all got on the bus hardly any luggage because they' been told everything would be provided up north there is actually footage of the moment they got on the bus there is no sound i'll describe it for you the gids have big smiles they lookd excited to be filled they chewing gum waving out the window as she bords welamat looks back over her shoulder she looks beautiful elegant in a strappy sequen dress and bright white cap the vidios just twenty nine seconds long but welamy looks ready after about three days on the bus lelamay as the bustriver to polover she wanted to change into her best clothes because she was about to meet president kennedy that is when she put on those pearls that jamal saw in the foto but when she was dropped off near the kennedy compound in hyanna's massachusetts kennedy was not there neither were the jobs or the housing it had all been lies what was there were some members of the anddouble acy pe some people from a church group and phatographers with their flashes going off tell me what was going through your head as eu started finding this all out i mean in away i hows cannot ouse ot i say hurt by it but i guess some one an bars that there is is trickery done and mi fammas taken advantage of because i i fell lke they were there ben use specu en mi the way my mother spoke about it wey my aunt wut they were proud of bein freedm rites nos ig not grandmau's as she use is a pan she is taken advantage of an an ese is a political pa but it did answer a question he would always had i always wonded how did we wind up in the projects were did we come from jamal co up in a big public housing development and boston his entire family lived there and now he knew why his family was jumped up north far from every one they knew no jobs and had to figure things out jamal's eyes were still closed tot this point in the interview i did not the life we were living anny li inthe neighbouhod i lived i did not hou know the jobs my mother had to do there is a lot of wy or things away they are nobody knows why his grandmother ended up on that bus thether she was forced or trick ere chose it thinking a move north would be best spen years since jamaul first learned about the reverse freedom rides he told me he sees it differently now his grandmother had one way ticket and no resources and somehow made it work he is proud of that my grandmas is trying to make abetter way for a family in that is all she is ever done and that saw my mother's ever donce oh ike who would not they ther while this is our way out of jem cro sou yo know and know how they way but t it judge these giyes up to no good anon ann an th how any one at the time when do not with tat other things fron their past jamal's family does not talk much about this history sometimes when things are tramatic he make the choice not to go there jus not helpful and sometimes s time in a choice jamals brought up the reverse freedom writes a couple times with his mam i knew she did not want to talk about it she may even have difficulty understanding it now he even sol just because he emotional experience if we got to dark she would not go there but she talk about some of the ot fond memories about growing up in the sout but somesof she would not go there thats jo she was she did not want to talk about this cdo not thinkis omething was a pleasant experience for her i've known his ma betty for a few years he was a tea najor when she took the buss norals she wants to talk about it she is really trying but is not that simple just i guess when you get to be e thouht you dis come co walk out the use of things you just o woy remembato what you but at ont we manbo lot about the buss an on you remember none o that sto i'll remember esometimes be past is something only the next generation can really look at a while back jamal was at home sketching on a canvas he is also an artist thinking bout the reverse freedom writes his grandmother and his mam and then his son who as ten walked in a notice jam was crying jama let him know it was o kat he is fore

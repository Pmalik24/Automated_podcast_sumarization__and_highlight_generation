welcome to the huberman ladpotcas s a science science pace tos for i man drew huberman and i'm a professor of nurbiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine recently the hubermalabhost at alive event at the beacon theatre in new york city the event was entitled the brainbody contract and it consisted of a lecture followed by a question in answer session with the audience we wanted to make the recorded version of that question in answer session available to everybody regardless of who could attend what follows is the question answer period from the brainbody contract live huberman lab event want to be sure to thank the sponsers from that event they were eight sleep which makes smart mattress covers with heating and cooling capacity i started sleeping on an eightsleep mattress cover about eight months ago and it is completely transformed by sleep i sleep much deeper i wake up far less during the middle of the night if at all and i wake up feeling far better than i ever have even after the same amount of sleep in fact i love my eight sleep much that when i travel now i'm quite bothered that arbian bees and hotels do not have eightsleep mattress covers on them and i've even shipped my eightsleep mattress cover out to meet me in the location that i arrive to that i get the best possible sleep if you want a try eight sleeping go to eight sleep doc calm slash hubermen to save up to four hundred dollars off their sleep fit holiday bundle which includes their new pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ssay canada united kingdom select countries in the w and australia again that is eight sleep dok calm slash huberman i to also thank our supplement partner momentous they make the very highest quality supplements they ship internationally and theyv formulated supplements as single ingredient formulations that match what is discussed on the huberman lab pot cast if you are interested in any of those supplements please go to livemomentousdok calm slash hubermen and now without further ado the question in answer session from the live event held at the beacon theatre in new york city and as always thank you for your interest in science you said before this stress can be good for us but how we known its too much ah that is a good question and i should preface that by saying that there is some incredible work that was done by a colleague of mine doctor a leochrum ally is how she goes my im doctor alichrom who is a she was a division one alet she has a she is a tenor professor sychology at stanford she is a license clinical scologis li everyone sm i look around my colleonylinciness release popil am yer humbling place to be but she is made some important discoveries and i want it just highlight one which is its notion of mine said and know these are not placebo effects but me jus tell you when you think about stress how you think about stress is really important for you cannot lie yourself but if for instance you watch a one or three minute vidio as she is given subjects in her lab about stress and it tells youall the terrible things that stress does your imune system in sleep then you experience those things increases in blood pressure it cetera however if you watch a one to three minute vidio that is also true about the fact that stress can sharpen your decision making for certain kinds of things actually can eccensuate your immune system i wish some one could help me get this narrative right out there stress does not do plet your immune system unless it goes on a long long time will talk about what long means in a moment why would it think about it if you had to fast and move with family or whether a storm of any kind emotional or physical and you got sick that would make any sense it is usually after your stress if you'v ever even go go go or taking care of a loved one or studying or working hard and then you finally go one vacation you rest youre riveney gets sick i's because your mune system shut down it is stop your mune system is mobilized by that alertness side of your autonomic nervous system but you do need sleep you do need sleep and it is i shally we think the slowing of circulation and this is why it is probably not a good idea to exercise if you are already sick and if your veering toward sick probably limit the intensity of any kind of interaction as best you can and just still yourself well alleys lab has clearly shown us over and over again that what we know our knowledge base really does shape the physiology over those outcomes now that strss is both bad and good which one as it dis average to nothing no it turns out that you can buy us this in one direction or the other depending on which information your listening to more often i think this is really important i still im trying to get my head in my mind around what is happen over the last few years and where it is place tus lay where did it land us are we more resilient now or we just really beat up i do not know i really do not know but i think how we interpret the last few years is gon to make a big difference in terms of how it impacts us how do we know if we are thanks y i i i what we are missing out there i think is a narrative from somebody that people listen to in or not saying that person should be me in fact it should not be me but somebody that can help us frame what is just happen to us much a goi think that the world needs a good therapist basically it is a very good therapist o i would call short term stress which is very beneficial for us is the kind of stress that happens on the order of a day two or three days not a problem even if you feel torn apart provided you can get rest afterwards long term stress is the kind of stress that really strerts to impede your sleep wake cycle make your dreams more stressful and more nightmares in thei're not going away and i can promise you that for those of you that have challenge is with thing sort of a accumulation of stress from the past that is now compounded by what is happening now et cetera that the solution does seem to be to get yourself into a supported environment of some kind that will allow you to go through a full catharsis again it does not have to require psychodelics a that can take you through the full ride of autonomic intensity cathar says of some sort and then relaxation that does seem to be what snaps people out of what welcall longer term stress and historical stress there is even the question of whetheror not focassing directly on the trama and the story is critical i think it is a mobviusy that something that should be done with a clinition but stress that impedes your sleep for three nights or more that shifts the pattern of dreams to more anxious dreams that is is more long term stress and for that you need to take it seriously and it is the kind of thing where if you do not take it seriously you can start degrading things your imiun system et cetera and i would say that under those conditions ou sleep as a good marker in fact the i'm sure therere some clinitions in the room i me one of the questions that is used as a diagnostic for whether not people are depressed are anxiously depress is whether not they are sleeping well or not right again language is not very good at parsing what is going on inside we have to look to behaviors and regularity of sleep wake psycles et cetera hofully that was at least a partial answer i c i try to be m accurate but if i were exhaustive i would i might actually cure in somnia some day with these podcast the if nothing else how is hypnos a impatin i a i'm in hypnosis now no the ac she spend mostly afternoon and hypnosis before i do these i spend good hour in hypnosis again self directed hypnosis cast it unfortunate keep talking o david spegl about this a again his is dad was one of the originars of hypnosis as a valid psycheatric treatment there is even the idea that things e m diar the scanning of eyes back and forth while reporting a narrative may actually be capturing some of the elements of hypnosis a again ad and this is why at least for me i appreciate the opportunity come together to night to talk about principles i i would hope that after to night you could look at any practis any thing any compound any breathing exercise and just be able to frame up which continuum where on the continuum what is it really design to do move you up towards alertness or down towards calm and in factas i cannot help myself i'll just tell you for all the breathing stuff it can be made very simple if your exales are longer and more vigorous than your inhales you are ging to get calm down if your inhales are longer and more vigorous than your exhales you are going to become more alert if you hold your breath just eventually to start breathing again the physiology maps perfectly to that that marmaps perfect to the physiology and if your for instance you do box breathing in hil hold ex hail holdin n t tha this kind of thing well you must stay right were you'r at you gan to bey on an even plain more or less oci that is of hopefully captures all of breathwork in one sentence nowl answer the question you are askoug me hypnosis it is imbact in my life in a couple of ways one way is more from a practical scientific way which is that my laboratory works on vision and we work on stress and in some ways those might seem divorced although now with the cuttle fish and the fact that you'r eyes narrow their field of you when your stress et cetera should become obvious why that is but hypnosis also takes advantage of this really weird kind of cool feature which is and the anways wer rean do it a group exercise but i cannot really see you all that wile i certainly cannot see your eyes well enough to nothis but david speagle there is actually something in the this is a valid thin call the speagal irol test and it is not the lecteen age iroll that when you look up with while not moving your head when you look up you actually are engaging circuits in your brain stem theyre evolved in generating alertnis and whe you look down in your eyes close the opposite is true your engaging circuits in the brain that are taking into a calmer state now when to be wonderful fall you had to do as look down you be calm and look up and you be lert that does not quite work that way but to induc hypnosis what they do as they have people look up and then whi'll looking up close their eyes which is actally kind of hard to do some people cannot do it their eyes roll forward hence the sbe ieroll test some people their eyes get you see the whites of their eyes and they looks really sbooky nthey are looking up while their eyes close those people are very prone to hypnosis why well hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation with alertness and focust it is a contextural narrow to narrowing escuse me take being in early stage sleepe and that is why stageshypnosis works with people telling people to do certain things it is not that they do not care or their under the control of the hypnotist sthat they forget what is around them why because their mind is focust internally and on the dialogue with the hypnotist and is not paying attention to context its o narrowing of context but hypnosis for me has been very useful because e it validated the relationship between vision and states of mind it also checks off this box again which is that to acus neuroplas to see what you need you need focus plos you need a state of deep relaxation usually first focus then sleep er non sleep deep ress ah but speagle and is daddy figured out cause their way smarter than i am that you can get people into that perfect state of neuroplasticity by combining them both in real time through this atypical thing we call hypnosis i do a daily or maybe every other day hypnos descript that is about it is self directed hypnosiscript of about five to fifteen minutes im usually trying to get myself to be less pist off about something that i'm really pistalf about frankly i imagine the stuf on really pistoff about in the screen on he left side i thing about ll the things to make me feel good and that keepthing abhow angry i am this is really how it goes and then over time i've notice well you are coupling that bodily state of calm to the anger thing this is all very hard to do in talk therapy no disrespecto talk therabe there is a tremendous advantage to talk therapy that i myself or benefit from it although according to certain people my life not enough but hypnosis works because it is it is capturing narrow plasticity processies thank you for that question one of the most affective protocalls for boosting the microbium oh we will here i'm very fortunate because my upstairs neighbor at stamford is the great just in soninburg and he and his wife erica run this amazing lab defining all the principles of the gupmicrobiom and they have a really cool idea i do not no be serious about this but i cannot help but chuckle one i think that this might actually be true we all know this is deffily true that we all carry round trilians of little microbacteria not just in our got that goes from one end of our throat to the other any mucosal lining eyes genitilia nows we have microbiums in our nose et cetera is why we are hading into th winter months being a nazel breather it that sounds craze new agy stuff be a nazel breather is ac shaly a book written by pul er can sandra con at stamford with a forward by jerred diamond and probert supolsky the book jaws thes a heavy hitters andthere is a very good evidence that people who mouth breathe or making themselves more prone to illness when nazel breathing because of the microbiom it just a better fillter for germs this winter and always really trying be a nazal breather all the time one of the best ways to do thatfyor not into the mouth taping thing which people to is to i'm trying do some of your exercise with am just nazal breathing and tickle awhile thoy get used to but i i'm not good the nazal breng thing am always talking the microbiom is all over us and in us it is on our skin were actuall exchanging it when we meet and we shake hands do what happens usuallyin the first ten fifteen seconds data from nomesobl's lab but the wisemen is shown that we wipe our eyes we wipe other people's molecules on us we are really good at that just watch these interaction now runs me doing the germ freeciand handshake the fisbump but there is this idea that maybe we are the house cats ri maybe we are not just transporting all these microbioda because it is good for us would have we are just the vehicles and they are running the planet and they oh we are running out of some stuff we should figure out somebody to take us to mars and then we will take over mars i m maybe it is all them and just on as the one that told me that ally that is conto erie you think about it but there might be these other intelligences that our hijacking us and that is kiniscaricause we to think that we are in charge and who knows what is good for your microbiom or what is good for them that is well prebiotic fibr seems to be very important but the studies of fibr at least is it relates to the microbiom are somewhat controversial there was a study done onhumans at stanfor by cris gardener and just in sonoberg that show that people who eat one to for they sor yetroramp up a servings of low sugar fermented foods this to be your kimchiesyour natas your sour crouts your key fers yeure combuchas et cetera per day develop a very robust microbiom and fibr did not do that in fact fiber increase the called in flamatome which is the mark marces for inflammation but that does not mean that fibrs bad fibr actriis gettin enough fibr is correlated with a number of other things that are great reduced carto ascular disease for instance cancers of the colan for instance fibr and got microbiota prebotics probiotics probably only necessary if you have a despiosis if you' been taking antobiotics or for some reason your depleated of t microbin one of the great ways tho deplete your microbiomas is just highly process foods but hopuly most people are not doing that prebiotic fibr and these low sugar fermented foods and then some one always says beer rights on always yes yes beer will support your microbiom but it might do other things do ah in general loalcall losugar a fermented foods reduce the number of inflamatome markers that is very very clear from the son an ber data and thend there are other ways of course the microbiomachite interacts with temperature the cold exposure thing as actually good for your microbiom but and i want a really emphasize this if you here about studies that such and such improve such and such keep in mind that anything that improves your sleep your microbiom or your social interactions will improve a basically everything else and those are what we call me modulating excuse me effacts not mediating effects this is really important and we teach first our graduate sunes in medical students about this for instance if there were a fire alarm polld t right now god forbid it would modulate all of your attention but would you say that fire alarms mediates attention no it is not directly in the line of mechanism but it can adjust and existing mechanism great sleep is great for everything but it does not control it directly and things getting great sleep keping your microbiom healthy getting enough sunlight at cetera they provide a kind of buoyancy to all the organs and systems of your body but they are not necessarily the thing that cures adht but of course if you have eightiate suour issues with focus getting enough sleep will help does new isnew tri sion the way to cure your adiate no but if you improve your got microbiom it is very likely that you are nor transmitter systems will improve limiting sugar will help et cetera et cetera there is reason to think that great sleep solid nutrician microbiom social interactions exercise with a kind of the big five there are others too of course with those you set a good boyancy to all the other systems and then we get into the things of how to directly increase fokass or modulate do pamin and on and forth oh well i realize some people are afraid of dogs we eke youhave a dog stimulus in our fear lab we get people there terrified of dogs we hired this dog train or guy yo as thes pitbles that will attact you while you are in we are a by the end people are a little more comfortable with dogs ain general a for you and me a if you are not afraid of dogs that is not terribly terrifying but am if you are it even the thought of that can be pretty terrifying i a couple of things people thought about the eye contact thing they make ey contact we are big on ey contact humans to am i contact is meaning full in terms of oxytosand release that is all real those day are are the more n more data tha come out with from better studies i contact is a big deal i think it is also that just the dogs are always game to show up exactly where you want to meet them and they always show upin their most loving possible state for them it is a pretty simple equation if you get it right they need proper care but au i mean costello was unique because the bulldog also you do not i get me going on dog breeds but the bulldog also looks disappointed all the time and then you do some thing it likes and then it looks delighted and pretty soon your working for theire approval and we were the odd couple me an him and i realize he is got me trained really really well to do my best to please him and delight him which delighted me and there i was on the hook s that is one reason i think there is also another reason which is supernarity which is this seetactile fibr thing which is yet these little nerve endings in your skin and we know of course that oxy tosan is released from parent and child o we knowis from nor imaging at ceter we know oxy tosan is released from romantic interact nonsecual romantic touch one of the things that is very powerful for the release of oxy tost very powerful is nonsectual grooming touch among members of a species or even a cross species those pictures of monkeys picking around in each other or people who ou insist on popping things on one another or people go to the hair dresse or the barber and they yo touchy does even have to be masage massive oxy tos and release those data do not get as much play as all the data on oxy tosin and love u you wis called the love hormon but it is it is basically a nor chemical signaling system for this interaction feels good and it is very much of the present and i think that is an important distinction to make more broadly s that dopa men is really about the pursuit of all things beyond the confines of our skin i man a get that thing i want that because it is all about anticipation and when you hve some distance between yourself and the thing that you think will deliver whatever it is you want usually pleasure in some former andother or excitement whatever your pleasure is or combined then you actuly have to mobile eyes and dopamen as the precurser to a drennalind lot of people do not know that a drennal is made from dopamen it gets you into motion then you have the reward systems that are more about what you have from your skin surface inward this is gentle totch holding hands and indeed stroking your dog probably does that for you wouldo accuvates the sea fiberers as they are called in your skin which feed right in to these saratonan and oxitosan systems of the brain sound a little pop psychology ish but it is a real thing and it exists in essentially all mamalian species i think a lot of us just dogs cause they'l let us just pet them all day some people to be touch but more or less even when they trust is all consent i was enoites is consentiual age appropriate contects appropriate in this case species appropriate ose the conditions or important am when i was a kid i i had o know why my sisters in the osson kno why she decide to do this in the first place but i loved having my face kind of olike pet that i still it but do not try it cause that she is the only want she cannot do it anymore even we all of these things that feel good and i think it feels good because it releases these these chemicals and these are ancient systems ancient ancient systems that we all have and i think dogs let us do that and cats toy with us with this one because there are those cats that let you pet them but most of the time they are doing it to you and then they withdraw and i do not know many dogs that do that i think people ofm an answer the question finally i think dog we love them much because they let us pet them as much as we want and cats play this very diabolical game bthat is a lot more human relationships how can night owl's best function in a society made for morning birts ah can you change your conotype or doust night owls just have to suffer o ket well as a former night owl am i use to work long hours in the lab am i still work long hours but lessen the lab just happens as the way the the career goes but tinfoil on the windows or lock the doors at last the music and i would stay there over the holidays until had to go hone just for the holiday events and my clock would drift i became a night owl and than it my clock would flip and everyone was gone mind gets really tweaked when your not inter acting with anybody by the way seen faces in the morning and seeing faces at some point dr in the day once you are ready to face the day very important for mental health this is something i wish more people knew about it also and here i'm not trying to evoke any kind of sentimentality but when yu think about people who just are clearly not doing well whether not ther have shelter or not you it is how often do we actually make direct ey contact nowadays it is not very often i contact is important but i've also shifted to beng a morning person and here is the thing if you are a true night owl that means that you are circatian clock meaning the genes that control the air of your brain in your hypothalmus that controls wakes sleep cychaels is fundamentally different very unlikely you will become a morning person without being a out of angry morning person as you can use that argument you can cight me however as we get older it is true that the amount of slow wave sleep to remsleep tends to change and we can do better on shorter abouts of sleep mostly because we are getting less rap it i movement sleep and even if we try we cannot those people would probably be better off sticking to limited amount of sleep at night and then getting a short nap the ruid naps is nap if you want to do not if you do not want but not if it interferes with your night time sleep and if you cannot nap do some sort of non sleep de breast or andasty ars ever forted nonsleepy perse you can probably shift your clock by anywhere from to to eight hours and that is true for jet lag is well light is going to be the best way but if you really want a shift your can have to stack the big three or four light get light when you want to be awake temperature you have to increase your body temperature to wake up you have to decrease body temperature go to sleep keep ou mine f you get into an ice bath or cold shower you get very very cold but then what happens slike putting a nice pack on the thermistat your body temprture goes out member thermogenasas that is the warming of the body ind response to cold of coure if we stay in a long time you will you will get crispy colld etrentrpobsicl but the ideas that if you take a cold shower and you get some bright lighting you get some exercising and drink some kaffine you can train your system to expect that at a certain time of day and you will want to go to sleep a little bit earlier we are much earlier and you will want a wake up when you stack those things but that also means not taking kaffine and cold showerers and doing exercise late at night i's gin it take some work but those of the the big for it is can o be light is the most powerful way to shift more light a wake less slight asleep temperature increase a wake temperature decrease asleep right food is the other one eating and force yorself to ep breakfast even if you arenot a breakfast eater this works when you travel to just get on to the local meal sgadual cause you have a clock system in you'r got believe it or not you want a sinchrnize that with your brain and then activity getting some sort of exercise but it takes a little bit of work but you can do it you can deffling do it if you are nocturnal that is werd unless it is because of your work in which case there are tools for shift work that we have put out there on on the podcast your pod casiven will success how you see growing over the next years i honestly i try and live in the tunnel of lack of understanding in a wareness about what is happening with all this ive really do i lack suggested we do the podcast that is ha true story or doing it i i still really do feel very much lyke i did when ons e lokit unjurskin to keep trying to learn and share i'd love for people to share of the tools i do not want credit for them if people credit us great but if you think about it most of what we talk about are not things that you buy these are tools that again work the first time every time i always say behavioural tools first then nutrition supplementation and the for some people prescription drugs or some of these more experimental drugs make sense for some people does not frinces i do not think kid should be doing psychodelic to me childhood is enough of a psychadelic experience in and of itself but i had a u an amazing clinition he is ik yu triple board certified psycatris nerologist hat samfored noling williams on the podcast and he talked about even the use of abigain and m d a ma even in some younger populations but again with therapeutic oversight it blue my mind i did not all i elsoo did not know this that emdi a may i thought was toxic please do not just take it off the street but if you are intreting clinical trials or great clinical trials happening through maps and you can look at no one's webside as well you most of the knowledge about the effects of m di ama is from the eldiesque community ah because they volunteered for ah these studies because it is on it is not on the band substance list and there is a lot of knowledge and they do not tend to or they do not use o ther substances u alcohol and marowana cocane they but much of what we know about the effects of emdia ma on the body and brainer is from that community other communies to as well what are we going to do with the podcast well every mondaym en a keep putting out episodes until they put me in that grave with the thing thank you i it it is a labor love and and it is a lot of fun and were we are just always trying to make them better clearer somehow they are not getting shorter i was tell rav this one's give me ninety minutes and he is ye how leve it when i see it i think for me one thing that i ithas brought that is really wonderful is the opportunity to learn from people and other domains that are far better at putting information and things into the worlds i've been i hope he does not mind me saying this i've been very blessed a become really good friends with rick reuben who is been realy helpful to me is as amazing book on creativity coming out that is not a plug for the book olike a ich as kone of accentlly did it but rick of courseis produce ind created all this amazing music everything from rundim c b c boy layer johnny casser is amazing an one of the things that he is been impressing on me is that it is ver y important to stay focust on the process of what you are doing and to really not get in to a too much of what that is how that is landing i do to hear when things are not clear that is really helpful to me i do to hear suggestions about great people to bring on the podcasts i love u criticism ah as most of the time i try my it is hard sometimes but i really trying just absorb it for what it is but i love that aspect of interacting in this this is very fairly unitirectional hopefully theye'll be more opportunities for kind of dialoguing and learning what is out there my real hope is that practitioners will start to incorporate things and again it is not about me i'm gleaning from fields than the work and discoveries of other people and trying to thread acrossfield that is why i see the podcast going just more the same more the same more the same but a lot more and more topics as best we can lots of guests and we hare shave an episode with coming out at some point about creativity which i think it is one of the more interesting aspects of our or being you watch for that what is a stress inoculation pro to call for the work a work place anxiety speaking does the principle staying communder hydremacies yet definitely i think if you were to pick some sort of u practice that you could do privately and safely again how cold should you make the water cold enough that it is really on comfortable you really really want to get out we can safely stay in and that is why we never say forty degrees because for you can' kill yourself with cold wates just hard to do you have to get really really cold before you kill yourself and open bodies a water ant good act hy i told my friend sammer hatar he is the director of conobiology you nit at the national institutes of mental health he came on the podcasts got him really excite he is great about all the stuff on light and sleep taught me a lot of that over the years were good friends i told him about the cold water thing and he got into some river in bethezda and almost rown sammera now he is thi story about how we almost drowned and what you any thought about a paper he want to write while he was almost drowning just be careful open bodies of water or that kind of thing but i i think you can quickly see within about a week or of doing some sort of deliberate a drenalin release it could be sickly hype of ventilation twenty five hyper ofventillyad breaths with a short breath hold repeat done two or three times we have good data to support that in the lab you see massive shifts and people's base line level you become aloven more hostillo you really do and ofn the way to think about is if you are more on a sea saw than on the continuum you get better at loosening that hinge and controlling that hinge or you can imagine cant of moving up and down that seasow a lo bit more easily umand then of course you have to place yourself into the environmen yoeve to test yourself in that environment and some people will do tostmasters and things that it can work mymy way i do not know iit works for e but my way as o startaking do not stop and cannot feel distress would you think weill be the next hotopic new trend in the field an norsin's behaviour l therapees ho i that i have lot of opinions about that a first sal i do not think it is can be brain machine in her face o my good friend et ich ang who iave known since we were nine he came on the potkasy works on epilepse is cherof nor surgery we had a bird club when we were kids at two members ye had to know the names of all that all the talking words and then you had to know which one was the best talkern its the minea bird and of course no n want to join known even took the test but he became anero surgeon and does brain machine in her face he is doing truly incredible work getting people with locked in sindrum to speak through a device inplanted under the skull they just think what they want to say these are people have not moved or or shared a word with anybody and they are now communicating but here is what is really cool and that he has also realize that facial expression as a lots one thing to see on a screen what somebody and in a chair or a hospital bed is thinking that is wonderful but facial expression is such a rich part of this this is a really good use of a i he it is now created very realistic i pat images of that person's face and they are actually speaking the words and people form a deep relationship to the person whose right next to their avatar sthat is a positive use i think of avatars and etdi's doing amazing work that kind of work of brain machine in her face neurl lank et cetera i think it is going to be very useful and popular in the realm of therapeutics for parkan sins movement disorders epilepsy locked in sindrum et cetera i think we are many many many decades from chipin plantation into the brain for things enhancing memory and frankly i would not want it not because i woulnd want enhance my memory but because of what i said earliers that the nervous system has a certain amount of real estate and you do not want to make that real estate very lopsided and i think we are going to see something very different in the next ten twenty years and i hope ope hope this carries over to younger populations i think we are going to hopefully start learning about our nervous system an what it can do and the fact that we have these pre existing sarkats in us that we can learn to leverage that work first time every times i'm strongly biased in my answer but i think that it still remains in open question for instance whether not people could require less perhaps or no medication for certain things and i say certain things because for conditions skis a frenia by polar in particular medication osid as proved very effective but that their whole other set of conditions depression and anxiety for which behavioral tools really work but most people just ont even know they exist that is my hope and am again i of tha therapeutic co munity could try and expand their tool kid i also thnk we are staring to see a blurring of the lines between different fields of psychology it is no longer psychoanalytic verses cogna behaviour o verses dialectic verses at m dar verses hypnosis that it is all gan be governed by some sentral principles all those camps is just it is just silly frankly to me it make sense academically why those came to be but in nerrow science we had the same thing you used to have to pick itase a john hughesfilm from the eighties a b a jock or a punker popular kid now it is not that and half this audienceis looking me what you talking about and that is exactly the point which is i'll never forget i grope in the scape word thing first time i saw some oe wearing scape woarding shoes on they escape what in the know they just people jus wearing this stuff right what you start to realized all blended to gather which is grat and in the feeld of nerrow science you used to have to pick are you an anatamist or a physiologist are you in't o nerrl computation at now your lab has to do it all or you collaborate with people those divisions have really melted becaus people are interest in questions and theyre injust in answers and do not get me started but the careerism of the requirement for everyone to have their own independent laboratory and say this is my mission that is one of the worse things about science because everything we know says that collaboration collaboration colaboration leads to faster progress and i'm not going to take on the whole academic system it is been very good to me but i'd to see a blurring of the boundaries it used to be that labs were not here i'm really guilty huberman lab but it used to be that labs were named after the problem they worked on vision lab stress lab happiness lab i that quite a bit more but i screwed up and call this whole thing the huberman lab you had a number youhave had a number of performance interision fitnes ex percern to show what changes of you make your fitness protical include nutrition oh ye well i'm an ominofor i those things they call car behydrates they and i eat them in moderation and i i've never really been too extreme about any of this or the fasting thing although i do cojust i've not very hungry in the morning that is all secause i the eel ot night i wake up not that hungry what have i changed weln'n terms is of fitness stuff i've definitely start to incorporate more nazel breathing when i do carty of ascular work because it has eliminated any sleep apany i had and sleep appeny as very very bad very very bad you now i wish i could say snoring was no big deal but we know based on work of the stampord sleep lab pen sleep lab other sleep labs that people who have sleep apnia are really in for trouble for a number of reason you want to learn to be a nazal breathe or and if you some people take their mouth shut with medical tipe when hey go to sleep other people will just start doing carty of ascular work keeping their mouth closed and that requires that you not go to intensely but it is as create a dilation of the of the nazal passages those scinessis can dilate 've deafly done that ad at the end of training i try and do one minute or three minute decompress not immediately look at my fone to cat learn to shift from high intensity kind of thinking and uto lower intensity thinking and shift throughout the day tasks switching i think it is goin to be a big area of science and you'r a science in general ahwe still do not know how to tasks witch well how to shift the mine from focus to defocus and back again that something that there is but by the way this is i i think of a a rich opportunity for people to develop tools we do not kno a lot about that we got too caught up on consciousness flow an free will and that stuff is great but i as you can tell i tools i physiology i the things that work in my lifetime andthat we can figure out and agree upon in my lifetime let us see got it and i'm told that this final question i when they have put the clock up here earlier to they sai ther were in a run it for sixty ments my first question was where is the snews but an i can keep going but i think there gon homeme to it i know people this is new york after all their other fon things to do ah for things that take a long time career pursuing a degree is ar right way to know they were on the right path is there way to know er on the right path thank you for that question i get aske this a lot and gosh theres much information out there much information about this we do not yet have a gauge of whether not we are in too much stress or not but there is one tool that is used in the free diving community and in other communies that you can use as a kind of thermometer of your how well your functioning and some of you may know it already and if you do forgive me is this carbondoxid tolerance test why mi answering this question this way while i to start with actionable tools if for instance you were to just take three or four breaths and then take a big deep breath and then do a very slow control baxhal could be through your knose or through mouth i deately through your knows and you are trying to make tht exhel as long as possible until your lungs are empty and you time that that is the call the carbondox i discart rate or discarrd rate or the extell this cardrate and it tells you how well you are controlling your diafram using somethig all the frenic nerve it also tells you how well you are managing carmondyoxide and how well you are managing stress and if youre very stress that number will be very very short i'm not soing bout how long you can sit with lung's empty an talkan honest a praisal of how long you can controll that axail for and if it is anywhere from zero to twenty seconds you are stress level is high and if it is from twenty to forty seconds it is moderate and longer than forty seconds means you have good control over your carbot doxide system m or less now these are averages and guess what has nothing to with fitness and also it has nothing to do with you persay because if you do this when you first wake up after a good night's sleep you will have a long discard rate if yu do this after running you willhave a shortguss carderate you are not out of breath you are just not managing this system very well you can touch into this every ones and a while as sort of a blood pressure reading type thing this is very back of the envelope it is not perfect but it works well enough that alongside things resting heartrate heartrate very ability et cetera youn get a window into how well you'r managing stress why am i answering this question this sway well this is something i recommend doing every one an a while especially if you are in a period of a career or any kind of pursuit where you are feeling your grinding i think once your carmeda oxide discared rate starts to really get shorter and shorter you are having trouble sleeping i think it is time to focuss on re establishing that buoyancy to your nervous system because then and only then can you make good judgments about whether not you'r in the right trajectory for you now in terms of the larger psychological themes are you doing something that brings you meaning or not that gets into some complicated territory we are very good at assigning meaning retrospectively and saying well that was a good experience because we had it and we learned from it et cetera but i think most pe wld to avoid things that they can only look back on and say it was useful because i learned something from it and for that i'll just give the default but i think at least to me accurate answer which is the more often that you can tap into that feeling of excitement and delight in your work even if from small things or from surprising things or from the social interactions that you are able to glean from that work the longer and better you are going to be able to pursue that line of work for me is in graduate school i was very isolated i worked alone in the lab maybe was cause of the tinfoil i put on the walls or the windows i do not know in fact my graduadevisers one complaint was that i'd seemed unfriendly i was not un friendly as jus busy but i got to be very good friends with the juanitorial staff cause they were the only one around at the time i was working were a few other people and those small interactions actually became very significant to me and became sources of sbrief but to me at least to the time meaning for social exchange and of course eventually i made friends and had relationships of other kinds and things that were healthy as well but i think learning to tap into this love of what youre doing is sometimes hard but you have to look for it it is an active process and i'll default to to the work and the poccass it is coming with rick reuben and he is a lot of what he talks about intrems af creativity is about accessing what he and others have talked about as the source if that is an abstract i do not know what is but the source is this ability to see yourself as more of a poort ole for getting certain things done in the world then being careerist and focussed on whether not outcomes are really matching what you need it it involve some mental flexibility and is of course okata pivit back and forth but we can only access this feeling of delight and joy and this feeling that were somehow connected to some larger theme ach a meaning i think when we are able to be comm enough and not focuse but in ordertoget anything done we have to be hyper focused and that brings me back to the basic principle of his whole discussion which is that it is not about landing yourself in a state of focus motivation and drive or in a state of deep sleep certainly not in a coma it is about being able to move up and down the various continuums that allow you to access focus and real yon gaspetal down to the floor kind of thinking and action but then also deliberately back off transition to periods of rest and the real key is for you to feel your in the driver seat if we know anything from the last hundred plusiears of psychology and nurow scince literature it is that if an animal or a person feels that they are in control of the physiological process within them and they know they can get themselves out some way somehow at some point and back in to a state that they want somehow some way at some point well then all the language is around meaning and happiness and delight starts to emerge learn to move around along tose continuums learn to do it deliberately and i wish you the very best of luck in it i know it works thank much for coming out i really appreciate it and don grateful to our sponsers of course thank you and to all of you for your time i know there is lot to do in the city and ren enjoys it and of course i be remissed if it din say thank you for your interest in science

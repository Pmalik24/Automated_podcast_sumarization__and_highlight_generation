folks will get to all the news in just one moment but i have to tell you that to day is for me a sad day a couple of days ago facts by my friend tom mac donald featuring me dropped from the topslot on ie tunes right after the gramme's after ten days of pure magic it is still the number one rated hippop song in america on i tunes but rap honica is officially over and with tears in my eyes i have a big announcement to make tall the little home's we have been lifting me up since i began this journey it was an inspiring moment some of called it a musical supernova but now the time has come for me to walk away from my art and to day i have to announce i am retiring from rap to spend more time with my family it is been real dogs and never forget the music neverdiyes long as the beat is in your heart are i pee doctor dradl i know i know that i've ben getting a lot of sad messages from people people who grew up with my music people whose lives were changed by the by the beats and by the flow but i've decided to leave the industry too a young generation of truly great artists of truly great rap artist artist ice spice she of the rhiming name ihave been informed reliably that ice spice is a human and that ice spice also has a bran new charting the song out no she is not sur pass fact on the charts yet but we can only hope that for the sake of western civilization eventually she is widely appreciated by the masses in the way that shes richally deserves ice spice as a brannew song out and i'm the nature of this song is ive think quite deep and requires a bit of explication and we have deconstructed the culture on this show before in fact itwas probably my extraordinary rendition of wap that legtid eventually to my hippop startam and then of course to my short lived but brilliant career in the industry and we have to deconstruct a little bit of the culture that i am now leaving is i od be onest i was been drawn into im in that week in that week where i was the top charting wrapper in america youo i i have to say wen to the clubs sipping on some henny is wherein the blang my wife she was really i'm gettn in toe lifestyle as well but ay iagain i have to leave it to the

slot on the rap charts is a song that is called bo bo bo or bow bow bow f my baby dad im and a apparently is an older song youno classic from our friend sex red she of the multiplastedy bouts and tum she apparently tid ay randition of this rap f my baby dad at a hospital after having her lat ist baby because nothing says lucky child quite you are pushed out a mom and you are immediately making sexual vidios in which you say f the dad of your child that is that that that baby's going to live that is that is a happy life for that kid getting im well wll i'm jst absolute cultural genius happening i cannot imagine why tom mac donald i rappes about the short comings of rap culture because it seems it is in it is doing well it sems drulian sentivizing excellent behavior here these pictures are in sane by wayk she is litrally in the hospital bed and a she is posing as out and touching herself in the hospital bed i got i got a say that the definition of sexy has ratically changed in america if people find this attractive in anyway shay perform iin any case here is some of the vidio she literally cogt a music vidio from her hospital room after having a baby about f the baby dad good stuff happening here sh n nosfurging round dollars in the hospital room presumbly in not com ansurance i shes working on her hospital bed after having a baby points for durbility i suppose im oso there there is at there is a lot to say here one thing i will say is tha dom if this lady does not get to take a maternity leavin why des peop lo tocet get three months off for a huttern you leave i'm confused about that i mean she is back to work wif thin seconds and by work i mean tow e arcay work tha this is this is solid stuff guis i know i understand that i had a place in the rap culture i understand that i was an inherently important part of hippop but i have to as i say i have to leave it to the prose the reas an icementime on the step by the way is i think folks need understand do not we talk cover politics a lot on this show the number of people who are drawn in by pop culture is insane pop cultural engagement in america is it levels not even remotely charted by politics the number of people in america who watch politics is extraordinaryly low it is really really really low in fact if you look at thou latestatistics with regard to for example news websides in political webside's being visited the answer is that the numbers ar way down waywayway down since the last election cycle and if you look at big political events for example the fifth republican primary dobate that is ro two point five million viewers trums competing town hall ad about four point three million viewers aggregate all of that in your talking seven million yours total and then if you ad in people on the other side of the ouate politically engaged you are talking a maximum of fifteen to twenty million people who are politically engaged on anything a regular level and even those people are not engage the way that you probably are listening to the show listening every day the number of people whowill engage with content in pob culture is much wider and much iced i speak as a charting artist as the nuber one rap artist in america as a hot one hundred number sixteen recipient on billboard are without any radio place i speak as a great artist of my of my jonra and let me tell you pob cultural engagement is much more important in terms of how young people think and the values thater shape then actual baseline posic tha'swhat we spend time on it it is why we'v dundee constructing the culture before and it is why it is sort of manters that garbage is being parbaded every day by people a spice and sexy red as our culture gets dumber and dumber and stupiter and stupider oka meanwhile on the political side of the isle the is a lot happening s i have to say that donald trumps take over of the republican party there've been some interesting things about it i the lot of his policy as president but one of the negative things about having a singular figure a top the political pile for any party is that there is a tendency to follow them to stupid places and to day i have to examples from president trum example number one president trump came out yesterday and he suggested that conservatives go back to bine budlight now you will recall that it was just last year that budlight decided they were going to sponsor as a as a fase of their brand dellin mullany a man who mocks womanhood by pretending to be a girl and they made a budlight beericannallist and people thi us at to show myfrand mt walsh they dayly ware personalities premic teverody on the right said okat will word not then by budlight first all tases corsepist and then beyond that it actually is promoding values tat we do not t o great american brand budlight not not and heizer bush which is now forn own but the actural budlight brand is a deeply american intertwine brand and they are sacrificing thei'r brand which is basically blue collar people in favor of upper class tran's politics and it is stupid and it is bad and is bad for the country ands were not can dring but light any more an budlight tok get directly on the chin ther sails went directly through the floor and they are they were in fact reduced to not the number one beer but the nmber two or number three beer madello actually overtook them for example whell mow president trump is calling for an end to the boy cot on budlight which makes no sense if you have a successful bug if you successfully destroyed a large brands in order to make a political point you then do not undestroyed the brand before they have actually apologized for the thing now budlight is trying to make some sort of obassons to the other side of the isle to our side of te isleon the conservative side by going in contracting with a dana whight over at tyem maylikt dan't i'm frends of dana but the the attempt to sor bybat conservative lov i hiring dan up that does not make up for what you did in the first place when you spit in the fa ase of all of your consumers well now donal trump its calling for an end to the boy cot he put out in a e a missive last night on truth social he said the budlight ad was a mistake of epic proportions and for that a very big price was paid but anhizer bush is not a woke company anhizer bushes a great american brand that deserves a secon chance what do you think perhaps instead we should be going aftfer those companies that ae looking to destroy americo now why would he do that why what why what wouldtrive presiden trump one most vindictive voices in the history of american politics to suddenly doside that it is time for forgiveness for bud lightwell it could be the fact that apparently heelns about five million dollars in anheiser bushstock it could also be the fact that a top republican lobbius for the company its hosting a fund razer for trump next mumnp with some tickets going at ten thousand dollars each maybe it is that don trump tjuner has also previously defended anheizer bush saying the company tonated morter republicans than democrats and holp ceve mc carthe is efver to assume ant control of the house now as my friend mat wallh says this he most effective boycot prolly in the history of concerveto politics why would you endid on the base of donal trum jussessup we's a more on this in just one secon first well have that weird neighbor the one who has a rusty car wit the tarp over it and that car has not been started in fifteen years or the guy who just happens to

also call for an end to the anheiser bush boycot he says quote as some one that worked for this incredible american company got to know them very well i rased for anhiser bush in the eighties i agree with it donal trump look go at the company does for many americans in their track reckor over the years it made a huge mistake in a pai ta large price i think it is time to move fort i 'am saying we should focuss on the big picture agreeing with forty five the big picture is that fortyfive of courses president trump with the forty fifth president the big picture is nonagring with president trum it is never been agreng with president trump i gruth presiden trump when president trump deserves to be agreed with and i disagree with president trump when he deserves to be disagreed with this would be one case where he deserves to be disagreed with there is another case where he deserved to be disagreed with and now as on ronot romey mc daniel let me tell you the tragic story of rono romney mc daniel who now goes by rona mc daniel the reason she goes by rona mc daniel this is not a tr o is because rona romney mcdaniel who is in fact related to mit romney of course she used to go by she issues his nees she used to go by rona romney mcdaniel and then it turned out that when she became arente chair and donal trump was the leader of the republican party she dropped the romny because trump hated romney much because that is the cand of obeisance that is demanded by many people who really love trump and trump himself is that you have to somehow drop actual parts of your name because he does not their uncle which is witld in thit is wild it is jus good jobbersers of adjob and then turned out she to crappy job ronaromny mc daniel is historically the single worst aren c chair of my lifetime the only possible exception being michael steel she is a erabl arente chair truly a horrifyingly bad arnte chair in fact her tenior as arente chair which began january nineteenth twenty seventeen just preceded by rin's previous when that up going into the administration briefly when she assumed office in twenty seventeen she assumed office with donal trump having a housemajority and a sent majority thow as the state of play when she took office she then proceeded to lose the house in twenty eighteen and she proceeded to lose the house and the senate in twenty twenty twenty twenty one and then she proceeded to wildly under perform in the twenty twenty two election cycle and now the arente is flapro the arnt has no money inthe bank she has sacrificed whatever principle she had including the political princple that the arenty should be involved in choosing candidates on the primary level who can win and then raising money for those candidates and then boosing them to victory instead she basidly decend that trump could have vre raign of the place much that the arenc any time there is a conflict inside the republican party between trump an any other candidate in the primaries not in the primaries with regard to the senate with regard to the house the arnty always cided with trump because mc daniel knew where her bread was buttered and unsurprisingly bunch of loss its huge string of losses foronoromym daniel to the point where after the november twenty twenty to elections the republicans by pulling ditter were supposed to clean up republicans were supposed to win a broad majority in twenty twenty two bught the arence did not do its job the arensee is a vehicle for victory one of its jobs is to work with the senatorial republican campaign committee and the anarc c the national republican campaign concongressional campagn comitte and all the rest of these groups in order to select good primary candidates particularly im purple districts and purple states in order to boose them to victoryin the arent completely abdicated the arante insteadspent re bspent a bunch of money on perks and flouers and nice dinnerers and limmos and then the twenty twenty two elections were a full skill disaster area n which the republicans not only did not regain the senate tanded up retaking the house by a handful of votes nd that handful of otes is small the republicans can no longer do literally anything in the house of representatives with out making serious concessions to democrats those all ron out romney mc dniel in january of twenty twenty three in the pear between november twenty twenty two and january twenty twenty three there is a seriou suffer to oust ron out romney mc daniel in fact you will re call tha right after the election in november twenty twenty two i openly called on the show forthe replacement ov ronout romney mc danel becauseyou do not get to lose this many times and still retain your job at any job if you if you fail over and over iyou fail once o ke that is call life you fail twice o can maye you need a serious corrected you fail three times now you are starting to look pretty bat you fail four times you shuld lose your job and she fell twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two she gelt four times four supper times just complete failure and now no money in the bank and the nominy of the party for good or ill is the person who basicly put her in place donald trump in dorsed her again to be come the arans chair over harmey dillen who is a far more credible far more serious candidate full disclose your harmy dillan has acted as our lawyer in suing the federal government for example here at daily wire harmeet is great there is some other people who have been talked about has arin tea cher her be good now donald trump a couple whichsto go after having boosted mc daniel back into place just in time for the primaries where the aran see every time at poud put its thum on the scale for nonal trump now thath she ben the knee to trumpet every which way literally tok romney out of her name bent the aran seet you trumps will at every possible point now trump is going full jowfre and cutting off her head now she is going to be out of a job is it again directly after she was in dorsed by trump and one reelection as ar intea chair now ron out romney mc daniel isa is gone she is expected to leave according to the washington post quot ronaromney ronot mc daniel is expected to leave her trob the spring after formel president onal trump had increasingly grown priti cal of her leadership according to people familiar with the matter oh did he you mean after she in short that he got everything tht he could possibly wonth in twenty eihteen twenty twenty twenty tweny one twenty twenty two and twenty twenty three basicly she did everything trum cer possibly wanted now he is defenistrating her said he can blame her for all the problems with the aron see despite the facthat again he boosted her to that position we's mor on this in just one second first when you unng a business your employs can create all kinds of interesting situations somebody not showing up when the're

com right now type ben shou pero under pod cast when you sign up they know we sent you spalle b a m b e dot tom bam b dot tom typin ben shippero right now to get started again it is i'm glad she is leaving shoosn competent sheld hare bad job ye only point that i'm making is that you should agree with donald trump when it is good to agree i agree with him about alsing ronarony mc danial i also agreed about alsting her before she was eaven the ar an t chair and i disagreed wih donal trump when he was attempting to foist her into place the decision came as she visited marolaga and met with trump on monday but the situation remain fluid according to people who spoke on the condition of ananimity the news of her departure was first reported by the yor times which reported it was likely to a car after the south carlina primary on february twenty fourth shofs expected to servantil twhenty twhenty fivebut has considered leaving for months her relationship with trump soured over the re publican primary debates featuring his challengers this pass ot fall trump wanted her to council them and shoe does she provided much fuelty to him i mean she really tit during the primaries if she 'idn't force him to sign any pledge thing he vote or the other candidates despite the fact that you wanted all the other candidates to pledge theyd vote for trump if in fact hiu on the nomination she made room for him at every possibileturn butt she would not just outright hand him the primaries and got pistad her and now he wants her out and now she is leaving the point in the matter is that if you wish for good policy to emerge from donald trump or any one else that does not mean listening to trump all the time it does not minlis not in trump when h says and the budliht boy cot it does't meinlistn't in trumpwhen y tries to boost rona mac anual back to the arency chairmanship in january of twenty twenty three he mean some times h's right and sometimes he is wrong youre independent human being andyou should have your own thoughts on matters and you should not just follow any politicion or people m any one literally anyone blindly yu shuld actually think about these things and then decide whether or not in meats with your principles ohga meanwhile speaking of the consequence of having a very narrow house majority yesterday the house voted on impeaching athehon throte mayorcus the secretary of home then security now too be fair to the republican congress people who voted against im peaching alehonder maorcus know hig crimea mis de eaner was actually alleged e there are some members of the house who argued against donald trumps impeachment including my galligar of wisconsin is really the representative i know mike i make e ma galligar voted against im peaching mayorcus why because he said less and i voted against donald trumps im peachmen because no crime was alledged hurno crime as ledge som also voting against impeachment now the reasnt i would have voted for im peacment if i were in the house and the reasonwh i think it was good that people voted for im peachment is because the im peachment is obviously a political tool a impeachman has obviously become political tool trump was im peach twice without any serious high crime or miste meaner even being charged in th in the impeachment documents and now that that is what it is everybody's fair game because if the rules apply one way for democrats and another way for re publicans then there are no rules no double standards a if impeachmen is a political tool all then should be political tol all the way and then we can make a deal i go back datisko anty where you only get impeach for actual impeachable offenses but until then you cross the line and we will treat it just a political remedy in any case the reason that the republicans could not get together a housemajority is because at their house majority wath narrow that goes back to the twenty twenty to elections in which the intervention of the aran c and oall trump and bad candidates ended up blowing the possibility of republican fifteen or twenty seet housemajority and republicans ended up with a tiny slim tiny house majority and ten ofcourse george santos was just t ouseted by congress which left them with one fewer republican vote and the house ended a voting two sixteen to two fourteen against impeaching alahondro mayorcas only four republicans voted in favor of keeping maricas or not impeaching ham the republicans who voted against the impeachment resolution said the merica's conduct dis not rise to the level of impeachable offence thes what tomiclintocks at to tomiclintuck by the way is a is a borderhaw tomiclintocking californiy he is not some sort of of bor dof esianimagrationaranything he just said the same thing that galagar said he said the impeachmen articles failed to identifind impeachable crime that mayrcus has committed demicrafts for accusing republicans of trying toscore political ploints which of course is true but that is exactly what they were doing when they impeached donal trump twice represent of kenbuck of colorado indicated another vote could take place once the house majority leader steeve scoleesh returns to work sclees has ben working remotely as he under goes cancer treatment in the end probably maricus will be impeach they do have enough votes to dit but barily the demicrats did wheel in people who are literally sick to try to get the vote to turn in favor of mayorcas representave algreen tried to vote on a second resolution targaning morcas but he backed off after receiving assurances from house leaders that the earlier affr proceeded to comittee level and then who is actuoul wieldin cause he was sick to vote against impeaching mayoras we

have known that for quite a while and in in yet another element of republican stupidity it turns out that banging your head anginst the wall does not and of being very good strategy they got ready come mc carthy as i said at the time mc carthy ar hipmoc carthy mc carthy knew how to count votes what is happening now nobody knows ha caunt votes and the deals arn't gettng any better slow clab for all the people who thought geting rid of comin mc carthy s gan affix the problems in congress ce butt in the end to americans as we say watch politics this granual little level or they care by how the impeachman vote goes rana no theyust get a general sense they get a sort of general gastalt of the election and then they vote accordingly and the general gust all right now that the border is i disasteraria and jobidon is the president and sto republicans whe're not passing this bad border bill they are winning a political victory right now the me yoare trying to turn this into republicans will not pass a border bill to give jobine the authority he needs but the border was considered a non problem by democrats and told this very moment suggest to follow the democrat logic for a moment the border is not a problem at all but if ye do not give jobid an extra power to srut down the boarder that is when the crisis emerges i'm noe need an explainer on that if the border wis in crisis wisn jobidon doing something about it he has the authority to do already as every one legally acknowledges jobidon however is trying to play the hand that he is dult himself again he could just shut the border and take the issue away from trump but he is afraid of ticking off that left toing base and sto now he is trying toblim publicans fr all of this he says the border is not secure beaus of trump in his friends this this is not going to play at all in any way shey perform this why he is thority points behind trump on emigration every day betre now nemember toe mer c peopleitenn now it the only reason the border is not secure is down trum magar publican transi'm i'm no that is not going to ork if you really think the maga is keeping the boarder open that is wrong jobidon is the president of the united states then jobidn wisd suggesting the re publicans neen to show some spine and pass the bill i'm we all know what is going to happen if that happens if republicans pass the bill the border will remain largely open because jobine will make sure that it remains largely open and then he will claim that he is ben able to create a by part is in deal to create responsibility at the boarder and then he will boader is left and say that he basically put one over on re publicans and whatever are the future border problem will be collone by the republicans that is the politics of this why douthink democrats re to desperate's pass this thing the reason the democrats are desperate's pass this thing is beause they see it is a political win here is jobdn trying to force republicans and devoting for it is not going to happen now all in the cases o this tou w move forward to th sent for why a simple reason don trump es dow cum ticis bad for him politically therefore he does not we not help to the cancy he is not for he would rather reponize his is he din actually sall for the last twenty four hours he is done nothing no told but reach out thre publicans in the house an a senate and threaten then o try to intimidate them to vote against this proposal and looks their cavy frankly they ow it to the american people to show some spine and do whit they know to be right i got to say ther two probems of this nuer one is the argument the other is that i swear jo biding at this point he looks nno joke julian glover as walter donofan at the end of indian anjones in he holy grail he looks you drank from he chose poorly literally every vidio of him is a state of further physical in mental degradation he is degrading before our eyes every one can see it it is impossible not to see it i jobidon is admitting by the way the bill will actually allow people to enter the country more quickly well know what the real agenday is here here is present inbiding admitting this yesterday thi stillid alsestablish new efficion an fair process for the governen to consider in a silum clam for those arriving at the border to day the process can take five to seven years as you all mou he shovof the border get a braced tol ticly come back when called five to seven yasion i in country that is too long in aston ration with the new policees in this bill and the additional of fourh foulicen three hundred more a sylum officers who spend hours i might have with each emigan to consider their claims a they cora qualify will be able reduce that process to six monts not five to seven years ge again he is trying to reduce the time puriod between when you apply for refuge you status and when you are granted refuge you status his goal is get more people into the country not fewer people into the country the only thing that the bill does that is presumably good is it changes the definition of asylum in order to have a legitimate asylum claim you now not only have to claim the iuffeure go back your home country you have to have some sort of credible fear that you cannot such that you cannot relocate inside your home country or in any country thatyouhave pass through before but how do you establish that sort of thing my seriously you think that jo bidon and his processing centers yoe loo com and the jus cone to say that there is con to say i cannot move inside my own home countrys people are pursuing me how do you confirm that then they are going to say mexico is not accepting me in orer to live there and the gangs are following me and there is no place i can go and then theyou s a new matric words listen i got by bordr patral agents some of them are in support of the bill thy thnk that it gives them him additional tools if they are allows dou their job ut thet i think the'e assuming that yourbine's going to allow them to do their job and that is ant assumption as we say in the law not in evidence and meanwhile jobidon has tied all of these issues together he is tied his version the border bill together with you crane aid together with israel aid which is kind of amazing because he does not have to do that it demonstrates his failure of the power of the of the bully pulpit if jobidon actually had any level popularity he could probably force each of these shisshues through one at a time lhat's sai that he wanted oucrane ad he raly forced that through he can make an argument to theamerican people he could say lissen eucranes can be overun by russa if we do not give them the aid then vlanerpoutans can be standing in keyev by the end of the year wen they need the aid most of the at is him go toward paying our military contractors anyway be nen to restock our supplies an all the rest he could say all that sort of stuff but he cannot heis really really unpopular and he is trying to lump that together with a significantly more popular proposition which his aid to israel in fact he cannot yesterday and said he would not even sign off and an independent eid to israel clean bill which is totally crazy he says he wants that he is the oe who proposed it he saying he wants fourteen billion dollars in military aid to israel and ten billion dollars for the other side he wants ten billion dolars in called humanitary nato gazi say called his commass and terror is hi jack a huge num a huge amount of that and then use it for weaponry that is wha he says he wants the republican toi o cafin will give you fourteen bill for israel and no ten bill for gaza and no sixty bill for u crane and bines all veto that he has to tie everything together he has to turn it into a crapsandwich it is his only hope of passing his man priorities at this point wel get to the situation in u crane in just one second first i need your attention mhave a major announcement markyour calenders the epic return of back stage after almost a year away filling the pendragon cycle jermy boring his back he is joined by matwash candis owns michaelmuls andrclaven and of course me join us this tuesday seven pm eastern sixpem central as we go behind the scenes in beyond the headlines there is a lad happening and o can one mis a menute watch the show live exclusively at dailywire plus tuesday night at seven pm eastern sixpem central a're not gon a want to missive and meanwhile the situation in new crane continues to be rather dir best report suggests the russia's going to moblize another all out assault on u crane some time later in the year and as western support for u crane declines youcranians are very much in fear that ceeve theoretically could be overun according to ou cranian media the ucrane in parliament has now passd the law proving a presidential decree to extend marsial law and you crane for another ninety days from february fourteenth until mad thirteenth apparently this is basically a unanimous legislative act because of course the country is still in fact at war and all of this is again coming to a had notchest because the united states is unlikely to grant sixty billion dollars and ades ou crane based on the cran voting constituency in the house of representatives but also because tucker carlson is now jet setting over to moscow to interview ladmarit pouten huros tucker confirming that he is interviewing putent and here he was explaining why he is doing it warin moskowtan i were here to interview the presen of russia lad in er putent will be doing that ton almost three years ago the bid administration illegally spied on our tex massagers and tatlea econfense to their servants in the news media they did this order to stop a p uden interview that we were clanning last one for pretty certainly did exactly the thame thing once again but this time we came to moscow anyway we are not here because we love lader were pruten we are here because we love the thated states ut we wat of terman prosperous and free na the entire the entire case that he is making is that you are not getting the full information and that we neednat interview with pouten i'll get that that is a'll find ind and i mean i'm i'm fined with anybody interviewing putent hell i've loved interview putent good for tucker for getting the interview ii will say that the only thing that is going to matter about this interview are the questions that he asks meaning that if he goes in and he basically just alows pouten to spout about dnosification efforts in ou crane and about how ou crane's actually a country that is filled with wild left liberals wh are promoting elg b t k values but there also notzies an that is why he is invading andthat is why he means to take out vlodmer's lensky or never that will not in fact be public service that will not in fact the information that is added to the information that people need to hear the the questions that need to be asked obvieus there what are the offrams why are you holdthing a merican journalistslike amo gerskevitch in jail why why is that a thing w tucker says in the vidio that nobody has as actually wantot interview putn esnot true a min a huge number of people have requested interviews with puten in the legsy media putntjust has not granted any because he feels that the lgsy mediat in the united states are very much opposed to him and there is truth to that i think for some pretty good reasons number one that vladmerpouten has sort of on a various history of having his political enemies yelled end or poison and or pushed off a buildings but in any case if tucker wonte provide another sawid it is the conflict that we can all get morn fresh nof be great but rling in a no exactly how that goes once the intervieu actually airs and i can a prejudge the interview i certainly of no problem with tucker interviewing vlodmer pouten i hope he does not do the same thing that he actually did with conya west when he had on cone on his show and proceeded to cut out all of the crazieskuctions of the interview with conyang which he was bouting even at the time wild tan smetacan a stuff in tucker cutt id out and then put out the interview with conye and it may conye look he was a lot more saing than he actully was at that time no again and tucker's a supers mark ey i think that he does care about the country and i with love to hear him ask some really solid questions of lamerputents i'm not asonement will see how it goes i will say that the kremlin is expecting that they know how it goes according to d and why ou z carlson's trip is exciting a lot of people over at the kremlin on tuesday elecsay then indictov the former editor of eco moskovy radio station said as i understand tuckercrossin got what he wanted apparently a source close to the presidential administration told the moscow times qhat tuckeras been expected here for a long time he is welcome here under scored the depth of carlson's commentment to the russian cause state media programs pointed out that in america he is called out as a trater and strip is being compared to jane fonda's visit to be atnom in nineteen seventy two now again the it is not jane fond unles he is actually a propaganas for the krumlin let see i doft want a pre judge anything in clives not con free judge tuckers interview i know lot in the media are already doing that i'm not going to do that intil i see the questions that he asked is a mass of opportunity obviously o could it have an impact in theoretically opening eyes to the possibility of a future solutions shore could it also be a propagan and real god min presume lass why puten is doing it apparently during an interview with the evening with vladimerit sol viov political scientist seregat mheiev said quote a fewords about tucker since he is a popular figure is as if tucker dares to broadcast this interview in the united states first and foremost this will blow up their informational blockade from within he said that ta in interview of puten will have some interesting consequence is quot it will blow them up into pieces this is a the united states and then he said god willing there will b a civil war in th united states because of it now again i think that some wishful thinking on the part of a some russian propagandist but it is worth yo pointing out that the only thing that is important about an interview is the contents of the interview not just the faces of the people ware in the interview and by the way the united states does have a very strong interest ing you crane not actualy just becoming a russian protectorate as i've said since the since near the egining of the war that the solution to this conflict was going to be in simply recognizing the frozen battle lines that are already presint in the donbas and in crimia the areas of the donbas that are currently occupied by russia and in crimea tha are curently occupied by russia ar largely russian speaking those or areas in which lodmers lensky did not win when when it came to last election cycle those are areas that did not vote some of them in last selection cycle because that ardy been occupied by russia in twenty fourteen but those are areas that did not voted for the the more european mine did you cranian politicians they would allready voted for themore pro russian politicians in those areas those conflict are not likely to be undone those arrars are not likely tobecome soverign u ucranian territory again any time soon thog battlelines hive ot move for a year and the idea of the all framp is american and european securito guarantees to u crane more military metary all put in to prevent a future invasion and setting of the of the final lines kind of where they are right now every one knows that solution the quessian i hopetucker asked puten is is that he selution for you right because otherwise there is no offrampan et just continues puten is counting on the west to just get tired eventually just give in keeve that is effect iof what puten is waiting for it now o cim meanwhile gena corono our friend who of course starrd and terror on the prairie for us we hired her after she was fired from the mandolorian for the great sin of saying that people shouldnot to humanize one another that is really why she as fired from the mandil oriange put up a mean saying es sentially that othering and ns with murder which is i thought kind of a main streame point of view in any case they fired her we hired her and shoos in terror on the prairie and w sort of of big wind for every one now gena is suing the wall disney company according to dedline hollywod three years after cronoas act

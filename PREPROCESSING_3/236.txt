thre's a crisis is importan to say certain things practical stuff information and instructions but also this feelings to share we need to connect it is not a momer for big revegations just when it tint the collers in the picture of you to a little bit this way or that mi coror cor bem has been having these daily conversations with he brother demola he is been sick with cove nineteen for over a week now thes conversations are totally different than that nurses vidio all the ways of that nurse o these barret is direct imagining every possible terrible ou come one by one and discussing it be madamalarand not into that i'm guessing with no evidence i ou here that most of us re mark bemendemoar we would rather side step thi scurious possibilities for as long as possible but in ther daily talks ther still new information passing between them than the usually share she is in new york damoar in the rest of her family are in london he is four years younger he perhaps remains the most beautiful baby i have ever seen youn my life aggressively my mum will tell you oh yet devilasim is beautiful of my babys she she makes no quams of us that is jus rude to sad you rather ccit ererid but deell i was beautiful he was pretty he was a pretty vaby he ill has the som this little beautys pot right whey marryling monro had has o well am e and these lashes and when he was very little my sister and i will put him on there was a thet was as short soc of them short exactly child level ironing bod ives more a table and we put him on ther and we would kiss him all over him until he would cry in protest her bim tell it dam was relationship with the sisters to day is a faint echover that his older sister is more expressive with her feelings damila i would a bit opart happen to be by himself separate island from the rest of them keeping his own counsel very quiet before he got sick been would usually texd om retalk to him whatsap a cop of times a week asofer was talk abut tevy shos quite exat bran again from future ama to each other and bem marking demila whenever is teem arts on alwayses but now thers talking every day and for te first time if te bidio chat the dailiness of it gives everything a different feeling the subject matter is different to i'm asking him did you drink enough water to day what is your temperature did the cough go away is it is it a dry cous a se hav the questions on the one hand a kind of very dry and basic but on the other i suppose because i've never asked them before it feels extra special now sa kind of be asking very specifically what is your temperature and to be able to track his life in this way the knowledge that it went from thet he seven degrees and now it is tirty six degrees and n i mean sells he is spoviously er it just feels really a oddly intimate that i know the temperature of his body a cross and ocean even though the question seems really kind of bland on the surface what is a temperature it is a way of asking and it is away i think also circumvensing the elephant in the room which is if he had a more serious case of covet nineteen is if his symptoms wol morl severe if things were really die we just do not talk about is when i ask about his temperature what i am asking is it is kind of a a shorthandets its half language that way you's visit visit as a yeurof y saying my mum ofton says which is a speaking from underneath your tongue and in a way i feel i am speaking from unterneath my tongue to ask a realy serious question but in the most blnd language which is all you drinking water was the headache is asking these very basic questions that a vasically pushing back my fear of what this could have been that is terrifying to me because the thing underneath it they do not saying is the thing i think i'm saying i fel lik am screaming it is please do not di i do not want you to die is ii she is learning some new in formation about this person she knows well these daily conversations but yhe seink such a different side of him norma he stoic she says ut now hi's way more vulnerable wan more opened everybody in the family calling him all the time and asking him questions i think he

beu go settle sating round the edges though it all of or stories to day i have to say it is way bigger than that it is people declaring you thought you knew the truth but no no know you did knot not all of it and the part that you did not know changes everything thow as ball harbys to say now the rest of the story stay with us i one i cannot be a hero baby certaint stories get told over and over about undocumented immigrants in this country one of the bigwins is about sacrifice about hard working people who work long hours and restaurant kitchens and farms and other go paying jobs to suport their families grateful for the chance to be in the uass wor the docka kids yo strive and want nothing more than college in the american dream carlo can i hov ve of his sensia as or lots of these stories thought she could do better tost gueed no to better essay there are very brief references in it to rapan suicide who shou when i was tha senior in college i wrote an anonymous a say for the daily beast about what they wanted to call my dirty little secret that i was un documented this was in two thousand eleven butfor daca and i was one of the first on document sudence to graduate harbard the essay got me some attention and agents wrote me asking if i wanted to rite a memoir i was angry a memoir i was twenty one i was infucking barbara strisand i had been writing professionally since i was fifteen but only about music wanted to be the guy in hy fidelity and i did not want my first book to be a rueful tale about being a sickly victorian orphan with to brculoisis who did not have h social security number which is what the agents al wanted the gui who event tally ended at becoming my agent respected that did not find an interchangeable inmigrant to publishas ad but bret everything i would write over the next seven years and we kept in touch i was the first person who wrote him on the morning of november ninth two thousand sixteen that morning i received a benth o females from people who are really freaked out about trump wenning and the emales essentially were offers to hide me in their second houses and dermant or stay in their basements shit i told my partner tofr trying to ant frank me by this poin i had read lots of books about my grants i hated a good number of these books i could not see my family in them because i saw my parents is more than laborers as more than sufferers are dreamers i thought i could write something better and i thought i was the best person to do it i was just crazy annough because if you ere going to write about on documentute in migrants in america tell the story the full story you have to be a little bet crazy ad you stertainly cant be en amered by america not still that dosqualifies yo i did not want to write anything inspirational i wanted to write for everybody who wants to step away from the buswards in a migration thi talking heads the dreamers an graduation caps and gowns and read about the people underground not heroes randams people i wanted to write about my parents and that is the story i'm going to tell here the story of my parents if you asked my mother where she is from sheis a hundred persent going to say sheis from the kingdom of god because she does not to s y that she is for maquadore a guador being one of the few south american countries that has not especially out done its self on the international stage magical realism basugly skipped over it and our military dictatorship never reached the methical status that wu benorchet or a veuteda plose there are no world famas aquadorians to speak up other than the fool who hass julianas on to the embasy an london and grusy nigelera's father who she said was a domestic abuser if you aske my father where he is fr m he will definitely say aquadore because he is sentimental about the country for reasons he is working out an theraba but if you push them i mean really push thm they are both going to say there from new york if you asked them if they feel american because you are a little nark coance to prove your blood runs red white and blue teu'r going to say no wi youl new yorkers they have lived in new york since they left aquadora nineteen ninety one i do not know much about my parent decision to choose new york or even the united states as e des thenation it is not that i have an asked them why they came to the united states it is that the answer is in as morally satisfying as most people answers are the capitated family member fammon and i nother cassed them for mordetails becaus i do not want to a cly pressur n a bruse the story as far as i knowic go something this my parents had just got in married and their small auto body business was noing well the idea of coming to america to work for a year to make just enough money to pay off their dets came up and it is seemed a good idea they left me with my dad's family when i was the year and a half old that is about as much as i know my parents did not come back after a year they were barely making ends met when i was four years old going to school and aquadore teachers began to comment on how gifted i was my parents knew aquador was not the place for a gifted girl the gender politics were two fucked up and they wanted me to have all the education lopportunities they hadan hak thas' when they brought me to new york i was just shy of five when i stepped off the plain why americans love academically achieving minorities and i learned quickly that the most a luring thing about me was that i was young and brown and a good student the holy trinity i went to a cath elementary school on a scholarship and we lived in queens my mother stayed home and my father drove a cap this was backwhen east new york was still gang country and he had to foold his body an to a little orago me swan and hide under his steering wheeldern cross fires in the middle of the day then came september eleventh two thousand one here is how i remember the day my

the migration lanscape forever ice was the creation of nine eleven paranoya it changed my father too it was hard to see him fall because he was the most powerful person i knew he was a difficult man and i was a difficult child i was polite and craved approval from authority figurs but i was also dark and precocious not precocious in the we live in tribaga and my kit as a born ardist kind of way more my emigrant tirt grater is reading cemming wit but as secrelly drinking lesereen and toothpace until she throws up because she woncs that to kill her kind of way only years later would i realize

began when i was five and lay crayons around the peribeter of my bed i'd know in the morning if i'd been secretly raped at night i'd know because the crayons would be broken my father red parenting books that explained how to rase troubled children but those children were never strata students who were soft spoken and love teachers e confused him and the dicidence made him angry at me he saw me as different fromr other children in a way that troubled him and he fumbled in the dark to help me with what he could not name when i was off from school for any cind of brag my father would plan out my day and half hourincerments scedruling everything from bath time to teety shills to colthering time to math drills to time to play with dolls and even bath an bras he called at my scedual and he hand rod it on grath paper in different colored inks and taped o to my desk when i'd became overwhelmed with panic crying histeric lay he was send me to take a cold shower bere take me out on a jog around the neighborhood he would set aside magazine or news paper articles for me to translate he could not review the fidelity of the translation but he judge my pen menshep i dint know what would have hapen to me if i had nop been kept e way for my own thought for many years my father kept me alive after my father lost his job as a taxy driver he found a job os a delivery man at a restaron down in the financial district in the mornings he would deliver breakfast to offices a rais and bagle with cream cheese and coffee with hazel not creamer arange juce an a banana but ganola bar and chocolate milk there was no delivery minimum my father delivered at all because the deliveries were small sometimes he did not get a tep sometimes he was told to keep the change a cuarter sometimes he was tipped and pennies he had to say thank you sir thank you madam sometimes he was given a twenty dollar tip for a five dollar breakfast he always told us about those teps there were usually from porterican reception as who talked to him and spanish and aske as he photas of may when he came home with one of those teps it was cating my dad bak from the dad he woul dans to no music and he would make jokes and he would come out of his shower loking a teanager my father did not use a bak he made all his deliveries on foed he speed walked will carrying bags of foo to officeas on wall street the plasta candles of the bags would twists and cut into his fingers and he developed large calis as on both his hands his polliaster pans trupd up agans as cats much that he lost all the hair on his lags he went through many pairs of inexpence of black rubber shoes my mother missache 's feet at night my dads feeter small and fat mine you cannot tell when their swollen iafter a few years ma dats fee were hurt much that he walkd he was on hot coals sometimes leaning on me to move from the cach to the bad a a a he would say as he lemped a mariache when i was fiftee an the owner of the restaurant where my father work tired and ye manager to oversee the deliverymen who were all immigrants the gi was poteregan an american citizen and became immediately abusiv thriting to call i son them yelling

father was furious when i told him what i did but not for a minute in the fifteen years sense have i felt that what i did was una thigal nor have i felt guilty for having a man fire i' do it again but my accent would be better i went to a small public high school in time square where round eighty per sent of thstuden botdy was atter below the poverty line we were mostly all blacker latin ax i was a hiachiver i wanted to go to the university of chicago because i found the unofficial motto where fun gois to die appealing but there is no beeting harvard that name i needed the name to keep my parent safe harvard at the kime did not know how to deal with a documented students when i was there a very successful wall street man who knew me from an educational an geo we both belonged to he is a supporter me is a supportead learned i was un documented and could not legally hold a work study job iveraysa mester he wrote me a modest check in the note section he cheekily wrot beer money i wrote him regular emales about my life at harvard and my butting success as a published writer he was always appropriate and boundary i had wrote obsessively about artist since i was a kid and considered myself an artist since i was a kid i did not feel weird about older wealthy white people giving me money in exchange for grades ar writing it was patronage they were gertrudes tine and i was a young hemming wiy i was vango crazy and broken i truly did not have any racial anxieties about this thank god that kind of think could really fuk a kit up gifferent that oir best throughout the years have tried to get me to confess to cultural shock about arriving to harvard as a poor un bocky man at freshmen but the truth is there was non i ave always had a really wonderful sense of self esteem thanks to my mother who was a tiny bit of a narcisist and has delusions of royalty and because of my mental illness which comes with delusions of grander of its own i kind o fell it was my birthright tha palli makes a lot of people therymad as i began to receive my diagnoses an mis diagnoses throughout my twenties the pession anxiety o c d bi pollar disorder borderline personality dis order complexstrama i did not feel anything other than affinity with riters i love people emily diginson sylvia plath an saxton and robert lull it made sense to me that i had my own demons of course i did i've always been super casual when people ask me about my parents having left me in equadore tat sta bravado i'd liked to keep on the official recker but sometimes i think about it i havn talked with my parents about their having left me in ewhet ar when i was a year and a half old sometimes i' do adorable things take pictures of myself chocking boca bottles or pretending to down the contents of a pill bottle and send them to my mother with a caption because you abandoned me when i am away from my partner and dog for a few days for work and it is hard i wonder how my parents were able to do it for three years i do not blame either of them for it i never have whut i'm describing to you is dird exturacted from a very tight pore i do not feel anything about being left on the day to day but i am told by mental health experts that it has affected me and i fought that conclusion i denied it i wanted to be a genius i wanted my mental illness is to be purely bi a logical i wnted to have been born wild and crazy and weird and brilliant writing mathequagions and chalk on a window instead thearbest after tharabest told me i had attachment issues and that my mental illnessas were related to my childhood i left those tarapists ghost od them but it is not just those early years without my parents that branded me it is the life i've letted america as a migran asn't andocumented person i

beginning stories where new details arrive that imbigan the picture and thank you the simpsins by the way for that word and change everything we have arrived at at two of our show at to popular vote there are times when you discover an information gap in your own past something you thought you knew everything about after al hat happened to you and then somebody comes along and says no it did not happen that at all what do you do with that new information john col has a stoy that it begins more than a decatago at a high school here shohn the school was gronadi hills charter high school g h c h s s in the suburbs of alet huge more than forty five hundred kids in rolldright now s the largest charter school in the country and in the spring of two thousand seven it engaed in one of the most hallowed of american high school traditions senior superlatives you might have had these at your school kids vote each other most likely to succeed best smile cutist couple mark sneticer was one of those kids i 've been embarrassed by mysepoatives for a ten years havi d i mean i wone most school spirit nobody wats to win most school spiritet i put all of my closeted gay energy into school spirit i do not a man ilike i did the morning announcements i with ustin council i did theater i it i loved high school he also one in a category called all around senior you were allowed to compete in two categories but no more than that and g e c hs really put a lot into these suprlatives there was an election usual with paper ballats but instead of announcing the winners over the intercom when posting them on a halway bullet on board there was this event run by the senior leadership council which mark was on a big ceremony and trophies all of the winners received a little replica of the oscar statuet it was not unlike rost all the seniors were in our auditoriam and i think i actually now thi realizer i think i a help give them out i but i do remember reading names of some of my friends and cheering them on and all of my best friends all one things which make sense mark was popular his friends were popular but that was thirteen years ago and he had not been thinking too much about the suprlatives until recently i was at home cooking dinner and i got a text for my friend a friend from high school and all i said was please thoughpt wer to doing and read this it was a facebook post posted to a private face book group fror marks high school class the class of two thousand seven marked ot onface book was the first he was seeing it and the text was not just a mark four other bodies from high school were on at his well we all read it and immediately we were all freaking out am i cannot believe this on i got to smick much sense am i wonder if you could just read that host do you have it there tutly am a he said heggas one more thing before i forget an the spirit of the new year i to take this opportunity to confess to all of you that i and one or two other members of senior leadership council of seven who will remain unnamed interfered with the class of two thousand seven senor suppolives this is not a jok we went to great lands to forge no less than thirty fill about ballats with all of our friends and acquaintances winning their respective categores we attempted to rig literally every category classic ballad stuffing with thirty forged ballats at least the perpetrator goes on to say that not every one he tried to fix the election for actually wine and the nomines for each category the choices on the ballat those were allajet it is just the outcome that was now in question category again was confession was coming thirteen years after the fact wow i feel ich a way lifted off my shoulters having finally confess this thank you for reading oh my god were now it is not mark has been sitting around for the last thirteen years clinging to his many oscar trophe the finding himself by his superlatives since high school he is port his no longer closeted energy into enter tainment worked for entertainment weekly for a long time just moved over to nethlics but it is not he thinks he did not deserve his awards whetherr not he rigged it is interesting to think about who really was rig because me i really objectively was very school spirited and very all around seniory and a couple of friends on the text thread felt the same way one of them said do you think people do not believe i had best eyes we particularly were interested because the five of us all on we all wont some different supprilatives and we all thought thi was pretty chool because i think ultimately high school senior supprilatives are am man it is complicated right they are absoly meaningless and yet at the time they are such a huge deal because they are pure voted and nobody wants their memories kind of tampered with or invalidated right subconsciously we are all thinking to ourselves oh my go what would eighteen yold me have thought about meow that really at the core of all this we are all having imaginary conversations with our eighteen year old selves thinking oh my god he can never now i this will this will uproud him this wll unravel him to find out which probably explains what happened next in short mar posted is gren shot of the confession to twitter on thinking much about it went off to the gim and when he came back it had explot more than a hundred fifty thousand likes and rereets in comments at this point most of them not gagsea jesalums werdly a lot of people wrote that the same thing had happened at their high school or that they themselves had rage to supprov election were it always suspected superelatives were raged and now here was proof at couple people pointed out something that i notice too that the perpetrator never actually apologizes in his message i did not know this was going to go viral i though this was going to be shared with four hundred people ind mi high school senior class face but page and that was it this is michael barlivav rigger of high schol elections confessor of high school transgressions thirty years old now still living in alley and i had about a hundred questions for him chief among them why it took him long to come clean and what it had been sitting with the weight of that guilt for many years you say at the end of the confession em i on ah i feel such a weight lifted off my shoulder aliff o mishllas yet what wic is that is that did you no that was just me bing a that was just me bing synical in truth there was no wait no gilt in fact michael had wanted to come clean right away but a bunch of more pressing things took his attention he was dignozed with cancer actually went through treatmen got better moved on it was only when he saw his former classmates talking about a potential reunion on the fase book page that he thought of all this again and the thing you need to know about michael unlike mark he was a slacker senior year checked out only interested in his words smoking weet and getting lay and then he found out there is a superlative for that bigest case of seniorrit us and i remember begging everybody in my homeroom to nominate me and i asked all my friends i really want to get senior itus i want this because he was competitive about being a slacker and organized about it he only picked four supereasy classes senior year including he says senior leadership council which ran the election he knew that no one would notice if during class he and an a complice hung out for a while near the ballad box where there also happened to be a stack of blank ballat's handy and one thing michael learned right away rigging an election can be complicated there was actually one category i remember where two girls were we are both nominated nominated for the same category and we were friends with both of them and o we just filled out an equal number of ballads for each of thet because it did not want o favor i did not want a favor either one cause i them both was it a kind of thing were other people really wanted as certain superlative or ere i mean you really wanted biggest case of senioritus en you were begging people in your home room to nominate you well es let was nt let us not let us let us not o crazy i was not begging anybody okay msorryfolks im just pausing here can we go back to that tape we played sixty seconds ago and i remember begging everybody in my homeroom to nominate me thank you anyway votes were in balabox was stuff and it came time for that big event where they announced all the winners the whole time i was supernervous every time a new category was being announced the winners were being announced i was all man is it i'r beging to win this one ire begin to whin this one ire begin to win this one and every time somebody was announced as the winner i was who i athak i wone because of me or was aution the got the girl that i wanted to win did not win or i said not everybody that we tried to u to fix it for one a and then when my friend who held me rigget one his category and tat when i when my category was just it was just sweet i'll never forget it they announced the winners and the winners would go up on stage we got our trophies and then he went back stage for a picture that would go into the your book which was important to him proof of his victory it was the alic a something that i would never forget there would be a page in the year book reminding me and my friend that we interfered with this shit and that all of our friends or most of our friends on their category a wether or not they would have otherwise i kind of wanted to ah make it absurd ridiculous preposterous some of the people who won their categoryes absolutely should not have won their categories and that delighted him in a diabolical way it did then in it does now the lack of apology and his confession was not just an oversight what is there to apologize for what is there to apologize for honestly yai was an ascel ya what i did was dishonest yat was shady yai was insensitive but i would definitely do it again the exact same way really if i had absolutely i would not do anything differently i think it is going to be a net positive impact at least i hope man i hope that what people take away from this is that you should not put value into things that are arbitrary and silly popularity and who has the best hair or the best smile or who is the biggest flirt or who ise most likely to become president or who is most likely to whatever it is it is just a pinion man it is completely subjective there is no meaning behind it then michael's hearts in the right place but as far as i can tell the person from michael's high school class who is most concerned about these senior supulatives h's michael if you squint et it for a second he cared much about getting in a ward for carrying the least the senior ritus aword that he went to quote great lengths to commit electoral fraud also in the comments below his face book confession and my conversations with some of his classmates no one else seems at all invested at this point and ho one are lost we all you gy lagher he loose shirasport was a warded class clown in two fousin seven says he and his friends were not the least upset reading michael's face book post we kind of laughed and yok about ther at mi cofrend that la we bu ol you lik you you ge you you were the one you should have got in it yi giwat apparently the ee a e your cuativ wo count o cat yo did it make you question whether or not you were actually the class clown i cure i one a faran square i tink yo i ul tink i wul funny i can i ok i you very cured in mike o very young for my a e al i had we per canowity e uld do pretty much everyone i talked ho felt this way since there is no way of really knowing there were sure may be somebody else got a supurlative they should not have gotten but mine was totally deserved michael fon even i one get couple this is david vagodnear he is a nursing student in colorado now and tat cer waan ri aa because you are the cutest couple ner cill be getrin yor he was at home studying when i called him eve his gol frend eva was there too she is pursuing a doctor in in psychology did the other couples that were up for cutest couple ihad be o rema man en yo abau u remar a we wark in aro aa a a a i i ah i ot if i only knew which names michael shecked off on this fatebilets i could ask those people what they thought now if all of this changed anythi for them but michael refused to give me those names hit was one thing confessing to what he did in a general way but pointing to individual people and saying they would not have one if not for me that just seem mean and unnecessary did end of asking him about one person in particular mark sneticer who posted michael's confession on twitter they were in senior leadership councel together ye i knew mark very well he was really popular ye at this point michael took a peak in the old year book he would brought along with him for the interview ye he on most schoolspirited and he wont all around he did he win those fair and square or did he win those because you stuffed the balabog you cannot how the fuck a misemoston willat's a pointments you vo no way to know did you vote for him on those ballets that you stuffed before i answer that let us let us acknowledge that it does not matter i o we will acknowledge that it does not matter o c we sol you acknowledge that this answer i'm about to give you his arbitrary but i'm in to give it to you any o ca good yet ya i voted for i wanted him to wint cause he was a good he was a good guy yes i he was defi nly one of the guys i fixed it for for shire i told mark what michael said o my guide but that the same time girl who 's to say that everbody else did not think os the gi guides i comeon i relik if if he deemed us good friends enough to have rigged it for me cool tekslote lash you hav label me as muscel spirited for ten years and i would hapily diesn't help myself of that yea you i i the fexesry smil as at michael as michael's find we had a good time and has go together soi i it is it is nices to hear that she a believed in me enough to reate fods in my ship in other words while michael worried that learning the news might make mark feel bed it did not come close in fact the opposite but here is the real effect that michael's rigging the election had in the way that he did it because it was just thirty fahe nowlance in effect what he is done is create a superlative sized black hole of information for everyone involved he says a lot of the winters might have wone anyway but they might not have lot of the losers might have lost anyway but maybe they would have won what we are left with is an extremely rare o currents i cannot think of another one in which a bran new piece of definitive clear information that the election was ray actually makes it that everyone knows less than they did before cacon co is one of the producers of our programme sattory tunnel vision this lastery was first en ou show back in twenty fifteen that was the of canada hosted the panamerican games but a few months before the games began somebody made a mysterious discovery close to the toranto venue for the games it was a secret tunnel and was hen just some shabby half bake construction it as tall enough to stand in thirty three feet long wi support beams a pie would sealing walls it had water resistant lighting a generator a sume pump to pump out ground water and at the end of the tunnel two little rooms were still under construction even more intriguing the da cor a rosary and a pastic red poppy nail to the wall canadians use ta poppy to commemorate fallen soldiers fom remember instad in tean in sates all this got a little bit of coverage but in canada twenty fifteen it was big news no one knows who dog the thirty footlong tunnel neathe soth of tisuse pan american games in toronta and is mor tunnel ton o round the tanans for the com panam games as park fiers and an anans territack rarely has a dir tunnel received much attention no one knows wi was created some one told ther ced gitechiand et actfully dry but it is not justistifistication the police says troubling with a lack of suspects or a motive but some thing unexplaind this hapments of course people of nuts anspec ulating about what it could be in this case the media ponder whether the tunnel would be used to pint a bam at the upcoming panan games near by that panagims ar an oembics for north and south and central america may be some body was can to build a mecklab in the tunnel oran operation gramarawana they wuld use the tunnel to hide for an athletes from the panam games whe my one a stay in canada illegally on twitter it was hash tag terror tunnel but the truth of what was going ne in that tunnel and whis purpose was was nothing any of that and the way the canadian pways figured it out i ga firs ot can i say sometimes one is reminded of what a very different country canadas from the united states is part of the man hunt for whoever built the tunnel a policeman twe did if he built a tunnel knear the reckal senter in teranto give us a call keh the tranter police pointed out that it is not a legal to diggaholl apparently kno aw was broken from the start they said they saw no evidence of terrorism and they did not wanted jemp to conclusions frinceensersa exchange between then toranto deputy chief marksanders and reporters after he showedhim a photo of that rosary and plastic popy this was found inside the atual tunno itself and it was lal on the oewall is that that sells wet this was te inside the tuntl onewal the police pacicle went on to v and showd pictures of the stuff that they found in the tunnel a ladder and the generator in the sumpam and they asked public this togg anybody's memory an't maint kno anythng about the stuff and that turned out to be exactly the right move cause watching that coverage was a guyd named boco merrick he sees that ladder and i said to myself they look exactly my ta platand i be tratin many thisis my i bet you any money this is mine and then sthin i sa sampan i say theho i stet plat himsampan but i could not believe i could not believe i could not believe myself i could not sleep i was thinking about tha he could not sleep cause he knew who he given the stuff to bab's contractor and he went that stuff to one of his favorite in poes his younga is twenty two elon what was outn doin come to think that alton had been asking to borrow a lot of tol slately he ha aki me or sha for pi fornot the shal not thera to many tools si i just would say ocase you neen think boco lav out he gos it outin' th great worker hit loves that and other young people bobsork it than passed apparently olton always wants to learn aslots of questions wat do you do van you do de how you coneg thes how you pu je sin ges vatis the sans between that can i do des instead of that these thisgunel cae di suport unbelievably youknow and i jowith everybody filved about aske me who is that guy this is my atat tat san a helto allways i use to sell this s ni tha san o ke i would te lent hi many tools he vent sel morning after he sees the police pointing to a photo of his ladder and sompampotelovision he goes to pick abolton to pring him to work always outon gets in the trak he bratuca is for me in he i said elton tell me anti a that sam pan i did not even ask fool cuestion he said boco yes i de o i god boco went to the authorities an made sure that outn would not get a rested or get a prison for this and then he turned a man the police talk to alton satisfied themselves that out and was not a terrora story and evil criminal master mind but just some guy and the let him go and t even give him a fine though they did suggest that he not dig mor tonnels ganda tsup who is elton why do you do it why go to the trouble well olton has not given many interviews there we did alo one reporter named nic coer spend a coupleo days with him in his familly to write this long story about them in ma clain's magazine and nich was able to tell us a lot about elton elton turned oun our request for an interview alton las may be two minutes from the ravine ind woods were the tnnel was found in a kind of rough neighborhood in public housing nicxsas both of his parents from jamaica he lives with chusi ters an older sister in a younger sister and they all lived with her their mother outins quiec in the family nex says everybody else's big talker and i think in particular his older sister o nora she she has a lot of a ideas about am how elton ishould be a living his life and she is not shy about conshering that with him i she is a big fan of self help books and sho i think elton his often in the position of of listening to an life talks as they they put it advice advice and elton found refuge ever since she was a kid in the ravine in the ravine there were no life talks from the time he was a little elton was this introspective kid who loved to build to take machines apart put the back together he fixed upbot von mowers cub housees and that he said in a shored interview tha nick recorded for a vidio that acclain's magazine made he would go to the ravine what i soon evin what els a kitis run aron play having go see would play apar we go fishing but im i tiin my first tonnound probably when else in om te menthy school it is going to creek walk around and this is something on my mind i want ta bod a cubhouse ad five or six ascents and i think the six oncs the he something the ont i've heard him call it the short of the future of cub house a gain hereh's neck the the tree house of the future that it is underground because one of the fundamental things she wanted from this was that it be it be secret it was his secret place that he could go and just relaks and and be alone an not always alon a frand helped elton dig the tonnel and build it excabating he thinks to dumtrucks of dirt by hand i wonce it was done the would go there together watch movis was in ta music barbicu ca did this because somethin ils one be din by ig ol i should have going out of it and thi knew thatk if i buin tunnel it came from childhood reasons but at a same time if i buidy who knows li coul fobly hang oul there turn that chutle jumentlike a man cave a bunker when f we cone to te place cool hang o and if thereis something to happen a that is disaster if some would happen i could go there as a black hold im to non a deder charge of my fown even make a smon nel down ta to something back of to my house back whenel would go to the townel it sisters did not know insidy what he was doing but they knew something was ab from mance i was dinging the thing he would come home jus covered and dirt tracking dirt everywhere onora thought he was building some kind of unde ground house and bil him about it bet he would not say is other sistertracian found the rosary i shaly sitting it a bustab he gave it out to pro tect him since since lexsence sheav it to me ti our lad else ready down there i kno to thup every day after that everyday where go there on some tome make a prayer it everydy sondys o forget was sometimes o wheember to have a litl prayer to some safe and sta pece of mind her the reality afbout his tonel it was different from what people thought it was when it was first discovered by police i think what that is about is i think when we encounter something hat's in ex plicable or mysterious our imaginations we are such hhacks we go t the most standard stock seeing at in a hundred teevy shows version of what something proably is all its terri tac oh its trug deaers when the reality of what this townel was it was this dreamy ga i which is one of the place to get away from his sisters be alone for a goototle while u much small one but muh lass predictable we more interst

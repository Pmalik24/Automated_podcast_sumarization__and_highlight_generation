she was pregnant they were all prgnant they all did not want to be pregnant but they ald in states that had just band abortio talory georgia i was very naive about it because i had totally forgot oa thing rovy way was maybe a mad is gun the sprancort overturned a rovy way the roing that made abortion he constitutional right that hppened the week before talor got pregnant yes it was new but ou also was it something that was important to me on the regular it dated a i got on the phone and i called and they were superrude to me a plamparnit i was wo do not even think i'm six weeks in i really was not understanding what she was saying because she was saying it does not really matter wit wor is not going to be able to do it n thast when i was oll a totally forgot then this is lke this new thing or i cannot go and get it done i have to go somewhere else can ohi was also looking for a connen she started calling immediately they did not have anything or i think it was a month or two and yit was backed up and it was that pretty much everywhere i had checked it was either a few weeks to a couple months hat have to wait en nine months since the pram corte returned rovy way and to mark that fact on to day we coudno look af what these last ninht months hade been to peopl discovered they were pregnant right when the laws changed in ther states in came up against a wall trying to find an abortion these o people who nine months ago found themselves waiting for an appointment waiting to get together money to travel to make a plan just to get somebody on the phone then that waiting i was time for other things to happen forincence cay an ohio n taloin georgia were both waiting for an appointment and one day cana boay frond walke to deiry quen it was not until the walk back that we surch a to talk about it and we were both kind o joking about the fact that you do not all i wonder what our baby woutd look and we were discussing o what colour eyes do you think they would have color hair we got to talking about wat we were as kids and the we were yo that could be i guess fune to have our own i was watching us talk about how we wer er and oas ik ge that would be also tolike hows o a baby with this person talking ther ias mike osh a mi changing my mind i in mit get to keep it talister wondering the same thing she been certain she waited first tor the ultra sound appointment and then for the abortion is weeks and weeks i just spant a lot of time thinking what i want i i felt do a on have a kator d i i think it was the first time for some one mins very sure of themselves that the firs som ous ever ston cantal had been pregnant weeks earlier they both would have gotten abortions it nearby clinnex but now this new reality set them both on very different paths as they try to find their way to an abortin dby bsy chicago it is this american life a mor glass stays sho nine months after the end of rovy wayed to days o episode as inspired by the excellent reporting of caroline kitchener who cover's abortion wir the washing impose if you have ever seein her story is carolines retorting just gets inside people's lives in this way that feels very unusual intimate and very real and you see how not black and white people's feelings and situations can be she'l be with us for the hous stay with us an afirst trymuster we ser to to show in those first few months read after the court's decision and how this played out for can tailor whoe both has found out they were pregnent and both wone an abortions fourteen states the band most abortion since roe was overturned i for someby but that is it they will not get abortions but others of course a can' tallor thes stol going to try to get one i for them the state bands are a hertle the things down as he try to figure out how the anty abortion movement is a wer that ther's this new window of time we are maybe they could reach these people wand persuade them to change her minds since th fall of road has been a big pushed to do just that to increase state funding for crisis pregnancy centers we trie to get millions of dollars from taxpapers these are cgointics whose whole mission is to convince people did not get abortions meanwhile long line any abortion folks are trying to connect with people who 're looking for in formation about abortions an any abortion actofis reached both ka and tailor toring the first try mesters n nintresponded very differently caroline kitchener watch us unfold for each of them in two separate states week by week ut just a quick note that we changed some names intodaysio for people who requested that for privacy though cannot tellor are their romames iit here is caroline cat was in ohio tailor was in jortio boll states had just spanned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy that leaves ha super short window to get an abortion from the beginning kate tried to approach her pregnance the way she approaches other things in her life she is methodical organized kat is twenty five years old white on't turn pat setting business she kept track of her periods on a nap and when she messd one she took a pregnancy tast it ws positent she' started calling clenec to try to get an appointment for an abortion kate was not completely sure she wanted one ever since that walk with her woy friends to the deairy queen she is started going back an for u wondering if maybe she should keep the pregnancy after all she made ap pro conless she realy was not shor her boy friend kept telling her that he would support her in onouter one that was not iexactly helpful she pross tim trying to figure out what he actually thought is that was l o ka i makking up my mind a and i have an abortion how do you feel about that that is fine o ka will i change my ind to know the y bo keeping how do you feel that that is fine and i was do what the he co lin give you something more it was just gat a oni almost somebody to tell me what to do because i felt out of control of the situation u that i just needed somebody almost help me make the decision finally kay found a woman senter on line that offered free ulter sounds and abortion consultations they hadnant appointment right away i remember my first thought was wol this is super purple as furple a pretty much every the walls the decor i just remember it was very commin in quiet i remember them offering me gingeral it avisis a gal take tingerailun superdaushes the women senter was actually a crisis pragnancy center those are placeis were staff or specially train to talk people out of having abortions but kay did not know any of that she was there to get an answer to a question cout she get an abortion an ohio at all whut she still under six weeks the crisis pregnancy senter gave her an ulter sent i was o cable how far along am i and they were too early to even tell it is too early to say anything a trained ulter sound tac should have been able to give her some sene of how far along she was starting around five weeks whut jus right where cat thought she was obviously i'm not a doctor i'm not good argue argue with somebody but i was sen looking at im theirs nothing you can tell me absolutely nothing and i was just is there anything any type of estimate and she was i cannot say it will just half to reschatul another ultre sound about a week from now the only thing that kept going through my head was i'm going to be past six weeks hur is something i've heard from abortion providers crisis pregnancy senthers will sometimes to lay telling people how far long they are or though misinformed people about how far long they are un til abortion as no longer an option the doctors telemeng they have heard this from patients who com in to see then after going to a pregnancy center kay had wanted some one to help her to side what to do with this pregnancy an she walked into a place that was pacifically set up to do just that meanwhile tailor could not get an abortion in georgia because she was too far long she had to fly to florida for her appointment but the soon as one she could get was weeks away tailor as twenty seven years old lack she studied film in college ended up working an office job at a financial servace's company she just got in her first apartment also she is o a but nurty the grat it use her when she hear something that teaks her interest her first move is usually to scout around for the relevant supper tha weeksi when she larned that her abortion procedure would use a suction tool tailor wanted to no mor threean i shall went home an lik it u cause i think a lot of times the only images we have or of people worpra lie whon show you pieces of goody fesis a i do not look up anything that but i was able to see an animy daversion of woud it looks when the when the actual surgical tool is in the body iny pools the feet is out a toube would be inserted inside her uteress a pump and then the suction it made me wonder if the kad was alive or not anythi i's going to hurt him if they use it to i just thought that ther would be a more advance way ut to do it that would not be thag grusone it made me wonder if is to barbaric or to arcaic or to violent taylor had pretty uncomplicated feelings about abortion up until now to the excent sien of her thought about it she was figured that if she did get pregnent unexpectedly she would go to the plan parent had clinect down the road from her apartment and that would be that but now she was not sure what to do she called her aunt she said i do not know f from comfortable doing this she was just listening you cannot affor a ki thas she saing of the day it is not matter if you think the precedures barbary they do it every day they do this is a very common proceduis is not anything you need be alarmed about you'ld be just fine her aunt reminded her that she did not have a lot of savings her new job was not a don deal she still had to pass a big xam to keep it and she did not know how to drave taylor says it was kind of insumeting she called her boy frend they were long distance he had just moved to florida and the colinect she would pecked for the abortion was near where he leve now on the phone she told him she was having doubts he assured her that was totally normal and he had his own theory to explain her feelings would he was saying was that he felt because he was far away maybe the baby was away from me to feel more connected to him then i was just what the i just immediately was you are not that impfortant to me i thing i'm pretty sure 'm stellin control of her i feel if i was having second thoughts it would wol hund yo prer cent be because of me an no on ow a baby is not something that she used to feel closer to aknow the person i go just such a weard thing to even suggest me wanting to emotionally connect with him through the baby the nest when i went out for other people's opinions talor found herself in the exact same spot as ka an ohio asking other people what she should do kay taylor would soon find herself face to face wit the anti abortion movement people who were ready and eager to influence her decission when ka lepet her appointment at the pregnancy sent er in ohio she still did not know it wasn'n a regular abortion frendly medical clenec the stoff handed her a gift bag an haw to nal file manny many pamphlets spearment gome to help with nasa and prenatal vitements wut she did think was a little bit weard she told them that she was planning to get an abortion it was the way that they described them that made me things that they wore completely listening to me because they were all this is for the house of your pregnancy moving forward and well the pregnancy is not looking forward ih having somebody give me these options and almost push the option i wanted to the side it was not even really a choice t that really just ir to me and i was ful this is what i want in you are not even listening to me lake i would expect this from aa man or something butto have other women just regard what i was saying was one of the most irritating things to me crises pregnancy sent hershef carefully thought through all these moves to push people away from abortion but for a it actually seem it was back firing it was making her more sore that she wanted an abortion when she left she looked up abortion pills on line and found eight access an organization based in europt that se ns pills to all fifty states teven states where abortionis man they operad in this kind of legal gray area that made pa nervous but she put in the order anyway she still wanted to know how far along she was she went back for another scan of the price's pregnency center people who wrk at prise's pregnancy senters the see their work is saving lies that is what theyre there for i talkd to several stappers at senters who told me they find immense fulfillment in convincing even just one person to keep their pregnancy a part of that is making the best case they can for not having an abortion kay got on the ulters on table for a second time ti asked if she wanted pictures no thank you she said they pleayed her something they called a hearbeat kacnically doctor say this is not a heartbeat kay did not want a hear it i havn't changed my mind hearing that was just another sound for me and the ulture son tack who knew that i did not want to keep this pregnancy asked me if i want to take pictures ah home with me and i immediately was just now i do not want that and she was just what are you sure s yet pretty sure i was already angry in having her e question me i was just you guys really just art getting this again are you sure you do not want pictures and was i guess i'm very sure i i and on ingd in abortion still i got i pills from eight access ah i bought those i'm just waiting for those to get to my house she immediately just kind of had this change of demeanor to being completely defencise and not in what way when you say tefensive her first thing was oh you should be careful because you knever know what kind of great pilliur cn to get to be clear there is no such thing as different grat abortion pills and eight access has been around for years and as a widely trusted source but cris is pregnacy senter told kay how far along she was six weeks and three days that ment a couple of thanks first kay could have tried to get an abortion an a clinic an ohio right after her last appointment had she known it also meant that the week before a train stenographer should have been able to give her some sense of how far along she was wit kases permission i reached out to the women's senter it is called bello women's senter they would not give me an interview but they said in a statement that they do not talk about individual patients because of confident sioalityy they did say they are aware of the time line pressure that comes with a six week abortion man and they added that they are committed to quote full disclosure of the patient's options but as far as kay was concerned her options were dwindoline kay wanted to take the abortion pills by the time she was ten week's pregnent thecause that is what the afty a advises she was probably right around six weeks and the pills could take up to a month to be delivered she was runting out of time hmeanwhile and georgia what tailor weated she fixated on one particular question she could not find a satisfying answer no matter how many people she talked to or how much receart she did on line would be abortion hert the baby an the only people wil ever say abortion actually physically her babies are people will prolite she found an antie abortion for a on line and wrote a public message o ka hi o can i am procha werly having saken thoughts about my appointment next week advice question or question work she writes that she is now eleven weeks pregment i've just gotin used to being pregna and have the fly to another state to give in abortion that would happened a lot of people comments in on that post i mean just flloodin a lot of them were telling me i could give my baby way for adoption any option is better to them than to murder qold uncle your baby aun't i abortion obvecates on line use all sorts of different strategies to sway people away from abortion to do everything they can two and share that pregmancies are carried to term i shat is lady axs me if i would do an open adoption oh o to give it to her right ire's no way i would doit probably a little over two hundred commens people offerin me money people would just super involved in making sure i did not go to my appointment how did it feel to read those things there is always a tome o coertion in my opinion but it was nice to read them because you just want here of ther people's opinions u just hearing that it was nice to here the other side of iverse jus just the answers the abortion but i had no one else that was i shally excited for me because i will say that in a moment i really needit somebody to can neck with me about how is feeling them whan i first started talking to cay and tailor it looked to me they could be swayd by people who dosperately wanted to sway them carry was trying out different decisions odiioning them for her wiferan and tailor was seeking out guidends from people she that ne them now but thot i started thinking they actually were actably desiding what boices they wanted to let in who exactly they wanted to be influenced by in the meddle of one of the most polorized debates in america can tailor were trying to suss out what was riht for them i woull read those comments all day i woud read those comments at night i would read them at work i would read them when i left work in some of them did not mean anything but most of em actually mean a lot to me a but just being able to speak to some one freely and not feel theyr pushing you to a certain place i mean they were pushing me but they were also give me what i axfor which is a valley reason to not have an abortin ultimately tailor did go to florda she got on a plain to another state for an abortion her boy friend picked her up from the air port of eleven p m in the next morning it was proba six am but my appointent was at eight and he was just leeving away no problem no whatever but i was up i kind of welcome up i will be we talk and they kept talking about their parents how they were raise what they would want to do the same if they became parents a what they would want to do different ly her boy friends said he worried his kid would struggle in school the same way he had they wandered how much to tat was janetic the kept talking and talking yei cepe loking at the clog because it is ar iht is six thirty unless we there are clothes one right now ere going to be riht own time or it is seven we it sid get seventin fifteen seven thirty i just cond of worked out in that way were we just blew threugh the time an just ignored it tailor never want to the appointment cays pells arrived when she was eight weeks along when kat took them she was in pain more than she been expecting which was carry because with all the new laws kaydid not feel safe calling a doctor she din't want to get in trouble i was in a lot of ain i was cramping i was bleeding i went into this little bath room and and i remember being hot because i had the light on the bout the oom the door was closes this heat was just building up from the light and the only thing i could think of to help the pain was a warm shower even though i was hot and i turne the shower on and i kind of contemplate getting in for a few minutes tats i was all my god what if it does not help and i'm just roasting myself alive and i i't it up just getting in an was immense relief it was done for c but not for tailor carline kitchener as yoe're putting the stre togethe the legal landscape changed a few times in many states including ohio were k lives i was abortion mare was challenged in cord

pregnancy than the ten weeks the f da has proved now to be queer the pils are still safe after ten weeks but ther coun be complications the whole experience can be more intense people call lok tust

and the people we talk to felt very ohon spoke it noaly a dozen people whoe looking for abortions the weeks after ro fell in many of them could not decide whof trust who would asked for help and there is one other thing people talked about when they talked about what they were afraid of i do not know how wu col my log katy had to travel out of state for her abortion the only appointment she could get t was the same wekend as her college or reantation at there is no way regetu yet is i wult kno howtit from my la a why what it aregetulat moms there is no figure we heard about more than mms people did not won i have to talk to their mams about the rebortions it was hard the mom callt le the time it resked how they were but they needed the mom to drive them across state lines briana e sas she heard over twelve hours in the car of it would rat ion't be e e bu your lie to i na yoping i wish i did not have to de ying mo no at all but i needed a ou gar we needed to help hor to we get ashly i o figure at what to say about why she needed to weave town you wide she would exturemely help about we gain a far a bik i think ek agan one day th i hade had to work aturday but i had ta yar l i could not tell i lon thisis jest ago in texas telling her that i was praglens and was not sure if i was going to keep it would hav probably om that i stated her there is one a post row second tri mister pregnancy that especially drew caroline in caroline kitchner the report of the wathionipos that were ding to day show with this pertiguar pregnancy was in okohoma a teenage girl name lily who could not get in abortion without pulling in her parent in this case her dad i gat his carolin i met lily a few days after she got her possit ot pragnency test she was seventeen years old and well into her second trymaster i liked lily right away she was silly and made me feel old but in a superendearing kind of way lily told me shed kown this boy for a while and they had an on again off again thanks and soff more year i not ix whenny he is very funny and he is very he is very sweet and very carring he is little stupid but that is o get and byet we have we hav jast started hang out again i think cause we had been going to lunchan stoff because o my school we had gon fifteen menute lunches than then he was aw would you do it and always o dear cot and then it all cota just re started lily had no idea she was pragnant to the entire first trymaster she had just graduated from high school still riting high off from she was making her own money working at a samdwin shop stang out late with frands somewhere down the line she thought she might go to colonariy school or she had an idea for a business that combined her two favourite thangs tattoos and food she would call it pies and pents lily's the youngest of five the older siblings have all moved out already se is just her an her dad in the house together what you picture when you picture a single divorse tad he does not know how to decorate we a shop nightly for meals he will not go shopig for a a lot of things to keep the fridge of the pantre shot well just go as we need or will go by food i fasteod places or go to restaurants and i just think it tlarious here is how lily found out she was pragnent she was at work and she called her dad with really bad stopit crants they ended up in the y are where they took lily's vidals took some yearin an the doctor came in the room with this weird look on his face he asked lily if she was oquet talking with her dad in the room lily was yet of course talk about what he told her you are pregnant and ay looked at myt ad and i remember him getting all shocked and looking at me it was he just loked he looked he was deafinly pannicing but trying not to show me because he knew i was pannicking cause i was fisiply pannicing how were you wik whald you now i was re crying i was crying medially that that is i literally instantly started just stobbing i turned out she was about nineteen weeks along the doctor handed her the tusts results and told her that she could put them in her baby buck he kept talking but lily was just staring at her dat studying his face i just remember being scared i felt shaky and i just i conno wanted to know if he was mad at me or really just what he was thinking about honestly he said nothing but at one point he did reach out to hold her hand they left the room walked to the car in silence as they were driving home lily said he asked her right off the bat d ye knows it is and i was i yeh and he was well whos isit nd cause i do not't tell him cause he knows the guy and was ger an did you ah yeh that he was o my got i should have your brothers kill him don ide she rolled her eyes and then the conversation was very much over they drove home she went to her bedroom he went to his the next day lily sat in her room while her dad went to work and it really started to hit her she was pregnant and abortion was now a legal in oklahoma there was nod out in lily's mind she wanted in abortion had she found out earlier in her pregnancy before oklehom a band abortion lily could have driven thirty minutes to a clinic to gaton but now she had to find a different way first she tried clincs and cansis but the clinic she called told her that she was too far along for them to see her then she tried new mexico they did not have apointments for three to four weeks i talk to lily a whole bunch right around this time she was terrified one clinic told her she was far along they would have to induce labor to end the pregnancy lily told me she could not imagine pushing a baby out of her ninety five pound body do you think you sounded scared on those calls probably a it was very nervous and i it was not fun to say on thephone repeatedly she kept calling and calling eventually she found one clinic in new mexico were thin a point at the following week she knew she would not be able to get there on her own she knew she was gone an eat or dad lilys dad his former air force now he works in ig tee he lods music lily likes to describe as dad rock asy dysee bout jovy he was five kids three boys in two girls he grew up in a conservative famly beleving it was wrong to have in abortion lily did not know what he would think about her wanting in abortion i was just nervous to tell him honestly i was nervous to see his reaction hat were you weried about i just didnit want him to be disappointed i guess a few days later her dad finally asked her whady you din i do she told him i'm not con i have a kid he said how hard thot's goin to beain out right lily knew then her dad walked out he said he needed a little time to prossass that information lily decided in her head that what her dad was not saying was that he wanted her to keep the baby dit was it was it was cund of hard cause i can handle my o being out of me him being dispointing me as a whole different story was he actually disappointed did he actually not want her to get the abortion what was he thinking when the doctor told them she was pregnant when the drove home that night wily had not asked him i did the the first thing was who is this kid right because ther's there is a butt kickin come you mean who it on person who impregnated her yes yes and when she is told me it cont of infuriated me a litl more why well because the guy had already he was ot he already got another you fifteen sixt year old girl pregnent and ha a baby with her ies yes then the next thing in my mind is im i'm calling thes three brothers and this is getting handled that that was the immediate you have ruined your lice your seventeen years old you can have a baby now a how how you going to take care of this babyou do not even have a jot no i think she was workin it at that point you work ing a jersey mikes making in on wage i have just gotten out of finally paying off her medical bills for your broken leg which was aur also the result of a horrible decision on your part what were you thinkin when lily told her dad justin that she wanted an abortion she imagined he was angry her aps that but he told me he wasn'm he was really just surprised i did not think knowing grace that it was going to be an oction for her grace is his nickname for lily he is always called her that i do not know why just that was my first instinct was she is gn have his baby i doft know why i tought ti caus she i mean when she talks about it it is there was no room for that it is interesting that knowing her as well as you do that is that is conta were your mind wen this dismay sound terrible but it probably was a result of how nurturing she is she does not to step on spiders he wont of saying i just never thought ti that that would be an oction for her but juston quickly moved pass shock and insaction mut he assumed that this was something that he needed to make hoppen for his daughter the day lily told him she wanted an abortion joston went to work and research he looked up clenix he had no idea that lily baby now h's anxious and somewhat irresponsible tea natur she was wat out of him generally hear from her much that day and i get home fully she is laying on her bed she is got her little note book out she is got some kind of ganks to rap going on on the frick in on the elexa im and she is called forty difplaces she is called the rosy wage fund she is called everything and and she is basely got a planing place and i'm oh whow you thought you were ging to be the wet makin the foncoss i did i absolutely did it amazed me because that is not a a trait she had displayed before and her calmness sturing it that is what really stood out is she she did not she din panic she would all ded a old me she is oket i well gofd called this gaga cosgut what did you want her to do what decision did you want her to make that is a great question i think if you had to say what was your topchoice i would have said yest keep i wt want her to keep the baby why do you think your topchoice was for her to keep it ah that is that is it that is probably a very that probablyis very psychologically deep and it probably has to dus grace getting to the poin where she is get a leaeve u and feeling all my children er out kis he has her own kid michaels after in the world doing his saying cristran brad yr out in the grace's all i h've left right that i know needs me right her daily shuvibal to some degree depends on me and i've gone almost longer in my life with that and without that i i do not know how to be the me before the kid's right i've always had for the last twenty seven years always had somebody that needed me i know if grace has his baby i got another at least eighteen to twenty years of being needed and that may be purely selfish but i hope that my concerne for her i'lt way my selfishness in that situation bjuston was not sure he could trust his own impulses or his own feelings that is why he did not talk to lily to her it seemed disapproval but juston was feally just trying to give her space not chaire too much of his own complicated thoughts he knew lily would have a hard time ignoring anything he said when lily asked him to drive her to new mexico for the abortion juston said yes she got in the funds shed made the appointment she had a plan lily was twenty weeks pragnent when she and her dad loaded up the car to dries

that people have second trime uster abortions at home that some people will panic and not know what to do with the feetal tissue for feel too scared to seek medical attention at some point in the future without fear will not be remarkablone and we will also get used to this notion that for many people if you get pregnant in a state were abortion is band and you do not want a baby you may still wind up with one we are rapidly moving into that future where all this is normal which means right now may be the last time we can truly feel how much has changed for the people who wanted abortions

the media rush to jo bidon's defence as republicans prepare an impeachmen inquiry against him inflation jumps again as the bide administration tras to make bidenomics a thing and mit romny announced the end of his political career i'm benchper of this is the bench parro sho the josponserb express ve pianis time to stand up against big tack protect our data express vepian si com flashed man wost pretty obvious that re publicans launching an impeachment inquiry are going to end this process withan impeachment there is no purpose for an impeachmen inquiry if it does not end in an impeachment that just be a giant pratfall by the re publican party to launch an inquiry that does not actually end with an im peachmen which means we are steadily moving toward that and the question becomes what exactly must be proved in order for an im peachments to be pursued with vigor and alacrity and the answers pretty much whatever democrats did in the last few years of the trumpet ministration apparently that means you on'noveh to lutcher crime it means thet do not actually have to pride evidence that a crime was was full on committed all you have to show is that there was corruption or abusive power enough for your own party that is basically all you need and to this point we have aready shown that when it comes to jo bidon and hunter bidon and the doce all that material is all ready public one the biggest gas lighting apisode afe ever seen this happening right now in real time as the media determine that actually there is no evidence what isever that anything is wrong with jo bidon or hunter bidon that that effectively these people are just as clean as the driven snow for example entire medium on tash last night of the medio claiming thereis no evidence of joe's connection with hunter biden's corruption which is a li it is an absolute avert wy not only do we have two separate business partners of hunter bidons saying that joe is involved in the business that be deven archer and tony bobolinsky we have them both testifing that jo bidn would stop by meetings or call into meetings having to do wit his son's business tif direct tacts from hunter bidon to his own daughter suggesting that he paid daddy's bills we have what is abs from hunter bidon's computer to foreign companies suggesting that if they do not pay up his dadd hy is sitting literally right next to him and will wield his outsized political power in order to punish said companies we ave tens of millions of dollars moving around from foreign forces of sources into a variety of shell companis and then into companies andpeople connected with hunter bidon and we have hunter biden living in jo biden's house whele a lot of the stuff has happening yow i mean ther's old little but of evidence wh i sad little i mean a lot of evidence the only thing that is missing is an actual transaction wire showing money moving directly from hunter biden to chobidon but let me just make something pretty clear when it comes to parents ind kids that sort stoff fugnav to happen nor for the bill to get paid pointing this out it is pretty obvies have you ever gone out to dinner with tyour parents and thn e ick up the tab yute you picked up the tab right well ofm dut does that mean that your parents did not benefit from you picking up the tab or you have to actually trans for the money to your parents a counts and then they pick up the tab in order for to be considered a benefit for your parents idiocy anyway here the media denying to nying to night i gent remember these of the people who for four long years every single day on sean and remember i be at the gim which is the only place th that seanan has ever appeared my life and seanan would unfortunately be on the wall and every single day wulfbletz r be talking about how new bom sholbles emerging in the russia investigations can blow this thing wide open who is ging to destroy the trum precedency for four long years we heard all of that and in never emerge adamshift is still sitting in the house an honored member of the democrati calkass the media went crazy over things the steald oscave for years on in but here there is no evdence none not not not a wit not a sintilla not an ioda of evidence that jobidon is corrupt in anyway just listen to our vaunted media having months and months of a conversation and hearings and a news coveradge of well what exactly did go on with jo biden and huntred bdon's business dealings that a as we have all said no evidence yet has been presented bthat the bidents have made a lot of mynay in at farth again a no evidence that we have sand even som house republicans say ther not convinced evidence exist lu r poblicans insinuated they migt not back the move they might not vote for it given the lack of evidence to support such a drastic actions but how is republicans have far not provided evidence that bidin directly propidaed off his sonbusiness on or made any deficiens as ni presedent cause of thato ge here is the thing the media are relying on a very very broad definition of evidence here in order to escape the reality there santler there is only circumstantial evidence letme first point out that circumstantial evidence includes thing in court for example finger prints on a weapon that a circumstantial the definition of circumstantial evidence is evidence that indirectly points to in outcome but does not directly attesto the outcome direct evidence is i a wittness saw oj simson murder his exal life that would be direct evidence indirect evidence would include things blood all over oj simpson's bronco blood all over the crimesene all of that matching i thout all be indirect evidence that be circumstantial evidence when you hear people si bl there is only circumstantial evidence that joe and hunter were involved together circumstantial evidence jo bidon directly saying that he threatened the upranians the billion dollars and removed with drawn aid if they did not fire the prosecutor overseeing the prosecution of his son's company well yes that is circumstantial also is pretty indicative it is pretty indicative in again if the standard now on impeachment is effectively that if a party does not another member of another party they just get to im peach him then after luge a crime and and unun have to define the crime agus got to tell you if what i have stacked up here is donald trump impeached in twenty nineteen for the great crime of calling up vlodimerselensky and allegedly threatening to with draw military aid if vlodmers lensky did not dig up dirt on the bidons and then on the other hand i have jobidon being impeached for an on going scheme with his son to clear tens of millions of dollars by essentially using his influencs as vice presidents of the united states or by the way even allowing his son to purport to use his influence as whi's president of the united states and clearing actual money that way and shaping you ask policy that way because i mean why else does jobin care about victor shokin why seen charge of you crane policy in the first placewhys you squiring his son around to chinine ar force to whe mean those she those stack up at least ferly evenly at the very least and yet were told there is no evidence whatsoever none no evidence that that is a li there is in fact evidence but the medeare gon to continue along these lines calin collons for example over its yenan directly asked re publican congressmen mike wall to florda have you seen any torect evidence we mean know he dn't actually see bi the heads of breeze my handing jobidoni sack of cash but thek these people do not kow the definition of direct forss in direct evidence we have tons of in direct evidence for you yourself when you are talking oup the evidence that ye sayye seen and for those listening how have you seen anything then directly ties present in bidin and shows that he profited from his sons foreign business deelings we have is son conplaning to his relatives about how many of his fathers bills he is haven to pay with these e licit gans i we have ic ait in t wh avthet i le dide and profet we have it but i mean but te caywin the point of the inquiry is to give us greater standing to get the full evidence if we get full cooperation if they say we have nothing to hide and give it to us and we do not see anything than thats wher the facts lead us they a tha ow e ta i shal i nee tet yet at do not get more evidence we n t we nee at we workg en to follow the facts were ging to do this responsibly ah but agan i'm amazed at the standard i'm amazed at the standard here i mean that tt the standard which is hunter bided says to his own daughter i paid dad's bills and calin collins ik heavy stenin t e evidence that hunder bidn payd das bills whet mean he said he did that' yes some evidence that he paid his dad's bills and the fact that his dad has millions of dollars of unexplained wealts i mean that that iseem pretty suggestive i guess the new standard is that republicans have to show that hunter bid in directly signd a check to jobidon an has to have jofs jobin's name on the back of the track handed to thang in order for any of the to be good i do not think that is not how any of the sginwork an by theway the american people do not believe that either the reality is t impeache or not is almost o rallevent because we know that jobin is not can be removed by the senate of the united states is dominated by democrats whell we do know however is that the american weoplt by an large believe the alligations that jobidon is involved in corruption because he very clearly is will get to jobin's responso this momentarily first a company is looking out for you in the

ragnt now thinking a fantastic deal hand art a purtalk dot tomslash pure save fifty per cent off your first month because again this accompany that actually cares about you o case the jo bidon response to all of this is basically to pretend that is big nothing says that a campaign reception mc lean virginian he reportedly said hunocl wy they jus nearlhy one to a peagh me nnow e best i can tow non a peash me because they wont a shut down the government lok lok oi've got a job to do everybody always asked about im peachmen i got up everyday not a joke not a joke jois is not a joke ans thi do no one thought you were joking i'm confused by yos it i gret avert not a joke not folk is done o peachmen i've got a job to do i got doit the issues that effect the american people every single solidary his theory is thet republicans are pursuing im peachment they can also pursuade government shut down which by the wayt is actaly t e opposite of the truth even if you are cynical about politics what you think isthe mc carthy is pursuing the impeachment inquiry in order to get his own side off his back seen cu to deal with regard to the continuing resolution not the opposite but again ji love one jobidon pretends tht he does not knowhat the hell is going on with regard to his son when he very clearly does that the golpost continue to move the white house is using the same line is the media creenshohm pur says there is no evidence that jo bidont did anything wrong wel she says ot net there is novidence that but mit my favorite is they went from njoe knew nothing about hunter's businessnis to yacke knew something about hnters business is but he was not involved to well yah he was in valv but he nactialy clear the money and now ther moving to wll eurnamean direct evidence that he cleared the money and from there they are going to move to what how could you offect him not to cleare how oul you toock him not to benefit after all this lis not relyf for him it was for hunter he just loves his son too much he just loves his son to much and that is goin to be the final repository of this argument it was trotted out yesterday by the white house is in sams saying that the reason that joe stop by hunter's business meanings was out of love it was just out of love just uno the in the corlly own family members the family would stop by meanings hell by other members the family just out of familial love now i love my family i do i'm also not a public servant i'm not somebody who works for the american taxpar and it turns out that if your love for your family requirers you to engage in corruption at the expense of theamerican tax par that is impeachable and quasa criminal behavior i love this defense he day he just loved hunter to too much he loved him too much a a tragic love story why was the president at those meetings on those ar fofals well again i think this is part of the right wings mis information machine to try to confused people i'm about what the truth is the truth is that the presdent as he is said publicly for years a calls his family every day to check in he calls his son everyday to check in he calls his other family members to check in to see how they are doin he loves them there'is not their tighten at family then there is tightenan who is just checking in his yaunt hy's doing which is why his son would call him inthe middle of business meetings and dad weget ont phony say how is o lern an in in your grin and gev on and there is a wthat is fine dad and click the phone at stand it call it an se ang nammi down on the phone any time i want according to the nur times the strategy here is to battle it out in the court of public opinion says en sams to the near times e what good luck with that because again it is pretty obvious the level of corruption that jobin as been involved in his entire career this is nothing new for jobin this the prentit is totally astonishing i'm not sure how many democratic scandals getignored by the media on the basis that they are utterly unthinkable they totally cannot be true and then it is pretty obvious that they could totally be true i've mentioned before in a completely different contect scandals involving for example alligations about braccobamas drug and sectual behavior in the late nineteen nineties belling that is unthinkable that is totally crazy ha that is terrible now maybe those rumors are untrue mayethey are the meedit in bother to look them up for five seconds why becaus they were unthinkable and then it turns out that brakobama admits in his memoirs that he was doing cokan and he also wrote letters to his gial friend talk about fantasies of having sec with men and the media when those rumrs arrive thon't got that is unthinkable we cannot talk about this an then later they wellt's too late there is nothing realy to talk about your get here is the thing as scirrilos is those rumors maybe what were they hilic the most implausible rumors i mean not the most implausible rumors but put him in that aside yere were not even talk mout rumors herre rear talk abut actual documented relationships bet tween hunter and joe testified too byjoe's business bu by hunters business partners we have documentation from hunters computer backing alls an we have deckades deckades of records ogjobitan engage in corrupt bargains on behalf of his family with a variety of sourceis ranging from m bione in delaware he was known as the senator from m bionet he was known is this because his son hunter right out of lawschool already being a direlect got hired over it mbionet and ambinameas a huge binddowner and meanwhile bide was giving sweetheart legislateiove deals to m biane which was growing by leaps and bounds in the state of delaware an' it that sort of tuff's been going on with the bidnsrt who is cut cunning sweetheart real state deals with the heads of m bionet going alway back in the nineteen seventus cutting sweetheart deals with unions in order to get himself elected in thet there is nothing n u about the corruption here he is cutting sweetheart deals with banks in order get those banks yove lons to his brother jimmyes wo his brother jimmy could startthe is rot a rock bar in in wilmington delaware him using his power in order to benefit his family financially has been the entire jobidan story for as long as jobine has been i public office a's been the entire stick why is this implet there is no evidence there is no evidence well actually there there is a lot of evidence gies there is a lot of evidence a meanwhile there is another scandal this piled on top of the actual corruption and that is the cover up of the corruption the obstruction of the corruption wi'll get to that in just one second first are love watching

for an instant deposit match up to one hundred dollars i'll ge scandal number one is obviously joeand hunter corruption but scandal number too is that joe is currently the president and the do j was attempting to cut a very obvious sweethart dealy sweethart deal with hunter obvious that the jodge in the case un covered it and blew it up and the do j was forced to pretend that he had not cut the sweethart eal in the first place meanwhile the whitehouseis maintaining gis jo din talk to anybody about the hunter case here is the insam'sthe witehousesancjus that gaming the president's been very clear about tistance before he even took office that the justise to cartment in his administration is in dependent he has not been involved in that case he has out talked anybody but that case but do not take his word for it take the words of the go pes own witness is in the house who testified in an open hearing that neither atterney general garland nor president bydon interfered in this case i get well i mean what they did testifi to is that the atturney in this case david wites had askd for special council status from the do ja and was not given it or at the very least that he was not given special council status even if he dan ask for it and the mericanlll you didn' mean askportan f wat it is not up to him to ask for you just give it to him if you wish f r him to be truly in dependent will now politicos reporting an fbi agents invalved in the hunter biden probe said the prosecutor leading it sought but was denied hope from a key fellow yus atturney the lack of quoperations not prevent charges from being brought against the presidents son but it did make the prosecutors job harter the testimony's liver behind close doors is consistent in part with an iris whistle blowers description of the probe and comes at a critical juncture in the investigatiens into the bidon family republicans appointeds that whistle blower description when makin the case for openig an impeachment inquiry in to presiden trobidon the agent said she did not recall another kee part of the whistleblower allegation re publicans of focast on that david whites said he did not final authority to charge the president's son apparently the agent sad quote i remember learnin it some point in the in vestigation tht mister whiss would have to go through his other process he is because the uus aturneys office hat i guess in that sense using that terminology was not going to partner askd if she recalled learning thet martinet strat ofthe us of turny for the central district of california specifically decided not to bring tax charges against hunter by the agent said i understand that yes a decision had been made that the central district of california was not going to i guess my understanding is they were not going to bring the case on their own here is the problm with all this and again this is is the problem inherently with issues involving the deoge jobidon does not have to say anything to meric arlan for all this tiget done they are widespread reports in the public media in the near tons about how upset jobidon is about all these charges with hunter how much he loves his son howpset he is with all f the stuff happenything meric garland does not know that ithing meric garland is not interested at all h his no political stake in making shore that a sweethart deall gets cut with hunter a sweethart deal that he attempts to bury in a gundeal you thing that that is jobidon does not have to pick up the phone and sa to meric arland merick i want outo quash this investigation hes nef to signom lettersing uch oh my son make a go his not have to do that all yester is make it clear that he would that tappan a meric garlan knows how to make that happen he makes it happen an one of wasy makes that happen is he says to david wise i'm not giving you special council status you work for me things go wrong here i get blamed anyway now leke let us make this thing go away that is all democrats for the record are beginning to turn on hunter howse democrats are beginning to realized that tom maybe hunter has to go under the bos in order to save jo here which is pretty dirty pool gets that momentarily first innovation refuns has ben helping small business is the qualify het business perell tax refun through the employ retention credit also known as

they protes that thre is nothing here house democrats are preparing to throw hunter directly underthe busicoing to politico quote as the house barels closer to an im peachmen vote democrat's are valing to defen biding to the end jo bidn that is not hunter top democrats are co lessing around a stratagy to oppose the jeo peas in peachment inquiry cleaving off the son's conduct from his fathers they think they have the facts to back him up since the prob as get to find any evidence to rectly linking hnter bidon's business dealings to joe i gan they keep saying this over ad over i do not understand you do have evidence hunter talked about it tony bobolinsky talked about it devan archer talked abatly what what are you talking about but ges then gin a pretend de'll get stacy plassgat of the virgin islanc has our job or my job will be to remind the american people of that over and over again hunter bidon is not the administration jimmy raskan said you cannot in peachunter bidin but he will be prosecuted democrats do not even plan to try to defend hnter byt his conduct during is time serving on the board of the cranin natural gas company berizma that arrangemen republican say allowed him to trade on his father's influence at the time as vice president by the way that is not just what republican say hunter himself sed it he said of mid net lastname wer not bidn i would not have been on the board of a natural gas company in nu crane h knows nothing bout natural gas he knows nothing about you crane but his last name is bidon instead the president's party is keen to keep joe as far away as possible from the drip drip of damaging in formation coming out about his son jurry naddler of new york he says hunter bide may have very well done some in proper things he is a disturb band almost every president has had problem out ic familembers yes but i's the presidnt in business with them question w we understand that roger clinton bill clintn's brother was a really screwed up dued was bill queering checks was bulle billic actively using his influence to get roger clinton jobs outside the administration i'm just i'm confused but but ther's what democrats think they are going to do they'e goin to throw hunter under the bso oh it will be fascinating to see it is almost shakespearian whether joe is eventually just gon tothrow hunter unde the bus as well if the if the mask of he is a carring father goes by the wayside when his presidency is at stake if he says o hunter does a lot of crrupt terrible things and hegot probns obvious land ni i i was not involved in those but hunter man he is gon nhouh to go to jom pasbut you think joe e's gin to do that 'll be interesting to find out meanwhile democrats have ome up with a secondary angle here and that is the person behind all this is the nafarious trump oh trump trump is be trump is manit he is pulling all the strings here i'm no i'm sckin to say no te'e a lot of re publicans who think that jo bidon has done corrupt and terrible things here nothing to do with donal trum butt i gain everythig has to be trums fall that dog is not going to hunt that is notty dog that is going to hun that it is that it is trump from behind to scenes manipulating j genius all of this donal trump can barely manipulate his own hands are you kitting me that is not a thing donal trum manipulating the republican party into impeaching jobide in give me a break but according to yah who knews on hy sweeping padio overlooking the golf course tat his private club in bedmanster new jersey for a president donnal from dine sunday nagh with a close political ally margery tailagreen is ha chance for the frormer president to catch up with the hard right teorgia congress woman but over halibit and diet coax greenbrought up an issho of considerable interest to trump the push by house republicans to impeach is liktly ponent n ext year's election i did brief mon the trategy i wantcs he laid out with impeachment brief a greens seadin a brief ophoned interview trums dinner with green came just two nights beforehouse speaker cove mc carthy anounce his decision on tuesday to or order the opening of an impeachment incry a just to get the straiht the theory here from the prass is that trump talk to emty g who then dictated terms to ceve mc carthy heh yaw that makes perfect sense nailed it that is probably what is going on here but of course he is what jamy raskin who gan was involved in te impeachmen of trum twice now as claiming that te impeachment is coming from trump ah this is tiresome irit is coming from it is coming from the fact that joe bigon is a lifelong corrupt politician for deckades you knowt you nwhat ye wouldnt have to worry about impeachment if he had not been a lifelong croup politician for decates deploying his drug addicted booz at old prostitute abusing son to go pick up money for the family i mean in understand why this tuft understand it is amazing his jimme raskon do you think the white house should have could have handled the hunter vid in sogo better ou know but i'm i'm not closely watching the white house what i'm duing is engaged in the work of oversiht committe for seven months we have watched the republicans on the oversad committeing cherman cirmer gat all of the witnesses they want all of the documents they want more than twelve thousand pages if documents and there is no evidence tot any criminality are wrong during by joe bidin there is ninety one criminal charges against donald trumpright now fhirteen criminal charges in canti a congressmen saunters who as just on the show a few moments ago they 've nothing to say about that there no charges against jobigton and they wantan inpeach to gy that is obviously coming from donald trump dowv his going from downal trump or maybe it is coming from republicans tho look at the fact that you impeachdown trump twice without actually a leging crimes and the turn about is fair play and your president is corrupt anderson coopers uing santhing trump is behind it oh it is then farrious trump i do enjoy the spectacle of donal trump is simultaneously a bumbling fool but also he is a mocgive elly ingenious manipulating all the strings from behind the scenes see then is reporting that the form pressent trumps pok day with t has juky confren sharilys to phonic about the impeachment stratity is he i mean is is he really the one driving this i do not know whether he is driving it directly or in directly certainly as as he a a participates on commedian talks about this on sociolmedia he is driving the act of is to call members of congress and an gettin ball whether he called caven carth to directly or whether ou a is just o sort of getting into tho the trups rea u i'm not sure which way it happen but certainly members of congress are hearing about it oh you mean well yeu shocker twhatr doam trumpston's ang publicly he wants jobitnin peacher the very first day bt what else is new well thatthe one ofthe reasons the democrats are in a state of outsizes pianic about something that is not going to come to frulition by the way again letme re mind you democrats control te senate jobinen is not going tobe remove from offics the reason democrts our fighting mat about this is because by announcing an im peachment inquiry mc carthy and the re publicans have successfully put this atop of the news and tha's it te do not want thy will not talk about trump then talk about the old news of trumps indihtments and all the rest of this kennistuff they do not want talk about jobidon being absolutely corrupt tit is not something they wish to speak about why whatl because they are fighting thi mean they are afraid beyond all reazon and all measer about comela harris that is really one o the things that is happening here it isi it is hysterical every columnthat tells jobid no to run always includes in a dendum from these democratic cen of advisers that comela also should not run divignacious as we talkes about yesterdo on the program daving matia sort of column in the washington postsing joe should not run and alls astresk and also comela harris which jis kind of amazing right because she is supposed to be this wonderkin this political genius shes suppose o be amazing at this and we just all mis understand her but the proban is nobody likes comela harris the reason thor panicing about biding iscas they gougt nobody to back him up who is the person waiting in the wings yeu sad's gavenus him bletme tell you running on the record of california is not likely to win you the presidency or the very least tank on a go amazing californ's been bleeding population cluding my entire family for years under gavenues im it is truly an amazing spectacle to watches the democratic party recognized them mean they really do that they must send this madam to wax figure of a human into battle and he is melting but you better you beter get him back in the presidenc yo before that you would completely melts because backing him up is comela harris and you can hear the democratic unease nancy polosy was asked yesterday about whether comela harris was the best pick for vice president for jobiton she refused three separate times to say yes jak walt joe did pickim but she is lay i renm an thatmila harris the best running maor this president he think and that is what matters people should not under estimate but comml hars ben to the taple an do you think she is the the best running athe she is the vice peson a to nig sta ton kipl satin whysen she doing thi te tat i tepiccessis the bi president that is the job discurbtion you do not do that much yu know you you you you are a a sorce that stragth inspiration intellectral rethorist and the grais again she is not saying that should that she should be theruning mi she is saying melling you kno im she is grat and and joe pick nobody 's comfortable with comla harris why wellcause she is terrible at tus for example she is asked about her lemints on abortions remember the talking point from the democrats including from people jensoky former spokes person for the president of the united states the talkin point is that they are not for abortion on to man the problem is when asked name a situation in which you woudo outlaw abortion they cannot name any here is commal harrison faced the nation botching it once again thi would what is it that you believe from what week of pragnancy shul abortion access be cut off we at to restore the protections a overs this way which we are not trying to to something new but does it meed to be specific in terms of defining i were that guarintee goes up to and where it does not a which week of pragnancin we an't to put back in place the protections ofroves this way you here i nain let i stit o because twhey're not trying it but we are not trying to do anything that did not exist before june of last year s that be abortion on de man by the way tures n't recognize the question was where would you limit abortion and the anser is i'm not going answer question because they do not have any limits on abortion she is terrible at this everydy knows

has been a union guy is because there is fairly good evidence that the unions were actually heavily involves in jobiton's first senate election campagn ben shrackinsir rites bast this in his book the bidens that basically the day before jobiton's original senatorial election campaign backon nineteen seventy effectively there is a malor that was supposed to go out in all of the newspapers that day and the unions picketed the newspaper to stop the mailor from going out ack te ba has to people connected with jo this or he is always been boughton paid for by the unions will now he is runing into a probem because the u a w is seeking another big pay out from the car companies despite the fact that th u a b did enormous work in the fifty sixties and seventies to completely undermine americas car

the workers are calling for thirty six per cent payhike over four years and the restoration of to fine benefit pension plans which means the utter bankruptsy of these car companies again you re member that brokobom ma bailedout the car companies we will get that again jobion presume will come down on the side of the unions because jobinin care about the economy does not cabou te car companies he cares about pleasing his union cronies we will then presumaly spend a bilion dollars in the upcoming election to get him reelected orget all of this bodes ill for jobidon's re elect chances the good news for the emocrats is they always have the republicans to fall back on which is exciting exciting stuffs republicans are about to have a a circular firing squad with regard to a possible shut down according to axios house republican to fallen into a state of paralyzed chaos on the second hay back from recess with no obvious exet ramp and a goverment spending fight of their own creation on the first night of the house speaker election we publish to piece headlining the un governable house giope eight months later the sentiment has never wrung more true the house was forced to cancilevote on wednesday and vancing funding for the pentigon after the freedom of caucas rebelled over spenning levels another typically un controversinal appropriations bill funding agriculture has been scrappd entirely over an internal geope debate about abortion policy mc carthy's announcement of an impeachment inquire appears to a back fired with some republicans trashing it as a distraction jopy leadership is now advocating for a short turmant continuing resolution to avert a government shut down but if mc carthy put to bill on the floor mat gates is vowling to trigger daily votes to ouse tim as speaker agest have a question what is the point of this mik what is seeking to be achieved here i said this with regard to the first thrats to to not hand mc carthy the speakership unless he handed some concessions to the house conservatives i am fine with that but can we name the points that you actually are advocating fore mc carthy can either do them or not instead what wre getting it seems is another fight over mc carthy with nobody waiting in the wings to pick up the pieces because a hundred ninety republicans say their committed to mc carthy no matter what and meanwhile democrates just sitting on the side shortling as what are they care now behind all of this is a real sort of bizar idea logical battle an it is an idyological battle over te valu of tactics at all their there is part oftherepublican party tha just thinks that tactic do not matter at all that the best way to stratagize in situations in which you do not control the powers to run to rectly at a wall at full speed with your head down andif you do it over and over enough the wall will crumble i've get see that strategy achieve any sort of real success lasting success it seems more likely the we should do is you should make moves that eventually guarantoou full power across alle branch of government then you can really make harish moves but instad whirchs can get internal squobbling matgates goes on emas and be see to bitch about khev mc carthy it is always a dad give way republicans ar appearing on emison be see to do the sort of stuff this is about ternaliments aballance quencion mendmen and single such expending bills just ou been sad for entire here i am the most investigated man and the entire cagress and right there i sau ceven mc cartha wire a ded dog because i have never asked to to interfere it any afics bat i th a e i and eiga o hate me investigate me for three hears you covered it nerely nihtly and even you knowledge to thean that mie te diles held out consistently and the people thos fretlies about me ar sitting it a federal presen right nout because they or part of a criinal scheme notn i not the hel that has to e kemc carthy but suddenly i guess the ideais that if what you you yellic hemc carhy that he will replace by whom who is waitig the wings youv scholies does not want it jim jim dorning an take it a what what ae you tong about right no ow meanwhile mccartheis acis ingages of teeping up with teemig up wit theiric swallow to attack his speakership this alght thes oglon gragggies wman again in these sorts of firefights are completely useless but leave its republicans to shoot themselves directly in the foot when facing down the possibility o democrats doing the same i swear watching democrats in the republicanst to battle with one another is watching a gun fight in which both gun fighters are pointing their own guns at their own heads and threatening to commit suicide it is it is an amazing thing its tening ten paces the part and the democrats if yo dont kom e what we want man i'm a shoot myself right now in the head and republicans dont do not do ite i'll shoot myself in the head and im all ta rstand youie why do not you i understand what why do not neither of you do that that seems that seems stupid i'v been saying for years of this point first party to sanity winds but tha it seems glub were not going in that direction any time in the near future and hen meanwhile other big political story of the day is that mit romney e's now announcing his retirement from the senate of the united states and mit romney is one of them more peculiar figures in the history of american politics he was a a very very moderate massachusetts republican governor he ran as the conservative in two thousand eight you will recall against john mcan cam in seconds john mckan in that nominating battle and he is considered the more conservative candidate against john mckan largely becaue of emigration then he ran again in twenty twelve and he won the nomination andthen he lost the precidency to beroch obama in an election that i think actually broke the country because you had an incredibly milk tosed modert republican running against a radical democrat and the radical democrat winds by cobbling together ae coalition of the supposedly oppressed against the against the the demographically elderly white majority in all this nonsense anza an he breaks politics permanently does does brokabmama in the united states his to then mit romney goes to the senate in you taw he moves outa because he 's a moreman he is elected to senate overwhelmingly and he proceeds to work with democrats on a on a wide variety of issues he is voting record over all is prettyconservative but on some key issues on certain bills for example the infrostructure actans of workang with democrats the widespread perception from republicans about mit romney e's almost the circle it starts from he is a moderate orepublican not sure how conservative he is but he guess he is got an arby his name to he is very he is he is a harsh conservative he is a harsh conservative in two thous name to he is a harsh conservative but he wouldn't really stand up to brokamoma the way that he should probably that is why he lost if he would been only a little bit of harsher to he is contomamoderte republican he can has an arby his name but not all that conservative here 's mit romney now ncing he is not con run for reelection at the end of another term i'd be in by mid eighdies frankly it is time for new generation of leaders the're the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in i' we face critical challenges motding national debt climate change and the ambitious authoritarians of russia and china neither president bydn nor former president trump or leading their party to confront those issues political motivations too often impede the solutions that these challenge is demand the next generation of leaders must take america to the next stage of clobe leadership wele i'm that running for reelection on that retiring from the fight i'll be your united states senator unto january of two thousand twenty five at he then shared in an interview with mckaycop ins his his hatred for all the rest of the republican partyan and here is the thing about this kind of stuff we have a peculiar standerd in send the republican party for what counts is loyalty mon accounts a disloyalty for ment romney's attacking all the othe republicans he sured unique discussed for senators at joshawley and tad crudes we said wuol put politics above the interest of liberal democracy and the constitution he also when after senator jdy vansid idont i do not know that i can disrespect sime one more than jdy vance and and un asoso that is considered disloyal by lot republicans i hear it i hear it whyre you directing your firinside the house also i tend to hold that rule about donal trump attacking fellow republicans inside the housebut it is it is very strange to me that certain types of attacks are considered completely verbotin and certain types of ttacks depending on whois doing them are considered totally appropriates when donald trump suggest that in some way ron to santis is a ry know his tounds but gat that is true and i way that is not true at all and then when people attack mit romney as eryno then the same people will be well that is that is appropriate or inappropriate pentlic habout one standard for whether you attack people inside the caukis or notlicke when they violate actual conservatov principles then you attack him donald trump spent the a spent the day celebrating the auster of mit romney which is again donald from spends more time celebrating the ouster of republican senators than any democrat that i know he he put out a statement sing fantastic news for america the great state of youtaught in the republican party that romney sometimes referred to as pierre delecto i we will say the gas rellybony that that was his ab his peculiar screenname on liccan all turn of twitter account will not be seeking a second termin new a senate where he did not serve with distinction a big primary ifight against him was in the offing but now that will not be nasterycan grats to alll make america grate again now in gant i'm fine with that romey sepping down and i'm find with a lot of people thinking thathe was not conservative enough in utop i agree with some of those criticism a lot of this criticisms i just wen out thet donal from his now celebrated the aster of of people ranging from jeff lake to john mcaine to mit romney meanlak he does this kennes of all the time when you talking about it is bad for romnue to attack othe republicans in the senate 's not great to attack of the republicans in the senate you you you might think o kate time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day i have to say that the the the pagan mentality is taken over corprt america is truly in astonishing thing there is an ad that was released yesterday by apple in which the effectively call for worship of mother nature i means i pure pagan guya worship nonsense this commercial is tim cook and supposedly the rest of the apple board meeting with mother or nature who of course is a a is a black woman and she shows up to express her unease at the progress that corporate america has made in protecting her the environment and i here is how this commercial goes mother nature welcome to apple how here the wother good in yeu the weather was however i wanted it to be let us cut to the chase and twenty twenty you promise to bring apples entire carponfoot print o zero by twenty thirty henry davi the ro over here said we have a profound opportunity to build a morse a sanaple future for the planet we share ivent her ten ofclock said the senve theyon all right this isn my third worprat responsibility gig to day who wants to disappoint me first well we have got some up tits we are excited to sere with materials status is there materials person yes we are in the process of eliminating all plastic from our pomaging by the elemi guess fifty years from now when some one else is left holding the bag by the end of next yeear actually i cu can i get just point out a supir thesis there re few things thatar incredibly supet ofbethis this entire commercial which apparently was inveiled that the apple product launch to demonstrate jus tow invironmentally friendly they are firstof all it begins with mother or nature arriving and then they say how is the weather and it gets real dark and mother nature says whatever i wanted to be what are we wored about you for i'm confused if mother r nature is all that powerful then why is it the we are not seekin to protect ourselves from you and not the other way round which by the way was the story of virtually all of human history unti last five minute mother r nature trying kill people and people trying to figr our way not to die it isvery much the story of all of human survival n civilization still kind of the story of all of human urvival and civilization et but immediately it is it immediate contrition then it turns into how can we worship the altar of mother nature well we will not what if we were cycle all of our plaster mon use plastic whatif we were cycle all the illuminum that we use in our phones and this s will weewe are proving to you what good people we are what amazing amazing people we are do not nore about values do not worry about whether what you are doing is good or evil in terms of the product that you produce wha c a protections it has for sa children how contentactually reaches people vea the phones and computer s you put out or about an atsta or you really ought to worry about is mother natureso first of all the substitution i me this it is paganism worshipping nature is a form of paganism because the realityis nature do not care about you and if you are making pagan sacrifices to the gods but what you'r offering up is not rain and meat what you are offering up is instead recycle the luminum i'm not sure what the differenceis made my favorite part about all o this is the apple board the suposed apple board meetng with mother nature here it is supervrerse yeu got a black lady an agian woman gn indian woman chere is wit the actual apple board looks right now that is the whitest group of people in human history that is a very white group of people thereis maybe one person on this entirelist who is not white i'm yah they woent wont put that in the comerchal cs then we just be aboutchtal white people meeting with a black lady and i wuldn't looked nearly as good or or quite as diverse what i about this is it is good when the mass comes off when when corporat america basically says en people tem cook while you now my my chief goll is to worship mother natron to use my trying company to do meanwhile i'll produce all of our product in comminis china or they completely abuse the environment do not care about anything ye i i i do not believe you but but i appreciate the sentiment i'lk a time for some things that i hate are i things that i hate to day samsmith is running out of boundaries to transgressin has become boring i the other day samsmith who used to be a talented musician and now has become a parody of himself theyself herself zayself put up a tik tok dressed up in tell a tubby boots i'm i hesitate to show this just beause it creapy by i herigo t as samsmith o creepy man in a beard wearing gen shorts and tell a tubby boots in a teashirt with a small boy on it eating an apple grown man wearing shirt with little boy eating apple on it in short short short gene shorts daisy dukes and tell a tubby boots as he dances to the telletubby music why are you doing all these things involved with children's branding if you do not have ifit has nothing to do with children i'm just wondering tank in it i do not do children's activities in the absence of my children bat i do not sit around dressing in tell atubby's outfits or playing with tellatubbies or doing any of those things unless i am you engaging in some sort of play with my small children sam smith is a gender variable gay man who is wearing daisy dukes and tell a tubby outfits what is this what is this if results it is hideous but besides it besides being hideous im i'm not sure why were notspis to fine that creepy cause i it is superit is superdupercrepy but thentire meedia have brought into the m have brought into the bazaar creeping nature of our of our gender postgender world which is why presumably mi pense the former vice president whis corntly runing for president whis appearing on siannen and he has a face down a question from a mom who is destraught that her trans daughter would not be able to drop in mi penses americay i'm sithis renews nation rather not sienon ar fou me to ask these questions after justheri what a herd what is your policy plan to protect e ransgencommunity pecifically black and brown trans women trom thistoricly high level with vilet gomerles e levin sayi i i'm digly grieved to hear about those treasur circumstance es to and i hear your heart ni'm cumb by your motion o truly but ifin present in thunited stas soon i'm not a see to the protection of every american and the rigt every american but tos whether a that is that is squares with my values o not im a i'm a bible believing christian i have e particular view as he m dese matters and tha and you ave different vew of those for out yon but i want to na believe in the you are not a bi belive in theh free and sho religion i believe in the freedom of conscience i believe ove every merican to live to work to worship according on cas heares heres the el pence is answered usn't matter nearly as much as the questionis being aired this the actual answer is black and brown transgenders a transcender people are not experiencing historically high levels violence the're not ay they the the lie that there is a great slaughter of transgender people going on in the united states is statistically untrue hey would put that aside the actual answer to this is not i i feel your pain i hure your heart all f this kind of stuff the actual answer is i'm sorry that you are very upside boys are not girls girls are not boys men are not women and women are not men it is not an age dependent argument and you are doing a great diservice to human beings when you tell them a li when you tell human beings that the delusions that they are experiencing are in fact reflected in reality and that it is the job of every one in society to reflect that back at them you are not doing the many favors you are engaging any cruelty it may sound heart but at some point som eas can have to say somebut something harsh about all of this if the a merican pople cannot take that then maybe the american people deserve what they got honestly if you

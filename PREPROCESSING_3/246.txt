a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in todays episode of the sho if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our websight this american life dot o work ro getting kond of old in my family and when we get together for the holidays there is never any drama any more used to be i avoidteo coming him for years all through my twenties in early thirties cause my parents and i were not getting long well pardhe pobem was me and my early twenties i was a harsh and judgy and said lots of things it now i wents at and neve apologize for but parde h bobem wth them they did not agree with most of my big life choices starting with and especially the fact that i worked in public radio during that period i was working for the empure news shows all things considered morning addition and my parents were completely against it i'v said this before it my parents hated when i say this but my parents are the only jews in america who do not public radio the stories were too long it seems second rate to them if i wanted to be a journalist why was not i own tv why ways i settling for this place that paid me little the money was a huge thing my det is an accountan does all our tax is and he knew what i made and could not quite believe it i gould still arn a good living somewhere i cutd still be a doctor coming home for the holidays sometimes i dad would ponmy aside sometimes you would bring it up during dinner at a crowded table should not i quit these jobs i love and finally going to medschol it is not too late my parents pleated with me well into my thirties my mam officially canno half joking half serious gave up the effort when i was forty one and hade been hosting this mirk en li for five years ibut for long my dad especially would express his love and concern for me when i came home by questioning the basics where i lived how i lived how i dressed how my heroiked who i fell in love with why was not i more of his success to beclare he was not mean he was not angry he was just very very concerned my sisters randyind caren they got their own versions o this holidays yet things to get very tens which jus to say we were a normal family but now it could not be more different my mam died over a decator go my dad's in his aities an the last couple years he is had a lot of hearing loss it is harder in tract with him he is not the critical questioning man he once was i got home now a nothing's bothering him about me they needs to get off his chest he is been trained over the years to say i love you when we talk on the fone or see each other and he actually seems to mean it he is lovely but i am not used to this milder gentle reversion of the overworked stressed out dad that i grw up with it is that guy oh dissolved away that whole side of his personality leaving another man standing there and i have to say is his bed to admit some t imes i miss that other guid i go home for the holidays and it is chill and everybody gets along and i never thought i say this i swear i never thought these words would come out of my mouth i wish he would pick a fight with me i feel that is my real dd thit is olderly guid with the same name who likes and accepts the person that i'm in love with and in fact notices if she eese o glasses in the dining room that helpfully brings them to her in the kitchen just to be nice that guy he is allsome but where is my real dad ind this bes of going home for the holidays and not having anything to fight about at all i meen are our lives over are we already dead that is it we are done no fighting are we really a family any more to day in our programm we have families boisterously noisily getting into it with each other kid's coming home with importan stuff ley been weading to get off their chests parents showing up at their grown children's houses with demands that absolutely need to be met id then let the games begin fut the holidays it is a family get together episode of our show including a song s n good family then that either is or is not e vailed gretique of one family member in particular en i you be easy chicago is this american life an my reglast stay with us tha wan how do i say this i begin to day with somebody returning to the family in the suburbs out in the far west in canada an calgari a burda and she is returning with a mission somethng shou needed to discuss in english though the thing yhou wonter to discusse was a different language entirely persin doing this is sat she call nine months ago after twenty eight years of being alive i finally started taking hindy classes my parents are both from india and they emigrated to canada long before i was born they speak in number of languages including hindy and their mother tongueish mary but there is no real text book or organized class or do a lingo programme for akish mary hindy proved to be the easiest one for me to learn i'm not enjoying these lessons i've set al lot in clast several times that i hate it i hate it because it is hard harder than i expected becaus for some reason i thought this language would come naturally and yet for two hours every week i meet my teacher and fellow class me at a coffee shock in ma time and hatten and learn how to greet some one and tell them what i am presently eating and that the cat is sitting in the big chair sometimes the cat is sitting on the little chair learning to say that has cost me one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars thus ar i certained these lessons on a lam i knew for years that i wanted to do it but i did not give much thougt us to why i assumes my parents would be happy about it not even just happy alatit my dat has said to me more than once you are barely recognizeable when he says it he means i'm not recognizeable to him as the person whe wanted me to be the persons who would never for example i've married a white man much older than she is or refused a creer in medicine or smoked at least ate hundred cigarettes but i do not know if my learning him the even matters to my parents or how much i also do not know why they never made me learned in the first place i went home to find out he ther something by gidy ya davy here is a fot of i fatin featurein yastrs when i visit my parents we do not usually do much more than sit together in the living room an alternate between joking enfighting ere allin door cats e i recently got the magugl home foolishly thinking they delight in being able to boss it around they have had it for a day and have been characteristically hostile to it eog o that song ya you ar bus she did not say she was buzzy she sais she was buggy what is than she has a bug my parents have long converted my childhood bedroom into a sorry storage facility but its still home there is nothing more comforting to me than my mam accusing in inanimate object of being against her te fes it iis because i keep detding the by gan endi dis'n bewiged when the gugolhome fails to play the devotional song my mom reclests she curses at it and i finally recognize one of the fukish mary words i know for my childhood e that will not you tat pay it that as my mam said is her saying that she hopes lightening hits the gugl home the insults my parents use are the part of their language i absolutely know i can help you call some onlazy dumb loud annoying rude ugly but the one i know best is that you say when you are mad or shocked or when some one's cooking is excellent you just cannot help but want them to get hip by lightning my dobt eventually gives up on trying to teach the guggohom kishmry and settles on something she knows hegoga te frank a not a we a o thi pleased to no she is a robat i mean it is nice but's not necessary my mean man is i should have a cigarette and aviski on n a smoking jeck ten in the morning edan in ton later that night my mamhose the party for my brothers fortieth birthday and she is cooked her usual dinner partin spread the malo rogenjo but tha hach dripping in oil it happy wet wyethank you i have all these quastions for my parents but first i want to talk to my brother the only other person in the world who understands what i'm getting myself into i call my brother bayah meaning older brother he is twelve years older than me and was born in india kashmery is his first language and though he understands it when its spoken to him he lost the ability to speak at himself soon after he moved to canada as a toddler he does not remember any one trying to get him to speak ish mary instead of english but nobody said anything to me or may be they did i just said i jusone whach threes company thank you very much that is how my brother learned ingulash we runs of three's company consequently he has a very complex understanding of tenant protection rights my brother afirms one thing i remember to be true when we were kids it was deeply uncool to speak hin the orkishmary we knew lots of indian kids who spoke their parents language they were dutiful good polite o was saying yes anty handi but we also knew that those kids were fuck and dorks and worthy of our ire we were never dutiful bact then i envied my brother he is fair scanned with angular features an a fanatic name he could always hide in plain sight i used to wish i could do the same my brother is maried he lives twenty minutes away for my parents and he has a nine year old daughter that i call raisin she is the best person in the world raisin is by rachell her mother as white and she is light skinned with bright blue eyes she does not speak indierkish mary but the exception of naming her favourite foods and even though my brother could do something about her slim language skills he has not why have not you put her in those classes she does not but she is nicsont do anything i dont she wants to wash er but but i do not want a i also do not anm superlazy it is the the reality is driving to the monder it e thirty on a sunday that is not can happen i can barely get her to corraty somethng she is interested as for my brother he is not likely to sign up for u class himself destspite having the urge just i do do i think about practicing ye all the time but i just do not i do not because our parents are merciless when ye try to learn something een on interested giving them more fodgter for jokes what do you mean that theire merciless about men whou ever tried to speak a language that they know in front of them yet ye a hao yet exactly i say it is a spicy experience that does mean anything to me but don' ke do you think that we turned out the way he wanted that he we know no i thindit at all if we did not turn out the way our da d wanted us to well my dad bears a lot of responsibility for that for one thing instead of forcing us to learn hindy he made us learn french why instead of making me take hindy class is that the temple did you decide oh i know i'm eang to put them in french immerse an for some reason as a can id is a biding good country and i was hoping that te the a hindy would come automatically because am at home and a the indians my dat as loquacious and ry and thinks he is the smardest person in the room he is also stubborn is how and am i which means were often trying to murder each other after i first got together with the man who had become my husband the way older whitegey my dat idn talk to me for a year when i first ask him how he feels about me taking these classes he is his typicalself dismissive and cled what did you think when i started taking the hindy classes i was imused since you do whatever you want to do wit out mady a good what os that mean i do whatever i want to do because you are at tity independent mind you t puston you not ak endy an instruction a anything i was glad that at least you are doing something for you ar betterment because i said having knowledge of another language can neverhood you do not be fooled by his detached attitude about weather i speak kendy he has other feelings as well depending on the day he used to get upset about it when i was younger sometimes he would speak to me in kish mary and quickly get frustrated that i could barely understand it and could not respond he gave that up after i moved out whet ever since i started my hindy classes he is trying again now when i call my mother he will barge into our calls and demand that she speak to me in hindian kish mary i had to ask him the same question over and over again before he finally admits that yes he is absolutely thrilled at the idea of me learning hendy ane whofly ye one day you will converst with the somebody in hindy and you should go india i'll go with you but let you indeed that you can speak with dexidries a idu y churies a shop keepers and tried to haggle te tem in hindy i bet atbe belaties ly wonderful were you surprise that i started taking lesson ye i was because you were bot you kids wor extremely white washed maybe i i i had something do there i did not puposely do that exactly what my daubt had to do with that gas all the way back to his arrival in canada this is whom y dad was when me and my brother were kids a hundred and twenty five pounds five foot four ambitious and working hard as ha farma cuiticale representada it was also we would eventually have all you could ever want house two cars a yard university educations we were middle class in canada all with traditional hindo names it was the indian dream we did not have much family near us in calgary i did not go to school with any other brown kids until i was well into high schooll my brother and cousin spoke to each other and me in english my father had this idea that we would pick up hindy at home but that is ridiculous my p arent spo kish mary in english hendy was reserved for bolly wood movies and when my momneeded to speak to her jeweler what form of osmosis is my dot even talking about i thought tem that the language mother ton specifically would cometolaten on an the i should concentraton i you being dontly stimulated id the the madian co cer if you will wut or that cujuis but somehow i i i should have teted some sort of in su sucha ver you would be you would learn and em be at least sufficient in o e languages in in tingse tates wo why did not you make me take les sons for either hin theor kishmeri i do not i onknow why i ougt to have don it si do not think my dot is equipped to directly talk about how hard it was to leave india my mam can talk about her sadness easily as if all those feelings are right at the surface of her skin waiting to blead out of her and drown me thi had to say good py tim may dad and my mother that mas may hart ady vey hat my dad was the family sol bred winter and in her early days in canada my mother was alone alot with my brother just a toddler she noticed he was losing his kushmary three or four months after they arrived and an mi would talk to him and kish mei and hiin on sudenein ishan se cansisit he is not woid to say anyting back now and i would push him an sain kish me and he ho satining she would not say shme then why did not you push him to keep it up wet how can you make him to o push how can you make him to speak when beya got a little older my mother and father considered signing him up for hindy classes and it turns out their reason for not doing as the exact sane practical yet lazy one my big brother gives about raisin papasit to sunday in morning i i do not want to get at a gen ofclock and take him to him te school that was don to we gas im the schools that is what te da s sundays tony dar and i ham a dea and i was not that confident driving that time on the deat fut tin vinter dane that is o tell a pat my mother says that years later they actually put me in hindy classes i was mad be five then she says that i'd wander out of class which was hewld in the basement of her monther and would trot up the stairs to find her atther remember this at all they stopp trying to foreit at the time i'm sure i was thrille that they left it alone i pushed against brownness in every way i could i recoiled when my white friends would call and over hear my parents speaking cashmary in the background i did not want to invite them over because they could smell sandalwood in the curtains i resented my un pronouncible first name and passively let peopled call me sasha or sara or scratche nor sushe or whatever examples of gentil rases and were permeating my life beou disappointed than i cannot speak kishmryin i cannot speak indy i would not sit d isappointin wut she f sad that it would have me nice because sometimes se hy if i want to dell you something and i have to jege the langy i loses its what i wante delyou that tim i deo festatesi ih she could understand what i'm tying to del that sometimes i could see my mm struggling to find the right word to convey the right feeling as she always felt a gap between which she wanted to tell me and what i was able to grasp when i moved away for university i worried my momb would be lonely i resented that i worried about her wut i wandered who my mom would talk to when i left home i never considered that maybe the language we were speaking left her feeling lonely before i even moved away t did you want me and be a to a similate in canada yet did we assimilate too mut well iven say yes at no to tat it would have been nice you for lie i stad doi towards yod he di toasor calcet ut i gess it jas suppose to happen andi i think i can do about it this idea from both of my parents makes me nuts of course there is something she could have done about it i know that my parents made the best choices they had at the time now though i feel i missed out on something that i desperately want i wish i could a spoken to your ma'm when she was alive i wish that to mean did that did she say anything to you about that that she could not speak to her grandchildren i she use to cry and cy and ashe e i i cannot speak to them and they do not understand me and er i wish i could tak to bit it was it was hard itwas she that and you gis could not tak to hat she would have been old wa i tose jesti few woulds no tis al gon o does not mat yi tin yots of course there is something else there is always something else what are re making for course it you wante to se ho we green means a ye cooking is the only place where i do not know the english equivalencsey of most words evidenced by how many times i go to the grocery store and ask for am ruth or a light she and struggle to name it in english in the kitchen my pronunciation is flalless and for once i do not feel a fraud when i spok an hin the erikish mary when i was a kid i would not even let my mompack me indian food for lunch but no one wants to be different in a great school cafateria it as then i moved away for university and i realized all i wanted was my mom's cooking i wanted her to braid my hair and rub my back and wax my mustache off for me all these blips of intimacy with her i once had i been learning how to make her food ever since i beens always turn out wird hat no they get to salt did youa e waoaoful i handie after a few months of lessons is finally good n that i can have slivers of conversations with my parents recently they visitedt me in new york and on a walk with my husband barily two feet ahead of us my mother told me in hinmy your husband

let it quush cush gotaten me check sad butit cushcutan e checks a but on mome eyou my mim now tells me constantly how proud she is that i am trying to learn hinthy more than anything that is what keeps me going to class sica col shories about culture for busfe news and she is also the author of a colection of essays one day will ell be dead and none of thismle matter be sam it son seonw coni when everythe e son bt sm coming out they did not mean it they really did not mean it they really really did not mean it a made as whete they say mother and daughter and the song thy chose to sing at a very significant family event thats in a minute from chicago bobo gradio when our programm continues tosmaric on li from myr glass eu we con a purgon of custihis a theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme to day show too close to hom for the holidays stories of family get togethers were somebody shows up with something they think the entire family has to deal with rugi's disguss and they rated to forced the issue we have arrived at at two of our programme ac two you probably think this song is about you in this act two family members show up with a message the messageis contained in a song which make sense as the family ingoods bunch of musicians the dad in this family is laldan rainwriht the third song wraters started putting out albams in e nineteen seventies he is father two sing er songwriters rufus swainwright and martha wainbright and with ha different mom lucy wainwright roach lucy's mamma says hy broch you got some notoriety in the band the roaches lucy and says he came into the studio to tell the story of this song we sang this one actually at tat one of my dad's wedtings to be precise her dad laldan at got married for the second time and this was a party to celebrate it may be fifty people lucy went with her mam says he who nevere been married to adn but they were together for years and a he asked us if we wanted to sing something and we said ur and then he was a cable you kdo not pick whatever you feelike singing and surprise us and we would been learning the song that was a cover song that we just really liked and sometimes wen you are learning a new song you cant have a little crush on the songs we just when as sing it all the time and we were likely just do that that new one that we have been learning and we we we just din't really think it through yet i would say that that is an undeur statementi do not know what we were thinking i mean at it was one of those kind of situations where you are standing in front of room full of people and they all have ther champagne glasses and their looking at you smiling and you start to sing the song and an i just imagine that youere at a wedding and and yet s yours are going to sing and you got your champagne and and then and then this happens ie that is gets through the song n ndes fao aton y t seniyoen ain an as slon lo or ha aal that ttime tes thin ataplasan anaty son ow lookat at this point what are they thinking i feel ic as soon as you sing jus yes frado people think oh oh we are talking about that i bet more than anything they felt what is happening right now wei gis the cas is a message it is he slightly hostile thing to sing at your father's wedding or your exess wedding but we were thinking ge j sev ase seminer and basically concentrating on playing it because i did not you do not know what that well i tink of going do not youd lnanyota yoye a ou kno the clyn a swayss youras o si an an in aana a ta ut you onl aane gan gaaawhat do you think people thought at that point i think that is the most cringy fine in the song in this contyes yeseems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table and you only once once that you cannot get i mean that seems rude you do not often here a wedding toast that says lake and what i love about him is lucky you he never once the things he can get that is not n tow i have not heard that a nor i think that is the low point of what we have done here that that is go into the next first oh you are not getting no younger right this is th wu say this the second to worst whine of the song yes frdo allan an youn anyou tan an onana draaaain youo and tre a ta ju sini to your gs ans agin thes o oso how do you think people might hav hard that al wat's sad that is sad it is sad now the mind you are not get no younger howld was your deat ye old yo was not getting any younger you'r singing this and you are looking around at the face is what dare you saying did not feelike it was the most well received we thing we would ever yet ye i mean there was a kind of a feeling of being looked at without a lot of expression which is sometimes not a great son i think they were probably thinking i thought that i think a lot when something happens that is uncomfortable and when something that has happening lik just make the right kind of face owiste a rye i jus make sure your face is right i mean the the truth of it is that nobody has ever mentioned it again to us to the stay yet what did he say afterwards nothing do he say thank you no not really now the horrible thing about this is that people must have felt we were doing something passive aggressive or agressive made and and the sad thing is we were completely oblivious and i know that that probably sounds maybe it is not true and unconsciously we had some sort of thing we were doing perhaps but it did not feel that at all but i think then after that couple years later when wev first perform the song in a show i might have said to the audience for the first time oh actually we sang this once my dat's wedding and then the the absurdity of that really hid us right in and also the song kind of turns into a comedy instead of the beautiful song that it is but here i recorting from one of those concerts yes o an s it is wear that you can get a song iis plaous comedy i mean people get hysterical when they hear it in that context which makes it obvious that there was something strange about it now it seem som tn se ta bet you e oo tin gan gee oin o yo youthi here is the other thing about it i do not know i should say this but i mean on the one hand it is a terrible thing to sing it a wedding and at that wedding but on the other hand it is kind of the perfect thing to sing at that wad i know an yo mean it is the perfect intersain well well because you are basically saithe lyrics if you really study them ar basically saying you have got to let somebody love you you saing unconsciously maybe it was the perfect pick for the wedding right i'm starting to change my mind on this whole thing and say id that yes of course we meant to sing this song i'm not and i see what it is actually saying what it says to me if there is a subconscious message that we were aiming at loud n or ell speak for myself me is just i see you i see what you have been true and i see your pain and and we were happy for you that you found somebody to be with saysi lucy rodgh the version desperado s on their alba mud an apples lucy's most recent atomis little beast i did by the way check with lauden sadesacs and lucy's dad to see what he thought about desperado as their trace of sang at the party since they really had no idea at all and mot kno me thes deaf and only remembered it oh yes yes i remember thinking it was hilariously funny and and the ironic and i thought it was a kind of really ironic cool choice of a song to do you mothers lose y father slims smother zuuvother pass back and fort between those two unto they had enogh of you anoa mon te comes alon b this tim somethings go awa ca nito fraesly it is overlo therin to d sheful get ta overloes over kwwhat a family's ftmusic from lauden ra met the third which brings us to act

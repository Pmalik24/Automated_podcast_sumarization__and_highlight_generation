when davis turning his life around in trying diveren things and figring out what to do next one placeas he looked was to the howard's stern show i think there was a really good choyes i know everybody is not afan of howard's stern but i am and i think that one of the best things about the show is that it is always been a place where people talk with this kind of brutal and funny honesty about themselves one of howards innovations is that he took the strain of crude dark confessional comedy that is always been a big part of stand up ever since wen hy bruse howard forget out he way to turn that into radio daily radio anyway to get back to his gidave he loved that about the show and in twhenty fifteen he was a few months sober in his early forties working as a waiter t cats's delly in new york sity when he was younger he would worked in tellivision posting an interview show for cowlage kids but bruined that career with a heroine diction now sober in recovery he needed a project he decided to a podcast about drugs with the feeling of the howard tern show he rememberd the years when commettionarty langwas on howard's stern definitely my favorpec howard's tern won aigady would come on every day he would talk about his own drug problems he would tell crazy stories he would talk in ths very real way about the mistakes he was making in his life at that time that he was not atble t stop and dave wanted to shoot for that he would callhost the show with thi frank criss to he had met chris years before in rehave there woad sbeent howards in rehav smoking cigarettes and talking about the crazy things o the done on drugs that is what they wented to podcast to be peopled come on tel wild drug stories and very importan to dave no re covery talk which dave found to be sanctimonious and annoying this show i's not as sowly about recover it is bet drugs they be ventually it will be wes its this show is ever about recovery yet get somebody else in thi put ome o o gatie cases is not clear in thse recortings dave is the one with the deeper voice in the loud opinions chris is the other god the show is abot drug story is not abot recovery it is not abou doing the next rat thing it is not the last wrong thing the lady with the evolution of you recovery that is what the show will be notice ow at the endther chris is not agree in hi day chris is ten years younger than dave but started drugs in drinking at an earlier age he is just eleven or twelve and his waymore exstreme stories about it putting a year in prison his alsas pent way more time in rehab and at this point he would been sober for nearly two years firs his four months for day and all that gave him a different feeling about re covery and sobriety he was came to talk about it but dave was at am it brity is not all that entertaining at first and foremost he wanted the podcast to be entertaining it i shows abo recovery sann ben la they telld drug stories was men to be good for you was mean to be fun hey listeted in the comedy section of hig tunes not self help if he wonce self help david said go toon meeting it will do not call the show war stories but there was already apodcast called wor stores was about nor actual war with tanks and guns and stolf they came up with dopy wuth really captures the spirit of the show perfectly as chris put it two dopes talking about do listen i grateful to be sober an om grateful to be able to u talk about drus in in a way where i'm not feeling bad about it you knowi is it is not even you for recall it is shust funny dady ges why we got along as we felt safe sort of doing that with each other times he had a feel little judge is people wi you sort of recount funny stuff that is happened yet doby thre wis can be no judgi in the drudg newse past or present they recorded the first episoe on a laptop no microphone or anything ner a fish tank in daves apartment in men hat mayb yo could hear the hum of the tank an at e rding but between this episode episode one and epistoded one hundred forty three of dope just two and half years later there lives of going to changed drastically bapisoded one forty three doby wit oun completely different and the episodes im between the croniclef the story wish much happens to them and some others things lots of drugg ears os face but because the to podcast an readio or intimate at all gets documented in the most unfilter way thavan chris one of there show to be just for fine but an end up being much more to day when i have a two stories this stories about a kind of am d i wy radio a very different kind of the i wi radio but in both stories its amateures inventing how to talk about what it is that they are going through and really both stories are dispatches from two very different battlefields i knowtits on the little ground but but really by this story from the opioid epidemic and then the other stories from a small town in serio in the middle of the war that is going on there and we hear about life during that word in this way that is much more personal and cosop than we usually gat from the bebe asy chicago is this american my on our glass s tay with us at one two dope kings oke remember the premis to geyes dave and cris they have this podcast its called dope dhin he chiv us from our staff listen to dozens of hours of the podcast spending two and half years and tells the story of what happened quick worning before we starts since his is the pocast internit version of our show we have removed the bweeps that we use when we do the show in the radio if you prefer weepd dversion of a show is sad our webside anw hers dana weven talking about this podasts for five minutes already in thewhole point of the podcast is to tell crazy drog stories is get right to one this is from the very first episode christ tells the story i am i relapse a mit onle gon say re last i just started using again after weef period of abstinence and i took a lot of daanex about sixty bars for those whtout of hours no eperiod about three for days see to a hundred and twoing lon ams over fort it yet and that blocked out for about a week and turing that black out i robbed to ten narian i went

mastachanses croston white eyes i's very big and broad and and i would be scared if chris got that i but on the gentle pers very gent very gentle soul a lamb if chris is the lamb and a drog outic's closing dave is the border colly conselly circling criss hurting him between drug stories nipping at his ankles there is boston ag fen we you you invite all your face bo friend to dobe no and the

toodla a toodles non se don satoodles which dave hates christart saying it at the end of every shel toodles thes tasaonbles they do very little editing except they do bleep out people's last names hey want the showe to be anonymous which is why i'm not using last names either by the way thn they use non traditional bleeps this one doby is not the kind of show you bring home to meet your parents davin christ swear a lot for one thing and obvieus they their talking about heavy druggies it is not just that they can be insensitive and insulting too tit is not politically correct by design they use the kind of language you might forgive your grandfather for using but which is harder to stomach coming from a thirty or forty year old to day and then sometimes there is also language you would not forgive your grandfather for using i'm not con play you that stuff on the first few episeds of dope they run through most of their favorite drug stories how christ made wine from orange tus at re hab hat dave once stayed up all night doing cok heroin and ecstasy before appearing on howard stern how christ shot christel mes while at a brain an dury clinec hey're not suppose to be engaging in recovery talk tut of course the only reason dopy can exist is because davin chriserbles in recovery there would be no dopy without it recovery keeps slipping into the conversation even dave does it we

the book we co we games o says it tye ha purtual a sprees os the educational ri that is whet you talking in exaction the beginning for the first twenty episodes or they get five hundred downleds an episode barely an audience but they stared hearing from people right away they get their first fanemal from some guy name troy three weeks after they outleard the first episode they cannot believe any

back to every emal they get they respond a comments on face book and twitter theople are not turned off by the recovery talk they listening to sober guis having fun enjoying life and recovery they give them hope chris says the listenere's come for the debauchery and say for the recovery he calls this marketing stragegy rope ado theavin christnow they have a finigte number of drug stories between the two of them they develop a roster of recurring guests friends of theirs who were also sober tne res celebrities robriner's son nick daves dat allen thand then there is a guy name tot one of dave's best friends from college they got addicted to heroine together and their twenties dave always said of tod got sober he could be the third host of dopy an taut really wants to be on dopy but tat is never sober a e gi givmy six months o bride timein on jo aya he is doin heviny servi ince tat is gettin back please he is giing bad a wha tus gevme some fo clain time you comei to co i o ta aa

his money on drobs lives in his parents apartment in man hattan he often just watches devy dees all day how you doin to a that is chris talking to tod on episode fifty for o doit all right miserably miserable as at a related two wast substance of yeus a a ast i less an my live e on this episode tod tells a very dopy story about getting high on heroine who passed out in subway station and then slept through a meeting at the unemployment office the mext dam gol feel there is the end of the story the call drobs and dave says to tha te wor athin t everrd a my i thought of wis fun for a second and then i realize poor tois in big trouble as a listener to me it seems tod has a specific purpose on dopy he is a caricature of how not to treat your diction an example that davin chris can hold up to their listeners and say do not do it this gy when davin chris talk about recovery they often talk about abstinences in twelve step programs that is what work for them but the science shows that opior dediction is best treated with medications saboxone and methodone which are associated with ha sixty eight per cent decrease in death for a while on dopy dave was prette clear that he thought medications were dangerous that you should learn to live without any substances chris was more middle of the road daves opinions of change by now he feels whatever works best for you is what you should do less an y year nto making dopy dave moved out of the apartment with the fish tank and in with his partner linda and their sixyear old daughter chris eventually move to boston and started working towards the doctoral degree in psychology he was dating a med student named anny they live together at a dob he was also working part time for his sisters company which helps people who are struggling with the diction another issues find treatmen en he was working every other week end at a sober living house by episode ninety six of dopy they aregtting about three thousand listeners a show they decide to relabel the show they move it from the comedy section on igh tunes to the self helfp seption mainly because they thought they could compeet better against otheir self helf podcasts rather than comedy potcasts but also because by now they have admitted to themselves they are in fact a self help show but anyway back to tot on dopy tod is the foil to the sober good life to their successes where he locks control davin chrisnow exercise restraint where he is depressed they are content where he cannot hold down a job they are raising children getting advanced togrees making a pod cast every week do something good for yourself tomorrow just do na jus mot as do something one thing that wel it all builds on each other i we at whatever i but i love you ia ha i tase for gon tod i a i a i d bubut iis to is tad sa co alow e o wit isgoine on what is o et on upa said one twenty six last march tods on the show again this time though he sober he is been to detoxs and moved into a sober living house he refused a good to rehab sui davin chris arrange for him to move into the sober house where cris works in wester massachusetts sont terrily just wake up ta a r ous tra housh il

sober and he never gets it be free never free e it is if you are out there and you think you cany get away with it you might not you known't a mean in you gi should really fucking now that it can all in somehow after twenty years of heavy drug ews david never had a close friend die from an overdose tod as his first one it changeis things for hand before he laugh at the wors stories all these absurd situations and bad decisions that should kill you but did not he would had the upper hand but now he did not any more those things had killed one of his best friends dav as a one who introduced chrisan tod they were not close friends but even still dave thinks chris is a little cold about his deat and dave nosus is unfair but he fells a little resentful towards cris tod was in chris's sober living facility right before he died why did not he look out for him better tod's death last summer just tappens to coinside with an up taken downloads on dopy in july thei'r downloads double when

show on line without bleeping out dave's last name dave was pissed he wented an fixed it but inadvertantly inserted ten minutes of silence into the middle of the episode which made chris mad that monday their fighting over tex message all day dave could not make sense of what was going on with chris he told chris it was fine if he did not wanta do dopy any more but chris said no that was not it at all he loved meaking dopy dave believed him but meanwhile hris was aso fighting with anny she' left their apartment and went to stay with her parents chris was distraught crying he asked dave to

dopy together they would never mis a show dev thught if he skipped this week he would be letting the dopy nation dow he be your drug dealer not showing up an besides drugg users should know if somebody dies from a dug over dess three days after chris's death he recorded that episode of dopy and he calles anny a i youron th your ha at you are no on the show a h a i i feelin a e er they start to piece together the mistery of chris's death david completely mis red his behaviour in rettresbact he was probably high in the last episode of dopy he was probably high when he made that we ad phone call to his sponsor he was probably even high on the ardy lying episode david been operating off the wrong story that chris was not interested in dopy any more but anny had not she had noticed the strange ways chris had been acting he kept taking the dog for walks for instance when the dog did not need go out he as staying up all night and sleeping during the day she got suspicious he was youa ing again she and chris's sister arranged for surprise drug test on monday a gy showed up at their apartment and did a saliva test that night any told him she was going to stay with her parents chris left before her mamarrived to pick her up now she realized it was because he could notwait any longer to get high anny slepted her parents house and went to work the next morning but soon after she went home to check on chris an i don' n yo wa i a ari o on a i w wat wain oa a mit a mi your a a ot not you might as wyat i i wa an a i er a a a a a i e an a a e tere e aer a a a a up o a a a a aa bai

system he was thirty three years old soon after a packat derived for him at their apartment he was filled with drugs purcsette coqane cracocane peroin any scouered the apartment in chris's car she found a bunch of drug pair finalia needles some of which were used and clean p hed ordered on line also she found a small medicated patch that was not in any packagay she sent a picture of it a dave they could not be sure thut dave thought it was probably fetinel anny is a theory about chris's relapse he had recently injured himself doing a high corrati kick to try to impress her something in his leg popped he was in terrible pain the doctor he saw was not his regular doctor and she thinks criscop pan killars fold himself into thinking he could just take them for the pain and stopp there if anny's theory is rate thand chris started using again two weeks after tod's dest and was dead three weeks later i mean that when when the news came i i got angry about it and thand the next morning i woke up and tham and i felt the day at between the last time i had spoken to him and i mean i felt the distance and is it just felt it was becoming real and then this morning i woke up and i could hear his voice in my head we went we were doing this shell i could hear his voice and that and then i cana woke up and it was another day since i had spoken to him and it just an it is it is liquid becoming solid an i mean in it sart you move away from this liquid feeling to this cold solid truth that he is never gen to come back and and it is over dave hangs up with anny i know his got at ind this episote of dopy without chris for the first time just and et to wa be always andnd will say a stay strong dobunation and tam i said i would never say this but a chris is dead i'll say tutles for chris and that we love you and that everybody out there please try to take care of yourself dave still makes stoby by himself now he is pulling in bigger guests that the commedian mark maron and the rapper killer mike he gets about six thousand downluds and episode now this not the same show toby as the necian knew it is gone along with chris it is not a body comedy any more t's more of a straight interview show there a few or wore stories and when there are the tone is different dave is different this his one moment in episode one forty two the last episode dav in christed together that i keep thinking about chris a displayed a voice mell from a listener name mike who tells a story about hiding his p in the closet of his bedroom somportant wide and afterwards they get into a conversation about whether it is ocay o laugh at drug stories in the first episodes of doby dave was a solid yass on that thowas the whole point of the shew but now they flip sides chris says yes it is fine to laugh and dave says this i in it o but thi o at an in mg it ma may it migh be be and in dobe ray ci it dout i i gat eoi i de gi e mike every one laughing ab everything there doin and then main is drat dat but what tat be wat tit wat that morbid reality the hie oy da o do i i it monyi tin e year i wony i tin a it it e tere but mi it mag laughing on the drain at an tauhing te puggy dray i be morbid reality that a horseno a i ta at u know we laugh on the train tract but we have the right to laugh on the dre jact it be much dippit it omon at never struggle in the trut is that when we were struggling the person who ul tolla story that wul terrify in laugh at it might have a better chant at reaching out an getting it that han the person is marpit reality i get ye re atabll i e gt ay wy be in i ta a that li man we laugh at ta i gi won throw it out here an i an tain a migh gi be dat be gi migh to youtin i in i tat no everywhere and killing everybody thats not ta o t a now of course sol dave told me he always thought doby was good for him in chris for their sobriety he thought their creation would protect them but it did not chris is gone doby it turns out was its own worse story playing out week by week now on the show dave's mission his changed the dug stories are not just in service of a laugh now there in service of an urgent message you could died tod died chris died you could die thenachevis is one of the proes of our shew the doby podcast an you can find in wherever you get your podcast coming out what happens when you go on the radio and make fun of a militant

station an washing in d c a p f w a great station that really did reflect the community a deacy was two thirds african merican back thand and and also hat emigrants from all over the world and the most pop u wishor in the station i member was the bama hour was goning jury washington whowould placeins and talk a lat about his knees there were caribian incentral merican shows hit was a show made by arranians who missed the former shaw of ram and then another show with a raniants who hated the former show of a ram therewas a clin poetry show listen is wo callin and read the ron pams and it was daily this was a daily calln poetry show that in my memory anyway never seem to have any kind of trouble getting cours that is communy radio wit this nextoryis about somebodys sitting up a station that a community station only the doing it in a worzown in syria in small town called cafranbell that is cafranbells spelled with kay in the north west part of the country not far from the turkish border rural town sined by all of trees in fig trees threy thousand people wire there i promised eight years now a caframbos ben in a kind of no man's land where it different factions afad and now militant istleness are in charge reput a dan a bullute i heard about the station years before she ever listened to it i crossed paths with the founder of the sation bachwhen i was covering the warren syria for the walstre journal his name is rad rad fadis he lives in cafdanben we never met in person i was based across the border and lebanon because american press was mostly not allowed in syria but when the regime struck a town near cafdanbid or isis was advancing and i needed to know the details from the ground we in my colleagues would pull out our giants spread shee of contac and go through them rades was one of those names id skype him to confirm a death counts or verify a location then move on rades was an activist before the radio sation he was sort of famous for these banners these home made signs written in big block letters on white sheets he would bring them to protests post pictures of them on facebook and twitter i always saw them in my feets they were witty this one from thanksgiving a holiday syria does not celebrates black friday special offer whoever wherever you are bring your enemy and come to fight in syria for free limits ad time offer one of the most viral of these was after catlan gener announced her new name katlan spells with ha sea and not a kay the other women's names in her family rides gave her this shout ou kateland he writes spelling it with a sea we would write cafenbid with a sea if it ment you we could be free i knew rides had his own radio station radio fresh though i never tunes in back then but around thanksgiving last year i heard rads had been killed ihat me harder than i expected saddened by the news i listened for the first time you can stream radio fresh on soun cloud there is hours and hours of programming listening through was reliving the war from the inside seeing it in a totally different way from deep in the small town was incredibly alive hiper local sometimes utterly ordinary people complaining about their neighbours but other times radical i could not believe they got away with it here is an example of that one of the first things i heard thi satire programm called coedi sid at es back stage with the president where an actor an personating president bu shaded assaid has made up conversations with an officer in his army bao for sh the fubon oyrua ewen gosiesiv o oo o o labyad whatl i ca o woan ade o the wele te de e we that theactor making fun of the president slisp which is very pronouncet hese pretty sfodon alo e th fo to e the a o tefole te e hfol e bepo e i was shocked when i first heard this impression my newjeur creaction was o my god how did you not go to jail for this because in the pas that is what would have happens befor re listening to radio fresh i had literally heard of two other places in the whole air world where any one had tried to do political satire one was lebenon wramfrom and the other egypt where for a while told the government ran ham out of the country they had their own version of john stoar and now there were these guys out of a small town in northern serio it completely blew my minds i talked to a bench of rads friends an kafenben they told me he was always a rebel before the uprising against the syrin egime he would curse the president and away no one else dared he mocked religious figures too his cousin told me this always made peoples super nervous every one in town knew him as the guy who got kicked out of met scol trades was a burly guy in his mid forties clean shaven warm eyes mischievous face he was sharp taught hmself english rana thriving small business one of his best friends hadiab dela told me how rad strarted the radio station be gan i is te do a the omca thatsots in almosks they have that speakers these are the speakers for the call to prayer five times a day at one points early in the war the syrian military showed up in kaftenben and started shooting protestors rades wanted to get those soldiers to the fect he loaded up a bunch of recortings on a ues pes stic and had some friends at the mosque blast them over those speakers anti regim slowgans and is on you parcadion is on ons that in con thet is he misstaking you is he mis using you is hemiskilling yo family then noters he everybody is sevinin hiu the hol be la a to te tot o a te te tak abo ot te and that yeso from hou and that was why my lmitting himself to moscolmy why do not he start a radio station weri could to just tak to people mon in i e a ao otyou shortly after when rad found himself meeting with international groups including the ue state department he pitched them his idea for a radio station there are always opportunities in war and this one would be an unusual chance to push back on the rules make fun of people they could have never made fun of befor and opportunity to blast out ideas free speech d democracy to whoevortuned in to ninety pino i fo that that o yohow a an e than omen le es be in i san since on who e i tohot ma gin e fonin as on e this is a clip from the station's first few weeks on her august twenty thirteen rado fresh was based out of an old government building and cafdenbin the studio was done up with shiny purple curtins first sound proofing there was an ask tray on the table and loks of smoking while they were on the mike the host whose talking about how to form neighborhood counsils has a thick local accents one of my favorite things about radio fresh it sounds ruron a slangy home grons en te atore eetinin ta iyon an gated e will not lasson in while i was trarmed by the station from the very first clip i heard the people it was actually made for the citizens of caftenben many of them were against it in the beginning here is rads himself on the second anniversary of radio fresh one of the rare times he actually went on er i wull be te ate tf the you have in nole to ge ben i must seted ly settle yu have lo you mus e nat o wusy i dan os what with you lav i he ou a we u as you mus e e must ehe saying in the beginning there was a lot of talk about how the money for the radio would have been better spent on aid for families in need people were hungry they dan't have clean water or electricity it seemed extravagance and frivolous to spend money on a radio sho but prettyerly on the station came up with a programm that became indispensable throughout the village it was called the observatory radio fresh put twenty four seven watchmen and tall buildings to keep an eye out for air strikes as soon as they saw one they radioed into the station which would interrupt programming on say the natritional benefits of lettes then w da we a blotn and the have al ma y on adae why am nat with an air rate sirinupsid bess tat tan tas a lofyat yo t fom belat dud betoted they are saying plains are circling over caftanbe rad's response to the doubter is wise the radio is not frivolous it is about saving lives a abats is a is a te wi le o yon as ta ha a chahus we hav te begon beg he sayin if these erstrike warning saves even one life that would be worth the whole cost of the station before the observatory people used to jerry rag their own version of thes alert system buying a walky talky and eavesdropping on the regimes frequencies it was expensive over a hundred dollars and parents hated how much the regime thugs would swear and cuss on the frequency they did not that the kids overheard the observatory was a clean version for the cost of a basic radio five dollars the airade warnings they were just one of a sle of superpractical you live in a warizon and hears how to survive kind of programms there is a medical show that teachers people how to administer firstsa or wthat show has episodes on chemical burns men in jid us and kids how to treat head injuries and that is to bet would would giser see i don duma or undevahol mases here the hostess saying when you think your scoll is broken and when you see blood or a clear fluet coming from your ears or nose get medical hout immediately radio fresh had language learning programms in case you had to flee the country ad that hapi dely be be at be at that hat telyt ge ge ge ea pas theyr during the alfabet an this episode of teach me turkish more than three point five million syrian refuges have landed in turkey the last eight years they also talght french english and what i love about these programms is how the people teaching the language are actually not at all fluents in the language their teaching but you can hear how hard their trying thelinas we conto day an sho of tah meenglish every one i talk to about radio fresh brought up this one programm called the complaints show it was radio freshes version of a collin show except they putn't actually have a collin show because the regime had cut off all the phone lines they put up a bunch of little black boxes with a radio fresh sticker on them all around town people would drop in slips of paper with their answers to quit shows their comments and complaints the host would choose one complaint ich week to talk about aboaan beocoe te ba mamas sheko often it is very specific stuff at one points early on a faction set up shop inside a school building using it as ha police station arents were worried about sending their kits to school in a building shared with criminals and feevesplus the police station made the school and easy target for the regime we parents told the rebels thir concerns but nothing happens they turned to radio fresh as tat tsh a women materma n te had mahamahow le mafaa shalyto mos youould de shee ma desaa an at wa banen o menha te is an asamanmontit to day we have a complaints that tere is a police station in the same building as a school and that the broad caster says to fives logic again here

school please te the families we are going to leae the place we do not want any the trouble against us wacanon mafam tem andthey did the empty their police acion from old emiitan seuity people complained about the price and qual y of their bread some one brought up their neighbour using a hole in the front yard as a bathroom while his actual bathrom was broken the neighbor heard the episode and fixed his toilet when i first heard the complains show it felt pretty familiar we had a similar programme in lebena although not quite a small towni as the neighbors toilet but listening hour after hour would i realize was that this complaints show was doing something besides solving practical local problems it was also spreading a revolutionary idea that you could voicour concerns and hold people accountable and get results the guys at the station confirms this was at s original mission for the show this in a place where the rules were recently non negochabl and who just had to keep your head down and deo with it the complaints shw was just one of the many programmes debates kits shows a series on thesnam doing this kind of work one problem people had with the station from the beginning was tht it was funded by the americans which in the middle of a war where the uess was not being particularly helpful was not a good look it is true almost all the money for the station has come from the ouestate departments it is around forty thousand dollars a month these days which covers the salaries of fifty three people it is a pretty big operation when listeners accuse thes station of being a mouthpiece for the americans rad was happy to address at head on this is him on the ar ale edbus he te a bes mad you son sone she becas lem i gin ol belame mul gi o weon wigales of emagin he says the respons is very simple have you heard anything on rado fresh that sounds were supcording the americans we are always trying to prod them on the radio with our banners we have opinions about them and we do not hide them rades vision of democracy meant every one in caffrenbid had an equal sayin what was happening including women he wanted their voices on the radio to although that was such a daring idea for cafrenbid even his friend hadi wondered whether it was possible let them looke nos a caw all aden ye muso as a a easil fine women we hide in we train this was bold because almost no women in the village worked outside the home they took care of the kids and the homes that was it ander was bold because of who was running caffrenbid at the time rad was always offending the local leaders including just about every one who was in charge of cafrenbid over the last e years first the frecerian army was offended by a banner they came to the radio station an kid nap to guys next icis attack the station in twenty thirteen couple weeks later they shot rad multiple times almost killing him but when rade was deciding to put women on the air in twenty fifteen two years after radio fresh had started caferenbid was run by a new extremistis lemiscrupno sta an ca does branch in seria rad knew they would not this but he went for it anyway awhatta eo be watii e as

religious police rushing people to the moss without actually understanding the rules of prayer nosta assigned people to listen to radio fresh and shifts they issued regular warnings and threats to the station whenever they heard something thein at now radio fresh got a lot of warnings for having women on eir nosta considered their voices shameful a form of nakedness finally in january twenty

beter tan o we were having he meeting wan he came when he told us tat they wanted to transform our voices now we wok in at you something to change our voices from female voices to male and that you would not be able to tell that it was a female in the first place i to amomen o o wo oo e e o e on eo e on o emenon when we first heard what our voices sounded we were laughing and it was strange cause we were really thisses what peopleing in a listen to but after a while it just became normal and at i little get to the point where i could tell you which girl was which voice ba a haea ye but these days hipbojust feels annoyed at the voice and because the voice is hart to listen to radio fresh fordused how long women speak on the air to a fraction of what it was by this pastfall the essaid regime had retaken swasts of the country and in many other places including caftenbid extremests nosta were gaining power people raids people who did not want asaid or the extremists they barely held any ground and finally around thanksgiving rad was assassinated i read the news in a tweet and later heard the whole story he was in a car with two colleagues from the radio station it was around noon a van pulled up next to them and shot and killed raid and his friend hamuchnade then drove off while nosto never claimed responsibility for the assassination the whole town blamed them every one i knew who had reported on syrio was talking about raid that day posting pictures of him riting that his death was the end of the syrian revolution because rade was one of ta handful of people on syria who was still living by the principles of the revolutin he was still talking about non violent resistance and democracy civil society and freedom ride was there from the very first protests in seria and struck by his principles while many others either died or fell off the train now he too was gone hipbo got the news over what sap a waser that wevat an ritis ti at hany mabna haise ever that at that point i just was not aware of anything any more i never though that moment was cannacom wa an ta hidan not a te ri not i can na had a dot i never imagine that some one ride can guy no he would be he would be one of the ones that stayed the funeral lasted three days hundreds of people came there were programmes on radio fresh remembering raids and hamuns their childhoods talking to their friends chatting about their legacy after rad's death you can still hear glimpses of radio freshas classic dark humor they continued to make fun of the president an the local factions here is a radio drama about a local guy partitioning his house in cafanbed to host's refuges eedcada yo coctada cai ton ass da eee tahame but these refugees are not this play syrian women and chiltren it turns out no he wants the host french people fleeing their own country after the yellow best protests an particular peautiful french women maria toliwime enoe e tery o o e da e ga da we mary sonia amily sleeping in the streets not on my watch i found the episode hilarius a siin that rad spirits wo as well in a live ot radio fresh i wonder it a frads friends hady felt the same way do you still feel that you still feel that at their radio station o ocat he i do not think things would be to say again an spite old miim we we wer trying to manufacturea lag but ohaso i te sayca sa aryou i dontot be pecimisli but this is the truth there is a talk that rads gave two years ago at the oslow freedom for him es lito fiis will you a you fish he opens with fotage of the afstermouth of a boming describing the smell of burned bodies of guns the audiences rapts and rad descripin with foutho but he also looks very tired of trying to convince these westerners and peaceful norway to care about the more than five hundred thousand syrians who have died in this conflict and the millions that remain aand yet there he is he had not given up te wi yo as wele ah te ca tao wil cao wi te a wi te clote shama he

the mentgar shorsponserbaspress vupien protect our on my pravcy today expressbe pianza cam slashmen a pegrom is to find as an organized massacre typically of jews pegroms have ben unleashed on the jewish community across the world over generations by a wide variety of groups spanish muslims in al ondolus in ten sixty six french and german crusaders in the rhine linen ten ninety six cossacks in the seventeenth century and cominitski the largest pegrum was of course the holicost whill since the holicos the largest pegrum against jews took place on october seventh of this year when some one thousand five hundred is railies were murdered by comas terris since that pegrum we have been told by our great thinkers the comasas brutality requires context tnever mind that body camfootage from comos terroris reportedly included footage of comas killing a father putting the father's baby in an actual oven and then burning its death and repeatedly raping the mother while all this went on according to our suito intellectuals commoss terrorists invading peaceful villages and slaughtering babies and raping women and shooting entire families they were not sruly engaging in a pegrom they were in the words of somewhat columbia university professors engaging in a military action they were in the words of some of our suito intellectuals engaged in a project of decolonization no sa many of our thinkers the commoss pagrum was not really aby killing jews it was actually about settlemens in judaan simaria the west bank thi's about the break down of negotiations with the palysinian authority the massacres where anti israel they were antizianist not antismetic and yet the pegroms against jews continue on sunday mobs of angry procomoss pagrumasts stormed the airport in the russian republic of dagastan looking for jews apparently they got word of a flight that would been schedual to land from telovegers were look the giant crowd out and front of the airport screaming breaking into the airport is they got word then flight from israel was arriving you see the huge mob of people outside the tairort storming the arport an se members of military members the police looking on doing nothing as this happens the mobs broke into the apwhere they ran rough shod through the airport more footage of this the huge crowds people carring pousing in flags rushing through the airport again looking to get to the tarmac where this flight was supposedly landing from telamies oun hear the aloguac pires of course som eighty three per cent of dagastan is moslem and practice they are literally going to the doors looking for jews trying to break through doors looking for jews right own is what pegrums look there running through the airport into trivate areas of the airport obviously people telling them their no jews here does matter ther stolooking and then they would finally make their way out on to the tarma ac and a they are looking for jews an mean they te ot partictatly smart some of them are looking for jews in the actual engine which yould be a weard placed it i fine the jews tguise thisin't the evacuation of have ganistandor anything but they were not being particularly shyd about what they were doing in the words of this particular pegron perpetrator he was there to kill jews me yes some wiry herehe says i came for the jews ec yes te killas and i connecticentys well you care the the night these are chillen show me the nighwhy did you come here ya sishu youiay machine gon a came here for the jews din you yes o stay here till morning understand the bagrummas also held signs reading we are against jewish refuge es and child killers have no place in tagastand accordig to the moscow times local media report that some of the bagramas rashly stopping cars outside the areports to quote checke the personal identification documents of drivers and passengers as they searchd for is raily citizens among the motors an in fact you can see this mob going around rocking cars they attack to bus as well here they are grabbing a car rockan backin fort that is actually a police car and they are rocking back and forth loot's a delightful group of people the people who think just you obviously they also attack tobos their children on the bus here're no jews anywhere here by the way does not matter the mere rumor of junus sent them in to a spasm of violence en mout children the bus are trying ton they are looking on wondering what the hll is going on mobs a round tagastan have been going round hotels looking for jews trying to break into rooms owe the rles doing hotels that you nothey were literally checking people's cars they wre aski them for i dee papers to show that they were not jewish ftey're asking people for their passports 's thin cn see their paper now dagastans population is largely muslim theye been raticalized for years heyn raticalized both by their authorities and by their religious leaders the bagrums areare not going to end in dagastand all over the world demonstrares are appeering by the hundreds of thousands baying for jewish blood here for example is footed from london over the weekend this is one hundred thousand people walking through the heart of london chancing slogans antismetic slogans about the slaughter of jews look at the size of this crowd isyere all people imported to the west under the thezar misimpression that all culturers are the same and everyone will be equally likely be an excellent western civilet and citizen some of te rlliers we are chancing here' some of some some here isfrom the raliers in trafal ar square and i will inform you at their chancing theyare chancing a hibar hibar yayahood what is that mean that is they sloggan referencing at mahammeds slaughter of the jews of hibar a city in the coran again that is in the mddle of london here they are again in london chancing about the love of martyr them theyare chancing here by sol and blood we sacrifice ourselves for you aoxa it' in the middle f wester hav the thing with our blood we will liberate aloxa never mind the fact the alox an mas a son of control the s lon iguak an israel that tis matter at all now here is the story the story te jewish people it is a story of pegrums from pharo to hayman to comass weare told in the aftermaf of the worst progrmmin history the holicos that the world would never allow it again never again we are til well it turns out that much of the world was just line long as the proposed pegrums our company by some political context but grums against the jews are just fine not only are they find natinally have to continue in fact israel a state created with the explicit promise to protect to jews against such pegrums must allow such progrums to continue in the name of human rights that is why the international cmmunity right nows calling for a sease fire against comas bhecause too much of the international community fifteen a hundred jews slaughtered for the crimobine jews they do not count the jewish state and the jews have to just absorb at that loss will pretenlecan never happen those dat they are gone and forgotten all that was three weeks ago guyses who was three weeks ago the baked babies and the rabked women and the kidnappet whe're still under te tender mercies of comass tisrael has to leave comos in place in the name of humanity in the ame of the children after all if the jews were not being quite upity in their own self defense would jews be targeted in tagastan ain reality the progrums never went away they were just minamized because the state of israel and its allies were considered strong but now israel and its allies they seem week they seem vulnerable in the aftermath of october csevent and jewhators now believe the jews everywhere are vumerbol and here is the thing jews everywhere we will be vulnerable long as israel and the west are week hin just the secon we will show how how week th west is and that they are literally yoing propagand afforts in the media i'm behalf of comas to truly is an amazing thing to watch first pure talk recently announced they would alleviate ten million dollars in veteran debt by veterans day thanks your support last week they are seventy four per cents that goll with two weeks to go think about this the just military is made up of one hundred percent volunteers these are men andwomen who willingly sacrifice everything they have for the country and when they are non serving they re turn home to a tight jobmarket outrageous living expenses theis why i'm happy a private company puretock has jumped in to help when you switch to pu r tolks lightening fasfigy notwork they will donate a portion of every new order to this noble cause can make a real difference just by

towernetwork is one of big guise their coverage is great plaster saving money plas our opping out veterans there is a lot they are alike but ta pure toktok kom slashor puro tody to get started thit is pure talk dot cam slash chipiro today the reason why the wes is proceved as we is least in part because of the media mean truthfully speaking met the western media the're justagarbacy they will ad mit the truth but in back handed fashion for example right now we keep peering about the plate of te poor palistinian people living in gaza and yes they have a horrible plate it it turns out that it is terrible to live under a government the elected that tobunch of terrists it turns out that this a really really terrible thing tnobody seems to care about that for solidly twenty years and then the minute that comas launched the most murderous attack unchues since rael or too and then israel retaliated suddenly be comes israel's responsibility to protect comases civilians he hers the thing american civilians theye are the responsibility of the american government british civilians there a the responsibility of the british government and comasivilians are the responsibility of the comascoverment to what exactly is comas doing for its own svilins the answer of course is nothing the nera times which has been covering for kcomas throughout this conflict printing actual propaganton behalf of komas including the li that these ralyies killed five hundred people at a hospital when it turns out that it was a mis fired palistinian is lomacihot roket that may be killed a couple dozen people andwe on't even know that becuse is comas getting the stat l it the same year times the prince awful idiotic columns by people nicholas kristov to nicholas kristov has a pece to day called we are over paying the price fra sin we did not comment andthat is a quote from palastinians and here is what nicholas kristov says moral idiot in nicholas kristov a person who again you want a show your neck to terras is a great way for the west to do it f the most consequential decision israel will face in the coming dayss how hard to continue hitting gaza should not undertake a month's long ground invasion continu with large skilled arael bombarment allow fuel inso gosip keep hospital's running over the lass we gi've spent reporting in israel and westbank i've tried to listen and learn to f respall we shoul note he is not reporting from gaza wise nicholas kristovnot porting from gaza because comas controls gaza comas controls gaza all they do is allow you to report what they want you t report but he is a happy to run round israel mubrum let me sher wy believe sudden thay willook back at this moment an yep profound moral and policy failure says nicholas cristov what exactly is the profound moral and polacy failure the profound moral and policy falure is not stopping the jews from defending themselves he says to conclude his column quote the united nations secretary gernal antonial glutenas has condemne what h called clear violations of international humanitarian law we are w nssing in goza the bid administration which in the contect tof your cran constantly speaks oventer national law fuder to security council resolution calling for humanitarian pauses to deliver ad every accounts i've heard from gaza this past week including directly from people thate who despise komas suggest the civilian tole has been herendus one gages that at least fifty three you an staff members ha been kilsto fir in cluding teachers and engineer a psychologist and a gyna cologist and now the suffering in gaza is set to get much worse that is partly because hospitals are runnig out of deasal fuel and israel is not allowing feel into the territory i understand the reason says nicholas khristov come oss cuit us easal fuel for its attacks on his railies and israelitary in israilly military spokesmen also told me the ou an alarmist may be exaggerating the sorages however says at nicholas cristov israel faces an agonizing it challenge a neighboring territory is rule by well armed terroris well committed unimaginable attrocities amdicment more and now shelter and tunnels beneath the population more than two million people it is a nightmare but the sober question must be what policies will reduce the rist not in flaman whele honoring the intrinsic value of palisinian life as well as this railia life people wint answer that question in different ways says moral exumplar nicholas kristov and i do not claim to have all the answers but i think some that we will look back in wor at both the comosspbutchery an israel and at the worsenin teblo of suffering and goza in which we are complicit you see according to nicholas khristov the wast in allowing israel to kill terrorists yin saying that israel should in fact wipe komosovf the map is just as bad as koms pure moral equivalence who loves that stuff love that comas commoth who loves it they love it because cares literally zeroe about palisting into villions come os the on't care at all about them but they know that you care about them and if the idea is that they get to survive by abusing their

goza please save us from this horror i cract there is literally no mention of anything commostate in this piece nothing zero mention of it and theourare times printed it becaus of course the idea is that israel is responsible for everythng that is going on in the gozesstrip which presumably is also by the united nations as i've said before the most isoly of international politics o wretched hive of scumman villany voted a hundred and twenty in favor fourteen agains forty five abstentions in favor of a seas fire that would only benefit commas that is literally the the result of this by the way some of your favorite moral nations you crane abstained you crane which demanded that israel hand over iron dnome to it ou crane abstained from this particular vote meanwhile while begging an american

you have not heard the story because not important to you an's on important tuke as not importan t the media because i does not involve the jews that is the way that let us be real others that is why people care if this involves muslem on muslem issues no one cares noine cares that there've been several million syrian refugees who have been shuttled back and forthing torky and seria for yours knon cares about that no one no one cares that hundreds of thousands of syrions of villing to ben killed by the asoterishing in fact brokalom pretended to care that he carre little that he handed it over

when one get involved in that that whole problem of an ias lonactoc tatorship that maskerades his democracy when one won woning but when it comes to israel if to be oh that that is when that is what human rights concerns rt their apaxas when the jews respond the violence against the jews and as i say comos could not be more excited about this because they are very clear about wha they wanted do and one te most amazing things thet homases using sto its own benefit ise the paternalistic sens that westerners have about third rolders i mean really is an amazing thing they are people t at the comas tu says out loud over and over and over we do not care about our sivelins we want our sivllins to die weare planting tunnels beneath ours t they tait out loud all the time every day andt what is is well but really you carabackar svillings and if something bas happening to this villions probably its the jews probably it is the jews i mean here is is mile honean hanea is the political leader of cmmass he is living in great style and luxury over in cotar where he and his group have embessled hundreds of millions dollars from their own citizens and here he is saying what we actually need is the blood of more women in children that is what we need e howsays to stop this war against our children women and the elderly a yotha armasses are universities in our home sin a is grutal aggression must stop off him this new hallo coss mustup by the gall of these people a ee iave said this before and i say again m ae blood of the women on showsren and eldern all i am not saying that this plood is calling for your helt we are the ones to meed this dan we need this blood m to wakens within us the revolutionary spirit they need more blood they they need to awaken their own revolution they need dead kids they need dead women in order toawaken their own revolutionary spirit and they will achieve it according to the nearer times is an amazing piece from the nearatimes over the we gant quote as gozens it s croungs for food and water comass sits on a rich trov of supplies quot at supplis of virtually every basic human necessity dwindlin gozip one group in the besieged on clave remains well stocked commass arab and lestern officials say there is substans to his raily claims of comas stockpilling supplies including desperately needed food and fuel comass has hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for vehicles and rockets cassures of ammunition explosives in materials to make war stockpous of food water and medicine according to officials as senior labinese official seid comas which is astimate ed to numbe between thirty five thousand and forty thousand people has enough stockd away to keep fighting for three formonths without resupply the arab and lestern officials who described comases supplis situation spoke on condition of an inimity becaue theye were disclosing in formtion glean from human sources the stockpus are typically kept under ground and caution that precise details on comssspplies were difficult to come by whele the blockade is left gossis roughly two million people scriping by with what little food and water they s grounge up it does not appear to have begun to great comasses ability to fight the supply situation speeks to the relative cophistication of comass as a fighting force and here is the key sentene from the nearatimes it is just an amazing incredible sentence quote yet with gozens facing humanitarin catastrophe comssa stockpous raise questions about what responsibility if any it has to the civilian population why would that possibly raise question wet e mean what responsibility do they have to they are the governing party in the goso strip that is saying america during war time this raises questions about what responsibility america has to its own citizens for their safety a you mean that is literally why the government exists hon it comes to comas its easy to be at terras man when you are terrace you can reat murder kill your own citizens put them on top of your own bombs and the rest of the world apparently jus goes well you now that raises some questions about your responsibility bod in the andwer no blame the jews in the anwer to blame the jews masa said little of its supply situation but the goverment runs in gazas as it has an emergency fuel stu stockpitots quickly being to pleaded those fuelstock pos are separate from and far smaller then the two hundred eleven thousan to two hundred sixty four thousand gallons of gas and veasal these rallytmilitary says comas has on hand and by the way everybody understands the comas is stealing everything that goes into the gazes trip this notion that israel sending an aid the death not going to take macomaste lie of course it can be taken macamas and that is what cmas has been doing for literally decades another piece in the last few days from enbi sinews quote the unemployment ratein gazeis forty seven per cent more than eighty per cents of its population lives in poverty coms however has funded an armed force of thousands equipped with rockets and drones and built a vast web of tunnels under gaza estimates of its danuel military but tot range from a hundred million dollars to three hundred and fifty million dollars as the os hous an sentt will be asking in separate hearings wednesdayand thursday where does all that cash come from comas has filled its coffers with hundreds of millions in internashional aihd olvert and coverd injections of cashomaran and other ideological partners much of the public much ofthe money is public and legal including large financial aid from catar via the un by the way how much money does comas have on hand hundreds of millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars maybe billions one thing reported here by enbsinews is that comas has a wide portfolio that they really diversified comases leadership has invested its income in an international investment portfolio worth five hundred million dollars in real estate and other assets from companis n owguria souty sunan turkey and u a which you used to conceal ind wander its money according to treasury announcement comasassa supplements its in come with various criminal enterprises for example comas has a presents n the trie border area of south america oregin along brazil potoguay and argentina known as a haven for terras an transnational criminal organizations there comase participates in drugs arm and people smuggling naturally this is all israel'sfall right israel the veceas fires that israel can take care of the hmanitaryan situition now i just have a question please name the last war a war for the survival of the state please name the last war in which the chief question was what happens to the civilians where under the control of the opposing side did you hear this at all in the afromathanane eleven how to we open a humanitarian corridor to cobble do you hear this during the warnrock how do we open a humanitarian corridor into bagdad whar was the first order of business you destroy their capacity to make war if you wish to win a war that is the only thing that you can do but again the goal is not here to protect palstonians villins an an becaus again none of these groups of cared about the predations against palstonians village for twenty years the goal here is to use the palstoning cevillians lay comas wants than us as pressd to stop is ral from deposing comas it is that simple that is all that is happening n will that case is taken the form of large scale ralleys ba ock by your favorite left wing sources sremember that time when now everyone on the left suggested that if you said the name george soros this meant your an antisemi it did not meanyour an antisema george soros is terrible he is a terrible person who believes terrible things and funs terrible clauses according to the neropos george soros has funnlefd more than fifteen million dollars since twenty sixteen to groups behind pro palistinen protests where demonstrarers openly cheer comas an neuro post examination of open society foundations records the records shows sors is grand making tatwork gave thirteen points seven million dollars though the tides center a deep pocket had left the avocsy groups sponsering several mone profits hoave justified comas while clemming palistinians obsessed with the eradication of the gewers state are the real victims tides men officiaries include illinois based adalla justics project which the day of te october sevn massacr posted a photoon istogram of a buldos or tearing down part of israel's bord fence and a capture quote is raily colonizers believed they cand in definitely trapd two million people in an open oir prison no cage goes unchallenged and this s george soros's money george jos is given money to gewish voice for peace and if not now both ratical left wing organizations that do not represent jues in any serious way and side with comas criticizing george soros is not only not antisemitism it is filo semitism because he backs every antisometic caus that apparently he can find if you are wondering by the way how these

energizing solid stuff happening over at cornel universities well agan ar are universities garba chaps they continued to be garbaci te con the international level one of the reasons wire seeng much internatinal suport for comas is because their regimes that see backing commass as a way to strike against the western colision particularly the united states comas's leadership by the way openly admitsthis komas their leader thanna masha told the egyptiansto the quot russia benefited from our attack becase we diverted the americans attention from them and ukrane they said the will teach the octobersem of thettack in their military academies the chinese seditomado andthey will do the same thing to tiwant again weakness in the face of terrism breeds contempt from the world worst worst people meanwhile china his looking to intervene they have ratured up the antisemitism on places tiktoc china daily rand an editorial on monday declaring the united states was put on the wrongside of history in gaza it said washington was exascerating conflict by blindly backing is ralluan we seen this movi again is exactly what happened in the nineteen sixties after the sixtay war during the sixday war these sovie union flipped on israel between forty and sixty seven their kinopro israel becaue they kinopho may be israels can be a social estate it was not and then when a pan arab movement rose up to try and destroy the state of israel the soviets cided with the panaro movement in a hope to trin freed a lion sis in oil access for the soviet union and they started propagating the mith tat israel was in actual colonial expant extension as opposed to a decolonization effort by the indigenous jews you are same the same thing now they sicly at for strategic reasons russia and china are trying to ally themselves with aran and with terro grups across the region and with radicalized muslims world wide whos whosigin and influential commentator in former editor in chiefs of the lobal times which is the communist party newspaper responded who hawkish statements from an israily minister directed a cusbalaran quote o calm down is rellanwordial whipe the earth out of the solar system again china is not being shy about who they back in this particular conflict meanwhile fladneraputent is literally hosting commas at the kremlin he sees a an avenue for exasterating tentions in the region may be drawing american resources awave from ukrane and torwhat is going on in themiddle east and puten personally met with the leadership of komas at the kremlin meanwhile over in turkey erdawan resiptype erdawan who is the dictator of turkey heis now threatening to declar war on israel and send the military to gaza that is not going to happen by the way but he is threatening it the reason he is threatening that obviously's becauseyou would to be part of this russian chinese acciss than is forming up in the adaeleast here is t e some pictures of a rallyg an istonboull obviously

slashmen start getting helthier with bon charge produst bon charge sho con slash men use coban save fifteen per cent off keen meanwhile on the presidential side of the i the republican party continues to have a a pretty not contested primary mean if you look at the pulling date outright now this is not a particularly close election in the national pulling averages and us ben awhile but in the national pulling averages donnal trump is cureltly up fiftey nine to thirteen over ronto san is nicky haly at eight per cent of acromasuommy at fourpoin five per cent in iwa trum rnning a similarly large lead the latest i wa state sixpole has trump up fifty five to seventeen over to santis haily at eleven romasuommy at five scot at four well the field needs to consolidate because the reality is that trump has such a lar lead right now that and unless there is some sort of consolidation he is just gon a walk through the field pretty obviously whatever else his floibles and given the fact that the world right now is on fire and tha th world was not on fire when donald trump was president his case to be president of the united states agan is pretty easy which is shot the hell up and pointat the guy who is the president again tht's a pretty easy case for donal trum to mak that is seriously all he has to do even if he is bog down now an i was it lissn't i was doubtful that got bog down for with four separate trials over the corsoman election cycle was going to have an amazing shot of victory but i may have under estimated just hav about a president jobidonis o jobidon is really really bad at this and it turns out that he is basely set everything on fire and' donal trumpts walks back into the room donald glover from that out take from from community that meam from comitee walks in everybody's on fire then he might become pres init again well one of the wich the feld is consolatings that my pence has just drop to outso migh pence is really not running a campaign for present he is really running a campaign to justify what he did on january sex which is to stand up for the constitution it mi pence to the right thing on january six he did not have the right or the obligation under the constution of th united states to reject states certified electoral votes thate was not something tha is called for by the constitution of the united states he am was speaking at the anual republican juish convention in wasfagus and he announced that this was not his time he said he isgingto suspend his campagn for present effective to day i'm and then h he gave a bit of speech talking about what he hopes the future of the republican party is in hereis pense will republiccans continue to be the party a the traditional conservatives that is defined our movement ofer the past forty years or will our party foll of the siran song of populism on mord te conservative principles is war rage is in eastern europe and is treel an china continues its provocations in the age of pacific a new populous movement in the republican party says that america should retreat from her leadership pocition turn inward and focassolely on domestic concerns i do not have to tell people gathert here that there are powerful voices within and outside our party that say we have to choose between supporting our allies and solving problems here at home let me say for my heart anyone who says that america cannot solve our problems at home and be the leader of the free world has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on earth thofs pence his case and the reality is that pencehis case has now been taken up by pretty much the entire field and there is that there is a bit of exaggerations down going on inside the republican field there is people whor saying lotheres a lot of isolationis ince had donal trump was not an isolation is president donal trump did not gedison tend into any new wars because he was muscular in foreign policy because if you mast with him you did not know feis nofirements late you he squith him anotn he kills cossemsily money meanwhile he is ot thei cunning teal the souties that is not a not intervention is foreig policy that is a muscular piece of strength foreign policy that is in fact very reminiscent a ronald ragan's foreign policy froe tolk about donal trumping wildly conciliatory toward russia his policies on russia were significantly harsher than barocobomas or rockaba literally cut a deal with ladmer with dmitri medvadav literally on camera in the run up to the twenty twelve election now theat there is a feeligngs had the republican party thits larshly driven by the median by social meedin there' thes huge gapsons from soe foreign policy i i do not think that is actually true and o with that is ad yeel listen i think the pence is a good man i my pence i know my pence and i think that his service to the country was well worth while an excellent as vice president and and yes i think he of course he did the right thing in january of two thousand and twenty one by not delaying the certification of the election illegally artoguize the rest of the show is about to continue right now anicon warmus it will get into the mail

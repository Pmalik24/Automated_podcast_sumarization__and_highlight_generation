new daily wire pluss annual memberships go to daily wide oc comslash subscribe right now to join last night the israilly war cabinet to prove te hostage deal with the terroris group comas according to the israely government the deal will see fifty is railly citizens released mostly women and children in batches of twelve or thirteen per day the prime minister's office has released a full list and that list shows many many young people but their parents still in captivity or dad still in captivity and mom released families destroyed families split and all the rest for each day of such releases israel will pause its current offensive against comas in the gazestrip israel sai it would pause its ere operations for six ours daily in the northern part of the gazes trip that provision was apparently sought directly by ya ya sinoar the head of comas who wants israill u a vs down for that time period to limit israilly surveillent presumably to save his own skin as he tries to escape whatever rathole he is curneltly traptin for its part israel intiscit will still have surveilance capacity without the u a vs comasoill also supposedly allow the international red cross access to the hostages despite the iarces publicly obvious disinterest in such a mission israel wll also releae some one hundred and fifty palistonian terroris are women and miners in other words a democratic government is trading terrorists for innocent women and children being held by a terrorist group israel will also allow additional fuel into gaza presumably to be stolen by comas the deal is supported by thes railly defense forces the shin bet and masad that support led many of the members of the war cabinet to flip from apposing the deal to supporting it according to the times of israel prime minister benjamin intina who further and cisted on the potential release of more hostages a refusal to release terrorius convicted of murder and a commitment by hams to locate the other hostages held by other terro groups in the goza srip that last point is really important there are multible distinct groups in the gozestrip reportedly holding is railys hostage and some of those groups are actually gossen sevilions who participated in the massacre of october seventh according to the times of israel quoting an unnamed to government official quote israel beleefs comas could potentially locates some thirty more is railly mothers and children beyond the initial fifty nd that the haultand fighting could be extended by a day for each group of ten more is railly hostages wh are located and free the israely government released the statement adingquote the israilly government the idea of and security forces will continue the war to return all the abductes complete the elimination of cmas and insure that gosa dies not renew any threat to the state of israel here is prime mnister ninting o who explaining that after this paus of the war to evicerate homas will continue yis bohoos the boy hervers as outside there is lot of nonsente oas havanwy sease fire for the release in the hossages we will stop the war group ati omcoma aten okis o yu as i would to clare by wear at war then m shumo and we will continue to fight mosbomu kama until we reach alla gos colayau sumen te comayosoge the gonboo has in more than oure stages and also in theyre turning of hostages their stages at tan wilmala go in to an reach the absolute victory and until we ring them all back kugon this deal is in fact highly controversial inside of israel there are two separate strains of logic being applied on the one side there are those who believe that as the cord in tightens round comass they will start killing hostages that israel must do what it can right now to free as many hostages as possible before that happens they believe that israel will be able to continue to successfully pursue its long term goal of aratican in camass even if thatcal as made more difficult by commases activities during the pas in fighting there is some evidence to support this idea yesterday for example palsin an islonicche hod released news of the death of one of the hostages which they then promptly plamed on israel procrastinating which is weird because the hostages would not even be in gaza if terrisgroups had not taken them there bring the hosstages home as fast as possible at the lowest possible closs and then destroy camass that is the lodgic of those who support the deal on the other side there are those who worri that hostage deals have always been terrible policy they remember the two thousand eleven geelog shaleet deal in which israel obtained the release of one kidnapped is rally soldier from commas in return for and i'm not reading the statistic wrolg one thousand and twenty seven prisoners including two hundred eighty serving sentences for planning and perpetrating terrorism those prisoners were at the time respossible for nearly six hundred is raily deaths in fact one of the prisoners who was in fact release in that deal was the aya sinoar the current leader of commass who planned october seventh opponents of the deal remember when the authorities told them security an gaza was good enough to withstand the risk s authorities were obviously wrong opponents of te deal wilre most of all tat the current paus will be used as an excuse by the global community to pressure israel for further quartenquote d escalation with a terrorist group that just lauterd twelve hundred is railies and kidnaped another two hundred and forty and pledges to do the same and pledged israel's destruction they worried that as the focush shifts frome of comasses evil to hostage deals there will be a broader effort to leave comass in place such worries are well founded for its part comasses already claiming to have achieved such an end last night is malhanea the political had o comas living at fivestar hotels and cotar released o statemen saing a truce was going to happen the term for truce that hanea used is the same as the term for seasfire coniea hopes this will serve as a propagand o victory telling the radical musle moral the cmass has somehow fought israel to a standstill many in the mediare doing the same allready the mediare using the paus set to go into effect on thursday as an excuse to talk about leaving comas in place politico to day has an article from one colon clark of the suphon group and michael kenny of the university of pitzburg stating thet comass is actually a kind of nice terrorist group that their not isis they have merely territorial gulls they can be negotiated with according to clark and kenniquot unlike isis some of comasigals are actually political and there wo ll be no effect of solutions of the crisis unless it also includes a political resolution that is an absurd contention given the events of october seventh and commosses stated goal ove repeating as many october sevenths as possible and their statagoal of completely destroying the state of israel but commas is playing the game com ossreleast the statemen that at the very end suggested that what they are really looking for is an independent palistinian state with jerusalem as its capital never mind that what they mean by that is the complete destruction of the state of israel they are not looking for a to state solution but that contention that commoss can be left in place is being issued by whide variety of sources as the pause begins dividignatious of the washington post hopes that the hostage deal will provide aquot surprisingly pragmatic formula for easing the conflict expanding into a d escalation of the nightmare presumably somemon the body ministration hop the same that the israelies will simply forget about what commas wants what commas has done what cmmas pledges to du even before the bodies of october seventh have all been buried the white houseis obviously conflicted certain members are standing stalwartly by israel others are fretting over the possibility of aranian a gression in reality if israel leaves commas in place the possibility of regional conflict grows expinentially it is only the impression of his really strength that has prevented a wider regional conflict thus far commas would rearm and clair victory because ballah would be em bolded in israel's north terrorist groups in the west bangth would grow more violent the hothis in yemmon would up the anti the suni countries would shy away from israel and seek their own methods of defents tagainst the shia in cursion preating more opportunities for new clear proliferation aran would grow more aggressive until they have fully developed in newclear weapon at which point pretty much all hel would break loose israel must re establish tdeturrnts and security that is in fact the primary goal hostagees are a coincident goal but they are not in fact the chief goal if israel does not reestablish to turrants in security israel will find itself under violent attack from its enemies every single day the simple fact in the matter is there is no sease fire on the tabl with people who participated in october seventh and celebrated it here for example is some taperom a gosen civilion who participated in the october seventh attacks bragging about at publicly onamut te cos lusgada wat m when he an saying marether w no he is describing members of a family he slaughtered to his family he saying that one of them beg for his life and with slaughtered one was slaughtered in the bedroom the third in the bathroom the excitement unfortunately a huge overwhelming per centage of palistinian arabs are infavor of this sort of activity by polling data seventy five per cent of palistonian arabs supported october seventh ninety eight persenpiloy hate america this means that israel simply cannot allow sudal governmental bodies with control over money and weaponry staffed and governed by such people israel must secure its own security they do not have a choice every one in israel on all sides of the hostage issue agrees on thatmuch do not believe the media when they suggest that this hostage dal is suddenly the

many members the world community are eager to save komas believing that when yu appease terrorist groups somehow magically this makes the world safer when precisely the opposite is true israel mose israel tried to d sclat with komas for twenty years for twenty years and the result was october seven comas has not changed comas is lying to the world when they suggest that here is anything on the table other then komas continuing its mission of destroying israel this made clear every single days israel releases newfootage from the gosestrib for example yesterday the idea for leased footage showing how komas uses moqes to protect weapons and this is the thing when your talking bhat negotiations and diplomacy negotiations and oplemacy obviously have to a kur in a situation in which you can trust and also verify at that was the old ragan saw is that in any negotiation spessully with somebody who really opposes you yet to truss but you have to verify ke well trust is not possible with people whose entire mode of existence on this earth namely komas terris and their ilk is lawing is untruth these are people who deliberately hide weapons beneath maques in orders that when israel has to hit themase they can then claim that israel is attacking holy sights these are people who deliberately hide weapons in hospitals si in israel hesto attack a hospital they can hide inside and pretend that israel is attacking a civilian sight this is lying is part of the game and this is the thing that westerners need understand comas his balla euronyan regime with isnemin radical is lamic opponents of the west this honesty is an entire tactic it is not is though honesty i to facts on both sides to disagreement over politics or anything remotely that it is not one side is perfectly willing to lie as much as humanly possible in order to achieve its ends and the other side keeps screaming into the void negotiations cannot be pursued successfully under such sit you under under such conditions this by the ways what israele found out under the oslo cords when they trusted the palistinian authority and the palicinian authority promptly started multiple round to violence whn the palicinian authority used every dollar that came into the palistinian authority not to build up civil society but to ciphen it off into the pockits of the palistinian leadership to build up weaponry to pay terrorists this honesty is the name of the game in this particular region the only thing that both sides understand because israel understands to honicy andit doponents do not there ean play in that in that kittypool the only thing the only currency in the mideleast unfortunately i wish sou were nt the only currency is actual deturrent power that is the only currency that actually exists oshays some this foot it in just a second bcause gan it continues to be stunning and astonishing to me that people in the west seem to believe that comass is just ou no there just another political group the dividignatiouses of the world pure idiacy diplomacy is a tactic diplomacy is not a policy this some thing that the west also seems to have forgotten blet seems soa forgotten that when you make policy of a policy goal andthe you have certain tactics in order to achieve the policy goal if you wish for example for a two state solution that is a policy goal now the only way to achieve that policy goal may be to replace a rechime commass in the gosa strip and hope that it some point in the future another rishumarizes that is not a genticitle terrorist group but there' many people moless to believe that diplomacy is an actual policy and when asked in presidential demate you will see candidatesate things while i would pursue diplomacy diplomacy is the answer well that is not the question the question is what is depolicy that you are seeking to pursue and his diplomacy the best available opportunity to achieve that policy this by the ways one the arguments thats happening over this hostage deal there a lot of people who believe that israel shuld not have been negotiating with commas at all that essentially israel shuld have said from the very outset you have two choices and two choices only one you return the hostages you surrender youve up your weapons and you go into exile somewhere and too you die those are the only two octions but the reality is that when you are in the prime minist reseat in israel or by theway weng i the president of the united states states an seat in the united states all the talk about not negotion with terrar seems to go by the wayside because immediate interest in obtaining the release of innocent people tends to trump all of the tough talk i thing that is un fortunate by the way again we will get too some of that take showing what

not deceitful they would never lie it is not as though tht its a quarpart of their policy meanwhile is ral his released yet more tape of comos useing all sheef ut to build a tunnel net work again the it is amazing how many credulist members of the press were willing to humor o the le that every one new was he lie that all shefo was the civilian siht predominantly is supposed with homos headquarters even after israel released horrifying footage of commas literally dragging hostages into the hospital as doctors sad around and watch every one new do understand how to sgusting the international community is what you really have to understand is how many international organizations new exactly what lshifa was and continue to propagandize on behalf of kommass it is astonishing were talking international red crost they knew were time out doctor's thapword they knew human rights watch they knew and all of them were propagandizing on behalf of kommas during this particular conflict in israel breeched a wall and whan they found behind it shocker a giant well stocked terrtunnel under allshifa hospital it goes even further when commas is looking for a great place sto hide it weaponry it does in things baby cribs here is a picture from yesterday comashid in antitank weapon underneath a baby crib now i have a baby i'll lay what ar own keep under his crib a misil i doft kno about you but maybe that is because i'm not a piece of human debris the members of kommass none the less an the the typical sort of good harted american notion that every one thinks the same way and everyone has the same general mode of thought and we are all seeking the same thing on reall brought brotherhood all the stuff it is crap it is not true the world is filled with real politique a struggle between people very often believe horrible things in people who do not believe horrible things this is why for example south africa has now shifted dramatically on israel then r now accusing south africa is tisrael of a quonquot genicide that of course is not a shock south africa has been rife with the anti white hatred for years and years since the end of a partide certainleat justifiably in some massher during a partide in the post of partite euro the promise of mandella has been almost completely forgotten in south africa as there has been a move to tremendously ratialize the politics again in south africa and israel has been seen as an extension of that waccordig to the times of israel one of israel's most significant partners on the continent one time south africa has gradually come out as one of its most vituperative critics accusing israel of athne cleansing it now of genicide the genicide alligation as travelled up the ranks of the government beginning on november second with kumwudzol the shav henny a relatively junior cabinet missnt minister and then was expressed by the president syrel rammafhoza who called the gaza a quote concentration camp where genicide is taking place which is just the violest most discusting language especially about again the jews oactually sufferd in a concentration camp where genicide was takin place many concentration campser a genicide was taking place which is not gaza south africa is on to move in very dangerous directions against thit hursh population thats just a prediction right now in this is true of a huge number of countries ranging from africa i would take to the midaleas wit their no juws in the midalyst other than israel becas iv olebin expelled already which no one eems to gear about but from africa to europe this is going to be a continuing problem meanwhile turkeys seeking to up the anti because again turkey can do low cost and then make promises to it slamist population first there is lot at stake this november do not be a chicken and shop at the grocery store usual instead had anover good ranchers where they have great meat punsbut even better meat do not miss their black friday

the number one places to get all american beef pork chicken and seafood that is prumo coatshi pero at good ranchers dod com good ranchers is american meat delivered go check im out right now good ranchers dod com freeshipping with code shipiro agaso turkey is also seeking to up the anti because a erdoan is in his lomenst dictator according to the times of israel are proctinanly one thousand boats will gather in turkey on one stay before heading toward gozite an and attempt to break the israely blockade and destrupt maritime trade coming into israel during the war with kommass now dect gate tago they tried the same thing thy tri to ship in a bunch of weaponry israel had to board one of those ships and there wore terrus on board that isrel had to kill and that end up being in international incident because this is the way that it works among the one thousand vessels ould be three hundred and thirteen boats filled with russian activists nd a hundred for with spanish activists only twelve turkish vessels would join the flotilla apparently later they expected the number of turkisht vessels to increase to one thousand they then suggested that om the initiative was not associate wit the turkish government which of course is a lie the operation would be designe to cost astrruption in international waters off the israely coasts to the maritime trade heading for the port of oshtod in order to interrupt the supply of goods to israel for week or even up to ten days wouldnt even be to trydto ship stuff into the gosip trip which is not going to work instead it would be to obstruct other boats from getting into israel to bring goods into israe just though the world is filled with delightful people and delightful countries and it is worthy remembering that the united states does not exist in yvacuum we are very lucky as i said before the united states is blessed by god in many uniquean incredible ways number one ar geography whe are contiguous continental power to our north ar bunch of canadians and to our south are bunch of mexicans on the other to sides is much water that is really really lucky but that does not mean that the world is not a fairly small placs and that the more horrifying countries gain more power the more horrifying countries feel em bolden the more that effect your here at home i'm not just talking about n terms of security sure it means thathere 'ill be an up tick in terror attacks because again when terror groups feeld that they have a weak horse they attack me asomben laden said that much i'm talking bat in terms of your economic livelihood there are choke points all over the glob most of trade does not happen vea erplane most of trade happens thea oceans most it happens veal waterways therr theyre the're dozens of choke points all over the world and as the united states is power wans in those particular areas that is going to get a lot worse if the united states in itso allies for example cannot guarantee the freedom of the water ways which has been sortof the guarantee the united stateses has assumed since the end of world war to i promise you the price of goods services everything is going to increase dramatically if youweriedabout inflation now get ready if you are worred about price spikes now get ready what happens when for example china decides that it is going to take more control over the south chinase and then impose terifs on anybody moving through what happens when the straits of hormoos are shut off by ran this is the sort of thing that happens in a multy polar world we have all been living in the aftermauth and in the current of a dominant american hatreminy and that is a very very good thing america in its allies rule the glob that is good because in that absence the opposite is really bad we can pretend that none of this matters but it matters an awful lot if for example the strait of molocka which is the primary choke point for traited goods in asia it if if vatfhr example is grab by china or control by china that is a serious problem not only because it gives china in enormous amount of leverage over the united states but also becaus it means the prices are going to go up if the straits of hormoos are closhes i mention that earlier that is thirty percent of all oil trated on theworld's oceans which is the majority of oil traded thirty percent of it can get choked off you thing that has no impact on you an isolationism is first order thinking it is first order thing just on real politiqu level forget all of the moral suation arguments forget about democracy for sis dictatorship for second forget about human rights for to some of the most evil groups on the planer forget about all that stuff inderstand it is to stuff than emotionally moves people but there is a whole grup of people out there for isolationist because they are quonqued real politique qoare thinking about of the the hard power aspects of what it means to exist in the world and theyare forgetting that those hard power aspects do not just exist inside the united states of america america again is uniquelly blessed by geography that does not mean that america is au tarkic it is not we get an vast number of resources from abroad and by the way those markets purchase a vast number of american resources it wi'll have an impact on our life if we go isolationist it will hae an impact on our life if the bad gized wind in many of these places if russia gains power that army will be used to mobilize toward choke points if china stretches its power a cross these straits of tiwan and grabs tiwan that has massive ramifications for amerit can t acnology virtually all the sophisticated mikrochips on earth are produced in tiwan this is why we care about ti wan again forget abou he fact that tiwan is democratic states that shares many of our values and china is a communist hellhole that sures virtually none of them the real question for the real politiqu crowd because that is what they say they ois i they are hard headed ere hard headed and man notice that the hard headedness the hard headed isolationism does not extend to when people are travelling to spain or when they are travelling to hungary to talk with various forin leaders then the hard headed real politic seems to go away and 's moral suat tion again but even a suming hard headed real politi pappy cannonesk isolationism all right well let us pretend for a second tht you got your way there'ld be real mastive quoss associate with that to the american taxpair to the american consumer to american families and lest we forget the american economy matters an awful lot two the american family and two american consumers at that is your way of life that is how you live day to day everything seems very distant until the impacts are felt very very immediately and that is the probly foreign policies hard to explain forein policy generally speaking in real politic terms because it requires a certain baseline level of understanding and knowledge which is li typically there has been a semi by partisin consensis on foreign policy why because once you get in the seats and you see how certain decisions that are made in places very far away from the united states manifest as real impacts inside the united states it seems at that clarifies the mind a lot and that is true for members of both parties largely medonal trump came into office pledging a certain level of isolationism and he was able to carry that out to the excent that we did not involve ourselves heavily an foreign conflicts but to pretend that donal truples an isolationist on foreign policies absurd he personally helped broker the abrahamicords in the middle east tht was not just a good thing to do that also was very helpful for te american economic interest in the middle east president trump engaged intoplomacy insouth east asia was a thing that he did it is a thing united states will have to do begas again seconds order thinkcing requirs the unotjust look at the problem that is immediately in front of you an say that is very far away it is happening in a different place foreign policy requires you think two steps down theroa because america's enemies are an tht's particularly for for dictatorships when it comes to foreign policy the tatorships have a first mover advantage they do democracies are generally very slotomobilize and they ten to get boared very easily the tatorships do not have to worry about that this always been the case that china has made with regard to foreign policy for example china has always said we will just out last you well out wait you we will out last you we will still be here it will jut elect another president four years from now and then that kile dosome stuff and we do not that will win another four years and that guill gall away having a long lasting hard headed foreign policy is a very difficult thing to do in a democracy and to tatorships know that that is why the american people and people of the west generally speaking hafe to be a little bit more long sited in the way that they view foreign policy because again to catorships have the ability to simply hold the line for literally evernd if the people do not it that jus kill them that is not the case in the west which requires more of the people of the west at requires people in the west to actually think about the impacts of the things that they are saying and doing cause those things actually have nan impact and how their leaders act an which brings us to the latest in you crane now the issue in you crane is is really not whether russhi is going to win there now russia is not going to defeat you crane the issue is what does an all framplook the issue is can ou crane maintain itstone security inside the borders that a currently has because it was in america's interest to continue to bleed the russian army there is no question about this th is notion that it is i its in americas interest noctably the russian army is bizare to me russia's military has ben quite a gressive from georgia to crimia to the donbas to casextand the teu russian military used is an arm of imperialismn by the russian state has ben adverse to american interest across the world including in the mdeleast whre the been very active in places seria because brockubon the basecly surrendered seria to russia which was a bad move and has heightened the possibility of conflict in middleast again second order thinking when hand over serios to the russians it turns out that the russians are coordinating with the aronians that has impact on eucrane because eron is using because aron is working with the russians to ship tachnology over it has impact on te midallees because russia is helping aron with its re source problems to can distributterrall over the midleleast and that has impact on the world economy as we have seen from the shocking extend of te economic impact on the world economy of the warnnu crane their lot of interconnections in foreign policy well as america's interest in ucrane america's interest in eucrane was number one preserving the independence of ucrane against russia number two degradin the russian military an america has largely achieved a both of those goals and then it was an america's interest to continue to support eucranian action in the field until the point at which it was clear that a stale mate had been obtain that is basedly wha has happened here i'd be perfectly happy to continue funding eucranians if they were actuallych capable of pussing the russians out of don bassarcrimea they have shown no ability to do that then the quessian becomes iregus trowing bad money after good beyond a certain point that is the real question we should be asking n eucrane that by the ways of very different story from for example forinade to israel in defeeting commoss which they very veri achieve a bagoal commoss is a fairleast small moderately size terrorist group compared to the is railing military thes riting military certainly has thecapacityd to regain control of the security situation in the gosa strip which is ly all talk of szesmar fire now from a military real politeat perspective is the stupidest thing i've ever heard talk of some sort of solution in ucrane right now makes en sincewe' ben doing this for a year and a half the lines on the battlefield had basiclly been stagnent for at least six months and we all knew where they wre gon and up anyway ey wit that said the pensigon chief secretary defenselod auston has now made a surprise trip to the ucranian capital trying to rally sport for eucrane even suggesting ucranian forces would be even more ogressive in their fight against invading russian forces throughout the winter austins buillyant prediction about the next pfase of fighting coms after eucranan forcs failed which youve any decisive brake through during a six month counts ar offensive which came at a heavy cost for eucranian troups in the average age of members of eucrany militaries now forty three there is also serious concernineu crane about the longer trom future of just military aid with some republicans wanting to halt support eucrane's ability to quotincuo take the fight to the enemy as austin put it will dependent large part on the continuation of just military aid including ammunition but it is unclear whether the eucranians actually have the capacity to push the russians back at this point and they have shown no real ability to do beyond the first few months of the war when they had widespread success they keep promisin the will e a break through but there has not really been a break through along those lines as former diplomat richard hossiggeste said maybe the solution in u crane is security guarantees to you crane wou make sure that such an invasion never happens agan ucrane has the ability to withstand such in invasion well that is your realistic the battle lines dare not moving hereis richard hoss explaining they are gono increasing te sam we are hearing in in the house fore hearing in parts of europe why should we kee doing us were already strats for tryin to supportis reall word about ti wan ah and even if we did everything we need to give a wanting if to crane its still will not lead to success what i argued therefort is the united states needs to have some very od direct conversations with e crane forth president selensty talk about we dusing their emphasis on liberating land increasingly put all their emphasis on

the members of his ad ministration who desperately wont run for president sto replace him but our stuck in place because he will not go anywhere watching them defend him is really is real the quit humors here is p bouddojedge who desperately wants to run for president despite the fact that heis a terrible secretary of transportation and running joke who is only actual accomplishment was apparently being mayore of a small town in indiana and allso being gag here is a mare pe buddojedge i would add to that here fairs becoming much more reasonable lately and unemployment a that i do not think has state this loaf for this long in my life time but that does not e go round saying i know everythings perfect and we recognize that americans have had a roug few years especially when hou think about covin what that did to our society effects that we are still working three think about some of the political polerization that is going on irot out theyr' saying that all of the work is gone a wereat they'r pointing to the good work that we are doing the're doing much good work much good work says people to judge out they are not and theyve got a lot probise which means wait for it they got a redirectror trump when is there entire tragy nowt again i'm wondering increasingly these days whether that strategy is going to be successful or not be's mad all be baked in to the cake i think that their strategy as next year is trials trials trials trump in front of cuarts and all the rest but the problem is that because they launch all the indictement early it is possible that they already got their bang for their buck on that one it is possible that his trump atpears in court it does not have all that much impact becaue we are op look he is in court again in the same way that they kept trying to impeach him an were lub is it a day ending and why gets their trying to im peach him heye gingto do the same thing with these courtcases they are going back to the playbook tho playbook is as we said yesterday he sittler the near times now admittng the quit part i t alow what ignore trump democrats now want him plastere all over the news democrats aure hoping that morettention on him can help turn around president by mis fortunes reduptstian reporting when donald trump left the whitehouse democrat idn want here another word from him presinent bidon dis miss him as the former guy a party wide kinsent is held that he was best left ignored three years later mister bidn's reeleching campagn and democratic official o cross the party spectrum have landed on a new solution to his political slum more trump criticising te news media for giving trump a latform is out quitely pinding for matronettworks to again broadcast live coverage of trump campagn rallies is in behind the im probable longing for the former president to gobble up o litical oxygen is democrat's years long dependens on the trump outrage machine since his assent trump has been a one man democratic turn out operation unitin an otherwise fractured opposition and sheling victories in three straight election cycles now democrat's worry the fever of trump fatigue his passed and some voters are softening toward man than once lothes manye others may simply be paying little attention as trums share of the daily national conversation has diminished as i said before trumps beststratige in this it is to basically go to the asement and then you penty jobiton if he does that he could very easily be president again and they keep uping the anties o jo scarborough a my goodness this is unhinged here is it joe scarborough making doomsday prediction for donald trumps second turm trying to scarey you in devoting for the old man here we go just because he has it dot it yet does it man he wall do it why a he get aint shance to do it at i he has halbonind in to al is thet a lot of tese people better tung ut litero or figured ever whatever the hell thers sane yo loo

adan fifth haven nt i was not he president for four years withat a lots of political executions that were appening at that time did i miss it or was not tonal trump actually we ca need with regard to the d o ja that he let hillery clinton off the hook in the mistaken but i think sort of justifiable belief that we better for the country if we did not proscue our political opponents a rule that was then broke in the evicerated actually by the bidan ministration all the truggla how scary trump is it is jo bid nofs activated the d oj against his political opponents its jo bidon who as called his political opponents traitors and that none none of this washes and again illin it even waches for jo scarboroming it if he really believes that that this is donald trumps past him jus wondering why

white house towted transgender victims o violence here is caren john pierre the world's most diverse and leace talented pre secretary talking about all of us onto day on transgender day o remembrance we greave the twenty six transgender americans who were killed this year year after year we see that these victims are dis proportionately black women and women of color no one should face vilenth livin hear or be discriminated agans simply forbin hemtelt im justatestically she is rom she itisly sionwrong last year they'r apparently twenty six corn quo trans women who are murdered as supposed to five thousand dad women in the united states murdered every yer actual bylogical women and a and wa more biological men the the murderate among trans people is extremely low compared to the general population and in fact there is a list from humonrites council of the twenty six transpeople killed in twenty twenty three and in the vast majority of cases nearly all of them no motive is listed for example jasman star mac ac a josioa parker stabbdon leg no suspects or motives listed ksi le johnson murdered and robbed unique banks home invasion mother also killed three more injured saki imont we tajo shot by coworker maria hosat revera murder suicide with boifran cashe handerson shot by habitual criminality repeater portugwita non binary mail shot by police during inviremental protest tassia woodlan person shot outside bar geneal identity cording police not a factor again the list goes on and on and on and on and yet we are told again that trans people in the united states urnder tremendous threat it is mazic u why do not they justlistis lamaphobia there to and it just ththe number of phantum social ills that apparently is rife in the united states according to this white house while they ignore actual social ills is truly in astonishing thing in th this still white house that is pretending that the nashvil transshooter who murdered bunch of kids an that had nothing to do with transness or politics at all he're still pretending that one away but theire having transgentered dayes of remembrance af the white house and we ll have to pretend the transgenter people in the nie or people lidentifies members of the oposite sect and the rutinely being beaten in the streets it jus th absolute silliness it is not true at all but ou know none of that matters bekas the truth does not matter meanwhile the white house is a very excited because tha they have now achieved some guilty please agans the founder of bynands bynance is the largest globl criypto exchange now it happens to be the case that weve seen a bunch of scandals in the crypto space obviously san bankment freed was involved inthe rypto spaso soconvallybank melt down that was bankots involved largely in the crypto space bynance same sort of thing apparently according to the wallstra turnal the chief executive of bynance the largest lobal crypto currency exchange step down and playe guilties violating yuus anti money wandering requirements and it deal that might preserve the companies ability to continue operating according to cort documents changpangshal appeared in seatle federal cort on tuesday and entered his plea according to court records prosecureris accused bynance which jau owns a faciliting transfacilitating transactions with sanction groups ththis seems a perfectly valid prosecution by the way i'm just wondering why t is that the american federal government also facilitates transactions with sanction groups namely the government of oron but here ra secretary yelland very excited about this benance preces these transactions but it never filed a single suspicious activity report and it also alowed over one and half million virtual currency trades that violated youa sanctions we have taken the largest and forspan action in tracery history finsin settlemen agreement essses a penalty of three point for bmillion dollars o facsettlement agreement essesses a penalty ofmerly a billion dollars again all this is worth while i g one ask the question why is tat the united states governentis directly facilitating the movement of money to the aronian machine one of things they'are going after bynance for is the facilitation of theight hundred ninety nine million dollars in process trades between americans and users believed to be in ron the united states just freed up buillions tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to the aronian government which is spreading terror around the region and anding with attacks on american troups maybe they should take

welcome to the huberman ladpodcas discuss science sciencepace t s fr lii mander huberman and om r professor of narbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for this standard huberman labpodcast which comes out every monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feats you to applespodify and elsewhere we also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at stamford and elsewhere research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health physical health and performance i am also pleased to inform you that for every dollar the huberman lab premium channel generates for research studies the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance if you to subscribe to the huberman labpodcast premium channel please go to huberman labdoc com slash premium it is ten dollars a month to subscribe

is for you without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about the prose and cons of daily caffin consumption the question reads what is your opinion on the net benefit of daily caffine consumption and how can somebody determine if daily caffine consumption is right for them first of all i did not entire episode about kaffine you can find that by going to huberman labdot com at that web siht you can put in kaffine into the search function and you will find links to that episode in all the formats you to bapple spotify et cetera and it is time stamped of course you can navigate to the particular topics most of interest to you however forsake of this discussion i can summarise a few of the key points the most importanthing d understand is that for most adults that is people about age eighteen to twenty or no older daily caffine consumption is not going to be a problem provided it does not induce anxiety and certainly provided that not induce anxiety or panic attacks and provided that it does not to strupt your night time sleep this is why i always recommend that if you are going to consume kaffin in any form coffee t soda or otherwise that you try not to injest kaffine within the eight an idealy within the ten or even twelve hours prior to bedtime that is because the half life of kaffine as such that even if you are able to for instance have a cup of coffee around three p m or four p m and then fall asleep around midnight the architecture of the sleep that you get is going to be disrupted for instance it is very important that you get sufficient amounts of both slow wave deep sleep as well as rapid eye movement sleep each night and if you consum kaffine too close to bedtime and here i'm definding too close as anywhere from eight to twelve hours before going to sleep chances are you are not going to get as much rapid eye movement sleep or slow wave sleep that you would otherwise and it is the amount of rapid i movement sleep and slow wave sleep that together lead to whether not you feel you had a good night sleep in terms of your next day alertness and cognitive abilities now again some people may find that they can drink kaffine in the late afternoon mabe even at night and still fall asleep but i promise you even if you are in that category you will sleep far better meaning the architecture of your sleep will be better and you will feel far more rested the next day if you abstain from kaffine within the eight to twelve hours prior to bedtime and i should also say that none of us are perfect myself included i will sometimes have a cup of coffee in the late afternoon and sometimes that will cause me a stay up a little but later sometimes it will not i do not think you want to obsess or worry too much about having some kaffine every once in a while in the late afternoon if you are still able to fall asleep but do not make it a regular habit now as far as we know there is no drawback to consuming kaffine on a daily basis again provided does not destrupt your night time sleep and provided it does not induce anxiety in fact most of the world consumes kaffine every single day the current estimates are that ninety per cent that is right nine zero ninety per cent of adults throughout the world consume a kaffinated beverage every single day that is a staggeringly high number making affine the most popular drug on the planet in fact because of the way that kaffine works and just to remind you how it works it effectively blocks a denisine receptors a denisin is a molecule that builds up in your brain and body more and more according to how long you have been awake it makes you feel sleepy kaffine blocks the adenisine receptor and then when it is dislodged from that receptor whatever a denizine has built up and is around can then bind to the adenisine receptor and makes you feel very sleepy that is the kaffine crash if ninety per cent of the adult population of the planet earth is consuming kaffine every day that means ninety per cent of the adult population of planed earth is blocking there ae denisine receptors for some portion of their daily life and then there a denisine is binding to the vacant receptor once the kaffine has dislodged and why ore ninety per cent of adult humans consuming kaffine every day well to feel more energized more focus to have mor r both cognitive energy and physical energy now of course most people are not walking around thinking oh kaffine gives me more energy more focus et cetera most people are consuming kaffine every single day and are consuming kafine every single day in order to feel quotenquoe normal to be at their base line level of cognitive ability and physical energy and on in fact if you look at the data on kafine consumption what you will find is that kaffine actually as a cognitive and hancer can improve learning in memory it can increase physical energy it can increase mental and physical stamina but a feature of those studies that is not often discussed but that was however discussed in the full episode on kaffine is that studies of kaffine typically are done by taking chronic kaffine users and then having them abstain from kaffine for some period of time usually four days to two weeks in which time they undergo kaffine withdrawal they do not feel well they get foggy headed they have less energy there is ae malays sometimes even some mild depression and then what they do is they have people take kaffine and take a cognitive exam or do some physical activityne compare their performance to what it was when they were in the withdrawal state and other typical form of study on kaffine is to take people who are naive to kaffine or who never take kaffine and then have them in jest kaffine and then measure their cognitive and or physical performance and in both cases you see improvements what i'm saying here is that daily kaffine consumption is not going to lead to improvements in cognitive ability or improvements in physical ability above one's base line unless you either abstain from kaffine for some period of time typically four days to two weeks prior or you are not somebody who typically in jests kaffine in other words ninety per cent of the world's population is drinking kaffine on a daily basis to be at their normal level of mental and physical functioning the question was is there a net benefit to daily kaffine consumption and here i can reliably say provided you do not suffer from anxiety attacks or lack of sleep from the kaffine consumption provided that your mindful of not injusting kaffine too late in the day there does not seem to be any big drawback to drinking kaffine on a daily basis however there does not seem to be any great benefit at least in terms of direct effects on cognitive or physical ability ay i realize this a little bit of a of a convoluded answer but we have to be honest with one another here kaffine is a performance enhancing drug but only when compared to the non kaffinated state and ninety per cent of the dult cofpulation on the world is kaffinated adding more kaffine above what you would normally consume is certainly not going to allow you to think better and perform better physically here is a useful way to think about kaffine most people can pretty well tolerate doses of kaffine anywhere from one hundred miligrams to three hundred miligrams depends on body weight and depends on your tolerance tolerance of course based on hu familiar you are with the effects of kaffine and how regularly you consume it a typical cup of coffee which by the way does not exist depending on the vender depending on how much water to coffee ratio one uses depending on weather nots french pressor its pore over the type of coffee at cetera all that is going to determine the total amount of kaffine in that coffee but we can set some outer balande on the total amount of kaffine that likely exists in a cup of coffee and it is probably somewhere between a hundred miligrams tha would be on the weaker side for a six or eight aunce cup of coffee out to about three hundred miligrams for the equivalent six to eight aunces of coffee but if you were to brew your coffee very very strong or me occasionally throw a shot of a spresso in there too you could get that number up to four hundred or five hundred miligrams of kaffeen i personally tolerate kaffine pretty well ha've been drinking kaffine since i was a teen ager mostly in the form of brod unflavored year bamate tea to importan to stay away from the smoked varieties of your bamate if you are going to get your kaffine from your bamate smoked varieties can be kcarsonagenic the non smoked varieties i do not seem to have that property but there is a lot of kaffine in your bamates a'll drink yoere bamat and have for many many years or i'll drink black coffee or expresso or epress or americono things of that sort that is my preferred sorce of kafine most people are drinking coffee to get their kaffin and i would say that if you are going to drink your affin drink it in the early part of the day as i mention earlior i am a big proponent of delaying your first kaffine and take until at least ninety minutes after waking in order to avoid the afternoon crash i've talked a lot about this on the pod kast their lot of clips on the nnernet explaining the rasionall behind that and if you do experience in afternoon krashin energy i do recommend to laying your morning kaffin and take to ninety to a hundr ed twenty minutes after waking now first people that want to get more of a true cognitive enhancing and performance in hancing effect from kaffine again you are going to have to abstain from kaffine for about four days regular kaffine drinkers that is going to be difficult that is going to lead to headaches that is going to lead to brain fog that is going to lead to feelings of malays in fact the last time i took four days off or even a week off from kaffine consumption was when i was sick i do not get sick very often but when i am sick i generally abstain from kaffine and sometimes i wonder whether not the malays i feel from whatever o viral or bacturial thing i might be dealing with when i'm sick is in part the malays of kaffine withdrawal i certainly notice i feel much better when i return to drinking kaffine but that tens o coinside with feeling relief from whatever sinis symptoms an other symptoms of mihd have been experiencing from the illness it is not a good experiment i cannot tease a part those variables the short answer is for most adults there does not seem to be any major downside to consuming kaffine and there have been scattered reports here and there in humans showing that in jesting kaffine can increase dopaming receptors which will effectively allow you to get more out of the dopomine that you produce a this is why kaffine has a mood elevating as well as energy elevating effect i should point out that some people just cannot tolerate kaffine it makes them too gitery too anxious they start sweating they get heart palpitations it is very hard for these people to build up a tolerance to kaffine that allows them to enjoy it these are the people that can even feel a fluttering the hart in a lot of energy lift from d kaff coffee now something that y to me is just a foreign concept but some people are just that sensitive to kaffine that even the small amounts of kaffine in chacolate or de kaff coffee make them feel too alert and they should abstain from kaffine i do not think they are in any way harming their health by abstaining from kaffine then there is the issue of children and adolescence and teen agers and young adults injesting kaffine and i cover some of this in the episode about kaffine but there is been a lot of debate as to whether not kaffine can cause osterperosis whether i can leach calciumount of the bones whether not can stunt growth frankly there is not a lot of evidence for those sorts of claims and yet developing brain is a very tender and malliable environment and somebody whos started offhice career as a development al norobiol just studding development al brain plasticity and wiring it does sort make me cringe to think about children younger than the age of say fourteen injesting large amounts of kaffine in any form sod a coffee tea et cetera despite the fact that there is very little evidence that it can stunt their growth i do not personally the idea of the young brain being bathed in an a denacine receptor antagonist which is effectively what kaffine is no as much as possible one wants the developing brain to develop in a mileu of unencumbered non chemically incumbered interactions between nur transmitters and their receptors unless of course there is a clinical need for prescription drugg or a supplement or am some modification of a nutritional programe specifically to uper down regulate the dopeing system or up or down regulate the ceratone and system but those are the sorts of decisions that really should be made in close oversite and recommendations by a psychiatrist the short answer around daily kaffine consumption in young people meaning fourteen and younger is avoid it if you can have your children avoid kaffine if they can the occasional bit of kaffine is probably not going to be a problem the amount of kaffine in small amounts of chocolate probably not going to be a problem but kaffine ind form of energy drink soda's coffee tea for children younger than fourteen just seems a bad idea from everything we understand about brain wiring and the trojectories of brains that develop with a lot of khemical adjustment from other sources kaffine now for kid's age fifteen to say eighteen or twenty a lot of brain wiring is still occurring but a lot of it has been completed probably not as risky to consume kaffine every once in a while or maybe even on a daily basis but there too i think there are great advantages to limiting the amount of kaffine that one in jess and of course in the adolescen anten iyears nowadays lot o kids are consuming energy drinks and soda and some of those energy drinks and sodas contain a lot of kaffine anywhere from two hundred to eight hundred meligrams of kaffines and nowadays more sodas and energy drinks contain other things a menoacid precursers to naromodulators dopamine for instance a lot of energy drinks now contain al tyrasine which is a precurserted dopamine a lot of them will contain theanine i've talked about theonine as a supplement that can promote more restful sleep have taken thirty to sixty minutes before sleep the reason why a lot of energy drinks and sodas and frankly now coffee brands are including thenine in the coffee or energy drink or soda is because it tends to have a mild anxiety reducing effect and it reduces the gitters that kaffine creates and that is iche a trick that these companies are using in order to get people to ingjest more kaffine because by including the theanine it is preventing the kid or adult from feeling to gitery and therefore the an continue to consume that drink without feeling their over stimulated if i were to take the in parental nor scientist a adult a voice here i would say avoid kaffine and take as much as you can until youre about eighteen years old but i'm realistic i realize that adolescence andtines age say in fourteen or fifteen out i eighteen and older are going to be consuming kaffin in the form of energy drinks and sodas but reducing the total amount of kaffine that one is injesting in those years just seems really advantageous again for all the same reasons i mention earlyr you do not want the young brain bathing in a bunch of exogenist meaning externally introduce nor khemicals or in things theanine or eltirisine if you are going to indulge in kaffine or an energy draink sir theanine or eltirisine for that matter that is a sort of thing that probably is best left for people eighteen and older and even there if one finds that kaffine is for them as do i i think always best to try and get your kaffine from a clean source a clean source meaning something that contains just coffee or just tee am again this is not a knock on energy drink specifically but you really have to make sure that whatever energy drink you are going to consume what is in it a you recognize what the different ingredients do and you recognize the potential of ingesting those ingredients chronically over and over gain and i've talked o little bit about this on previous podkass and ill get into this again maybe will do an entire episode about energy drinks because they are commonly consume nowadays now getting back to the original question about daily kaffine consumption this person goes on to say that for them o ka this is theire personal experience after a few weeks of consumption of daily kaffine the negative start to alwaig the posive ones they are getting poor quality sleep lack of appetite anxiety et cetera and when they do not consume kaffine they find it lot easier to be mindful and their meditation practices much better but they are lethargic and less motivated o kase to what they are describing are all the classic symptoms of kaffine over you se in wee not abuse in this case although kaffine kan be truly abused people taking kafine pills et cetera in large quantities we are not talking about that but this person is describing the classic pattern of over use of kaffine and the clafsic pattern of withdrawal from affine when they stop taking it what should somebody this do and i think thit is important question answer becaus i thing a lot of people fall in this kategory they drink kaffine every day they are no longer getting the performance in hancing effect of kaffine to theire taking it just to be normal or feel they can focus normally and have normal amounce of energy but then if they try and come off they feel worse can they are couple ways to do this you can taper your kaffine and take off over the course of four to seven days but most people do not have the discipline or do not want to spend the time doing that but if you want to the way you woud do that is yu woud cut it by a bout ten or fifteen per cent per day you culd do that by volume or you could do that by concentration of coffee that sort of thing a simpler way to go about all this that still will allow you to get some of the performance enhancing effects of kaffine and yet experience far less withdrawal would be two things first of all just have your amount of kaffine in take for two or three days again that could be by volume or could be by concentration probably easiest to do by volume and instead of drinking and eight allence coffee in the morning maybe do four ounces of regular coffee four ounce is a d kaf or you just have the four ounces of coffee you do that for three or four days and then you take perhaps one full day off from kaffine may be another full day off you are going to feel a lot less bad on those two days having cut your kaffine in taken half on the previous four days than you would if you just went cold turkee and then you go back ton jesting kaffine but you go back tin jesting kaffine at that fifty per cent dose or what used to re persent that fifty per cent dose of kaffine for you and you just continue that way on a daily basis and then every once in a while when you want the performance in hancing effects of kaffine you go back to what was your original dose which is now double what you are taking on on a daily basis what we are really talking about here is not going cold turkey we are not talking about quitting kaffine indefinitely what we are talking about its cutting the amount of kaffine that you drink in half for about four days a ka pluserminus to day and then taking two days off from kaffine completely and then going back on that half dose of kaffine indefinitely that is your new baseline of kaffine and take and then every one in a while if you need a bit more of a lift you injest twice as much kaffine or a coffee that is twice as concentrated we should acknowledge that most people are not going to bereally precise about the amount of balances the amount of kaffine none the less it is pretty straightforward to know that you are reducing your kaffne and take certainly is clear to know if you are njusting no kaffine for a couple of days and it is pretty clear when you are doubling the amount of kaffine but but you doft have to worry much that you are exactly doubling the amount of kaffine you could drink one and a half times as much as you happen to drink on the day before or you could drink three times as much you would deafinally feel it if you drink three times as much one very important hing to recognize as that on any day where you really spike your kaffine and take above baseline no matter where that base line is when you start could be zero could be four hundred milegrams could be two hundredmilligrams when you double that intake you will get a big boost of energy and the next day you are going to feel the crash from that you are going to feel more lethargic you are gon if yoel not good thas has to do with dopeming receptor modulation this has to do with a denizing receptor modulation importnt thing to do is not continued to consume that elevated level of kaffine which is what most people do and then they set a new higher base line just to feel normal the keything is to just manage to get through that crash day manage tou get through that one day where you feel little less good or maybe even down a bit get outside of it get more sunshine we kow that spice your quarters all in a good way right it can increase i the katacolamines dopamine et cetera get a little bit more sunlight get a a bit more movement get outside do something to offset those feelings of malays nd then get right back to your original goal level of kaffine each day there is no use in getting quantitative that you make your life miserable you measuring things out a laboratory khamist if you are that type and you want to do that be my guest but unless youre taking affine an pillform it is very very hard to get extremely exact about the amounts of kaffin that you are injesting it is ocate to ee ballet but understand the contour of how ckaffine works and what the affine performance en hancing effect comes from it comes from a kaffinin take above base line understand that any time you go above baseline with your kaffin and take there is the potential of some anxiety understand that there is going to be a slight withdrawal of fat at lasts about twenty four to forty eight hours battle through that short period and you will be right back where you started and where you need to be you can enjoy kaffine on a daily basis and derive the benefits because there are many benefits to drinking kaffine and avoiding some of the potential hazards and again if you are a young person i recommend delaying that kaffin intake may be i do not now ten years thank you or joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the huberman labpod cast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to huberman labdot com slash premium just to remind you why we launch the huberman lapod cast premium channel 's ruly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard huberman labpodcast channel which of course we will still be continued to be released every monday in full length we are not going to change the foremat or anything about the standard huberan labpod cast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which i think we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocals for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all cha nels not just the premium channel but through all channes hubermn labpodcast in other medium channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funds come in through the remium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humbern lapremium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for te entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some prmium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocals of huberman laponcast episodes not found elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to huberman labdoc calm slash premium again that huberman labdoc cam slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in science

first of all to start to show for those people are hippop manson ar just her for the number one hippopardis in america i'll get totall bit later in the show gav to do the news first jobidans cowardly oppeaseman oriented strategy in te midle east has now got an americans officially killed it was only a matter of time until this happinaranian proxy forces have been attacking americans all over the middle east from arac to syria and now to jordan according to the wallstry journal three u u service members were killed at least thirty four were injured an aron back malitcias drone strike on a base in northeast jordan according to u us officials now that his a bit of a difference in kin from attacks in a roch or attacks in syria those are both countries the're not officially u us allies jordanit is officially in american ally this would be an attack by an aranian proxy force into in american allied space on americans the strike carried out by one way drattack dron signals an escalading in fighting in the region the presidenand secretary defence hat did put out a statement suggesting retaliation president bidan statement was this quote to day america's heart is heavy last night three ou a service members were killed an many wounded during an unmanned aerial dron attack on our forces stagein in northeast jordan near the syria border while we are still gathering the facts of the attack we knot was carried out by radical aron back militan groups operating in syria and roch and then there is the language about grieving for the fallen service members and how wonderful the soldiers are all of which i am shore is true also if you had not spent every day since october seventh trying to make nice with aran demonstrating that your true interest in the middle east has nothing to do ith a merican interest but to do with your electoral interest this would not have happen here is the very simple mathnem at eleast if you do not punch terroris directly in the mouth incredibly hard and incredibly often thay get more oggressive with you and when you show your neck they attack jobidan has been showing his neck largely since october seventh in fact long before that tjobin has been showing american's nack in the middle east since he decided that he was going to take the hoothies off the terror watchlist since he decided that he was going to start appeasing the palcinian authority since he decided that he was going to reorient away from the a lions striven model tha president trump had embrace the abrahamicord's model that really broughtlout a soone arab countries into the full ranging from sadi orabia and you a e and moraco to egypt and jordan he decide to move away from that to jobitan and instead he was going to seek the baracobama ask idiocy of what if we try to pursue a deal with aron and when you do that what you end up doing is appeasing the largest terr sponsor in the region and naturally as the dors began to close around he middle east to aron aran started to buck against that and i started to use their terror proxies as a way of upending the burgening relationships in the mddle east as a way of scuttling any possibility of the broadening of the abrahamicorts to directly include sadiorabia that is why october seventh happened essentially hamas was given in green light to attack israel by aran and the his ballah which is in eranian terragroup was given the green light to attack hisrael in the north thand the whoothes were given the green light to tack shipping in the red sea and at every turn jobidon made clear that he was not going to hit them hard enough to make them stop and the reason is because jobidon is much more fearful of war with aron than aran is fearful apparently of war with the united states now no one wants war with oron no one is interested in war with ron but if it comes down to it who do you think has more to fear aron fror going war t the united states or te united states from going to war with ron tho gen that is not something that i'm calling for i do not think it is a good i dea it only any one in the right mind thinks that that is a good idea no one walt spend blood t non wa spend tressure and that is exactly correct but containment can and should be pursued containment is a policy of deturincs that is applied in various regions surrounding oron tyou are not to go to war directly with theron to for example secure shipping in the red sea which is deeply necessary considering that container shipmans have now cost twice what they used to and everybody is now rooting around the cape of good hope instead of going up through the red sea the ar oil is gettng more expensive because of all of this suggesting that israel be supplied the munitions that it requires an or to take out the aronian proxy comass and to detur the aronian proxy cusblo in the north or take it out that has nothing o d with america going directly to war when americans get killed the proper response to that is to is to make sure the other side of the f aroun find out aquation actually applies that does not mean you have to derectly attack oronsan mean ere can have f twenty two flying over tahron or anything that there ways the united states can apply force in the face of the death of americans that actually establishes to turns and yofrenot gotn duthaysion have troops there it is that simple is that simple if you think that the united state should completely pull out of the region which is a whole other argument and also i think a specious argument concerning united states does have deep and abiding reasons to care about the middle east ranging from oil supply to shipping strategy to democracy there many reasons to care about the midly sput even if you were to argue that the us should not have troops there at all if youus troops are there you have to protect them it is immoral and wrong not to protect them and jobidon has beenin the business of trying to appeast the people who have killed thousands of americans since the day he took office he is been indelusional state about run the same delusional state embraced by barakobama and at led to the ries averanian power throughout the middle east and donal trump recontained it donald trump hampered the aranians donald trump put in place om the strictest sanctions in world history he impoverished the aranian regine he boks them in with the abrahamicords and they knew it and what they also knew is that if they screwed around the united states under donal trump might punch them in te mout that actually is a very good form policies o very effective forn policy and jobidon just as he did with the border decided to destroy that forn policy because it had a big gold trumpsin on it anythng associate with trump had to be destroyed no mater how good the policy was yen jobiden inherited a wor king border policy jobidon inherited a working middle east which is insane and he promptly decided to blow both of them a gets

troops without creating the possibility of a broader conflict with the ron now again the regality is that that is quite duable but jobidon is sol scared he isoll all fire scared fa continuing conflict in he mimolicities an sleep alk right into one because there are two ways the conflict happens one is we retaliaten the ronitaliates in then we retaliaten the ron retaliates n than an escalites the other way is hou do nothing and then ron keeps pushing an whe we have been watching for the last several months is a ron keeps pushing wet's een a hundred and sixty plus attacks on american targats since october seven and gobidon has effectively done nothing they shut down shipping in the redza and jobitin hidabunch of camels in the ass that is not in actual policy when gobin puts out a statements ang that three american service members we lost for patrits in the high estcense theire ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our nation together we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their families we will strive to be worthy of their honor and valor we will carry on teir commitits fight terroris m and have no doubt we will hauld all those responsible to accounts at a time and i a manner of our choosing does any one believe that thes anyone believe that jobdn is in a hold those people to account be cause far that has not ben his policy his policy has been to pressure our allies wet dro the momen he stepped on to the world stage as president of the united states he decided tht he was going to destroy relations with the souties forget about whathi's doing with israel what he did with the salities at the very beginning of his ad ministration is despicable he decided that is a virtue signal to all his journalist friends he is goin to cut off the souty regine and the riht befor th midterms had to go on bendid kneed to the souty king and basically ask the de fact does how to kangmahom ad been salmon to lower oil prices to ich m bees was why would i do that you have been campagning against me since the day youe got into office jobidon's entirepolicy has been ornientad against ore allies in the mideleast and in favor of trying to bring oron into the family of nations which again is the most specious and idiotic goal of any goal in the idleash period a meanit that the number of attacks on americans is going to continue torize here because again jobidon has basically done nothing his basely done nothing and as nuch as me saying this it is non a trumpsaying this which is correct jure o the statements the donal trump put out on trouth social quote the jrone attack on yours military instellation in jordan kelling three american service members and wounding many more marks a horrible day for america me most profound simpothies go t the families of the brave service members we have lawst i ask all americans to join me in praying for those wh ae been wounded this brazen attack on the united states is get another herrific and tragic consequence of jobidn's weakness and surrender sis correct says three years ago aron was weak broke and totally under control thanks to my maximom pressure policy the aronian regime could barely scrape two dollars the other to fun their terrorist proxies then jobidon came in and give ron billions of dollars with th which the regime has used its to spread bloodshedd ing carnage throughout them at least this attack would neber ove happen if i was president not even a chance just the aronian back comos attack on israel wouldever have happen the warn you cran woe nover ove happene and wed right now have peace throughout the world instead we are on the brink of world wore three this terrible day is yet more proof that we need not a me to return to pece through strength thewill be no more chaos no more destruction no more loss of precious american liws our country cannot survive with jobidon its commander in chief unow peace through strength for all thos isolation is than republican party peace through strength is not whe many isolationis are talking about many isolationists are just let us with draw within our on borders let us pretend that forein threatsdo nots actually exist let us pretend that if russia takes over you cran whole sale and takes over a huge supply of wheat to the world for example and then threatens nados borders that has known bact on americans let us pretend tha if we shut down the red sea and shipping cannot come through there than china will not take advantage in go aftfr tiwan o shut down the straits of tiwan and all the recith and i think t tht is a very short sided policy but most of all whats nonal trumpis calling out is the cowardice and vaillation of the bide admnistration which is totally correct which is why republicans today are really pushing hard four the president of the united states to do his job jobidon's job is not to asshurt equity in all public policy jobidon's job is to protect americas interest particularly abroad because the president is given outsized impact when comes to forein policy the president has the ability under article too the president has the ability to really shape american's form policies in ways that he does not american domestic policy and the fact that he has used that to make the world significantly more chaotic place wor con flegration is on the horizon in nearly every direction you look that is on jobidon senter o tom cottan excellence an ore from arkansaw hu put out a statement ain jobidon emboldsan ar on for years by tolerating attacks on our troops bribing the iatols with billiongs of dollars and appeasing them to no end he left our troops as sitting docks and now three are dead and dozens wounded sadly as i've predicted would happen for months i'm behalf of arkinsons i deeply extend a my condolencees tot e familst our brave and fallen warriors may god comfort them as who welcomes they are leved ones in to his embrace at may god quickly and completely heel their wounded comrades sener crus of tacas also blasted badingsaid then for making quote a dame one decision and not just to appease the aron in rechime but nde to enable the iat tollits to a tack americans andamerican interest across the madleast this is correct by the way now what exactly shuln ameri coul do i'm a practical level that is the real question an because no one is interested in a full scale wars i say now a ron should be more scared than we shoud and the reason i say that is is that is how to torrents works folks no caus i want to go to warthor on he said or the fifth time in the show no one wants to go to warthor on when it comes too deturrents the whole idea of deterrnts is you the bad god you have to fear me more than i fear you otherwise te turne is

rockets into israel on the northern boarder consistently for four months at this point i might note that again the hoothy pirates have been literally capturing shipping in the red sea and o shut down shipping through that strait i might note that rnian proxyes now killed three americans exactly wot look if they asklake wot esclation look to you seriously whel lat us collitionlook are we talking belic full scale oronian revolutionary guard quarbric ades going up agains american military tiges what are we talking about here and the answer is they doft know because this is all about yobins reelec effort that is all it is about jobidon has basically said to the aronians guys as long as you do not go to full skile war as long as youdo not go to fullskall war ye can do it every want what everyou want just kep it relative that youn kill americans keep it relatively low level and i'll keep it relatively low level and everything will be fine until i get my reelect and aronis thinking okca thisis a great time to push because jobidincan he aint can do anything you'r mint e t do anythin he is only a shut down th shipping in the red sea he is gon to let us attack a merican allies sadiarabia and israel and now jorden with impunity and he isgin to do all of that because he is afraid that if this thing go hot in any way sha per form it will hurt his reelect efforts now's go time for the aronians therelot ma jobiniand they see a mark man and they should see a mark because the acting a mark now what could the united states do in a situation this now gen you are nafter attack taheron oun ag to attack aron directly the'r bunch of things you can do one things could you could ship every piece of oronian militerry weapon re in the red sea you chip youcun destroy all of ite now i say that that towns crazy except for the fact that the united tayes actually do that nineteenaihty eight in nineteen eighty eight there is an operations call operation praying mantis it happened after e a you es worship was mind and the americans retaliated this of course was under ronald rangan thoe americans retaliated by taking down one frigate one gon boat three speed boats aanother frigate crippled two platforms destroyed one fighter damage ounih says basically found every military asset that aron had in the in the persian gulf in in aronian territorial waters an just sank all of them can whil you cannot bother american shipping any more it turns out it turns out the y cannot bother american ships becots done all of your under water now iu actually led to aron basically ending the aronorock war an had a major in packed on te end of the aronarock war because aron is oh i see we probably shouldn'n ef round and find out the osh could easily do that to pretend that aronians military cap abilities in the in the water ways around the persian gulf are somehou a deep threat to america is absurd they are not america's military force to take all of tam out tomorrow we did it before the the're much other things we could do the united states military facilitated the ouster of isis in under a month areu telling you the unit the united states could not use our aerial bombard ment power for example that in putting troups on the ground and just whole sailed destroy aranian tera proxy positions in say a rock or seria certainly the united states could do that wi'd be he purpose of that to get them to stop because if they find out than next time they do at theres in f thirty five on their doorstep somehow things look a little but different none of this requires going directly to worth ron and guess what aron is not going to ward directly with te united states there is a reason they are using proxies if the if aron wanted to go war withtheunited states they would not be using proxies they would be using the irge sea theyeould be directly attacking american forces they are not they are using all of teir terra proxies because they understand that if they actually triggered a war withthe united states the mulles would not have heads attached to their bodies to morrow morning theye'ld bein little bidty pieces all around teron if they actually declared war on the united states not doing that instead theyr using proxies what is oka wer enough to dethrone temallas an aron that is up to the aranian people to do that but the united states certainly dos enouh to stand for american soldiers being gild and to pretend that rea that that the turns cannot be reestablishes to ignore the intiridy of the trump administration when that is exactly what the trump administration established mean right now things are gettng much worce in the midliast because of american cowardice because trobign is tha coward when it comes to milies and he believes that is left wing will abandon him if the actually defends the interest of the united states they shay we will got to the bordener secon because the same sort of thing but things are getting worse in yemmen for example why wbut one of the reasons is because one ofthe first things jobidn did when he took office is he seid to the souties you need to stop your operations against the hothies in yemmon there is too much civilian casualties there is too much carnaturs to its too much a promet yet to leave the hoovhies in control about half of yemmonsterritory what turns out things are gttng worse there quote is from the washington post tnearly a decative civil war in the arabian penensil a country thas driven millions of people from their homes deep in poverty and spread starvation now a new conflict whoo the fighters are firing missiles on american tihipping an american bridsh forces are striking back is destrupting tentative efforts at peace well it turns out that you cannot make peace with people whir tacking shipping in the red sea what do they think is going to happen and if they think what is can happen is good what dies that say about western strength by the speaking of which aronaling groups are having more attacks on your forces in arock or coring tothe asan fronts press aronalid armed groups avoun on friday to keep up attacks on youus lek coalition forces in a rock washington has forces in arock is part of the international coalition against isis the bolital situation is pushed arocks prime ministers to call for the coallition to leave why because the coalition

southeastern bor area of ron on saturday thes weint an murdered a bunch of paxastandies aron is uping the ant everywhere because they sent weakness they sence weakness because te united states is acting weak they put out a trial balloon over the weak end for example they might consider slowing weapons to israels put pressure on priminister bentman it ton ow who to skill back tho war in gaza t's going t youus officials talking to anbysenews the white house later rejected the report the suggestion is that leverage had t be placed on israel to stop them from what to stop them from what destroying commass going north an destroying cusbala it is not only that the united states refuses to directly engage with these groups which tiy got in the united tateshould only engage with groups that have attack the united states or united states troups but t's not just that thatr telling american allies they cannot engage from soutyourabia wit the hoothies to israel commass no talk about whyoron sees weakness this is why this is why and it is because the left flank of jobidon's party does not the west they do not the west they believe that western powers are evil they truly do they believe that the united states is influence in the iddeleast is pernicious they believe that israel is a pernicious horse in the iddlies they believe that any allions with america in the midliest

is not just trying to appease the eranians he is trying to appease that wing of the party we have common interest in many cases with the ranians can meanwi none of the should be surprising because jobiding staffed up with people or sympathetic to the wrong sides in the iddle east for example one of the first people that jobiding actually appointed to his administration was a former palestinian

chief policys at the border are entirely executive branch shriven no additional legislation is needed to secure the american border it is in fact a duty of the federal government yto arrest people who cross america' sonthern border and to send them home if they do not fulfill the requirements for asylum jobidon has changed the interpretation of the rules he changed two specific things one he suggested that he would get rid of day on remain a mexico remain a mexico was the policy whereby donald trump hea an agreement with the country a mexico that if you came to te border and said that you wanted asylum we ta oke you can have a courtdate here is a stamp come back in two months when it isyor courttatan in the meantime we need you to wait in war ez you nedit you ye cannot wait here hout awaiht down there and turns out their mon people did not show up at the border any more why becaue they knew that the entire game was to get into the united states and disappear into the interior and that if you exha had to wait in war ez you wren't getting into the united states you woud sho up for your asylum hering tyou' ave no proof that you needed asylum and then you would get kicked out anyway why make the long walk all theway up to the american border vea drug smuggler and then be let off at the border to be rejected sent back to mexico come back for court take get rejected back home why do that jus stay home that was a good policy jobiden't it away with it day one the other policy that jobidon change those huge is that jobidn desided that the waigt to a judicate asylum was that if you claimed asylum we would simply catchion release you wouu not hold you intotention we'e not even threaten to hold you indetention you would show up we oud detain you for forty eight seventy to hours and then we release you to the interior as i've said he should check out the documentry that we just put out this bran new great piece of contents over at daily wire pluss first episode of divided states of bidin weu went down to america southern border in arizon we saw all of this inaction the boarer is wide open because jobidin decided that he was going to staff nearly all border patrol on bussing and ad ministrative duty their job is to go to various aries of the border pick up a leglimigrant bring them to the detention center maybe mill la couple miles away process them release them meanwhile the boarder is left wide open for drug smugglers and criminals to get through which wirsing the heno numbers theyouare seeing right now and this is also by the state of texas is doubling down a coring to she ges news the unprecedented stand off between the state of texas and he federl government at the southern border continues on monday the seprimcourt said that the federal goernment had the authority to remove razor wire texas had installed at the southern border andthen home lend security said texas had until friday to give federal authorities acass to eagle pass governor abbot for his part said that he would increase state patrol of the boarder and he added more barious and more razor wire here in fact is some tape of more raor wire going up at the boarder it is now an actual wall that is being ad hock in in egle park over at the border an is happening an egle pass sey here they are to ping up some razor wire they have got to shippin containers it is all because jobiton has decided to leave the border wide open it is that simple but jobidon is trying to shift this off jobin is trying to shift this off what is you trying to do he is tryin to suggestingmes more legislation he needs more power if you give him more power than hellen force the bordn again the laws are on the books it isnot a question as to whether ouned more laws you'r any many more resources when we spoke with brandon judd hofs the head oftheborder patrol union when we spoke with him he said thits not question of resources this a question of misalication of resources yeu ave enough board patrol agents ar ready they are being told actively not to do their job i talk some border patrol agents down at the border on background and thereware telling me moral has never been lower that they have been forced basically into this administrative duty job buy the by deministration theyre not en allowed to do their job any more tht is because of jobidon jobn can finish that to morrow literally to morrow he could do it you do it to day for that matter if he does not call lid by one p m but now jobidnis suggesting that we actiolng neen more legislaton ned it right now and hest be soft legislation nheso be the kind of legislation that increases the number of administrative law judges we can process more people and let them into the interior faster that is the real kee the real he is the let people in faster not to limit the flow but to increase the flow according to the associate press president bidan on friday pressed congress to embrace it by partisan sentat deal to pare border in forcement measures with you crane aid how speaker might johnson suggested the compromise on border and emigration policy could be de oway in his chamber bidon is trying to shift this off by pre tending affectively speaking that what he is doing right now is it giving a he is trying tocome to a compromise he is trying tomake neal now agan he does not en to make a deal close the boarder he dos not and right now that compromise what we stit we seen no actual material from what tho compromise looks the leagues suggest that the democrats only want to have sort of an automatic border closing at five thousand bordering counters to day five thousand border in counters to day now last it checked five thousand is a lot of borderin counters in fact if you had five thousand bordin counters to day on average o be tongu bhut almost two million people won went ight million people entering the country ever yor tht's a lot of people it is reduction for where we are now by not by much we would two point four million minimum last year republicans being the hard hearted people they are they were apparently thinking about eiht three thousand border limit which would still be almost one point one million people a year which is still too much how about zero about zero hw about you commen and you show actual evidence you require asylum and then we will consider whether to let you in how about you show up e find in actual set of jobs kills that enriches the united states and makes america stronger and then maybe we let you in hwabout you do not get to come here and then just throw up your hands clemasylum be released into the interior ho about that but again there is always a couple of republicans wo are willing to provide cover for this sort of stuff entor jams langford white i typically centera langford does a good job no lahoma but he is now accusing republicans of tanking the deal now if you really wants republicans tocide with him on thus we need to see the deal i cannot en dorse a deal until i have seen it and form what ihave heard leate is not a good deal not by any structing imagination here' centor lankford there well it steffling not in to leter buts people land it is focasonex on turing people around on it it is interesting re publicans four months ago would not give funding for you crane for israel and for a sother border because we demanded changes in policy we actually lock tirms together anc aid were not ing to giveyou money for this we want a change in law and now it is interesting i you months later when are filling it to the endther o just getting iactually do not want a change in law because the pres inti electi on her we all haven oath to the constitution and we haver a commitment to say we are ging to do whatever we can to be able secure the border ok gare not mean let us you the deal and if that is the case then i'll sum for it but if that is not the case then jobidins just close the border now and again this the way democratsing in ae tryimgplated alsos laing for t is helping out democrats here democrats are claiming that jobidon requires additional legal authority to do what he is doing and that is the reason why they are not compromising with regard to legislation that is the reason why the not just caving to re publicans they needs some sort of compromise that' if that is terand republicans are standing in the way o the compromise republicans meanwhile i dute just surrender just urrender you could do it to morrow yourself with executive authority o neededditional lawt do this ore you could actually jo pass ach ar too he is not doing either of those things and just one second we will get to democrats trying to make this case first america's currently experiencingin un precedentin invasion as we have said with millions velegal emigrans flooding over our border the drugcard tells are doing the invading they are doing it under the by deminstration's watch as texans are shouldering the fight against the search here is on his governor remains erally silent because jobin continues to pursue this nonsense i traveled two america southern borders when cover the shocking truth and the real depths of this crisis it is shocking it is criminal it is our duty at the dailywaye to share that truth take a look an invasion on the southern border america is currently experiencing an invasion r we e nen is bact is dn ot dan a sdan i rat theorya it is their ferbitic gang if teliation and all the oh eopler tes croe border e we waving their hand on the ar or handor thank hank er iand o ge in e no longer the borger te tro wor e wol o to a number one than in merica o tands in r crafp to ecross of the border and if jobidon remains in office it is only going to get worse i'm bent fero and this divided states o biden invasion on the southern border mutch now on daily wire plas as hat sayour southern bord it is wide open jobitan has crafted this posy he has created it join me on the ground at's i bring you the real world consequence is one most destructive presidenci'sin american history watch invasion on the southern border streaming right now over a daily wireplos ok cam meanwhile as we say democrats are trying to shift the border conversation into why an't republicans just compromise why will not republicans come to an agreement hes gavan nusoms stik he is running a shadow presidential campaign he is basily sticking around just in case jobidon should fall off a bridge or something orain o collapse which he could do theoretically here is the govrnor of california who isbeen a horrible govrnor here is the governor talking about how the is really republicans falled the border we have had six million a apprehensions of the border what ultimately should happen tall us people and ther the people do not qualify for a siorn r totally came in a legally i'm in sure there bee the importations as what republicans are coin for the th mass round ups in the port but but what what withey give to do with the cards that ar dout you to dea i the reality on the ground and you have to have a comprehense of comversation around this across the spectr of the pushon the pull and that is ground tat fundamental a shu emigration reform it is not just bordor securty the presien put out a comprehens ostrategy pathway to citizen along the wines of their former hero rodald ragon to dress the reality on the ground we have a plan forteen billion dollar plan right now to get more judges to process people more efficiently wore quickly provide security got at the border twenty three hundred new border agents that is what the present united states is put up and frunt of cogress in the refuse to act thei'r just promoting an a genda to destrup and find a crobar to put in the spokes of the wheels of the body n administration to tisrup any progress on this because they do not want progress no actually mu democrats want is to open that speaket further to let in more elulimigrants that usu want to do with faster administering of the law as opposed to uknow keeping people in mexico to wait for their asylum hearing for example to democrats in order to actually pass this particular logical bar that is to establish that jobitnen catches unilaterally close teboard to day which he can s they troted out senter cristmurphy from connecticut to make this particular case suggesting the jobitn oes not actually have the legal authority to close the border i'm spoiler lart he absolutely does thener republican concluding t housepeaker argu lot of them not the entor dealing with but a lot of them argue that presntt binnardy has the authority that he to secure the border and at their criticizing this deal of the v an egotiating im what do you make of that a then notion that present bidan ardy has tools and he does not in mor yet well it is just not true it is a political talking point a those same republicans of ass of representatives to say president by has the tools introduced a ch ar too which is a massive border reform bill they said it was one of their most important priorities a and republicans have said openly they want to pass border n imigration reform all of a sudden they are against borderd emigration reform because they are worried it is actually going to pass yay wrong what they originally said was gobiton has the authority do thing then they said you known't we would e to force him to do the thing could force him to do thing by passing additional laws that force him to do the thing and then jomn said wonme not going to do the thing in legislations san o they said find we will not do the thing in legislation just do the thing yourself do it right now we cou the force you in lawbutif you will not do that if ten democrasts are holding it up well then find wyous will not do a deal there will not be a deal you have no leverage republicans are saying to mie you have no leverage and you now what they right they do not have leverage again the entire democratic casere is that in tryine blame the impasts on donal trumps a here is christmurphy suggesting an this al donald trumpsed scheme that he does not want legislation pass because he wants casts ot the border we do have a by partison toal were finishiing the text right now and the question is whether republicans are an eliscenadonal trump who wants to preserve chaos at the border because he thinks that it is a winning political issue for him or whether we are gin the pass legislation which would be the biggest by partison reform of our bordered emigration laws in forty years and wo ould give the president of the united states whether that president is a republican or a democrat new inportant power to be able to better manage the flow of people across the border hat's the train wame trump hey's trying to blame trump for the lack of legislation now trumps response to this should be jobin is nee legislator ow's president s did it whsn' he just doing the thing but donal trump is donal trumps to here is donal trumps response to all this president at bidin is backing a senate de out the clamp down at the border whale trump wants republicans to oppose that dale and deni bidon any political en sh a lot of the senators tat trying to say respectfully that let me in a mans that that is ca please plamint on me please because they were not getti ready to pass o ter ben bill ca please blamein on me is not exactly what you are looking for here politically why why please blamin on me why this sims for language he used when he is president about a government shut hin blame it on me what no no blame on bidon that is the whole point that is what a campaign is blame it on jo it is jo bidons fault he is the present what yu doing what r you doing if you ware a found of trump an you for trump to be te president of the united states again or if you just do not want to bidin to be president of the united states again you need blame jobidon bu what why why would you say blame in on me democrates are going to literally use that in evere ad with regard to the border from nown till the election why would you say that it does not make any logical sense especialy iftit is not true what is going on right now is not falt the sent republicans is not th falt the donal trump it is the fault of democrats who want the border open and our presenting bad compromises in the senate and then pretending that jobidon does not already have legal authority to make sure that our border is safe and secure which of course he absolutely does he already has all the necessities in order make sure the border is secure that is all ell meanwhile presiden trump again the entire case of democrats can to make against president trump is that he is unelectable that he is crazy and all of the rest or alsicgan trime bankrupt him i mean that that that is one of the big things that is happening right now is that legally there just going after him in every way shaped form that they can le sissue james over in new york is trying to go after him for hundreds of millions of dollars baseon just in absolutely specious and ridiculous judgment they sent him in fleetng realistac vallues with no actual damages by the way to the lender she're going oft from fr lice hundreds of millions dollars meanwhile another jury has now given donal trump in eighty three point three million dollar defamation penalty to egn carol on top of a five million dollar penalty he was already order to pay her just thy at the strat she claims and an unspecified time in a dapartment's store in the middle of the day in an unspecified season down trump braped er shas no proof to back this up none shas it no substantiating roof that any of the sis true but because there is in new york an aree hates donal trump and all the rest they decide that it is true and donal trump saying that it is not true and that she is liar and all the rest of this that that now amounts to defamation and they have given him an judgment of eighty eight milli idn dollars eighty eight million dollars meanwhile in that other case thas img up with letishu james judjarther engron is going to issue his decision on financial penalties james at once trumpin is trumpeties to be orders be three hundred seventy million dollars you are talking bout in total four hundred and fifty million dollars removed from presidin trump if this judgment were to go through trump is appealing all of this obviously but dom the effort to bankrup dom not to criminally prosecut iom but the bankrupt him as well is truly an astonishing astonishing thing and the goll here is obviously to make him tox tat 's not possible to bote for him is the case that te the estimable a o c is making that trump cannot win a general election his primary numbers are low and all the rest of it but i do one osk you about the presidents re election campaign as as tom of these he battl ground states he has the real vulderabilities why do you think he is struggling aganst forer president donal trump some one who is been indited for times that who is now tan flap with this eighty three million dollars civiltu whn't i think we can take a look at the over all landscap here im if nonjus we were tocking out with preident byt im but i but forme presden trump also has extraordinary von our bility is we sto at in new hampshire i the fact that he is a former siding president had of his party virtually every one els has tropped out an en dorsed him and still as we just saw nicki haly i cam in ou he chan't clear about forty three persent an new hampshire bo i very not well o for donal trump and has the bility to win a general election now agetn withall donl trum foibles with all of his failures with all the rest to the sort ofstuffed don trump is still the leader riht now if ou looke the polling data right now he is up in the real clipolitics pulling average by more than for points which really means five or six because the polls ten to under represent donal trumps base of support th latest roiters ipsose pole thay came out the twenty fourth haddonall trump up five on jobidon in fact there has not been a national pole in which jobidon leads it since the beginning of the year when you look a the state polling data thing start to get a litte more interesting if you look at for example wisconsin you have not been pulled all that much latest pole is in lik beginning of december donal trump as up four right now real clerpolitics has that stacked up as it hige the latest polling in michigan is more recons and donal trumpts up very heavily in michigan in fact he is lead in the last four poles in michigan meanwhile last three poles and pennsylvania he is down the election re hell to day donnal trump led likely win the election by winning wisconsin as well as michigan but it is still a very close run thing why isnit such close rumthing pes gan go back to the gengthsho when it comes to policy jobidon is a bleapsho he is an absolute leap show pluss and combine that withthe fact tha he does not seem to be in control of his own faculties is a real problem for him here is jobidon over the wekcan referring to donal trump as the sitting president of the united states i serery resuy stotabo p e wa o o e wantye conmy crash you here soud he pres tho same i e

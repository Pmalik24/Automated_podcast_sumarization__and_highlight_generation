welcome to the hubermen laposcience science aceto i m inderhubermen and om a professor of neurbology and othemology at stamford school of medisine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor robert supolsk doctor supolski is a professor of biology and naurow surgery at stamford university his laboratory has worked on a large variety of topics including stress hormones including testosterone and estergen and how the different members of a given species interact according to factors hormones hierky within primate troops and how things stress reproduction and competition impact behavior one of the things that makes doctor sypolski's work unique is that it combines elements from primatology including field studies with human behavior in essence trying to unvail how humans as old world primates our controlled by different elements of our biology as well as our psychology doctor supolski is also a prolific author of popular books such as wisebers do not get ulsers the trouble with testosterone and behave the biology of a humans at our best an worst during the course of our discussion today robert also revealed to me that he is close to completing a new book intitled determined the science of life without free will and indeed we discuss the science of life without freewill during this episode we also discuss stress and how best to control strest and how stres controls us at both conscious and subconscious levels we talk about testosterone and estergen and hormone replacement therapy and how those impact are mind are psychology and our interactions with others as with any discussion with doctor supolski we learn about scientific mechanisms that make us who we are and to day we also discuss tools and how we can leverage those scientific mechanisms in order to be better versions of our selves i should mention that unlike most guest interviews on the huberman lad podcast this one had to be carried out remotely due to various constraints you may hear the occasional audio artifact please excuse that we felt that the value of a conversation with doctor supolski was well worth those minor minor glitches and indeed the information that he delivers us is tremendously valuable interesting and in many cases actionable as well before we begin i'd to emphasize hat this podcast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens at letic greens is an all in one viteman mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there easen i started taking athletic greens and t reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essetialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer the will give you fie free travel packs plus a year supply of videmen d three k too there are ton of datand now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wofre getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemen d three and k to is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstokcam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fi free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ive talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodiu magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolytes if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok cam slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok cam slash huberman and now without further ado my conversation with doctor robert supolski great will thank you much rober for joining us to day i've been looking forward to this for a very long time a appreciateit whas clukto beer theres an enormous range of topics that we could adrill in to but just to start off i want a return to a topic that as near endear to your hart which is stress and ont of the questions that i get most commonly is what is the difference between short and long term stress in terms of there benefits and their drawbacks and the reason i say benefits is that ovicy stress and the stress response c keep us alive but stress of course can also sharpen our mental acuity in things of that sort how should we conceptialize stress and how shall we conceptialize stress in the short term and in the long term well basically serto two grafts that one he draw the first one is jess all sorts of beneficial affects of stress short term and then once we get unto the chroniss it is just down hill from there short term becaus it saves you from the creditor short term becaus your getving presentation and you think more clearly or ar your focus is better all surts an aspects of that and what then wants i being argument is how long does it take to go from short termed along term and that somewhat arbitr e but the sorts of chronic stresses that most people deal with are just undeniably in the chronic range having spent the last twenty years daily traffic jans sor abus bal sir some such thing uthe other curve that sort of perpendicular to this is dealing with the fact that sometime stresses a great thing unlike our goal is not to cure people of stress un because it is tha right kind we love it we we pay good money to be stress that way what a scary movy or will coster o it umwhat you want o seeing is wonites the right amouns stress it is what we call stimulation and the basic curve there is hures an otimal level of stimulation and too little and function goes down with what we call bordon and too much function goes down with what w we call stress and the timum is what all the same for in terms of the benefits of stress in the short term one thing that is really striking to me is how that physiologically the stress response look much the excitement response to a positive event and we conspeculate that the that the fundamental difference between short trm stress and short term excitement is some nermodulator dopomine or something that but is there anything else that we know about the biology that reveals to us what what rely creates this thing we call vailance that an experience can be terrible or feel awful or it can feel wonderful exhilarating depending on this somewhat subjective feature we call vilnce what do we know what vailance is or where it resides on a really mechanical level uif you areacircumstant that is requiring that your heart races and your your breathing as fast in your using your muscles and some such thing a youre g to be having roughly the same brain activation profile whether this is for something wonderful or something terrible with the one exception being that if the emigdula is part of the activation this is something that is coun to be countings adverse a whether that the circumstance an adverse circumstance recruiting the emigdula into it and how much it is imigul being involved oeses you towards interpring it is even more awful the emigdula in some ways this kind of the check poinis to whether r talking about excitement or terror let us use the emigdula as a transition point to another topic that you'e spent many years working on and thinking about which is testosteron an other stexteroid hormond i heard you say once before that a among all the brain areas that bind testostron that you were testostrom can parkan create af facts that the emigdula is among the the a the most chocabloch full of these parking spot these receptors i realize theire's a lot here but how shall we think about the role of testostron in the emigdula given that the engagement of the emigdula is fundamental in this transition point between a exhilarating positive respons and a a an a negative straswal response or maybe just broadly how shall we think about testostron and its effects on the brain and pertnen to the transition from whether this is istresser that is evoking fear or evoking aggression omturns of that continue malso ause the emigdulas in the center of all for points on thos axies a basically am almost everybody out there has he completely wrong ideas to what tistostero does which is testostro makes your gressive because mals of virtuall every species out there ave more testostron and more gressive thand seasonale mators have tistostern surging at the time a year theire punching it out over territory and and you take testostron autof the picture you castrate any mamal out there including us and levels of the gression will rotem an the easy thing ventance to include to conclude that testosterum causes aggression and the reality is testostrom does no such thing does not caus aggression and you can see this o behatrlin in the emigdula what does testostron too it lowers the threshold for the sort of things that wouldnormally provoke you into the o that it happens more easily it make systems that are already turned on turn on louder rather than turning on progressive music or some such thing was thit look behaviorly you take five mal monkeys puttin together they form adominous hierarchy a number one is freat number five is miserable number three is writing between nout take number three and shoot the gy up with tons of testostron and hes go to be involved and more fights ah tistoster uniformly cor causes aggression but you look closely and there is a pattern to t is number three now challenging numbers two and one for their place in the hier absolutely not he is brown nosing them exactly as much as he used to what is going on o sees just a misrable terror to cor number four and five and in that case what testostrns doing is amplifying the cre existing patterns of the gran amplifying to social learning thus wordy gone into it now on cert of the more reductive level sotat as that translateinto the mictola does testosterown make a ma to lidenerons have action potentials does a cause those norons to suddenly speak about fear and figression spontaneously absolutely not what they do is if the imictola is already being stimulated it increases the bred of neroal fiering what arworth it it shortens after hypopolersations the theme there exactly is it is not creating aggressions just uping the volume of whatever gressions or dy there and once you factor that in no it is impossible to say anything about what testosteran does outside the contect of what testostron related behaviors how they get treated in ur in your siand in terms of a status in their relationship between individuals either non human primates or human ah can we say that testostrone and levels of testostron r i should take can we say that relative levels of testostron between individuals is correlated to status within the hiarchy om y yes butter the way the wines of being totally uninteresting am ye go back and are whatever number decates and chronology tects and the retrose hotally reliable find ince in there once the eyf a dog and hear that soia we dogs at the hubrmanlapodcaf ijingling of i are welcome they are absolutely welcome am and there be two true isms which is higher levels of astostron credit higher levels of a gression inpunes another nimals halass of testostran predict higher levels of sexual activity waa testostran cusing or and the correlations there an when you look closely we got cause an effects of sexual behavior raises testosral levels aggression raises testostran levels your levels beforehad or barely predictiv o what is could o happen sor stoscra than a cause am when you look at that though ind terms i making sens of individual differences they do not matter a whole lot a you can likeand an entire career on the social circumstances that preduce three and a half perset more testostro than the circulation and expect to see all sos of interesting implications and that is not really the case i somewhat of a yes or no mogulator of much more subtle social stof thats lredy there very interesting now i think that am there is a ther alotomous conseptions about human biology but testosteron seems to be one area were at least from what i can find on the internate ah there is a itsor that the pike of misunderstanding am maywe just ask a few more questions about testostro an sexual behaviour because there is an interesting story there about castration verses non castoration and the causality again am but before aum you address that i just when a highlight something hat you said i think it vital which is that behaviors such as aggressive behaviors in sexual behaviors can acually increase testostronite did i hear that correctly and the reverse is sort of true but not but not in a causal way that is at right the opposite direction the causality ye ye yes if i were to increase somebody is testostron by thirty percent male or female does not matter that their sexual behavior may or may not change esensually zer effect at all am your grain is not that sensitive to fluctuations and testosctral levels am min terms of things aggression raising testosterage segreat footnotes a if you have the right type of willing to die in the trencieus devotion sort of thing watching your favourite teen place for will raise your testostral levels as you sit there with a petatorships in your arm chair it is not the physicality of agression its tha h psychological framing of it ye testostron is not causing that and a greatway to appreciate that is okas at altis testostron sexual behaviour correlations and you do the definitive antecran intervention which is you do e a subtractions that o remove the testies an ns a it before levels of sexual behavior goes down good we have just shown that testostron the someon ol cause critically they go down but not down to zero whether you are a rat or a monkey or a puman whatever and what predicts how much residual sexual behave wis there how much sexual behavior there was before castration what thats telling you is by then that is behavior that is been carried by social learning and contects rather by hormon texact singthing with aggression drops after castoration does not go to zero the more crier history of it the more i jis keeps costin along on its own evin without testasteo very interesting i is can we say that there is an exception in terms of the early organizing effects of hormons for instance of a developing animal is deprived of u testostroner asterogen or a romatized testostron intasterogen there ist a whole story thereas but i then i could imagine that the circuits of the brain that are responsible for initiating sexual behavior in the first place might not emerge and therefore not be set sensitive to testosteron later in life is that right ye exactly and an a great way of seeing that is this totally nudty biological factyd o which is the second to forth disyour ratio an hands oya totally obscure thing the ratio once the other in some way reflects levels of testoster an andershin explosure during feedal life i cannot remember which we goes inc en scu need a thousand people in your safl sowus to beitle see anything whut you see it in other primates it is already there and feedal old somgrn ands all of that that is a redout of subtle differencis and crenatal exposure and that wants something a predictor of a whole ranges suttlesuf an the dull behavior ye at the feedal and when youre still building everything testosteron in the amount of that is making a huge difference by the time you are in adult is jests you somewhat of an old mon signal ye i cun have a confession which is that i was a master's tunat bertly and marked breed loves am arena sa i am a'm an author on that paper although i'm deep within the author line and a you you got the description of it exactly right that it is the deto the index finger to the ring finger ratio is more similar in a females and then it is ind males and males the index finger tens to be shorter and for people out there elisteni this who are now am freaking out or measuring that that there is tha proper way to measure this which is a it ibawling it does not work all the time unless at the extremes and there is somer interesting stories there it actuly as been rapplicated a no fewer than five times m mark brelove tells me am but yes and term a interms these early organizing effects am those are very a seem very robost on most studies these later effects are sort of activation of nerl circuits by hormones im absolutely fascinated by this and if we i do have a couple other a quessione which cis a we normally associate testostron with males but of course females make testostrone as well a from the adremales and imprisomably elsewhere to iam guessing if we looked pard enough we prirely find that there were other sources of androgens m in females it can we say that the that these general contours of effects on on aggression am but also pertain to females and om and i suppose i should ask in particular about female female aggression which does exist in many species female male do aggression as well as maternal aggression which is a robust aspect of our evolution of course that the mother will aan angry mother animal of any kind protecting her young is truly dangerous in the best sense of the of the word and that i es in cost orturision period after birth aggression is all about estrogen pogesto thin female aggression the rest of the time has testostron as natur clayer at much lower level on the average on the average orwesessy a bustas the same onslars in females the lower levels tistostenor are essensial for its ticnical levels of the gressionn sexual behavior none the less there not causings not senssmlitren differenc same exactthing you can it walser trust the importance andrgens in females just as readily as i males in line with that how should we conceptualize testostron i ra i realize there is not a single sentence or ah that can capture ai a hormone and all its effects because hormones have many different slow and fast effects on the brain on other glands on their own on the very lands that produce them but as i've heard you talk about testostron to day and over the years i start to get the impression that as the most misunderstood molecule in human health an the universe it it has it it is clearly doing something very powerful its its shifting the way that certain narl circuits work adjusting the gain on the emigdulas you described and and certainly other things as well is there any am truism about testostron and its relationship to effort or its relationship to am resilients and ain a way that maybe will help me and other people sor think about how to think about testostron na am i three secretas that firstone is i think it s a fair summary to think that when it comes to motive ated strong behaviours what tistosteron does is make you more of whatever you already are in that dome such larazlabido aggressiv nes spontaneous aggression react of the gression things of that sort it is opping the volume of thins ateralready strongly there om second way to think about it is we here is heres my favorite finding about teststron omin this thisless and wonderful work by a gyd john winga field who is one of the best behavior anda chronoloshists out there and about twenty years ago he formulated whotis call the challenge hypothesis of testosteron action what does testosterown do testosterown is what you secrete when your status is being challenged and it makes more likely that you will do the behaviours needed too holant our status oges o thas totally borein ly straightforward if you rebaugoon if somebody is challenging your high rank the appropriate response in your pard is going to be agression aras we have just got in through the back to or tistostrom an aggression again but then you get to humans and humans have lot o different ways of achieving or maintaining status and all you need to do is goda some fancy private schrouls annual auction and you will see all these half drunk alpha mals competing to see who can give the most money away as a show of conspicyues oukno property that they have and in a setting that i beli i'v have not been able to take your enxamples of those times and fortunallybut that shows the flipside of it if you have a species that hands outstatus in the very different sort of way tistostrons gould abose that also ocus to that generates a totally nuddy prediction wa take people in a circumstance ey playing an economic game where you get status by being trustworthy and being generous in yur inter actions with the game if you give people testostrom does that make the more generous in this absolutely the case totally cool finding om showing you unuobasecaly if you took a whole bunch of butist monks and shot him up with testostrom they would get all competitive with each other is to who could yo th most orandom acts of kindness and if we have a cesietal problem with two much aggression the first culplra to look at is not tistosterom the first to look at is that we hand out much damn elevated status for aggression in somany circumstances i i find that finding to be fantastic thirdthing about suttle chief testosternoca msubtler behaviour effects you give to stostern to people and they become more confident they become more self confident well that is good people pay to take all sorts of mon senseical self help courses that will goost yourself ostene and that is a good thing unless testostero makes you more confident that is inaccurate and you are more likely to barrel into wrong decisions what shown in economic gain lay is that stosrom by making more confident makes you less cooperative because who nuse to cooperate besomon top of this all on my own a testosteron makes people cocky and impulsive and that may be great in one setting but if in the others your absolutely sure your army is that over in the other country n three days sohew letst our world wor one you get a big surprisout of it testosteron altering risk asusen beforehand promptly play te big roll in that kind of is calculation superinteresting i always think about testosterone and dopomine being close cousins in the brain not just because of their relationship a through the petuitarian hypothalemis that of course but also because of dopomines sailient rol in creating this bias towards ex teroception when a somebody takes a drog wit that increases dopomine or their chaca bloch full of dopomine they tend an with hgh on highlight ten casisis an really generalizing t but they tend to focus on outward golls in a things beyond the the boundaries of their skin and testosteron seems to do a bit of the same it tends to put us into a similar mode of perceiving the outside world in ways a that we are asking questions how do i relate to this other of my species how do i relate to these goals is there anything that om we can du toc better conceptialize the relationship between testosterone and dopomne and motivation or would that just take us down the the alleyways of of nerl pathways and and the hypothalemis which was fine too well i think it is got lots to do with sr of this massor revisions abt dopomine every one since the pharaohs ta brought up in totedopomens oa pleasion and reward turns out it isent it is athat anticipation of reward and it is about generating the motivation the gold direcbehaviour meeded to go get that reward and before it your using elevate dopomin your tire life to motivate you to do whatever's go to get you entry into heaven after wike cind of no its it is doing that sortof thing sit is really about the motvation and what testosteron does even in individuals wo are not acgressive and why t stostro replacemen is often a very helpful thing for aging males is increases energy an increases a sense of theretess presence of ha leartness it increases motivation that is a whole aspect which thentakes into is your motivation to get up and go youll hand out lots of sup in a suit kitchen for holes people or is it to get up and go estically cleans o village a it is how much to do with what your make up whats before the tistostrion got on board it is activating ind an energetic sens tistosteron within minutes increases glucos op take into scalital muscle you just more awaike and alert than all that and that has a lot to do with what dopene os and as one might predict then gettinjest the right levels of of tistosteron i infused into your bloodstream feels great alabrats the will lever pres to get infused into the range that oftemis temen release o thitis your absolu lihe their their deeply intertoins now such beautiful biology there and i love the way yuncapsulate that their relationship i i one ask about esterogen om en we do not hear as about esterogen as often and it is always interesting to me now doing on some public facing education that testosteron is this very controversial molecule just to say it is almost controversal but esterogen a does not seem to hold the same a controversial weight and yet esterogen has a very powerful effects on both the animal brain and on the human brain of males and females om men a do not want their esterogen to go too low terrible things happen they will lose cogni function libido can drop a it men need esterogen as well but perhaps a may we we can put the sime filter on esterogen as we did on testostrone are there any general femes of esterogen that are that people shul be aware of or to you think that are generally misunderstood is it really all about feelings and empathy and making us more sensitive i i i sense not now an its once again very contextetendent and if esterogen after giving birth is playing a central roll and you wanting to shred tho face of somebody getting too close to your your kidens kind of thing we know it is notous worm fuzzy yo inpatheconstu esterogen no in loss of ways can be sumrised by if you had a choice in the matter between having a lot of esterogen your bloodstren wer not go for having a lot of esterogen it init enhances cognitions exactlas you said it stimulates mura genisis in the hyppicapas it increases glue cos and oxygen delivery it protects you from dementia it decreases in flamatory oxidate of damage to blood vessels which is by its good for protecting from cardevast elergicies in contract the asosteron which is making every one of ose things worse am this brings up this mind feeld of the queshi which is what about post menaposl estrogen and all sorts at lab studies with monhuman primas suggested that you keep estergen levels high after a monkeys equivalent of manapause and you arego to keep brain healthul lot better decreasing the risk of dementia stroke every such thing estergens great anti ox and all of that in the ninty u thing when heleum forgetting her name but when they were the first female head of the ni h a burned at hli a set up this massive prospective human study mo was go to be the biggest one of all times looking at the pluses among uses of postmanaposil estrogen and tens of thousands of women at this fiscere and they had to cut the shotn study surt because what they were seeing was estrgen was not only doing the normal bad stuff that you expect in terms of some decalcifications to but it was increasing the risk of carty f astoergicies and whwas increasing the risk of strocans increasing risk of dementia and this ground to a halt and everybody they stop the study an fronpagenes an everybody pant ta point and nobody could make sense of it who had been spending the last twenty year studying the exacts and thing thin primates enseeng all the protective effects and the explanation turned out to be lana those things weare lavon expected consequences noke menapaus and women at last different lengths of time that may be a factor riscetical what let us not start getting our study subjects more estrugen until their totally pase menapaus and when you have got that lag time in between you shift all sorts of estrogen resceptor patterns and that is wer all the bad effects come from while te tle monkey studies had involve just maintaining ovuatory levels intod postmanaposi period and you do that and yoet great effects estrogen is one of the greatest predictors of protection from al time ors disease alla but it needs to be physiological just keep going what continuing with your body has been doing for long time verses let the whole thing shut down suttlewan li try to fire up the col stoves at the bottom of the basean con thing and get that going there you get utterly different out comes and tat cost alota gemanoe consequences from people sudtnl desided at estradon this in fact your logically indangerin crusman hasily while that is fascinating and i never thought that these a stery harmon receptors could by not binding esterogen have being devoid of estergen binding i should say a could then set off a opposite by chemical cascades fascinating i gets the raises the question about testosteral replacement too whether not a people should a talk to their doctor before a too long a men and women talk to your physicions before too long a to avoid these a whatever is happening in these periods where there is not sufficient testostron and or estergen since i could am cause longer tern problems even when therapies are are introduced to to editional misery slash complications ca your tyna understand you look at women with the history wither without chusman palselestrician replacemen were it is done riht and you seen twenty years later or estrogen's predictor the decresresof ousiners thand you gode are tringed to tha the unpacking prospective ype studies how much estergen at which times estrogen is just a is a cach all turn for a munch of carmon's estrone estradial astro how much of each one of them natural or synthetic co try to figure all of that out and second coplication is is often hard say anything about what estricien does outside the contects of what progesteronis to and often it is not the absolute levels of either it is the ratio of theto this is such a more complicated andtcronsystem than tistosterone ando because you have tegenerte dramatic cyclicity that wi kno mal hi pethal the segrhas to dream of it is much much more complicated system thus ad lol complicated to understand let alone i figure up lok the ideal benefits ar of us now can i do not know what to make of the literature on a dropping rates of testostrone and disan endigrin disruptors what i was at berkley when tiron haze published his date on these frogs that were drinking water from various locations throughout the united states nocious in california and seem very severe endigran disruption of through blockadeor and of andergen receptors and all sorts of issues and you hear this all the time now that sperm counts ar droping that they are al these endercran disruptors that there is birth control in the water in the drinking water it all sounds starts to sound a little crazy and yet om i've also been fooled before by a i guess a a good example would be there is a lot of crazy stuff in the world on line about all the terrible stuff in highly process fruids and yet you have got very respectable people under chronologists that you see useff robert lustic saying yates a lot of these hidden sugars and thse amulsifiers theire causing real problem i've i've become more open minded about the question om and are we suffering from drops in spirm counts and tostostron end astrogen and fertility as a consequence of endicran disruptors in the in the environments and food or because of social reasons a s there anything that we can hang our hat on real data that your confident and orsa just a mess om no the phenomenn is sepure to be quite real a crossectional studiesi poculations or i still understand why of this is one of the first things at hasouded decreasing testical size an crcadiles go figure why that was on first contributions o this i think the phenomenons absolutely real and what your then left with this suclassin challenges which is this cuarrelate with something broad invironmental toxns which ons how much when cetera and the other one always being well a droping is not droping enough to make a difference how biger an effect et tis those are the jurys i still outs now it is an area that i know there is a lot of interest in and om you have got groups of people who will not touch a receit at a store because of the b pas that are on the inks of the and then who cut a peopleh who do not care about those things ats it is a fascinating aread i i hope that more biology will be done a there soon i'd to briefly return to distress om you described a study i once about two rats om one running on a wheel voluntarily one whose basily stuck in a running wheel and is forced to run any time rat number one runs in one case the rat is voluntarily exercising and in the other case the the rat is being forced to go to be class to speak but really and seen diversion effects on biology and i'd to just touch into this and use i this kind of a case study for stress mitigation in general i'm rather obsessed in our colleague david a spegal associe cheirpsycatriate stamford is obsessed with a this question of how humans can start to mitigate their own stress what what do you think about stressimitigation and and what should we do at individuals and as family s an as a culture to trying encourage people to mitigate their stress but in ways that are not goin a turn it into rat number to were we are being forced to mitigate our own stress and therefore becomes more thressful and what you see is rat number one gets all the benefits of that sercise rat number to gets all the downsides of severe stress with the same exact muscle expenditure and movements going on perfectly yoked great example that it is the interpretation on your head and iven't kept up with that literature but a'll bet you rat number two as having a whole lot more activity in its emigdola that is a rat number blonk o case a stress mitigation i'm anything i should say here i should preface with i'm reasonably good a telling people what is could o happen if they do not manage their stress but i'm terrible at actually managing stress or advising had a manage tot o much better with the badnes aspect of the i'm but what you see is by now just a class of literature half a century old sort of showing what are the building blocks of stress not who you step outside and you can gored by an elepant and can you row from your experyand sand what does not cula makes you stonger notan you could have a stress response but you are in the realm of the gray on of ambig youous social intoractions that sort of thing some people hav mass of stress responses others not at all and between enjoy it what ar tho building blocks of what make psychological stresstress and the first one is exactly what was brought up by that running study do you have a sense of control a sense of control makes stressers lesstressful and the running wheel shows that or studies where you you laberat where you college freshmen volunteer haven train that my press in the lever you are less likely to get a shock and to day you are at the lever they are working away and unbenowns to you the lever has been turned off and it has no effect an shock frequency but because you think you have some control you have less of a stress response if you are rat in doing this day in and ty out you are less likely to get an olds sense a control related to that is a sense of predictability rat get shocked human get shockd to whatever and the senaria lither is the shocks come now and then were the shocks come now and then and ten seconds before a little warning light comes on aman yet the warning light the shocks are a distressful you got predictability because if you'r not gettig narning lights any second you could be a half second away from the next shock you get a warning light and that if there is not one you have got at least ten second wirth relaxation it is coming you can prepare youare coping responses and best of all afterward when you are finely safe when you can recover from it and that is enormously protectprotective others outlet for frustration and en you take a rat whos getting shock than if it culd run on a running weold that is protective thing f it is do involuntarily if you have got a rat and e can gnaw on a bar of wood a stresser is less stressful a unfortunately if you have a rat or primate or human and their strest the akbility to pogressively dump on somebody smaller and weaker also reduces the stress response and displacement aggression expe can the fact that displacement aggression reduce a stress a counts for a huge percentig of earths unhappiness all those variables get social support as well that is a good one interpreting cercumstances as being good news rathe than that hurasa you have got thas very simpld sort of take on recipe of go out and get as much control and a much pretictability and as many outlesson as much socer support as possible and you coulto do just fine and you go out and do that and that is a recipe for total disaster because it is much much more subtle than that one great example o case of your getting shocks you one a warning beforehand get a litte warning litend second before eat shock it is wonderfully protective get a warning shop get a warning light one second before the shock does not do anything there is not enough time for you to get the psychological benefits of the anticipation now instead get the littl warning coming on two minutes before each shock and its get to make things worse because you are notger to be sitting there reveling and certain of your sense of predicta bility and it sunen mio you are to be sitting there for two minutes saying damn here it comes predictive information only works in a narrow domay similarly control do you ont to have a sense of control in the face of stress and the answer is only if it is a mile to moderate stresser because what is happening then your sense of control is completely independent of the reality of wayw av control or not but in the face of mile to moderate stressers a sense of control gets interpreted as wall look how much worse things could have been thank god i have control ofm on top of this masteryfate in contrast if it is a major stresser all that a ye arbitrary sense o control does is make you think o l god look how much better it could have been i could have prevented t and we all thet intutively we do that in h face of peoples worse stressors nobody could have stopped the car the way the kid suddenly jumped out it would not have matter if you had gotten them to the doctor a month ago instead of now it would not have made me you did not actually have any control and what you see is you absolutely ant a the hugeense of control over mile to moderate stressors and specially onces that result in a good outcome hurray for me and in the face of horrible stressors what you want to do is self deception than truth an beauty do not necessarily go hand and hand at that point and that is why stressmanagement techniques control and predictability whyndo being far worse than neutral if youre preaching that to somebody homeless ere somebody with terminal can ir were somebody whose refuge he tell a neuraudic middle class person that they have the sychological tols to turn hell into heaven and there is some truth to that do the same thing to somebody whose going through a real hell and that is just privilege heartlessness to do that because that does not work wr no outlets if your outlets or damaging that is not a good way to mitigate stress social support if you are confusing mere acquaintances for real social support youud have the rug pulled out from under you at some point if you are mistaking social support for being going and bitching and moaning ind demanding supporting thi from everyone around you rather than beaudoing some of that recyprocally that is loke a work very well i there do it is not simple it is not for nothing that lots of us are really lousy it being good friends and things some that and why it takes a lot of work tis li do in right because you you do it wrong and it may temporarily seen a great thing but when it turns out to be completely misplaced fath your could be feeling worse than before you started interesting these days there is a lot of interest in using physical practices to mitigate strastiar trying to get out of the ruminating and a to some ifthen take control of of nerl circuits in the brain by using exercise and using breathing and i hypnotis and and not and of course hypnosis has a mental component as well what are your thoughts on strest mitigation from the standpoint of oc to we do not want to be rat number two we want to select something for ourselves we have to take take the initiative for ourselves being forced into exercise thing is not it could actually have negative helphifaci perhaps we need to pick something that we we need to take control of it am in terms of supporting other people you touched on that a bit a what is the best way to support other people is it to talk about the stressful thing i may nom not asking to play psychologist here but a i find divergent date on this we can spin ourselves up into a lather by ruminating on something in language seems to me a at it is a wonderful tool but it is also a fairly to am deprive tool because it does not really get into the core of our physiology something breathing would what your thoughts on more i for lack of a better way to put it more head center cognative approachis distress mitigation verses kind of a going at the core physiology cold showers a now or even a thing to some extent just to get people stress aclimateit voluntarly taking col chowers now om that make some sens physiologically pre conditioning for when the ream stressers come ten ture to what you bring up ow transidental meditation mindful ness exoursise prayer sort of reflecting on gratitude all that sort of thing collectively they work on the average they work an terns of that can lower heart rad in clusteral levels and have al sors ogood out comes om but the come provises one's exactly the caviot tha comes out of the grunning you will study is it does not matter how many of your friends swear by the stressmanagement techniqu if doing it makes you on a scream your head off after ten seconds that is not the ones to to work for yo you read te fine print in the testimonials what is got to be something works for you another one is this stress management i techniques that work you cannot savem for the weakend you cannot sav hem for when your stuck on hold on the phone with yousac for two minutes it is got to be something were you stop what your doing and do iterversually daily or every other day and spend twenty thirty minutes doing it an what you see coming out of that is this eighty twenty rule from economics a eighty twenty eighty per cent of the complaints in storcom from twenty per cent the custimer since ic that what you see is if your entire life consists of every single thing on your shoulders that you cannot say no to twenty for seven if you have stop that and finally aid my world being is important enough that i'm finally a to say notice some of the stuff that i can sinotes you and i'm goong to do it every day for twenty minutes whatever stress mangen technique yo then do in those twenty minutes short of fwho knows what you are already eighty per cent of the way there simply by h thing decided your well being is simportant enough that you are go desot every single day and have the discharity and thus exactly sinfinding to find people with cromic depression untreated that you arely calling an getting in appointment to ceie mental house professional people start feeling better already becaus it is evidence that you have can activated and you matter enous to do this and you can conceive that this could actually hava good out com rather holjust in something meditated or reflectiv every day or and it hardly matters which one you doing and what comes aut of that is thus another warning which is do not trust anybody who says it is in scientifically provent that theyare grand distrustnanishment works better than the other ones just watch yo wallen that point wamen i think one of the corgoals of of my lab and david speagles labet i know you have worked with david and published papers with david as well is to really try and find out what are the various entry points to this thing that we call the autonomic nervous system and the stress system and these systems that when gone unchecked really can take us down a dark path and the idea that there are many entry points is really the one that keeps of what the data keep telling us over and over again there is no magic breathing tool or exercise it is i any variety of those or one of those and iagain we come back to this idea that it is the one that you select in the one that you make space for and it is the one that a you hopefully enjoy that is going to work best and terms of physiology and no not beninds for those people who resuck around you right right absolutely and you not that brings me to this question of i find it amazing that how we perceive an event and whetheror not we chose to be in that event or not can have such incredible you different effects on circuitry of the brain and circuitry of the body and biology of cells and in some ways it boggles my mind how can a decision made presumably with the prefrontal quartec although other parts of the brain as well how can that change essentially the polarity of a response in the body and i mean that you have talk before about typa personalities and that we do not have to go int all the detail there of forsake of time but it is interesting that the effects of endithelial cells i mean literally of the size of of the portals for blood i are in opposite direction depending on whether or not somebody wants to be in a situation is a highly motivated person maybeyou could just give us the top contour of that because i i think it really illustrates this principle beautifully and then maybe if you would you could just speculate on how the brain ight have this switch to turn one experience from terrible to beneficial what order from beneficial to terrible it is really fascinating well and all you need to do is to night before you are going to sleep in your lying in bed ind your liceent drows in your hearts beating nice and slow you start hinking about the fact that that hart is not going to be forever and imagine your toes getting col afterward and imagion the flow of blood coming to a halt and all of you clotding and if you r you are goto be doing something with your physiology at that point the ninety nine percent emamals out there only dother running frantically and you are cou be turning on your symthetic sesponse wit thought with emocons with memory in the measure of that is just how much the quartec and the limbic system sends projections down to all the autonomic regulators in the brain a you can think autonomic regula traner ons into action in ways that only other animals can do with extremes of environ to circumstances in given that and the autonomic rule mean the other big challenge aundestanding it is chigantic individual differences and tht you we talk about the automal amount of stress the counts of stimulation and in general that stress that not too severe and does not go on for too long is over all in a benevolent saying and under those conditions we lovh eing stressed by something unexpected and ati control in predict to biin who really interesting clot turn ind the movin our lotching that is great bhut you get the individual differences that somehow has to accommodate the fact that for some people the cerfect stimulatory amount of stress is getting up early for an audibon bird watching walk next sunday morning and for somebody else signing up to be a mercenary in emen and tremendous individual differences that swam any simple prescriptions you had the they prefrontal quartects the thinking machinery that we all harbour its such a double ege sword a and a whats a remarkable to me is how the verry as of the brain the hypothalemas ind the emigula they'r sort of switches i mean thet they theire's contacts in their gain control you talked about the gane cotroby testoterone et cetera but they are really switches i mana you stimulate venture me youl hypothalemas you get the right nerrons and animal will tran kill even an object that sitting next to it you tickle some other narms ittle tring mate with that same hobject i made athreally while the i think there are probably rules to prefront a quartec also but it sounds the the contect plurel from which prefrontal quartec can draw from i is pobly infinite am that we could probably learn to perceive threat in anything whether not's another group or whether not it is a sienthe or whether not it is a somebody is version of the shape of the earth vers as another i man it it is you can plug in anything to this system and give it enough data and i think it is oud you could drive a fr responde or a loverspot that overstepin or a mixed horribly ambivolent one that does changing by the millisecand when co metry contradictory now it is absolutely case an the prefrontal quartex i i more than once have regretted having wasted thirty years of my life studying the hipicap isured oinstudyig the prefrontal quartec it is much more interest in what it does and it is all this contectonal stuff it is all the ways and which it is not o cate a lie in this setting but it is a great thing in another it is noto ke to kill unless you do it to them and than you get a metal it is not all this social context te moral relativity and situational ethex stuff that is the prefuntal quartex that is got a master that and that wines a meaning that is place in your grain more than anywhere where you say your perception of things a can powerfully influence the reality of what is coming into you great example just harking back to testosteron oke exercise bosof testoster levels does exercise and success do it more than exercise and feilure a literature back and the adies or s o looking at outcomes a marithons to testosteran rise more in the people who win in the loosers restling match is things of that is for with a simple prediction and the answer round te beingugencyis simple answer o k you win the marithon that is not necessarily an increase of predictory increased testostero what is that about and then you find you the winner testosteram decreases and you find out the guy who claim in seventy third is having a mass of testosterand increase wo what is that about whats that about is far more human stlety the fird the guy who won the race has a decline at testosteron because he came in three minutes later than he really really was expecting and everybody nowas ga to be writing it up about how he is over the hill and the guy who came in seventy third is having boostof testostero because he was assuming he would be dead from a hard attack by e third mile instead he managed to finish it is this interpretive stuff going on and there and that is what prefrontal quartexes about amazing and i braise this question of cognative flexibility get can a can we tell ourselves that something is good for us even if we are not enjoying it and an we can we wriggle around these corners of of choosing the the exercise are doing that thet i personally am not a big fan of of am long bout to meditation but i've benefit tremendously from things dedicated breathing and short rounds o meditation am can i tell myself that it is good for me and wriggle around the corner and get my physiology work in the way i want do we have cognive flexibility can i be that am third place runner and tell myself well at least i'm i came in i wanted to wind badly that was my primary goal but another goal was to beat my previous time and i did do that and i mean it is t what to what extent can we toggl this relationship between the prefrontal quartaxen these other more primitive systems and an enormous amount am yo for example being low and a hierarchy a is generally that for health an every mammel out there including us but we do something special which is we can be part of multible hierarchies at the same time and while you may be low ranking in one of them you be extrumely highranking in another you are have the crappyes cop in your corporation but youare the captain of the chem st of the sophbalts ton this here for the company and you better bet thats somebody whose cun o find all sorts of ways to decide that mind to five monthy to fridays just stupid paying the bills and when really matters is n of the prestution we can you are poor but your the deacon of your church your and we can play all psychological gans wot that one of the most consistent reliable once that we do and needs use the front of qartex crazy is somebody does something rotten and you need to attribute it and the answer is that di something rotten because the're rotten always have been always will be this constitutional explanation you do something rotten to somebody and haw to yo explained it afterward a situational one i was tired i was stress thanthis sort of setting i tis understood this a we are best it excusing our selves an tad things because we have access tou are inner lives and we thought trefuntal qartexes that are greatas coming up with us situational expanation rather than he may be urjust a selfish rotens human we needs change and that is all prefrunta qartexand we do that every time we do not let somebody your merge in the lane in front of us even though you curse somebody just the same thing to yu an endlessly your i love it your statement about the fact that we can select multiple hierches to participate in am to me seems a particularly important one nowadays with social media being prevalent i know you are not particularly active on social media though a you might be unpleasantly or i do not know unpleasantly surprised to find out that there is there is a lot of positive discussion about you in your work as you do not neven need to be on there will just continue a to discuss yourwork but the but what is interesting about social media i found is that the context is very very broad i mean one could argue that who one selects to follow in which news articles youre reading at cetera can create ov kind of a fundling of information that itself can be dangerous more verification of crazy ideas or or even just less exposure to new ideas am but there is also this idea that social media is an incredibly broad contect as you scroll through a feed it is no longer being ing your aith great class room or your office or your faculty meeting you are being exposed to thousands if not millions of context this meal that socker game this person's body this person's intellect ah you tobe is another example it is a a it is a vast vast landscape and it is the context is is completely misshmash whereas i'm assuming we evolved i think we did evolve under contects that were much more constrained we interacted with a limited number of individuals and in limited number of different domains seasons tendd to be constrain us all in a of course then we got phones and telivisions in the started to expand but now more than ever our brain our prefruntal quartex and our sense of where we exist in these multiple hierchies has such a wicked out into infinity how do you think this might be interacting with some of these more a primitive systems and another aspects of our of our biology well i think what you get is in some ways the punch line of what is most human at humans which is over and over you see exact same blutrn the same cormons the same kinass the same resectors the same everything were built ut in the exact same s of as onlast of the species act there and then going usen in a completely nowval way and alenterms of being able to abstracts u on the sacean time in drunatic is soka you are a low ranking bagon and you conceal badly because you just cula rabit and your bout to eatand smhigh rankin co boots you often takes it away from you and you feel carmy in itstressful in your unhappy we arduing the exact same things with ar brain and bodies one were in losing a sense of self esteem but we can do it i watching a movy character on screen in feeling an adequate compared to how wonderful or attractive they are we can do it by somebody driving past us in n expense of car and we do not even see their face and you can feel belittle by your own socia economic status iam you can watch the life styles of the rich and famous or read about what esosis up to and for some reason toside your in your life as less fulfilling because youd can fly into pace for eleven minutes and you can feel miserable about yourself and ways that no other organism can simply because we can have our meaning ful social networks include the party youe reading about on face book that you were not invited to because it is taking place in see apoorn you do not know any of this people but none the less somehow that could be a means for you to feel less content with whom you have turned out to be do you take steps in your own life to actively restrict the contact in which you think and live and am and contemplate a in in order to can hance your creative life your intellectual life a i are those are those steps that you actively take am well i very actively do not know how to make use of anything with social media im i guess that counts as my having thus actively chosea not to learn how im that is the case certain for the last year and a half lots of people i mi've gone through stretches where i can managed ti sertivan forcea mors for i on looking at the news and ha was wonderfully freeing i ithink in the larger sense though im no in addition to me being a nurabiologist i srou spendecates any part of each year studying wild amoons out an a national hargonese africa an i'd spend three months a year without electricity without fun calls with you are going twelve hours a day without saying a word to somebody and when i finally would it would be somebody neumadic pasturalist gy in a different language ye i did ninety persend of my incightful thinking obout anything in the laboratory during those three months each year ar not one in the lan t not wen inundated with stuff i think there is a prova shifting tran towards trying to create a narrowing of contact a i that peop and i i what i see i have a niece yous fourteen years old and acheand our friends are very good at putting their phones away they say we are not an a have our phones for this interaction especially after and i realise wer still somewhat in this a an un clear were were teaded but at twenty twenty was restrictive and she was separated from her friends now it is let us really focus on being together and not bring in all these other elements from our phones and i ha that brings of me great hope for that that generation may be they will a ornos may they will run off and study baboons we need more a fieldry thirters a alon the lines of choice a i to shiftiar slightly and talk about free will about our ability to make choices at all well my personall youway out and left feeld inflamatory stance is i do not think we have a shred of free will om despite yo ninety five percent of philosophers and i think probably the majority of n your scoentist saying that we have free will n eleast some circumstances i do not think resenting it all om and the reason for this is you do something you behave you make a choice whatever and to understand why you did that werd of that intention come from am part of it was due to the sensury environment you were in the previous minute some of it is from the hormon levels in your bloodstream that morning some of it is from whether you had a wonderful or stressful last three months in what would indeuroplastisity happen part of it is what hormon levels you were exposed to is a feedus part of it is what culture your ancestors came up with and thus how you were parented when you were kid all of those her in there and you can understand were behaviors coming from without incorporating all of us and at that point not only are there all of these relevant factors but there ultimately all one factor if youre talking about what evolution has to due to your behavior by definition your also talking about junetics if youre talking bout what your genes have to do he behavior by definition youre talking about how your brain was constructed or what protines are coded for if youre talking about your yo disorder now your talking about the sense of efficacy you were gettings afive year they are all intertoined and when you look at ll those influence is basically the challenge is show me aneuron that just cause that behaviour or show me in otr onerancs that just cause that behavior and show me that nothing about what they just did was influenced by anything from the sensury environment once second ago to the evolution your species and theres no space an ther to fit in a free will concept that wines of being yiu in your brain but not of your brain tou simply no legal room for it there i can appreciate that our behaviors in our choices are the consequence of a long line of dominos that fell prior to that behavior but is it possible that i can intervene in the domino a fact to speak etom in other words can my recognition of the fact that genes have heritability there is an epigenome that others a hormonal contacts there is a historical contact can the knowledge of that give me some small small shard of freewill meaning does it allow me to say a og i accept that my choices are ore somewhat predetermined and yet knowing that gives me some additional layer of control is is there any philosophical or biological a universe in which that works tat om all of that can produce the wonderfully positis bewef that change can happen even throughout a change in worser circumstances most unlikely people and change can happen things can change a do not be fatalist ic do not decide because we are mechanistic biological machines that nothing can change can happenbut where people go off the rails is translating that into we can change ourselves you do not we cannot is there is nofree however we can be changed by circumstance and the point of it is you look at han a clesia a sea slug that has learned to retract its gill and response to a shock on its tal you can do conditionin poglorian conditioning on it and it is learned its behavior has been changed by its environment and you hear news about something cerrifically depressing going on an you refuges and in wherever and as a result you feel a little tit more helpless an e less it a sense of efficacy in the world and both of your behaviors have been changed oceoce agas but the remarkable thing is it is the exact same nerbiology the signal transduction pathways that were happening in that sea snail in corporate the exact same kinase is 'n rodiases and phossitases that we do when youre having memalian fear condition or when youre learn it is can served it is the exact same thing it is simtly playing out an obviously a much much fancier doman and because you have learned that change is possible tespite understanding mechanistically that we cannot change ourselves volitionally but because you understand changes possible you have just changed the ability of your brain to respond to optimistic stimuli and you have changed the ability of your brain to now send you in the direction of being exposed to more information that will seem cheerful rather than depressicg o my god that is amazing what nelson mandella and marton your king than all these folks did while under the most adverse of circumstances they were able to maybe i can also maybe i can go read more about people them to get even more day to points of changed in your chamistry that your responses are different now and your tilted a little but more in that direction of feeling you can make a difference instead of its old am hopeless enormous change can happen with the last thing that can come out of a view of we are nothing more or less tin the some of our biology ans intraction with environment is to throw up your hands and say and thus it is no use trying to change anything we can acknowledge that change is extremely hard to impossible that circumstances can change and yet that striving to be better human beings is still a worth while endeavor to have that correct absolutely because simply the nowledge either from experience or making it to the end of the right neur biology class has taught you that change can happen within a frame work of a mechanistic neur biology you ware now more open to being made optimistic by the good news in the world around you you are more likely to be inspired by this or that you are more resist an to getting discouraged by bad news simply cause you now understand it is possible yet somebody who spent much of his creer working on th hyppocampus i have to assume that you are a believer in neral plasticity that nerle circuits can change in response to experience and that some of the same called topdown mechanisms of prefuntal quartecs that we were talking about before can play a role there that the decision to try and change and the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of experience can chape our circuitry and therefore make us different machine to speak ye and not only can say prenatal hormonic goser change the way your brain is bin constructed but learning that freenatal harmon explosure can change the construction your bring will change your brain right now and how you think about where your intentions came from whal maybe that had something to do with it the knowledge of the knowledge is an effector in of itself that such an important and powerful statement not to hear i think that many people think that if a tool it is does not involve a pill or a a or a protocall i that it is useless and certainly there are pills and protocalls that are very useful in a variety of contect for a variety of of things but the idea that knowledge itself where as you put it knowledge of knowledge is itself a tool i think is a very important contept for people to imbed in their minds and listen i i'm grateful for this discussion and for you raising these topics i think that peopl i many people know your work on testostron on strass and we have covered some of thout to day the work on free will and this idea that we are hopeless am or that we are in total control ii ive i think i'm realizing and listening to you that it is an n ither neither is true and that the solution resides in understanding more about free will and alack of it i and and also nerl plasticity am your working on a book about free will am are you willing to tell us a little bit about that book and where you are in that process and what we can look forward to ya it is go on really slow am title is determined am a science of life without free will an essentially the first half of the book is trying to convince a reader okaif not that there is no free will whatsoever but at least there is a lot less than is morelassumed an a'm going through all the sandard arguments for free will and why that does not make sense with twenty first century science am and that has led to leading reading a lot of very frustrating philosophers who asicaly ar willing to admit that stuff is made out of adams nd moleculls and tres o physical reality to the worll they are not just relying on magic but that they believe in free will for magical reasons and where does not excenc ocase the first half of the book is to hopefully convinced people tat there is much lust free will lease think and then second half is this gigantic juncture built aron the fact that ieven't thought there is any free will since i ras sling an adolescent m and dislike thinking that way i still have absolutely no idea how your suppose to function without belief how are you sucoster go about every day life if anything you feel entitled to is not true if any angers and hatreds you feel our injustified if there is no such thing is appropriate in or blame were punishment or praise a reward none of it makes any sense and somebody even compliments you in your hair cut and you have been condition to say o thanks as if you have something to how ere we supposed to function with that come and the second half is wrestling with that and what the punch lined there is is its good be credibly hard and if you think it is goo to be har to subtract a notion of free will at of making sense of serial murders its could be a thousand times harder of making sense of when somebody says good job to you and is it is the exact same un reality of sort of our interpretations it is gold be incredibly hard but none the less when you look at the history of how we have subtracted the notion of agency at of all sorts of realms of blame starting with thinking that which is caused hailstorms five hundred years ago to the notion that psychodynamically screwed up mothers caus ketsofhrania we have done it we have done it endless number of times wem been able subtract out a sense of olition in understanding how the world works around us and we do not have nurderers running amonk on the stree and society has not collacsed into a puddle and in fact it is a more humane society the good news is it is possible becaus we have done it repeatedly in the past but it is goong to be hard as hell and it is hardest held to try to write about that coherent la om disgoverents o it is goan slowly well i speak of for many many people when i say that we are really excited for the book when it is done and we will patiently wait a but with great excitement for the book determined you said as the title correct yo determine the science of life without free will seems at yeu cannot publish your book these days without a ub titles o that is as its fantastic well very xide to read the book am very grateful to you for this conversation to day i learne uton am every time you speak i learn and for me it threally been a pleasure and a delight to enteract with you to day and over that the previous i yeurs am i should say as as coliton im thank you again robert for a verything that you do and all the hard hard work in thinking that you put into your work because it is clear that you put a lot of hard work in thinking and we all benefit as a consequence thanks s thanks sir havinis last thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor robert supolski if your enjoying this podcast and learning from it please subscribe to our utube channel in addition you can leave us comments and suggestions for future episodes and guests in the comment section on you two please also subscribe on apple and on spodify and on apple you have the opportunity to leave us up to a five star review end a comment in addition please check out the sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of this podcast that is a terrific way to support us and for those of you that are interested in supporting research on stress on sleep and had a better access sleep and combat stress you can do that by supporting the research being done on those topics in my laboratory you can go to huberman lab dot stamford dot e d you and there you will see a tab entitled support research in the huberman lab that is for work at the huberman lab at stamford not the huberman lab podcast and there is a make a donation tab where you can make a tax deductable donation and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that areof the absolute highest quality and aship international if you go to livemomentous ot calm slash huberman you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the huberman lab podcast and you will find various protocals related to those supplements and if you are not already following the huberman lab on instegram please check out huberman lab on instergram and on twitter on both those channels i post information about scients and science related tools anywhere from one to five minutes some of that information overlapse with the podcast but a lot of it is unique and different from the information on this podcast and last bat not least thank you for your interest in science

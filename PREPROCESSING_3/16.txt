i last night was the superbull and i have notes we will start with the non political notes and thn we will get to the political notes on the superble no number one that is kind of political is the people my age are now the olds a dairryacting to this the same way that people of my parents generation used to react too i dun' know prince showing up a in now it is us we have become the old people because people who are ten years younger than i'm a man i grew up with ush er all man i grop with ludicrous and i'm too old for even that si'm i grope with brohms in baytov an now who tese people are whenever i watchd the half time shryfeel more than a little bit out of tuch but the big note here is that my generation is now the generation being pandered to which means we are the old which means by the way that oure country is aging pretty quickly the fact that we are constantly pandering to whoever is the group of people who are the biggest tdemographically and tha group of people have taste that runs toward two thousand four which is when usher's biggest album came out apparently i ive nly been told is by my staff inna but apparently as when usher was super huge was mid two thousands and i is now tyo thousand twenty four demonstrates once again this country is now the young country that has some fairly significant rabifications for the future of the country but again wi'llget to the political later ive other notes we will start with the actual game an then'll get to the half time shop to the actual game patrick mahoms unably cit i mean that guy i did not think i'd ever see anybody was as good as bradiy just on a pure talent level mahomes is better than ray he can run better than brady he can read from the pocket as well is brady can his cuby are in the first six seasons is higher than tom bradies was in his first six seasons mahomes is truly a tremendous quarterbacking ye can feel it iiv ben to a couple of superbolls the first one that i went to involve tombrady and then the second one that i went to also involve tom brady and it was late brady but you always felt comfortable with brady having tha ball in his hands and ein that last drive wher mahomes is coming down the field you feel as a fan comfortable watching thatrick mahomes of the football an away that you do not with somebody oactur brockperty a get the fact is that mahomes with the football he knows what he is doing and you felt comfortable with a three point apisate him coming down the field and having a shot at winning the gan because he is truly in amazing amazing quarterback also ah i would just to point out this point that tho travis celse's crazy person this would be tailor swift boy friend and he is really good at his job e's an excellent tiden also he is a nut case now to be fair pretty much every one in the anafell is roided up beyond all reason but very early on in the game there is a fumble and travis kelse comes out and just destroys andy reed s it was amazing he who is mad that youl comes up toe ando read me bumps in he is all shewing out shewing out this this elderly walris is real weird here is travis kelse doing that i's kme hat a mans he comes up to him i bums and re's it what trad trat travis kellsy comes there as to be pulled the way by other members of the team he was informing him that caflein kennedy should not be allowed run the starwords universe any more it has to stop it is just bad good luck to travis celsy and honestly i'm i'm happy for trais celsee becaus he was this closes to being the subject of tailor swifts next break up song but then whe was saye by patrick mahomes now maybe the tailor swift baby boom is going to happen tha's ben my prodiction is that travis celsee is goin o propose to tailor swift hey're goin to got married there n have kids and suddenly a bunch of femin ise stee thirty two year old who never got married because girl power are ging to realized marriagers good then have babies en tas gin to save the country maybe that is the way that our country at saved is by travis celsy and tailor swift having jenetically perfect babies maye maybe that is the way this actually works of get which brings us to that fanbox thi's the first i'me eve ever watched to game or tailor swift is in the is in the skybox where it my iter was not directed a tailor swift somehow ice spice a person whos name is ice spice made me tailor swift more why well because tailor swift was always the neeo fight in the boxright tailor swift was always the person where you why she here tos she understand her football works how seriously to she follow football why we pretendingla she is big football fan when she is been two games ever maybe and now she is there exsplaining to ice spice how exactly football worksy litterally explaining to her at the superboll that this one team goes that away and that other team goes the other way an ice spice is is watching all of this as though she is trying to process hiher maphmatics whe knownor rider at the oscers a few years back here is a yer tailor swift trying to explain to ice by talfootball works sh geat an thn they go that way and you see that wan an ice oman oh i get it now littl bet but at sche asneally get eitan seen her eyes that chas no clue at tailor swift is talking about 's i tailor swift is teaching her calculus or something it u to that may me tailor swift a little more because tailor swift at least knows halfootball works and ice spice as many people pointed out stole her hair from manny id i do not understand what is going on in any case my favorite part of that was that this culminaed in the chief's winning the superboll an ice spice celebrating with tailor swift as though she knew what the hell was going on bike bunch of thirteen yer old girls frgnao pretend that their best friends for ever even tho two of them hate each other ice spice just being super excite what is going ont she has an know but she is celebrating crazy with brittney ma homes who by the way has loke a little more in vestment in all this a briting ta homes tat she marry o the quarter back brating ma home's been dating the quarbacs in hice school tailors the the nuwby and then ice spice is there for no reason in any case herigo whyse ice spice in the middle of the scrum why no one knows by ice spice is there that was thatw's the thing noes happening aswell will get's

of all envy p is autotune as always ottotune saves every single artist who has produced a piece of music since autotune became a thing because legitimately none of these people can sing live it is inratible it is true of everybody wh's in the stands by leves more tawens thn the stands than the rus on the field for the half time show you had tailor swift in the tands at just in beburnhants but none of these people without artitune can do a thing usher wi've been informed is an artist of some sort by my tame they the're'll big usher fans if usheris lisending to this savy says to la i ii i do not know why but in any case usher comes out and he plays his heads again i do not understand why he is famous becauses i do not think his hits her good but im usher comes out and he tries to sing points for points for moving around a lat sasher's a etter danswer than heis a singer and i it can of look this o sa herry as get at one point he took off his shirt for some reason and then non sira dancing around and by dancing i mean spastically moving his body and the meams as when you are over the her dotor asks you to show them where it and that is what it looks another one that i saw was you when you wake up andtere's a spider on you and ta that that is also that is also accurate to points for affert for usher who also rollers gated sows thaw's interesting they will pulled a munch of artists out of er tirement who i again this is not my bag as as america's top rap artist i i did not know any of these people but that is because again i'm out of touch with the younger generation which is to say the main stream older generation the eight year old in th room ful of sixty year olds in this country now that they they brought forth will john whose famous hit is turn down for what which involves him screaming at the top of his longs turned down for wat they brought forth a person who is not sealo green i who isa whose name escapes me ii reenoplay turn down for what hair yad this is that this was very funny i t they'r plaing yea they are playin that they cut in real close on lill john screaming at the top as longs turn down for what and there is an unfortunate man who gos flying up in the background knowone knows what happenen when he came down it was it was awkward every's jumping around then here he goes he gon o that man is dead somebody should check on that gi loll john was there to scream into microphone ludicrous showed up and was indeed ludicrous and alsodress ben stiller from dogeballs that was thing that happen and a olisha kee's shut up and she cannot sing sat as tousad yet there is doghaball ludicres he shuwed up wearing i ding me nowt he is wearing si rollablating uniform that thats strong i agiz in't understand a whatever we we maybe our society is too wealthy maybe that is maybe that is what is happened here okga now to the actual politics of the superable first first thing to otice about the superable this year they really tried to keep it ay politicale they played the call black national anthem before the game they have done this last few years since sjeorge floyd died but they played it before the broad cast relese and nobody i think saw it i remember ow that the superboles the same kind of thing a they they they played it but they played it far before the game that that it was kind of non controversial and then that alowed the usual suspects to foss about how people did not stand for this s black national anthem wich again there shouln't be a black national anthem here' just one national anthem you on a sing a song that that is fine i'm not sur white need a separate black national anthem at the one event that every one i the contry waches together but in any case the kun o message of the superble from all the advertisers was non controversy they are all desperately trying to avoid controversy because what people kind of just want is normality i know the superables werd place to get up at that is what people wanted tey just wanted a football game that was about football without the politics without the crazy of the past few years and that is what every commercial was about pretty much every commercial wash stone normal ninety ninety six level commersial with zit wit with nothing really provocative about that which is why when there was something provocative in the ommercials whot realy stood out really only two sort of provocative commercials along these lined one was in ad for an organization called he gets us the hebeing jesus and it is controversial because this take on jesusus hippy jesus now obviously m not a christian i'm northrox jew but i have read the new testament and virtualy all my friends or very religious crestions and i'm i will points out t this point that even some one me understands that the message of jesus is not one of unending tolerance for behavior it is love of human beings but not tolerance for bad behavior but apparently the he gets us campaigne is that how jesus really really is fine with everybody's behavior which is not the message that i got from the new testament where that is clearly not the actual thing thet jesus is saying jesu as petty hard core in any case su were some of the he gets us add campaign which completely does not get jesus but again all tat christian speak to that but i'm pretty sure about this one the the ad begins with im people washing each other's feet because apparently jesus was big into the feet washing bu t not because the acthen wanted to promulgate his belief system just cause he apparently really loved washing washing feet s e've got a cop washing the feet of some some dud you have a cheerleader washing the feet of red haired lady you have a whike gey washing ton of nat if a merican and then my favorite you have a lady wo sort of a suberban mam washing the feet of a lady outside a family planning clinnek im unless she is also trying con vince that lady nots havin abortion i'm pretty sure jesus not hot on the abortion as it turns out i you have poor lady having her feet washed you have native a merican lady in viromentalis having her feet washed you le e limigrant having her feet washed agait again muslem having her feet washed i mean not to be weared about this but christianity is in fact a prosilotizing religion my understanding is there ar certain values christiany wishes to promulgate have im ol people washing the fee togther we have a m aa christian priest washing the feet of somebody who appears to be drans which again jesus not hot on the boys are girls proteen is my understanding in sis jesusus did not teach hate he washed feet i would just to point out that jesus did more than wash feet men it again i do not mean to be to christian proslotizes her here because i'll leave that to others were actual christions but im that is not all he did and hate of what in fact jesus did teach hate of sin an jesus when or fan of silly my understandig of the merry magalen story is that he did not say to her let me wash er feet now go back to being a and i'm fine with it pretty sure that is the opposite of the story ye to tat got political lod people on the righton the add i am one of the people who did not the add again i i i i believe that christianity and people going back to church is maybe the only thing that can save the country in reality and be water down fversion of christianity that basicallejust paganism is is something i i'm not a bivantam it is moren thit is just one second first i've been talking about by he looks mattress for years i've had it fer in almost to decateat this point i love it it is the gift that keeps on giving every night when i climb into bed before my little daughter wakes me up at six ofclock in the morning i realize that this mattress is the only thing keeping me alive if you have not already checked out that he looks e leed collection you need do he loks harness is years of extensive tha mattress expertees to offer a truly elevated slep experience the he looks the le collection includes six different mattress models each tailor for specific sleep positions and from hiss preferences if your nerves bout buyinga mattress

president's day the bundle includes to freepillows the sete sheets and a mastrous protector hat don over to helick sleep dot com sflash ben use code helicks partner twenty five its the best offer yet sunkin last long that helic sleep dot com slash ben use code helics partner twenty five that was political ad number one politicalad number to ase h little warmer on and that was the r f kad there was it in a super pack for r f k who put out an ar f kad turingthe superableso let me first state this is supersmart this is really really realy smart the reason this is really smart is because jo bidon for went the honorary superable interview that every in cumbent president gats an the reason he did that is cause he is too old for the jobany can no longer function as we saw last week as wi'll get into in just a moment and donal trump did not take out an ad i do not know why trump did not take out nad this remulic a perfect time for trump to take out and ad i assume may be the people broad casting the superolds didn wan trump to take out nad but the fact is that r f ke did and this ad is very smart the reason the add is very smart is because again it is seeking normalsy what the r f case superpack understands that when americans basically want is everybody to calm tafdown that is kind o what most americans want at this point all they want is to know that they go to work there cing to take home the vast majority of their money there mable t raise their families without being victimized by street crime that the're not ging to have their boys turned into girls or hatever that ey they just want a baseline level of normalsy that is what most americans are looking for at this point and what that is a throbak and this ad takes a nineteen sixty ad si obvious im bigin ta presidential history i recognize the sad right away this from the nineteen sixty campaign nd was an add for john f kennedy and 'sto throw bak ad and basically it is substitutes r f case fase into the adna i'm not a fan of the kennedy family i think chave cat was ha wildly overated president who ble blew it wildly on the baabags for example i think that the rest of the kennedy family teddy kennedy was a likely murderer and allso disaster ary of the human being r f k r f k junior father was a fairily corrupt guy with ta with tha very seemy personal life i'm not a fan of the kennedthe joseph kennedy the sion of the theyli the guy who founded the dynasty was a was a notsy sympathize orso again farbeat from me to be saying that the kennedy families anything special i i do not the kennedy's as a ken family but they do have brand recognition as you might say in american politics and r f kake gloming on sthap at not glomming on to his own father really as much as he is glomming on to the nineteen sixty let us get back to something resembling optimism in normality really smart really a smardad here is what the add sounded and i will narrate through it because there is not a lot of talk its thin as kenned for president and then it has pictures of r f k where the jaff pic pictures used to be and it is a ma shop of all these pictures from sort ofthe kennedy pass with r f k pictures and they'e using the exact same song and the they had all the songs back in theold basment at's his vote independent kennedy and wha what is the field hat you get from this ad of this advertite and then says knney for president and he looks a button from nineteen sixty this had is really smart because essentially ar of k this ad is basily say make america grate again that is really wit the atisbatis to throw back at and taine vote independent right you do not either of thse parties vote independenct uts not even about anything that are if ke is doing it is not again i think that is quite a brilliant add i think that you are actually are going to see better name recognition of r f k because if you leak the poles most americans do not really very much either of the two candidate or running for president and just saying vote independent and then slapping at kennedy lable on there is about as well as you can do with one of these ads and using all of the throw back in magery here is supersmar fo our ifcat junior very very smart ad and running it during the superable the singlemost watched event in america quite politically astute quite politically is du which brings us to jobiten the man who for went the superable again usually the superable it is a piece of propaganda on behalf of the current presidents of the united states because hou get these sort of honorary pre superable interview and ta and jobin just for went it huse did not do it instead jobiton showed in what he did react to the superable that he is wildly out of touch and also to old for the job after the superable there'v ben all these weird stupid conspiracy theories about how the see aa and the f b i were gon to rig the superabowl that travis kels would proposed to tailor swift and then tailor swifts would get up and in dorse jobiton ait is superable none that was ever ing to happen is incredibly dum and again it it comes from a desir on the part of some people to a sume what level of control in politics that is absolutely four clothes by the stupidity of most people in politics jobiton ton line team they then tweeted out o me after the chiefs one in overtime it is a picture of jobiton with the kind of dark brans in mean with the glowing eyes says just we drew it up anre obviouslyit is mocking the people led the conspiracy theory this is superonline really online es and this this conspiracy theoryes somethin that is been sor pushd by the medio and exaggerated by the media as a major thing in american life the fact that his team is tweeting that as uppose oug just sort of a warm welcome to the people who won the superable and this is the big take away very online very insolor jobi notvis theya nothing to do with it he has no cluits going on get's more on this in just one second first he still have that old car out there do not you you are tired of looking at it ureally tired of your spouse complaining about it i get it you are busy do not have time but i have the simple solution for you you should consider donating that old rusting vehicle two cars for kids you non't cars for kids here're one of that jingle that is now going to be stuck in your head the rest

out a getting a tax break go check them out right now got nothing to lose go cars for kids dot orgs slashben get that ball rolling and that was betrayed by the fact that just be for the superbold jobidon try to cut af vidios he does not do the interview but he does do a vidio from the white house about shrink flation shrink flation is this phenomenon in which you are spending the same for bacpotatorships theire fewer potatoships in the bad thet ser a hidden form of inflation whit just happen thanks you jobidon now he is trying to claim an this because of corpora greed when in reality it is because he crated an in flationary economy the worst in flationary economy an forty years but what is worse about this particular vidio is that you say that jobidon looks dath in this vidio is in insult to dath he does not look a warmed over corpse the corpse does not look warmed over it is it is quite honestly ig as an american whose president is this guy it is really frightening that a person who is clearly no longer alive is the president of the united states this is weakend o burne's time here is jobidon ovidio thathe caught right before th superble e suprbal sunday anyy ma you lit es on by snacker t a watc in the big game no when fine snaks for the game you might have notice on thin pors tes pos a small ba shipsi my the way they will cemin cot to chargin i yesas muc ye can

callin a com t a stop thitsmak ser businesi how many reen cit he have to do to get this much vidionero ogat that is a truly awful vidio he looks terible his big pitch going into the game is irike shrink fe first of all who is the political wonder kin who tolds in talk about in flation before the superbole his gas whose fault that is joe in the corporations by the way this the one time in american life or everybody count a likes the corporations they the adds most of the time americans lik corporation suck and they watch the youbolike that was a funny ad from from dunkan donus i enjoyed that tone daff not alive too old and that is the slogan for the twenty twenty four jobidin campaign the poles are getting worse and worse for jobidon on the age issue i mean truly awful for jobtans hat we have in the twenty twenty four lections s why the arofcy junior ad is smart well he have is a president who is far too old and terrible at his job i'm ore concerned about hin being terrible at i job frankly thing a lot f people are concern about the fact that he is no longer centians that he is a house plant hiding the water stane that is the democratic cpaty policy i'm more concern about the water stand to be ounse with you but by pulling data most people are very very concerned about the house plant himself see have that on the one hand and the on the other hand you 've donald trump who just keeps saying things stop saying things if you want to what it is it is just eiht the world's longest game of hold my beer it is just i in anycates well start with jobtan bran new eb c news ipsospole ighty six per cent of americans think jobidons toold to serve another from his president eighty six per cent calame slade eighty six per cent of americans don' agee bout anything you cannot get eighty six per cent of americans to agree that elves is dead you can not get eighty six per cent of americans to believe the moonlanding is real eighty six per cents of americans agree the jobidn's toold and the other fourteen per cents are direct members of jobidon's exstended family everyone knows he is tooled for the job every one knows he is no longer sentian every one knows he is falling apart fixty nine per cents of americans think both he and donald trump artoold twenty seven per cent think only bidons tols the fifty nine per cent who think that both he and trumper toold are basicly just saying we doft either of these candidates because if you contrast trump with bidon trump is clearly a much more alive human then jobidon i donald trump is fully alive jobidon is in the words ofthe princs ess bride mostly dead he means slightly alive but mostly dead and he is cannot need miracl mats to com ing in rebive him for anything remotely resembling a campaign here sixty two per cent of americans think trump is joold to serve as president seventy three per cent of democrats atd think bidon'stoold to serve only thirty five per cent f re publicans think trump isto old to serve ninety one percent of independensthink bidn's told ninety one per cent i do not see how you can win reelection under the circumstances frankly the only way would be if say the other candidate would not shut the hell up and just kept saying things that are likely to hert his campaign but the democrats are trying to walk past this one beause they have no mecan is m for gtng rid of him according to news reports jo bidon is very very upset she is very upset because the special council rport from rober her came out and it said jobite is certainly guilty of miss handalin classfight information but a prosecution f him would be unsuccessful because he is vegetable because he is the centially a druling vegetable and we cannot allow any trial of him because he will just per cent himself thus and everon'll gall i regen but that old gian jail prolly knots o do not bother wit the prosecution that is the case the rober hrd the special council made in short and apparently source is at enb s news relike while jo bidon says the report is in humane imean i guess you could choose the prosecution and se a that goes for you here as meet the press reporting the persont is close to the first slavy told me that she was directly involved ot the crafting out this fundery isin e mot jen kno well it is not alwayry rare the ca has that she said among other things that she wanted to speak out in real american mom tupsin this was not just an accurate that was in humane and then she also wante to make another argument that the first lady dhid there she said that americans benefit from each of the present ahtin one years is experience is expertince is what is alowed him to get things done or cay were benefiting from each of his eighty one ears h woman we coul get now his record and we will in just a moment can but democrats our trying to come up with whatever angle they can hers what they are saying is that the special council is bad now oh how every argument flips the moment it is your side when het was rober moler and donald trump was saing the special councel investigation is a joe can its to which huntand it is terrible an its politically motivated and thre's a gep state that is out to get me then the enti preslike that is un patriotic that is the president of the united states threatening dema croc threatening the buraracy you cannot do that that is terrible o there are hearts to flutter oh there are fands a waving oh there ir sweat of breaking out on brows across the media landscape but jo bidns an tired teem is out their senators members of h

of any of the interviewth robert her ah jobidon in any case here is criscoons what that po could have been about is who understands that our allianceis keep us safer jo bidon who is led fifty countries to come to the defens of you crane were donald trump who alarmingly last night bragged about a story were he claims he threatened a nato allied to throw them to the russian wolves if they did not pay up nato is not a protection racket but is a security alines the substance the difference jo bidon and donald trump and most elected officials make small gaffs just the ones ou justsioed that is not what matters we are in a fight for the soul of our nation and the idea that somehow jo bidon forgot the date of his sons death is offensive and appalling and what you should be focused on in by view what that phole shit of focus thouht what are nation sche o way bozle trump is undermining rule of law democracy nd our safety is a nation i get whatever tha it is insulting how dare the special counes howde then adam scheff he biggest political hack of our generation adam scheff who literally went into the green room an amisendy seeansenan for three years claiming that just around the corner was a bomshell that would link donald trump to ladimer puten slush fun that garbage human adamsheff he is out there now saying that her is a political hack oh pot calling cettle black here but der clinser trold if you do not remember pesectictlyar facts o things that happen years ago st ot in gomon you dn do not try to rein that wer tru place and there is to thing ave tha unusual about a ducsishon which people ca recalled yy cos to years ago but to to strapklage from tho and make a political tact that that is shust hackery by mister her wow hackery says the world's largest hacklec she hers the question if it is hackery by her then what they could do sthe firstvalt i'm with her but nanycate if it is hackery by robert herry not thay could do thy col releasolve the transcrept they could do that here is that jobine's layer taying that i can rely s hae the cripts i wonder why i wonder why you will not release the tape to interviews ihe robber her maybe it is because jobidon sounds seenile in them that would be the ratio ow but what you'r talking about and letters you reale make a cown there are in dhe transcript that you have of the congracation over the eighth and the not yes i going ger my recollections but yet soar transcripts on as you heard of einsanps in the pressbeatin room say youther discussions under way because it is a classify document anot what could or whether will be or when released i cannot at anything to that to day dyou faver releasing them welit really a decision that hase to take plision in the governments a classify docum he council on the presents personal council right would you recommend that tef the made public if they in dee back up your personal recca gan there is a prossess under way i'm not a spescialiss in that process an i really have to te church to those who have to work through those issues to thab they do not want those transcripts mad public be cause what its going to show us that jobidon is no longer sentient the blowback by the way here is somewhat by partisan a huge for sundenge of democrats also think that jobidon does not have the mental acuity to be president any more hillery clinton can always be counts not to shive every other democrat in the back hilldr clinton is a walking shive that is what she is ha human being here she was saying that jobidon's age is a legitimate issue perhaps the reason that hillery clinton is saying that is because hillery clinton she is currently howold this hilleclent now hilder clinton it is curently seventy six she is a spring chicken by our modern standards of the presidency and maybe she is thinking while if chow steps down maybe it is me maybe hope never dies in hilery land here she was go ing after jobi ni's age the thing the extoctor and all of thats the thing that we teep seeing in paul after paul after paul is concern about byens at wwell stop what should he do oni te see is it is a matter of sort of leg under scoring his boundless energy or whor should he embrace his ai't decades on earth in the and the great wisdom he is games thrl i mean to abo o abov by me not he know i talk to people the wight house all the time and he know they know it is an issue but as i to say look it is a legitimate issue it is a legitimate issue for tromp with only three years younger right its an issue once you say that then you have to also talk about what is a take in the election and i'm for joe bidon for reelection on the merits because i think he is tona reallyng a job is president gate she is not i'm bob costis right before the game isports casser he was yo have made it is time for jobid go away perhaps perhaps the time has come o the poblicans and fox knews and all the tributaries that come off o that will overstate it turnal blind on o the fact that tromn who has always been an unprinciple and reprehensible person is now a ranting lunatic who has men e da i is not true and when it comes to bidon this is the truth that no one until very recently wants to say out loud but my friends will tell you ive been saying it for four years this is emperor's new close stump joe bdon should have run on a firm promise that he would be one term president the only reason he is presedend is that he is not donald trump then the em ta ud om sorded through those people if bydon's hubrus is such that he does' understand the best interest of his party and more important his country that he has to be shown the door hery gat costis is not wrong on what a democrats who feel the same way about this bit years the problem there is no wat gan beleve jobin is a stubborn old codger no one who tains the presidence he wants to leave it ever under any circumstances in that that 's just the reality of the ego involved here which is why bidons canpain coacher mach landrers he is ever n wet ever under any circumstances r is mish landrew how do you respond to democrats yo say they want o tee a change at the top of tha ticket i'm in the process of doing it right now and and demonstrating that the presnet its a tomplishment have really been second to not and joe bines ging to get up every day the wanthing joe biton his neven that a do is count on this he has never ever got a quit because that is not what he is not his in tire life not withstanding the fact that by the way he lost another shouter o manin this life an he got up and he went to work and that mister let difficulty with this other sin and he got u and he went to work and he is gen to kim doing that in other words he are not going nowhere which poulds democrats in ag he bove trouble if the republicans cannot step on their own leaps well good luck with that will get t that moment all right folks ineter attention from major announcement mark your calenders it is the epic return of back stage after almost a year way filming the pen dragon cycle jermy boring his back joined by mount wallsh michael mole's candizons andreclavan anmy jonas to morrow seven pm eastern six pium central is we go behind the scenes in beyond the hadlines is lot's gover an i cone one im mis a minute watch the sho live exclusively on daily wire plus tuesday night at seven pm eastern at six pim central i're not going to want to missit o cam meanwhile donal trump's reelects would be a foregone conclusion here if he could get out ofhis own way and that is the real question of the selection cychel jobidon cannot te feet his his own inabilities he cannot in he is physically limited he is mentally limited his capacity is limited he he really has a munchon boundaries that been set by reality for him and is own policies will gets o momentarily ardisaster area that are significantly increasing the likelihood of world worth there across the world mainly through his cowardice and in action donal trump has one factor under his control that jobidon dis not and that is the capacity to shut his face it is importan to shut your face when you'en't presidential election what you do not say is just as importat is what you do say you being on to v more does not mean the irgna win more votes donal trump dis ninetop his profile this point donal trump needs every one to be focased in on the fact that jobidin is a terrible president who is no longer competent t thold his office and that his back up is comla herris who is the world's worst lices president also not competents to hold her office but for different reasons that is what donal trump needs the selection be a referm rat fronmon to what what he does not need to do is make big booboos that alow the media to try to switch the narrative away that there is can of the usual trumpian nonsense i'l ag any of that is going to effect im the trumpyan nonsense would be stuff donal trump riffing about tailor swift before the before the big game he he rody tweet saying i signed and was responsible for the music modernization act for tailor swift and many other artists jobiding din do anything for tailor and never will there is no way she could indorse croked jobidon the worst and most crup president in the history of our country and be disloyal to the man who made her much money tbesides that i her boy fren travis eventhough he may be a liberal and probably cannot stand me i'll galec is dum stofinar who cares an it is on the dum cet by the way she is totallygan indorse bidon we we all know this right and 's travis i well get that again in a past world nown would care because who cares what a tighten for the candicity chiefs and a pop singor have to say about politics and in reality ounlings can move that many votes is it ga dum thing does at yet silly it is silly is that cganhaviny imback on the election no that was on connaviny impact but what donal trump says about policy that does alow for lines of attack to open against him that he does not need open donal trump was giving speech and ye's talking about nato dona trump's position on natoes that nato is important apparently thie's thet the intelligent version of dona from position on natois that nato is quite important in order to check foreign actors we have interest adversarial to those of the united stat ts and the european union which is largely what comprises nato and yes nato of course is in fact a tool to counter balance russian a grussian in the balkins in ou crane and other places and for all of the foolish talk about how russot is not an expansionius power i urge every one to pick up a blook any book about the history of russia the history of russia is literally a history of expansionism the kingdom o muskovy was a very small kingdom and the i was a very large kingdom and they got even larger undo the soviet union and they got a little smaller after he fall of sovie union and tot's gott n a little larger un of ladmer poutent the idea that russia is not in expansionist power he is not correct that is just not true but in any case doal trump could say listen nato important we it which is why we want every one to pay up we do not wish to pay the large share of te burden fornado we should pbay r proporsional share for nado and you guise who are in europ you should see how vital this is we rebuilt your economy with the marsial plan eighty years ago we ave rebuilt your economies to the point where you gots can have thse giant social welfare states where half your population is dependent on the government you can certainly afford a little but more for nado and you should i think that is the argumen that donal trump is making here o badly articulated doal trump is making the argument here that if nato does not pay up the united states will not that is called leveradge o caso using leverage is not the end of the world saying out loud things we will not defend our nato partners if they do not pay up is not exactly in inducement for vladmrputent to stop his aggression precisely here is that hereis donal trum over the wecan on of the precidente of ta big countrys stood up said well sirif we do not pay and were teck by russia will you protect us is id you did not pay you delinquent you said yes let us say that happen no i would not protect you in fact i would encourage them to do whatever the held they wund o kae he is obviously quasy joking here that is not halform policy decisions get made but does it matter when presidential candidates as i would encourage them to attack you if you do not actually pay n it againt this nonal trum speaking in hyperblicaus that is the language he speaks that is the reality hat you can telloeny's joking when he is not this a store by with it for sure never happen no major country got up and saids donal trump if weu do not par fair shar egnal let the russians in made us that is ta conversation than never happen in the same way that donal trump rutinelly retells conversations ithe other political acandidate who come to him crying for his support which is not a reality none of that happens nonal trum exaggerates for affact this in exaggeration for a fact but when your presidential candidate opening the door up to cretique is not exactly your smarti strategy the white house of course it jumps it directly on that with both feet suggesting that this was incredibly dangerous how could he possibly say the sortst off now the normal councers this is who did not invade you crane wil donal trump was president would be ladmer pouten 's all the talk about donal trump being bad fornato they are lotless violations of natos presumed reach or threat a tunatos presumed reach on derdonal trump than the wrunder drobitin caus your bins weakling but nato put out a statement nato secretary general yon stoldemberg shad nada remains ready and able to defend all allies anhe suggestion that allives will mout tofend each other under mines all of our security including that of th ou us and puts american in european soldiers an increased risks i expec the regardless of wins the presidential election the ou aslrman a strong and committed nato ally and then leaders in german in poland also swiftly criticized donal trump's comments the you understand where thei're coming from meanto the the reality is that if you are an eastern european country ore country in the baltics and the president of the united states you do not pay up and they might invade you and your tongbolic lofia or lithaania or a stonia an these places have gedy pes tat are my nue to compared to the gety p of the united states mean the gedy p of polen is six hundred and eighty billion dollars did yo the the annual budget of the united states not the gedy be the anual budget is ten times that amount let us say that you are polen and you are curntly spending three qoing nine percent of your gedy p into military golls including twice natofs currnt supercen target for fernato yeu you have to stay thyoue conspend a certain percentage of your money on your military budget in order to fulfil your judy undernato what is sa your polen and what you here from the presidents of te united states is that a collect an attack on the collective that is nato will be accepted by the united states long as it is lofiat in their paying say one point eight per cent or something if your polen is that make you saying winners that make you upset say an i understand edackle donal trumpit saying here and what he is actually saying is he is trying to leverage everybody in spending what they should be spending on their own defend spending but putting out that signal publicly is not the same thing is doing it privately because of course lander putent and company are listening and they sends any sort of weakness as he chance for aggression that opens donal tump up to critik that he does not need they does not nee that it is it is useless it is not useful to his campain to do that sort of thing other things tht are not useful to donal trumps campagn lashing out an nickey haley's husband why why is this a thing nickey hayley is not important in this race nickey hayley is not going to win any more primaries nicky haley was over after new hampshire mean to be frank swho is over before new hampshire this forace was over after iwa i said after iwa it was over it re mains over why donal trump is spending his mental energy going after nickey haley and then going after nickey haley's hus ben by proxy is this the sorestuff that iscan attract the suburban women that you need in order to win a general election i do not thing andof course it is not just about what he says it is about the fact that he opens the door this is trump is a personality one of the benefit of donaltrump is he does not give ableep right that is his big thing i do not give a bleep the problem is when you have the world's biggest target on your back which donaltrump does not giving a bleap makes it harder for you to get done what you need to get done i'm not saing he should care what people things i'm saying that he should care about strikegic thinking siid he is more likely to win for example if that the qon qua deep state has it is iy on you you should not do is refuse to turn over boxis of document to morrow i'll go after they request them just turn them over what is the point of anything if that all you have to do is just point at the elderly dottering seenile old man on the other side and win election whyyur bing an nicke haley's husband and allowing a spate ofheadlines ben nickhaly hus why just what woald's the logic here if you want from to win i'm asking this question because this is totally under trumps control the big prom for jobdon many of his probins are not under his own control for donal trump i know he wants to be inthe limlight i know he likes the rallies i know he is a commedion i get the jokes also what is the strichegically what why would this be hlpful forget about whetherhe is can win or not is this hepful here he whats going after nickee haley's husband the greatest president in my lifetimes she said i well never hun against him then she comes over to semiat mar laga siri will never run against you she breter husband where is a husband o hes away he is a we what happen to a husband what happened tor husband where is he he is gon a ga what he is actually implying right there what he is actually implying is than e halescheeting on her husband that is be clear about wha he is implying tar because that is wht he is doing there beenthese rumors long standing with afa davits and all thi sort of stuff where is nickehaley's husband he is an active duty member of the american military he is over sees right now how is that helpful again just forget about the morality of what he saying which i do not how is that helpful especially because again jobidon is a terrible president why not focus on jobidon forget bannikehaly focus in on jobidon the reality is thet jobiden's weakness is leading to a larger chance of a larger scale war breaking out for example in the middle east right now there several things happening one of the things that is happening is that apparently according to several uust offence officials this be open source intelligence monder rporting preparations are now underway for a total or partial withdrawal a vou usin colishen forces from eastern syria and a roch do to pressure from rnean back groups including catib hasbela an now you can make the case we should not have out outlet us over there but if you ware going to withdraw people you do not do it in the face of rawnee an terror if you wan to ake the case that independently we do not need people over there and it is waste of time in waste of resources make that case but do not let arane an terror groups corng wll drive you out of the region what ore they do after that they d clear victory what re they do after that they glafter the next easiest target whether that soudes or its ralees or americans for an other basis around the region showing your nack is the worst thing you can do in at eleast and the by deminstrations doing it over and over and over again theyre doing with regard to israel right now jobidon he believes that he can only win election if he panders to terror supporters in michigan that iswhat he believes and tat's why he is deploying top bidon aids two michigan to do meetings in dearborn to rip on the is railies who are in american ally ou knows non american ali hamoss not an american ally i willas lasti chak according to the times of israel youst deputy national security vis or john finer made comments thirstday during a visit to the city of dearborn in which the top white house official said he did not have quote any confidence in the corrns israel government now out jus to point out this point the curn is ral government is not just run by benjamin into naho who is ben made the bugaboo and the enemy of the prass benny gants is the prime opposition the person who in every poll if an electionrehalted y would be primenincter of israel backgay is in the coalition right now forthy purposes of the war and yet the goal here is to try to convince i guess michigan prokomasnec that the bide ad ministration is trying to dramin a line witween comas and th israel government and then he apparently called some unnamed is raly officials quot abhorrent and said the administration shuld hae taken a stronger stand against those who compared quote residente of gasito animals now that is a wy the person he istagmat there is yoaf goons whos th defenceminister of israel who compared members of a kamas to animals and gess what they are animals if you are a member of kamas and you rape women and you kill babies you are an animal but golant was pisilytogmakhmas not every palistinian whose living or the meanwhile jobiden again an attempt to buy michigan support the apparently told prime minister benjamin into naw one sunday that israel should not go ahead with the military operation in the gasabortown of rafa without incredible plan to protect civilians now what exactlys that means he first vull israel has been atempting to protect civilians this entire time because f israel which has complete air superiority for t one thousandth time wish to kill two million palistinians in the gasastrip they certainly have the aeriel kepa bility to do that but they are not doing that in fact there is really soldiers whoi kno wuare going literally house to house and dore to dor in e most densely populated areas of some ofthe most densely populated places on planted earth 's to not kill civilians in fact i mowthan israely soldier on friday night who literally had his budy gun down right in front of him as he was going into an apartment complex in gaza last week le why are tey veen on the ground there the reason is to preserve civilian life not only that the reason thre on the ground is to save the hostages wal jobiden was apparently telling israel mas to go into rafa which again is the only major strong hold comas as left theyapparently have four battalians in rafa in woere for israel to finish off that this basically jobidan saying to the american military during rold or to gos once to get around berlan to stop there jo stop right around berlan no that is not the idea every comasofficial is now in rafa everyone knows this this is clearly true not only that all the hostages aron rafa miraculously we found out last night during th suberbol israel actually rescued two hostages alive in gasa last night which is an amazing miraculous story yo have right now nat a hundred hostages who are being kept we are nominerdad nobody knows him anerdad but israel actually rescued two hostages alive in rafa well the bie admnistration was telling him not to go in according tothe walstry journal thes rally military said monday the rescue of fernando simon marman and leis har was a complicated operation performed under fire in the hart of rafa a city an southern gaza nere were palistinians are seeking refuge from the conflict between israel and komas i roughly toaam local time milit ry forces an a police swateem broke into a house in rava and engaged in a gun fight with commas militans while shielding the hostages with their own bodies before evacuating them to secure location is really air striksing gosa kill the hundred sixty for people overnight including dozens in rafa of course those targeted strikes were at military members of a komas who hide behind civilians and having talked again s peoplewho are serving in gaza right now the embedding is insane the line between civilian and military in gaza between civilian and terrace and gza is incredibly thin huge percentages of civil civilian households in gaza contain weapon ry huge percentages our hiding terror tunnels not just them by the way according to the wastry journal hidden deep below the headquarters of veu an eight agency for palistinians in goza city is a comas complex yith roes of computer servers that israel's arm forces say served as an important communication center and it' telligenctob for comas the compound is directly below the united nations relievin works agency buildings in gaza city and they are running on electricity drawn from te u n sonever people talk about the vaunted u n remember the u n our w a is cmas theyare indistinguishable in the gaza trip and meanwhile bidon istrying to tell these railies not to gon an rescue their own people which is amazing benjarmin at the ago for his part he says listen we are not going to stop here commasis eliminated when you destroy their fighting formations here he was on sunday youve defined victory said the war will not ent tell hamass is completely eliminated how are you getting know whin that is how do you knowin homas is completely eliminaed when you eliminat ther organize fighting formation and is tha sad we takin eighteen out of their twenty four tersbetalians out of commission youre mopping up the remanin individual terse and when you read releast the hosages of course and insure the comas that thet gazais no longer thread to is yhou do not have to kill every last terre you did not have to kill every last isis terrse but you made sure that that ises was finish is a military force you have to dismandal hamasis a military a military force at contols territory we are well in within reach and we should not stop nay meanwhile the bi dadministration istrying to stop israel of rathally finishing the job with kcomas which of course leads to more violence in the region if israel would stop because comas would walk out hold up a mas flag say that they won even thouh they have completely devastated gaza and every ounci blod is on komas which started this war and whch has maintained this war and then it has been on the north wuld polystar proding further and tring to kill more is railies knowing that jobidon is a weekline and its not just in the madeleast it is also with regard u crane let us be clear at this point jobidon's failure to do fine mission in eu crane has led twean impassing the senate and in the house no one knows what the aff ramp is because jobiden has not actually spelled out what he thinks the offramp is right here wats become very clear is that vladmer pouten is basically banking on the west just fretreating in ou crane flaner pouten in that interviewtockok arlson yeu people are sayig that he offered noffram no he really did not his offram was no american support for u crane ever again which ou crane is not going to agree to quelscan provide the support he has not made clear his territorial demands either and in that interview where he spells out all of russian history from his vantage point he says you crane literally does not exist and that the regime neds to be quortin quo de nosified which means that vladmer putten's goals have really not change his goals are not don bas and crimea his goals are keeve still and he is banking on the west basically saying okay find u no retired whatever oca what that would require for jobid to make the argument is not just alarmism it would be in actual explanation of what is going on in u crane that u crane yes there is corruption yes certainly a percentage of money that goes you crane will probably end up in the wrong hands because that happens with pretty much every country that we give forein aid to this ron o the probims of foreign aid there is some countryes the very transfaren about there some hundreds that really are not ou crane happens o be a place of the lot of cruptian sure their probis of vlodimers lensky is leader vlodmers lensky has crack down on the opposition there is no question tha h has done that hes id that actually even prior to thet twenty twenty two invasion by russia with all of that sad et is not in americas direct interest to have russia control keeve ou crane and put that ou cranian border to rectly on the borders of nato threatening places hungary in poland that is not in america's interest and providing some additional aid which amounts to a drop in the bucket for americans compared to the generalized budger of the american budgerana that i that is a well worth whils but he has to make that cases notmac that case he is simply declaring that everyone who opposes him is badly motivate n everybody who opposes him wants russia whin the war and wants them to take keyve en all the rest which is not helpful in any way shapeer form plus he has never suggestive what he thinks the end of this war looks if he came out to maris to lis en we almot the end this worlooks but the endof this war looks his russia essentially retaining the non bass and retaining crimia and the united states and the europeans providing security guarantees without them joining nado do ou crane and that is for the end of the sing looks and until ladmer putin is gioing to accept that this war continues ou mak pretty clear exactly what vladimer puten's aims are it is the vagary of western policy that is a loud space for vladimer pouten to create dout about whether the west even wants to end the war at all when in realityes seems less may be the only party that wants to end the war at this point may benonts lensky but the west more broadly t e u and the united states as well drovidin first of all slow walk the aid su crane in the very first place and then after slow walking the aid he failed to actually a low for an offram in fact he fosterdna non offram and now he is feiling to make clear what exactly the mission is and the very clear reality is that there could be a point where ou crane does in fact collapse again becaus russia will just keep doing this and then one of the things people do not understand about the ussian mines at with regard to war is that additional casualties are not a disancentive for the russian editional casualties are proof of the heroism of the russ in people its goes all the way back too the napoleanic era this is not just the world woare to era for the russians all of this radically increases all of the possibilities of serious war not jst in you crane not just in the gosi strip not just in the north of israel but allso china and tiwan china loks to tiwan right now they saide themselves who is gan a stop us sere's l who is gon ta stop us the american people do not have the will power to even spend the money on you crane jobidon seems to want a stop israel from crushing a terror group we are much more powerful than either rusha or homoss if we grab tiwan who is gon a du bleap sere's ly who is gon a stop us if we grabit if we blockated if we blockated and we get access to their tacnology and we upgrit our military radically who exactly is going to saboo jobiton has not tdemonstrated the courage of his supposed commitments it is a real problem and meanwhile they'r people w are making arguments that i think are a really poorly poorly articulated about exactly how americas military policy should actually be pursuit one of those people un fortunately sender marko rubyo why gendraly centetor of my homestate over the we ken he sayd that we cannot give any foreign aghe until we salve america's propins o first of all let us just be clear about us america is curently spending seven trillian dolars a year seven shrilliad it is certainly in america's interest to spend foreinahed money rather than s any american soldiers to places to insure the freedom of the seas for example having other people doing our fighting is a lot better the not's having to actually exspend blood an treasure in order to do things beyond thack what is happening at the southern bordrght now is not ar question of money he says that we have to spend the money on the border before we spend money on for in aid first of all congress has never seemd to have a propin spending anything including senator rubyo who is voted for a lot of budgets that hd been very very very large but when sendeor rubyo sayse that wehave to spend the money on the bord not anywhere else can we be clear on something the promise at the border not about expenditure the promise the border are about jobidn n oneg to keep the border open i've talked to the head of the borde of patrol union he says this not about staffings iabout pay this about misterrection of currently alicated resources an i do not think that the argument that rubio here is making is is sustainable as a matter of american form policy i want to get the border in a second but this to clerify something are you intupport of eigtin ou crane i think if we secure our own border here in the uni tates i've said that we should d we should help o crane look have the money that is going to you cran is not going to crane it is the by back our own weapons that we gave them to restock our own shelf at ovus its hi want is included there as well my problem is this before we do these things we have to make america and americans o priority again e i'm extrordinarily in favor of making americans cont what the priort agan i just do not think that foreign policies just connected from american priorities i only it is good when china takes over tiwan ir only it is good when russia shots off the supply of of shipping in the black see or when it takes over one o the chief grain producers in the world or when threatens directly nato borders i only it is good when commoss along with deranian sponsors is attacking an american ally and other aranian proxies are atacking shipping in the redsouding any of that is good or useful to to can hove make this hard divide between american domestic policy that helps americans an american foreign policy which is just what usk galevancing around and spending money interet that does not make sense that is not what american policy is for american policy is to forward america's interest we can argue about what the certain policies ford america's interests but the idea that any sort of foreign policy expenditure or any sort of foreign policy that is hawkish is somehow a betrayal of american interest is bizardome it is pascifistic and counts ar to most of america's modern history in a globalized world the world is a pretty small place these days aready

of our back packs stuffed for whil that ousing your back our own back that an't even havny pa on having in a carry this gest not ou did not see a very well talled out kaper this was more a let us breakinto the building and one's done not to leave ther slike last door of if all the things they lost the only things they actually carried about was ther vidio camera and they only care but back cause it had ther wedding for you on it the only copykaty fim the wedding to show a brother but adn yet my brother i'm really close to can come to the wedding and really sentimental and i really wanted at back and i was really up tat was filler really sat about it wanting after the burglory nowin the police were not going to be much help on this one katy desides to jump ing to action herself she goes on crags list to see if the thieves hav put her camera for sail there and boom she finds it immediately same camera in the same bag with all the accessories that she had specially bought for the camera had to be hers and she calls ae detectives on the case tells him the good news i can get my camera and i can probably put these guys on jail and he just immediately shoots me down and says there is no way of really knowing if that is your camera we cannot help you with anything the only way we would be able to help you as if you got the guide to give you a serial number off the camera and if you happened i still have the serial number from the camera and they mat and i think he was just thinging the know that will never happend katy however saves all her warrantes e special folder she does have the seria number and to confirmed that it is the same as the advertised camera she calls the guy on crages list and she can cox this story that she is a girl who needs to buy the camera for scproject she puts on thi supposely tough sounding brokonk sent that i would describe as cind of the brookonak and yo would hear performed by a kidactor on the disney channel i mayter do this for me you do not one o hear it and that mi iha told him that my boy friend was going to kick my ass if i spent our last three hundred dollars buying a camera that broke the nect day and do you have the warrante for the camera and he said no yous i got this camera from my friend there was no warrante with that nows ohaell do is there are waiting find out if it is still under warrantee and he said well i think you can find out if the cameras under warranty if you go on line and i was oha well what do i need to do and he was well i think you neen to have the serial number you did not act ue just ask him for the serial number you wanted him to suggest the seria number we ak cause i thought if i asked him for the serial number then he would now right away wat i was trying to do my house i was trin to get him to say it she has him can you read me the seria number and he says he does not have the camera with them wleft to call her back and she vigures o that is it jhegis op he knows she is lying he would never call back as myles points out this story that she has made up e really makes no sense at all lie o kase she is got a socia path boy friend o uld beat up his girl frend over the very nurty err of buying o idio camera that was not under warrant was luky wit the drunk and he founder cheating oner i an you's he he is valid op to beat somebody up but only if ti bi av adeo camea that we do not have a warranty because l you are got for that ids som thi youd happened o in thes cambre breaks down we can' get o money but we cant get we bay you knalways get at an the guy calls back get sho the seria number of course it matches katy cause the detective to let him know he says oh really what shall we do an irs you tell me what we should do you are the detectihe says of course would do a sting call the guy and arrange to buy the camer from him settle location we will be there too will sweop in will nab him fifteen minutes later the plice arrive to take katya mots to the stiing katy runs downstairs to meet tde detective on the street he tells me that there is been a change of plans he does not need my husband to come any more he only needs me i'm not in a meat the barglar face to face any more because it is not safe and he is got a different plan of power can iday this at thet point myles arrives down stairs i turn around to him and i just say am change o plans they do not need us both any more they just need me it is not safe for you to go i'll call you ioand he is tan es that then on our may at all myles watchers er get into the car and drive off inside the car katy says the etectives tell her the new plan she is goin to stay in the car and talk to the guy in the selfone keep him talking as the cop's go and grab him though they are very sceptical vasically saying the chance of this working out is small this is never get a happen do not get your panny is in a bunch she in the gragsleskuy agree to meet a decevious drug store cop's gone side then on the salphone katyasked some ok an woule wearing she can recognize him she tells him okat i'm in the make up isle i'm all i'm by the a cover girl make up he starts walking on the aisle i gass and he he says i still do not see you and that that point i hear hands up you are under a rest then the same detectives who are brushing me off the entire right out there then oure walking over to the car that the vidio cameran hand hie fiving each other and i hear them say that with some real police who are great detective wor the police could not be more surprise to be making this arrest and to be fair as miles points out it is crazy that it work there is many different stages were the criminal should have bailed out the fact that she comes up the story bout i need the warrante he calls er back he makes the effort to caller back and said did not you need a serial number for the warranty it is it a cannot believe that he is playing along with it honestly you do not get the lovel of service from real stor ihe do see but that is the whole thing i said is that she is an amateur sluth but he is also an amateur criminal r and this is the moment where they meet up there' be no way tha detective would ever spending on the time that would take to concock this ruse to go after this camera the only way that could ever be solved wul be if two amateurs got up but novy thesychcago is this american life om our glass to day on our program amateurs the fact that they are not professionals that they do not play by the book that they have you or time on their hands to try whatever makes it possible for them to a complish things to crowse simply never will we have three stories oncletting amaters stepping into one of this powerful jobs in the world and when i most commonplace stay witut acline theater of war sa nies a big professional outfit that is great at one thing takes on a task at which it has no experience at all i really no special aptitude for an anyway it is a rank amateur jekit as this example back when the first president bush was in office sawdom who sang invaded coaite and for the first time since veitnom really america returned to the battlefield derick brown felt called and he wound up at fort bragnorth carolina one of the largest military basis in the world back then about forty thous and soldiers most famously bhe eighty second air born another ready units h t can be demployed in eighteen hours fort brag is america's waiting room for war when derick first arrived he was trained as a para drooper you would wake up at five in the morning then you would deploy out to the field you do would jump from eight hundred feet i was an artillery man they throw the tanks out of the plans then they would throw us out of the plans you do these mock war exercises were people would trying to tack you and kill you and you would be out the cold and you would be digging were fox holes and just seeing how pow ground down you could possibly be that when the time comes for war your body in mind have been pushed as far as possible every once in a while there would be something else a volunteer duty i remember the captain of our unit he said he had the strange detail which was we had to manitorily send one soldier from our battery to be a part of this musical and it would last several weeks i you would not have to do any field duty bhuch you would have to sing and dance and efryone thought heas joking and i raised my hand and he said great re port to the for prheg theatr to day re the only person who volunteered i was the only person who volunteered and they had me sit in this room and this director first had everyone edition and you asked me if i knew of any songs that i could sing in from any musicals and i said not at all i never sang or danced in my life except while running and singing cadences and jody calls in the military and he soi weill tot sing me something and i remember singing even flow by pearl jam can you giv me coupalon his venseven throu thought o eve but i think i was as a person vaand somehow they thought it was good enough and turns out that no one was turned away in rehearsals deric quickly got a sense that something different was going on here this was not just your average musical review what what con a dancing any day ut it is march dancing i do not know if you have seen it but it is of the director's idea to combine the a honor and discipline of military movements with the bravado and panash of broadway movements but the thing deric remembers most more than twenty years later was not the song in dance nembers it was the stuff in between theye were short films projected on a screen above the performers and they were the opposite of light hearted entertainment grim testimonials about soldiers who died not in combat but drunk driving and another accidents near the base all done in a dark bluntness one rarely sees outside driver's ed movies we go from show ton to a vidio on the screen of a fellow soldier that the interview talking about how one of their fellow soldiers their friend died and then ut o surprise we would sing showton and it was this progression of dance sad vdo sing a bit sad vidio and then some guies come pelling out of the ceiling for the closing number at the end of the hour for the final chance to cheer ever one up as o they leave feeling inspired it was insane you ould have discussions back stange which is whwhat are we doing why are we doing this how did this how did this thing even come to be nexcellent question howded one of the most straight lacs no nonsense institutions in the entire country the u s army and that producing this piece of dodo musical theater i wanted answers i went straight up the chain of command yes a general carstater you ar shardly retired an i was a commander lata secondar bordivation your not dant eigt o shev at ent eighty eight general steiner was at fort brag and he confirmed that yes for a while in the sepenties eighties and early nineties there was this anual show which the entire base was required to a tend here were three or four performances a day for a week or during the christmas season which is when accidental deth spike we realiged that we were having more casualtis from o o duty activitis maly motor shack that co thous a par you jaha hav yo cuep ma drop wether we just needit to do shuted about it stiner told me that some years for every death of a soldier during training exercises there were almost ten killed getting drunk and driving crazy wartime death we all know about and afterwar p t s d but this was a whole other kind of statistic pre combat deths which come when tens of thousands of tean agers anxiously awaiting war get pumped up jumping out of plans and firing heavy artillery how could seme beer and say a motosacle possibly effect them originally the base had ordered manditory safety lectures but the soldiers to slep through them the united states defence department the greatest fighting force ever to march on the planet decided they would tri showtins and that is the origin of what came to be called the soldier safety show i interviewed a dozen veterans from this era and they all remember the weird mashup of got wrenching testimonials and cheery i hi leg kiks they all said you had to see it to believe it and i wanted to believe it when i called stiner he told me that he had a vitiotape of one of the shows you't i had a bs ar of it tut age casa tag to shepo strup you could not even tail what it was a picture shoon sho we struck out i will not bore you with the details but finding a vidiotape literally took months the public school library had a set of soldier safety shows but not long before i called they went full on digital and jumped all their old school audiovisual stuff a freedom of information request came up completely drie finally i happened upon gudred blackmen still working at brag who called back to state she had an old b s at home and in it a tape the label rad nineteen eighty nine soldier safety show life is worth living is o la gaie goay way early on we see a fol guitar seated on stage plucking out a sad malady oyo a it yus be yo above him on a screen as a general it is actually general steiner himself entering a cemetery and he starts talking about accidental deaths on base but a soldier is cel i fel terribl i get a shapening feling a feeling of faer we last twenty sax is yere and is terible charles a jage general stiner occasionally rails down and at one point removes his baray and talks directly to a tombstone we tried with you tartur and we fare you perhaps we could have done a little better if your prayrs had been borth forth comling to us with your problem you were a great soldier and we all rubier havn an nou grave nexe yere what do i have to do to stop these aur rechesary and english ash the lights come up on a stage pack with thirty of forty men and women in fancy dress doing some tapdan smotes with lots of spirit fingers in ja's hands it is attribute to everyone who fought in wall or two and these absurd smashships just keep happening for the rest o the show just all the soldiers told me who came up with this idea who was the master mine of operation shlockand aw his name was le yap and his journey to theatre was not one any one might predict he had he had no personal taste he at overdone me and he wore paliester suits i mean he did not care what he wore that is bo thorpe a local north carolina actress who was frequently cast in these shows yop dined back in two thousand six i talk tonother actors too and they all reacted reese brown apparent trooper from the ninhtes sthe everyone laughs when i ask a no because it is a's funny because i have not thought about him in yeurs persist to think about it is some of the things that he said every word he used every enunciation he used every colorful description he used was filled with ten words that did not need to be there he did not say i'm going to this toore an i'm traversing down to you knows one of those things but he had no room at all for shyness one states he made it a point of saying that if you were going to fail please fail loudly es fail loudly and saing it as though your life depended on it it is odd because id never met anyone him prior to this point aguaited this guy come from he was a his school football coach that is bo thorp again is was an on tentn new jersey and the director of the class plade gied suddenly and le inherited the glass play in and also appen that he had just broken his lag he really could not go out on the football fe yosel that is how he got into the teatr and he took his a personality football coach approach to life a into the theatr this tes steve curry who long worked his yacp stage manager and the within a very short period of time turned this little high school theatreprogramme into a a major competitive a organization that one the national theadral ward if for high schools across the nation and th and they went on a tour of a germany in japan with this production put together and it just lis he was bit and all is ce could not get enough of it le yach went up as the chief director of the buxconty playhouse outside trent new jersey which is one of the farm teams for lots of broadway shows yachp gave buck county his all spending lavishly even putting his own money into the shows le had just taken the second mortgage on his house and inte jersey to uses in investment in a show called the smile smile smile the reviews came out was a smile smile smile it was supposed to be funny it was not it was not it was not period one the shortest theater revius in the history of musical theatere curry told me that yacp bankrupted the bucxcounty playhouse and himself his personal finances rect he could not get a phone in his own name but then fate stepped in when yachp bumped into an old army body had an airport who was looking for some one who could direct theatr at fort bragg that they went thrill to dath with with this man who brought the actricality to the army the last place in the world that ye would think the one financial backer that that right that could afford him exactly the defense department it las exactly right steve curry the stage manager told me that with that money they built waterfalls and a sat for a roller scating number another time they planted the entire stage in real grass for a park scene with cops on horseback and we had people repelling from rafters with people e parissho rigging flying in o the stage cannons and machine guns and muskets and horces wearing up to the cannon fire thomson some machine guns fire and and thes are all going off inside as a theatre oh yet we would also trigger explosions at wed set into the stage floor and a wund look up thes flash pots i got a a got the gui from special forces that he would get me all these with the go squibs which these elike tron exfuses and we would create these great explosions you could never do it to ta far marshal to shuc to down but we were the army ell what was impressive about it is how i realize that there was no end te yap he had a special in unique way of making the simple more complicated than you could ever imagine it let me just take a moment to say how rare this is i wrote a book about amateurs a few years ago those dreamers in their garrages fiddling creating struggling what keeps most of them stuck in the garrage his lack of funders le yach had hundreds of millions of funders the tax payers of the united states everybody i talk to especially the cast and crew that went many these shows the regulars all mention this one time one moment that stood out for them it was nineteen eighty two thet been a terrible car accident this time involving one of the cassmembers kids here is actress bothorpe my son was narly killed man he was coming home from his first loot mallgame he was fourteen years old and was otober the aig and im the young girl who is driving her father's car decided to see how fast hard daddy's car woen come down scadrap which is where we live he remembers her saying eighty and when she went to put on the brakes io the car went into skid and then hit a tree and he was in a body cast for six months she says every one in the show was heart broken of course including yap but yap being yap saw an opportunity i's it t what we can do you think would you less go up to the hospital and i'll bring a fim cren we will go up to the hospital and we will film clife and then he can and and he can make testimony on the on the tape and i sudle i do not do not know that that is the right thing to do oh yo absolutely bailed the soldiers alove it that the will tell thell understand it i'll mean a lot to them i i i i was really reluctant about and i thought cause i thought that is just not very tasteful a few weeks later there was bow on stage my fourteen year old sin was in a very serious car acciden it happens that ere's no warting it just comesable that we went up to clas hospital room when he was very sick and here a great to make this sfilm ill you will pay attention then on the big screen thank claythorpe fourteen years old lying in a hospital bad flat on thus back in a full body cast an clayed jumps right en looking into the camera as best he cans reliving the accident calling out the miles per hour as if he were once again flying down that hill ten torty fhorty forty sity ta u o ou sixty sey sinc try s canby ot herou tes flice no i we sa can get o o sa ca get ot to m te ca o to m at o that to mao toll be and then beneath the vidia screen a young girl comes out on stage and and you think us had om how how effective was this with the soldiers amazing absolutely amazing because thes a eighteen year old boys and when you are eighteen years old and you'rop o butch con a mal you you your life is is going to go on forever and you are you are you are especial you are going to last for ever and you can do whatever you want to do and and if you die wood and le had a way of under standing that he would do everything he could to prove to them or to show them the value of life and how short it is and how quickly it goes bown at this lave it is the lecture i gave my teen age daughter a few nights ago when i handed to the carkees drive carefully buckle up please do not be an idiot every parent dress to come it with some way to say this to their kid the yacp had to crack that coat for forty thousand of them and what at worke after the soldier safety show started the average number of deaths at the base drop by a third at the end of every show one of the opsactors alwa s came out on the stage to give the final safety lecture we make your help and we at that each and every one up you joyd with bus to make this pledge two always always were you sages the speaker askes every one who believes in safo to stand and take the pledge these are soldiers and they follow orders we naturally up jumps every one in the audience and then the cast floods the stage for the final number and ops lasti brilliant contribution to musical theatrs a guaranteeds standing ovation at the end of every show as the outher several books oncluding the one that he mentiong in this story is called punch of amateurs awesen came out on paper back coming up babies having babies robot babies

act two what to expect when you expecting a robot this is thing in allot keds have to do in health class maybe you did this when you were in high school the ideais to give students a taste of what it is to be responsible for an infant and and conna woot a pain in the acid is actually and they do the spite making the gids carry out an egge or sometimes its a seck of flour for couple days supposally this jot of reality helps prevent teen pregnancies which nunos ought to ass of an agg to these days some schools using thse robotic babies these are plastic dolls with lectronics inside which make them cry randomly all day and night their sleeping eating and prooping patterns are basedon wogs kept by real parents about real babies the babies cost over six hundred bucks eage holy frank went out to find out if amateur parenthood is more intense and realistic with these high teck cry babies the first time i saw a robotic bab was at my local farmacy i's one of those old timy places with a candy cownter and sergical supplies and a large selection of scented candles one day i was in the store and i heard thes tea nage girl behind me say my god this baby is heavy she had a car seat slung over her shoulder a purse for a second i thought the plastic baby inside it was real the real ones are heavier i told her she groaned and with the car seat over to her other shoulder at the time i had a three year old and i was dying to know if this girls experience with the plastic baby was anything remotely my experience with my flesh and blood baby the girl told me she went to glenrach high

to the baby was almost the opposite of pages and that if i have a baby really young i feel i would keep the baby i also never would a gueste that page and rachel would flick their positions cause i cannot the feeling of having a bit for some reason i guess the idea that some one or something meeds you and only you canat makes you feel important it was alf over the same time i was i canna liked it id never really thought that i would want to have a kid younggir but maby i would rachel called it early on set baby fever in said her mam was freeked out by it i asked one of rachel's teachers and the president of the company that makes the babies about this ironic and unintended outcome that the robot baby made a teanage girl want to have her real one they both said this was rare they shrugged it off the teacher thait she was sure rachel's the kind of girl who will make a thoughtful decision about when to have her own child over all the girls had a way more authentic mothering experience what the robot babies than i'd expected but the moments when rachel and page could not be available to the babies when rachel gave blood when page fell the girls lost points in those moments when you are real parent those things happen all the time diag nosing whether your kid needs to be fed or diperd or rocked that is not what makes you a pro at parenting it is coping with the stress of getting it wrong a feeling an amateur which is gon to happen no matter how much practice you have had o i fang shes those of the parentin podcast the longest shortist time which had to say is great because unlike must parentex notis not actually desins bisically fore parent wast nerveits for anybody this sistributed by your wolf ere commandof in belief now a the stry of an amateur who for one night it is thrown into a very very big job one of the biggest jobs the busy we get thrown in as the substitute teacher for a class they have never taught or never taken specifically thi spese to for the president have the united states stephany fle explains if somebody needs to sub for the president the chain is clear if the vice president cannot do it it goes to the speaker of the house then the president pro temperay of the senate the the secretary state secretary of the treasury secretary of defence all the way down the cabinet to energy education batter an affairs it is been this way since the presidential succession act of nineteen forty seven but what happens if all of those people are in one room thister spiaker the survise posiden mat was a cogres my fellowmar the state of the union address what if someone belows up the building and kills every one on that list all at once well then the presidency goes to the designated survivor that is a person chosen every year before the state of the union speech to survive that is their whole job to survive run the united states government as an amateur president talda beginner we's first day in the job may include reaking vengeance upon slash surrendering to whoever killed all our top leaders each year the designated survivor is assigned a security detail and moved to a safe secret location away from the capital this all began no surprise during the cold war thomas reed was an assistant to president ragin for national security policy and it was his job to figure out what to do if a newclear weapon d c he is the one who came up with the idea of the designated survivor washinton was targeded with over three hundred shobiat newclay weapons they had a hundreds lad that wuullay down on every possible escep root and to think you could eescape that brade was nonsens well i i was narfa sin that a irrember thank i nol be s no can i happen what som dos capen that is bill richardson former secretary of energy designated survivor for the two thousand state of the union richardson was not sent into a bunker somewhere he was in a small town in maryland having dinner at his friend's house which was surrounded by a security detail and emergency vehicles inside they ad stake we d a ni sh me all but can we thad ot of the dolation in i was mo an a sur gar i had a garc of wine at er wat om all over i talke to a couple of designated survivors from the cold war ara who said they were put on plains and flown to undisclosed the locations one of them got training where he got to play war games and the secret doctor strange levask setting and they asked him questions oquet do you swear in immediately after the president's death do you launch missils at the soviets do you hold your vivor he said the training was helpful enlightening that he thought nobody should become a designated survivor without undergoing at first but by the end of the cold war post gorbechav prn on eleven things got a little more lax can you tay it ivet any kind of training cort about what di you be aper now that is dan glickman secretary of agriculture designated survivor during the nineteen ninety seven state of the union i think i did not get with my wi cat i can handle it a something terribly happen it well good wa donna chelela who was secretary of health in human services designated survivor nineteen eighty six did not get any special training either and che didn even leave the neighborhood she was just two and half miles away from the capital of the white house li et my finer da at the rell about rell at the wi hav an we had pe in wat e pated the younien and i cad a wondered into the ollof alot and tried out en dar what did it feel big yo tak for ma that pednt ten the very large man one designated survivor told me that actually attending the stated union is a pain you have to look attentive and interesteve and improving for really long time in case the camerous pan to yiel being designated survivor much hes er wonguy who asked i not use his name when on a vacation to the caribian when he got the gag not a government expense he was quick to tell me he happened have plans to go anyway another designated survivor took the opportunity to move to a new house te caravan of secret service guarded him as he loaded up his moving ban one thing you might have noticed from the designated survivors i spoke to none of them had dajobs that had anything to do with national security husually it is the non marquis cabinet members secretary of t interior energy commerce agriculture people whose names you probably do not know ever heard of anthony fox he is our secretary of transportation and this years designated survivor and when i heard about that i kind of thought well seriously the decision to launch newclear retaliation kill millions of people could possibly rest in the hands of the secretary of transportation thomas read the guy who design this programm says why not the secretary of transportation is as good a person as any the question in politic snallf i things life is compared do the question is not is and alsorised to qualified to be president or governor or successure the question is compared to who a compared to just ass tolon of course compareded way is now probably not and that the cabinet they are all brilliant people and iscertainly have the wherewithall to at least to make the initial decisions stepen either not all brillat people any more than you ere i are in the all have problems in some smoke to much somewere over weight and for and on theu're all human beings and read said the president's been chosen by the american people and the president chooses the designated survivor therefore by proxy that prerson is chosen by the american people sometimes the choose well sometimes they do not that is what politics is all ot that is a very ominous statement ahahahahaayes yes it is here is danglichman again designated survivor or nineteen inety seven secretary of agriculture you kno i may i but not really breet on what to do at tomt ting watd happen a present but i i have not a happen my self something word a happen i would not bol cerdan bakic rul an would hav ban a good solder in that in that cate when glichman was a designated survivor they flew him to loo guardia air port and a g three plain along with some stern looking guies and suits one of whom mayore me not have been carrying the newclear football in a fancy brief case then they got glichman in a three car caravan drove him to his daughter's modest apartment in manhatton's west village and stood guard outside while he watched the speech on tevy glicman admitted he did imagine what it would be i did think abat at way would not be what a very intriting thing that here the tecretary agriculture could be presen at taken i been tellin the world all e yer at agriculto a mot in portant part of our government i could reimport that that in sur mig all of a sudden that would be our number one national ha genda is just agriculture agriculti pouded agriculture glichman even said that in his regular job he was unimportant that immediately after the speech was over he lost the security detail they bailed on him and went back to washington in factor jact words were mister guiman the mission is terminated and i defided stay an and new york and have dinner with my daughter in was cold and raining and pleading an what the dinner was over we went out side of the restaurant and a we could not find a cab o we walked back about twelve blalk back to my daughters department in in a pleat tormin i hided struck me to three or four hours before i would the most powerful man on the face of the eurt for about an hour and now i could not even get a cab the fact of the matter is no first orn president goes into office knowing how to be president he learns on the job everything's naw in opening that brief case and deciding whether to launch new clear strike nobody could be ready for that the president might be as likely to make the wrong choice is the secretary of agriculture wer the secretary of transportation with a white house in turn er you wher i dstephany fo is

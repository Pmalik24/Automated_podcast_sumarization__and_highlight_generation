welcome to the huberman la pon cas o science science tace to s for i maindrew hubermen and i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching a research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens ath letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic grens and the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer theu' give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of datand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if fore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fifree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key rolle of hydration end electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is element dok com slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dot calm slash huberman today's episode is going to be all about the science of emotions the first month of the podcast we talked about sleep and wakefulness last month we were talking about nerl plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience and this month we are going to talk about these things that we call emotions we are going to decipher what they are how they work how we can control them when we might not want to control them there are going to be four episodes on emotions and to day we are ging to talk in particular about something that most often is call stress and you might be thinking wait stresses int an emotion but stress really lies at the heart of whether not our internal experience is matched well or not to our external experience or the events that are happening to us and around us and as you will soon see those converge wer combine to create what we call emotions now i want to be very clear that we are going to talk about the biology of emotions were going to talk a lotl bit about some psychological concepts related to emotion and we are definitely going to talk about tools to control what we call stress or commonly think of a stress ore also goin to clean up some common myths about stress for instance that stress impairs your imune system that is true in certain contex and in other contects stress actually enhances youromean system and makes it function better there is going to be a lot of discussion about whether or not our internal state whether not we are alert or calm is good or bad depending on the circumstances where were headed here is i'd you to come away from to day's episode with what i call an organizational logic a framework for thinking about these things that typically we just call happy or sad or depressed or anxious and i'm going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded in physiology in nurow science that will allow you to navigate this otherwise complex space that we call emotions that will allow you to ground yourself better when youre feeling life is weighing on you or youre nd of being pulled by the currents of life as well as to support other people whether r not thats in a psychological practice if yourope if youare a practitioner or you have clients or children or spouses really to be able to support other people in your environment better and the tools that im gan a focus on to day range from behavioral tools we will talk about some of the more valuable supplementation tools that ar out there and we are going to talk a little bit about things depression p t st but we will be devoting entire episodes to things depression pt st and even attention defisit and obsessive compulsive disorder which believe it or not lthough this may not surprise many of you have a very strong e motional component is just not just about compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts it is also about the emotional load of being in that state i promise that to day we are going to clean up a lot of misunderstanding we are going to give you a lot of tools and you are going to learn a lot about the biology of how your body and brain work together because if ever there was a topic that brought together the brain and body or mind body relationship it is stress and emotions it is also the positive emotions when we feel something whether not were superhappy were jus feeling kind of pleasant or we are feeling stressed anxious and overwhelmed it is not just in our head it is also in our body and as you may recall the nervous system which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord but also all the connections with the organs of the body includes the brain and body and those organs of the body your got and your liver and your spleen they are also communicating with the brain i look forward to a day in fact when we no longer think about neroe science as just the brain and many nar scientists now also think about the body of course the brain controls the body but the body is also having a very profound and concrete influence on the brain i think up until recently people would heareabout can a brain body and always think about mindfulness where ato not can talk that much about mindfulness at all to day mindfulness is kind of a vague concept in fact when you think about mindfulness it is good to take the opposite what is the opposite o mindfulness would be mindlessness well all a sudden we are into territory that is not really easy for one person to describe their experience or to help others with their experience they orgn ao talk abut objective tools that match the brain body experience or separate the brain body experience in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better to feel better literally to just feel better about what your experiencing and believe it or not to be able to control your emotions when that is appropriate this is not about becoming robodic this is not about trying not to feel human this is actually about being able to lean into life better as a consequence of being able to controlsome of your inner real estate this nervous system that includes the brain and body and how that nervous system is interacting with the outside world as to place you in a greater position of power and let us get started in deciphering what is stress what are emotions and why did i batc strests and emotions into one discussion to day o caso what is stress we hear all the time that stress is bad we hear people saying their really stressed out what is stress you all presumably heard the e arguments or the framework that stress is this horrible ancient carry over from times in which humans were pursued by animals or other human preditors and that whenever we feel what we call stress or feel stressed out that it is just this unfortunate invasion of something that we no longer need in modern life that this was design for when we were being attacked by bears or tigers or lions or whatever it is and dosh what an unfortunate thing and we have many creature comforts nowadays but we have not eliminated this stress almost as if it was an organ or a system in our body that was bad for us that were stuck with just because of the species that we are but first of all all species experience stress and i think that it is fair to say even though i was not there that yes in fact throughout are evolutionary history we were vulnerable to animal attack and other human attacks on a regular basis up until points where we started developing weapons and structures and fire and other things that allow us to protect ourselves better from those animals and and invaders a verious kinds but it is entirely naive for us to think that in ancient times ancient times being kind of loose term for previous i medieval times it a hundred years ago a thousand years ago ten thousand years ago of course there were in fidelities right partners cheated people died in fact before the advent of phones which were going to talk about today you can imagine that some one might head off on a hunt oere to go visit a relative and never come back and you would never know why that would be very stress welso there was psycho social stress ther as the stress of losing loved ones there was the stress of cold of famine there was the stress probably also of just worry this idea that and ancient versions of the of humans a thousand years ago a hundred years ago did not worry i think that is that is entirely inconsystemt with everything we know about the structure of the human brain a hundred years a thousand years ago all the problems that were struggling with existed for ever it is just that stress at its core is a generalized system it was not design for tiger tigers attacking us are people attacking us it is a system to mobileeyes other systems in the brain and body that is what stress really is it is design to be generic and that is the most important thing that i you to understand to day is that the system that governs what we call stress is generic it was not design for one thing and that gives it a certain advantage in taking over our the state of our brain and body but it also gives you all of us an advantage in controlling it because its based on hard wired biological mechanisms and there are hard wired biological mechanisms meaning ells and chemicals and pathways and tissues that exist in you right now that require no nural plasticity that allow you to put a break on stress and organ to talk about those you have a system for stress and you have a system for destress that are baked into you they were genetically incoded and that you ere born with them and you still have them now if you are alive and listening you have the capacity to control your stress and to day i'm going to talk about ways that you can control your stress not just by doing some off line practice of meditation and a breathwork or something that but real time tools tools that allow you to push back on stress when stress hits in real time the othis is something that my lab works actively on in developing and testing these tools and evolving these tools and thereare other laboratories that that that do this is well let us talk about the strss response and by doing that you will understand exactly why the tools i'm going to give you work for those of you that are saying wait i just want the tools just give me a summary trust me if you understand mechanism you are going to be in a far better position to incorporate these tools to teach these tools to others and to modify them as your life circumstances change if you would the cheat cheat or yu just want the one page pediaf eventually will get that stuff out to people but it is really important to understand the underlying mechanism oke what is stress well let us just distinguish between stress ors which are the things that stress us out and stress which is the psychological and physiological response to stress ors im mainly gin to talk about stress which is your response to things let us be clear about what we already know which is that stressers can be psychological or they can be physical if i put you outside on a cold day without a jacket for a very long time that is stressful if i have you prepare for too many exams at once and you cannot balance at all with your sleep schedule and your other needs for comfort and well being food rests sleep and social connection that is stressful stress and as i mention before is generic it does not distinguish between physical and emotional stress what happens when the stress responsits let us talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress response we could also think of this as short term stress you have a collection of nurons they have a name it is called the sympathetic chain ganglia and it has nothing to do with sympathy sympa means to gether and there is a group of nurons that start right about at your neck and run down to about your naval lobit lower and those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia you do not need to memorize that name there will not be a quiz but it is important to know that in the middle of your body you have a chain of nurons that when something stresses us out i ther in our mind or because something enters our environment and we see something that stresss us out that we do not heights if your afraed to heights somebody you dislike walks into the room at cetera that chain of nurons becomes activated u bunch of dominos falling all at once it is very fast when that happens those nurons release a nurmodulator ner chemical that have talked about before on this podcast called a seeto coling they release that at various sits within the body w this is important because normally a setocoling would be used to move muscles actually every time we move a muscle pick up a cup a coffee right with a pen walk down the street it is spinal nurons connecting to muscle and releasing a seet o colling in the brain it is involved in focus and it muscles is involved in making muscles twitch but when if we were stressed we would not want all our muscles to contract at once because we were just bekind paralyze this beno in what tonic activation as it is called we would not want that some thay call tetnus believe it are not because the tetnus toks an will cause that kind of riggor of the ovoe the entire body you do not want that when those nurons are activated a setocoling is release but there are some other nurons for the effycionatos out there they are called the post gangleonic nrons those ons respond to that a seeto colling and then they release epineferon which is the equivalent to a drenoline we have this system where very fast whenever were stressed the core of our body these nurons down the middle of our body release these chemicals and then there is a drenoline or epineferan wreleased at particular organs and acts in particular ways we are going down into the weeds here to stay with me cause it is gon to make a lot of sens and you will appreciate nhaving this knowledge in hand that epineferan acts in two different ways some things the muscles of your legs and your heart and other things that need to be active when you are stressed they have a certain kind of recepter which is called the bat a receptor and that bat a receptore response tepin efran and blood vessels dilate they get bigger and blood rushes in to our legs the heart rate speeds up lots of things happen they get activated and at the same time that epinefran activates other receptors on certain tissues that we do not need the ones involved in digestion reproduction and things of that sort that are luxuries for when things are going well not things to pay attention to when we are stressed and that binds to other receptors that contract the blood vessels basically the stress response this is the key phrase here the stress response ais generic i said that before and be it basically pushes certain systems to be activated and other systems to not be activated the stress response is too prong iit is a yes for certain things and it is a no you may n ot right now for other things that is the keythings understand about the stress response that is why your heart speads up that is why you feel blood in certain organs and tissues of your body but not in others that is why your throat goes try because it turns out that when you get stressed the salivary glands are shut down there is a lot less blood flow to the nurons that control salivation and you are ging to start swallowing if you your throat is getting dry therere lot of different effects i'm not cin enlist them all off but basically you are activated in ways that support you moving s that is the third thing it is first of lls generic second of all the stress response activate certain things and shuts down other features of our body and then it is a sense of agitation that makes you want a move and that is because fundamentally the stress response is just the generic thing that says do something and movement in this case can either be the bias to move in terms of action or it can be the bias to say something when we are stressed we are more likely to say something that probably we should not say we are more likely to move and if you are tring to suppress movement you will feel that as a tremor you are going to feel agitated and that is because it was designed to move you this is important because if you want a control stress younead to learn how to work with that agitation i'd to give you a tool at this point because i think if we go any further with a lot more science people are going a begin to wonder if this is just going to be a kind of standard universy lecture about the stress response i may give you more science about the stress response but i want to take what we now already know about the stress response and use that as a frame work for thinking about how one might reduce or even eliminate the stress response quickly in real time should it arise when we do not want it we are taking the podium or were sitting down at a zum call and all te sen work feeling flushed we are feeling our heart is racing we are feeling a little to alert we are feeling a little worked up and we want a calm down as far as i am aware of the best tools to reduce stress quickly called real time tools are going to be tools that have a direct line to the called autonomic nervous system the autonomic never system is a a name given to on the kind of general features of alertness or calmness in the body it is typically it means automatic although we do have some control over it certain what callevers or entry points here is what does not work to control stress telling yourself to calm down in fact that tensigous exass orbate stress telling some one else to come down also tends to exascibate their stress if you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress response the best thing you can do is activate the other system in the body which is design for calming in relax sation and that system is called the pari sympathetic nervous system because as i mention before the nurons that control stress run from about your neck to your naval the para sympathetic narons parajus means near exist in they are the some of the cranial nerves it is can let neck and lower brain stem can aback to the brain and in the neck and in the pelvic aria and the pari sympathetic nervous system is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves the ones that are up in the brainstem and in the neckaria those have a direct line to various features of your face in particular athe eyes they control things e movements pupil dilation things of that sort as well as the tongue the facial muscles et cetera the para smpathetic nervous system many people do not realize this is the system by which we control the face and the eyes and to some extent are airway the tracia and it is these nurons that reside within the pelvic aria now the nurons within the pelvic area are involved in control of the genitols the blatter and the rectum and those do not have a direct line you do not have a direct way to control those act you has to go from brain to spinal cord an than out to those organs whereas the para sympathetic nervous system has certain entry points or what i'll call levers might that well allow you to pushback on the stress response in real time and diminish it and feel more relaxed really quickly i'men to teach you the first tool now i do not overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge without giving you something useful and the tool that at least to my knowledge is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded in physiology in neuro science for calming down in a self directed way is what is called the physiological sigh esi g h now some of you might have heard me talk about this on previous podcast but i'm yun o explain this in the context of how respiration in general is used to camus down and turns out you'r all doing this all the time but you are doing it involuntarily and when you tress you tend to forget that you can also activate these systems voluntarily this is an extremely powerful set of techniques that we know from scientific studies there are beng one my lab jack feldman's labit you sealay and others now that are very very useful for reducing your stress response in real time and here is how they work these days there seems to be a lot of interest in breathwork breathwork tipically is when you go and you sit down or you lie down and you deliberately breathe in a particular way for a series of minutes in order to shift your physiology access som states and it does have some utility that were gin to talk about that is not what i'm talking about now but i'm talking about when i re ferred to physiological size is the very real medical school text bookd relationship between the brain the bod ty and the body as it relates to the breathing apparati meaning the diaphrame and lungs and the heart let us take the hulmark of the strass response the heart starts beating faster blood is shuttle to the big muscles of the body to move move you away from whatever it is this stresser is or just make you feel you meed to move or talk your face goes flushed et cetera heart rate many of us feel is involuntary just con of functions whether not were moving fast or moving slow if you think about it its not really purely autonomic because you can speed up your hart rate by running or you can slow it down by slowing down by syour run you can move to a walker lie down but that is indirect control there is however way in which you can breathe that directly controls your heart rate through the interactions between the sympathetic and the para sympathetic nervous system here is hout works when you inhal whether nots through the nose or through the mouth this skeletal muscle that is inside your body called the diaphram it moves down and that is because the lungs expand the diaphrame moves down your heart action gets a lobit bigger in that expanded space there is more space for the heart not t your motional heart getting bigger i'm thing about your actual physical heart getting a lobit bigger the volume grows and as a consequence whatever blood is in there is now at a lower volume are moving a lomet more slowly in that larger volume then it was a before you inhaled o case a more space heart gets bigger blood moves more slowly and there is a little group of nurons call the signo atrial node in the heart that registers its believer not those nurons pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart and send a signal up to the brain that blood is moving more slowly through the heart the brain then sends a signal back to the heart to speed the heart up what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster inhale longer inhale more vigorously then your exhails now there are variety of ways that one could do that but it does not matter if it through the nose or through the mouth if your inhales are longer than your exails your speeding up your heart if your inhales are more vigorous even if your inhals are shorter than your exhails you are speeding up your heart rate now the opposite is also true if you want a slow your heart rate down stress response its you want a slow yeur heart rate down what you want to do is again capitalize on this relationship between the body the meaning the diaphrame an the heart and the brain here is how it works when you exhal the diaphrame moves up which makes the heart a little bit smaller it actually gets a little more compact blood blows more quickly through that compact space sove a just a pipe getting smaller the sign of atrial note registers that blood is going more quickly sends a signal up to the brain and the pari sympathetic nervous systems om nuron's in your brainstem send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down if you want a calm down quickly you need to make your exhals longer and or more vigorous than your inhals now the reason this is attractive as a tool for controlling stress is that it works in real time this does not involve a practise that you have to go and sit there and do anything separate from life and we are goin to get to amotion emotions and stress happen in real time and while it is wonderful to have a breath work practice or to have the opportunity get a masage your it in masana or to whatever it is that you do in order to set your stress controls in the right direction having tools that you can reach to in real time that require no learning i may oit have to teach it to you you had to learn that but it does not require any plastisity to activate these pathways f your feeling stressed you still need to inhal of course but you need to lengthen your exhails now there is a tool that capitalizes on this in a kind of unique way a kind of a twist which is the physiological sige the physiological size was discovered in the thirdies it is now been explored at the nerbiological level and mechanistically in far more detail by jackpheldman's lab at you seale also mark crasnofs lab at stamford and the physiological size is something that humans and animals do any time they are about to fall asleep you also do it throughout sleep from time to time when carbondoxide which will talk about a moment builds up too much in your system and the physiological size is something that people naturally start doing when they have been crying and they are trying to recover some air or calm down when they been sobbing very hard or when they are in clostrophobic invironments however the amazing thing about this thing that we call the diaphram the skeletal muscle is that it is an internal organ that you can control voluntarily unlike your spleen or your heart or you'r a your pancarius where you cannot just say oh i want to make my pankries turn out a little more insolent right now i'm just goingto do that with my mind directly you cannot do that you coan do that by smelling of really go do not under something but you cannot just do it directly you can move your diaphram it intentionally right you can do it any time you want and it will run in the background if you are not thinking about it this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphram through what is call the frennic nerve p h are e an i ce frennic the frenic nerve intervates the diaphram you can control any time you want you can double up your inhales or tripple up your inhals you can exhal more than your inhals whatever you want to do such an incredible organ and the physiological sige is something that we do spontaneously but when your feeling stressed you can do a double inhal long exhail now i just told you a minute ago that if you inhal more than your exhail youre ging to speed the heart rate up which would promote more stress and activation now i'm telling you to do a double inhal exhail n order to calm down and the reason is the double inhal exhail which is the physiological size takes advantage of the fact that when we do a double inhail even if the second inhal is sneaking in just a tiny bit more air cause it is cunt a hard to get too deep in halse backd back you do big deep inhail than another little one sneaking it in the little sacks in your lungs that eveyouolly of the lungs your lungs are not just too big bags but you get millions of little sacks throughout the the lungs that actually make the surfacer of your lungs as big as a tennis court to the mazeit for t is spread that out what those tent a collapse as we get stressed and carbonda carbondoxide builds up in our blood stream and that is one of the reasons we feel agitated as well and it makes us very gitery am and there some other effects of carbondoxide hi want to get into but when you do the double inhal exhail the double inhal reinflates those little sacks of the lungs and then when you do the long exhail that long exhail is now much more effective at ridding your body and blood stream of carbondoxide which relaxes you very quickly my lab in collaboration with david speagle slab widavids i the associate chare of psychotrate stamford are doing a study right now exploring how physiological size and other patterns of breathing done deliberately can modulate the stress response in other things related to emotionality those work are on going i want to be clear those studies are not done but it is very clear from work in our labs from working jack feldman's lab and others that the physiological size is the fastest hard wired way for us to eliminate this stressful response in our body quickly in real tide and i'm excited to give you this to because i think most people have heard that mindfulness of meditation is good exercises good for us we all need you be getting enough sleep et cetera but life happens and when you find yourself in a position where you are more alert and activated than you would to be regardless of whether not the stresser is relationship based or it is financial or it is physical or anything that you can look to the physiological side because it by passes a very important feature of how we function which is that it is very hard to control the mind with the mind esspecially when we are in heightened states of activation whe are very alert or very sleepy it is very hard to use the called top down mechanisms of intention and gratitude and all these things that are really powerful tools when we are not superactivated and stressed or not supertired but when we are anywhere in the range of very alert in stress to very sleepy physiological size are a powerful way of bringing our level of called autonomic activation which thist means our level of alertness down and whether not it is in line at the bank or whetheror not youre wearing a mask now days or youor not whatever whatever the conditions may be where you are at and your needs when youre feeling str est the physiological side done just one to three times be dublin hil exale dublin hil exhale may be just two times wi'll bring down your level of stress very very fast and as far as i know it is the fastest way to accomplish that an important note about the physiological sig or exhale emphasized breathing for lowering the stress response many people worry that their heart rate does not come down fast enough i want to tell you do not want your heart rate to reduce very fast there is actually something called the vas of vagal response where people will stand up or they will get up in mill the night use the bathroom in and all sudden they will collapse they will faint that is because the heart rate was reduced too much some people will see blood or they will see something really troubling and stressful and they will pass out that is an over activation or an acceleration of the calming response they are not stressd that they kind of fall off the cliff of stress they get stressed that the rebound mechanism for calming themselves down goes too high too fast they calme down too fast and they collapse and faint and be aware that if you aregoing to use the physiological sigh or exhale emphasize breathing to calm down that your heart rate will take about twenty to thirty seconds to come down to base slime and you may need to e repeat the physiological sie a fou times that is an important note about the use of breathing to control levels of stress the other thing is that when you decide to look to the body to control the mind it does something else that is very powerful when you are stressed in your mind and body you are feeling really agitated activated and worried and you use a tool the physiological sigh or exhale impesize breathing you will notice that then your brain in your mind becomes more available for controlling the stress response and reacting to it which is great because the the sweet spot in life is to be provided you are not trying to sleep is to be alert and calm andso that is the ideas to be alert and cammon to bring you backing to that plain of alertness for those of you that have trouble sleeping or just relacing through the day the physiological side can be repeated for ten fifteen sycles if you some people find that it actually puts them to sleep if they lie down and theire reathing and they do too many of these that actualy can put them to sleep and what you will find is that most breath work protocalls the kind of stuff that is done away from real life that you set aside time intoside duce quotinqu breathwork most of that works such that if you are in doing inhales that are longer and more vigorous than exhales that tends to be activating and alert you aif you are doing exales that are longer ord more vigorous than the inhales that tends to put you to sleep an many of the protocols that are out there from laboratories and that are on populate the internete and well nocides and what not if it is exale emphasize breathing oftentimes has been used as ha tool for trying to teach people to fall asleep physiologs ical size little different is design to be used in real time just think of it is just kind of inyour kit of things that you can do as life a happens and as you need to react to life a note about nazalversis mouth breathing there is a plathera of information out there now ecause of james nester's book breath the new science of a lowst art am which came out this last year excellent book as well as jaws which is from a sandra con paul erlic with a forward by a jery diamond and a robert supolski a a collection of people from stamford a chair diamonds not at stamford but the rest ar and some heavy hitters on that book which is about the the benefits of of nasal breathing and in many cases nazal breathing is more advantageous than mouth breathing for all sorts of things cosmetic features of the face especially in kids a wording off infection et cetera with the physiological sigh the best way to do hit would be double inhal through the nose exhaile through the mouth but if you cannot and you can only do that through yur mouth just do ithrough your mouth if you want to do all through nose do it thrugh your nose this anchors back to some underlying neurology or ner narrow science am for those of you that want to know you have two breathing centers one that is involved in rhythmic breathing for inhals follow by exhals follo by anhals follow by exhails the call prebot singer nucleus named after a bottle of wine and discovered by jack feldmenat you sealeh and a near by neucles called the paraphacial nucleus allso tat scovered by jack feldmenat you see leh and the parifacial neucleus is involved in any time you double up the inhales or double up the exals it was designs that you could breathe while you are speaking because you cannot always go inhal exhalian hal exhal when you are peaking i tell you this not to overwhelm you with knowledge but just now that when you double up your inhals are you double up your exhails you are activating this parafacial neucleus and it has other cool effects because it is located near the nurons that control the face it also has a tendency to relax the jaw there some interplay between the nurons that control the speaking stuff and the stuff tforh your tongue all of a sudden when we do this physiological sigh we tap into nurral circuitry that allows us to speak more clearly to control the muscles of the face and jaw maybe that means not saying certain things when we are stressed and just generally to relax and this brings us back to the nur science of this para sympathetic nervous system this calming system in thats been gynetically incoded into us that we all have regardless of who ore parents are which is that the nurons that control all this stuff the face the eyes et cetera are all working together and that is why when we get stress its hard for us to speak or we tend to gidter in tese kinds of things just all the nurons that cause stress in the center of thes final quart ar working together to get our body activated oke lot of science to day you have now got the physiological sigh as a tool that exhal emphasized breathing will slow your heart down and inhal emphasize breathing will speed your heart up let us think about something now let us think about stress from not whether not it is acute or cr whether nots good for us or bad for us but on three different time scales because then we can arrive at what this is all about as it relates to emotions becauses trust me this has everything to do with ewmotions and whether not your functioning well emotionally or your not functioning whelel emotionally whether not your coping or not coping those are typically psycho logical terms in psychological discussions we are entering this through the portal of physiology the stuff of medical text books and we will arrive at the psychology soon but i really want you ou understand the difference between the three kinds of stress on three different times scills short term medium term and long term and what it is good for and what it is bad for i think we have all heard that stress is bad for us we have seen these picture is intended to frighten us and indeed they are frightening you see the nice really plump brain on the left says healthy or control and then you see the brain that says stressed above it on the right and is witherd or we see that the hyppocampa isinariinvolved a memory is smaller people their stressed we see that the alcimers brain is made worse by stress that people wever predispositions gets ophrenia when they get stress higher instance of s gets a phrentic episodes you hear that attics will relapse when their stress i mean oke we get it ans very important but i think we have all heard now many times at stress is bad but in that conversation unfortunately it is eclipse some of the really positive things that stress does for us in the short term stress can be short ter medium term or long term long term stress is indeed bad for all the reasons i just mention and many others but what is never actully been discussed is what stress is terrific for positive for in the short term and i think we tend to overlook the important question which is what is short term in what is long term no one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic what is acute rise it five minutes is it five days is it for the duration of final exams or is it for the duration of a senior thesis in college no one no one actually draws boundaries around the stuffor even general guide lines and it is become a bit of a mess frankly to try ing decyipher this whole space around stresso mhen a try and clean some of this up for you based on what we know from the scientific data first of all acute stress when the stress response hits that is good for euromean system i know that might be it tough fill the swallow but its absolutely true in fact stress often comes in the form of bacterial or viral infection and the stress response is in part organize to combat bacterial and vital infection theire pathways from the same brain centers that activ ate these a nurons in your in your sponal cort to make you feel you want o move there are other nurons in your brain that activate things your spleen which will dep oy killer cells to go out and scavenge for in coming bacteria enviruses and trying eat them up and kill them short term stress and the release of a drenolin in particular or epinefron same thing a drenlin up an eferon is good for combating infection and this to me is just not discussed enough that is wht i'm discussing it here and it relates to a particular tool that many of you ask about but i do not often get the opportune to talk about in such an appropriate contect it is not that it is ever inappropriate to talk about but what i'm about talk about now is the use of again resperation breathing to somewhat artificially activate the stress response and that will accomplish two things oki i'll return to medium in long term stress but i wance a short term stress is good because the dilation of the pupils the changes in the optics of the eyes the quickening of the heart rate the sharpening of your cognition and in fact that short term stress brings certain elements of the brain on line that allow you to focus now it narrows your focus you are not good at seeing the called big picture but it narrows your focus it allows you to do these what i call duration path outcome types of analysis allows you to valuate your environment avaluate what you need to do it primes your whole system for better cognition it primes your immune system to combat infection and that all make sense when you think about the fact that famine thirst bacterial infections viral infections invaders all of the sto liberates a response in the body that is desin to get you to fight back about against whatever stresser that happens to be psychological physical bacterial viral again the stress response is generic the tool takes advantage of the fact that when a drennolin is released in the body from the adrinals it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these killer cells from the imune organs in particular from the spleen but from elsewhere as well and interactions with the limphatic system that combat infection the way this works in the real world is best captured by a study that can be mapped back to called whimhoff breathing now whimhoff breathing is named after the called icemen whimhoff whim of course being this a dutch he i think he his self titled dare devil and indeed he has many many guinists a book e world records for things swimming under icebergs and going up killimanjarro in isshoritan om crossing the desert without water at cetera things that om are quite dangerous if you do not know what you are doing am and whim obviously a survived rom telling you he survived but there two components to a sort of breathing proto call that he developed that was based also on what is called tum l breathing tu m m oh before whim there was tumo breathing and many people call this now superoxygenation breathing although the breath work offisionatos will probably sail well it is not superoxygenation cas your also blowing alo awfu lout of carbonoxide what i'm talking about here regardless of whether not's called wimhoff tumo or superoxygenation is rapid deliberate breathing it is deliberate hyper ventilation why would somebody want to do this well deliberate hyper venilation done for may be twenty five sycles inhal exile inhal exile inhal exel typically it is done in through the nose out through the mouth although sometimes its just through the mouth if you do that for fifteen breaths twenty breath twenty five breat you will feel very alert people who have anxiety will feel anxious they might even have an anxiety attack however we need to ask why that kind of breathing feels that way and it is because that pattern of brething rapid movements of the diafram we will liberate a drenoline from the adrenals it is the release of a drenoline i mention that whim is also called the ice man well that is because he ashually discovered this pattern of breathing somewhat and again it maps back to tumo breathing by going into cold water when you going to cold water that too is a stresser and you liberate a drenoline in response to cold water if you get into an ice bath or a cold shower you will immediately release a drenoline from your drenals now there all sorts of things related to this about psychological control and strestthrechalds it will talk about but i really want people tounderstand that when a drenoline is released in the body you are in a better position to combat infections and weather not you breathe very quickly in these psycles of twenty five breaths and regardless of what you call it does not matter a drenolne is released if you take a cold shower a drenolie is released if you go into an ice bath deliberately and even if you do it non deliberately a drenline is released you are mimicing the stress response and that a drenoline serves to suppress or combat incoming infections and this was beautifully shown in a study that was published in a very fine journal the proceedings of the national acatemy of sciences for the s it is atliberlly called proceeds the national academy ou essay to distinguish it from other proceedings of other national academies in other countries the way the experiment when is that people were injected with endotoxen or in some cases they were injected with with a bacturial woll that mimic infection get it gives you a fever it makes you feel noxious it makes you feel sick it is not pleasant half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing that looked very much the pattern of breathing i described a moment ago of doing twenty five deep inhals an exhals followed by an an exhail holding their breath than repeating twenty five inhals exils holding the breat o this would look something this or if you are listening it sounds twenty five thirty times you willstart feeling heated up youel start feeling the a drennalin response you are liberating a drennling your body than exal hold your breath for fifteen seconds and then repeat and then typically after doing through yor four rounds of that they would inhale very deeply and hold their breath now i want emphasize never ever ever do this anywhere near water people have passed out call shaler water bracaut people have died do not doit i the batub doing in the hotub do not do before swimming please do not do it anywhere near water pleae do not do it at all unless you get clearance to do it from your doctor because there are some pulminary effects and what not an the breath holds should defully not be done by anyon that has glal comar pressure a concerns for the eyes but these repeated cycles of breathing that liberatead drenaline alloud the group that did that protocal to essentially experience zero symptoms from the injection of this e collot which is remarkable they had much reduced or no symptoms they did not feel feverish they did not feel sick they were't vomiting no dirhea which is remarkable but makes total sense when you think about the fact that the short term stress response that what is typli called the acute stress response it designed o combat all stressers in fact were you to cut yourself very deeply while out on a heigh in the woods the other thing that would happen is that there would be a rapid inflammation response and we always hear inflammation is bad inflammation gives us alhimers inflammation is the worst thing but the swelling is associated the inflammation as associated with the recruitment of things macrophages or microglea if it is in nurl tissue sells in our brain and body whose job is to act little ambulances and rush to that sight and clean it up and indeed the inflammation response looks horrible it sounds horrible but it is a great thing in the short term you want to have that tissue marked as in trouble and you want the body and brain to react to it if youre getting peaks in stress from time to time throughout your day or throughout your week you are in a better position to combat infection you are in a better position to heal your wounds physical wounds many great things happen in the stress response now of course the stress response is not always superintense some times it is milder sometimes it allows us to just focus on something as we have a dead line that can feel stressful but that is one of the reasons you procrastinators out there people always ask me what can be done for precrastination what can be done for procrastination as you can understand what is happening which is that you are self imposing stress because stress acts a drug it is a powerful neutropic i get ask about neutropics the most powerful neutropic or smart drug is stress it is the concern of failure it is the desire to do well it is the impending deadline it is the omagoch i have to do this thing now or i'm going to fail that is the best neutropic you will ever find that co bine with a good night sleep which will talk about but we spend a whole month on sleep si do not want a back track too much o ki short term stress great the key is to be able to turn the stress response off when you are done when you do not want that in fact let us just really tamp down the relationship between the short term or acute stress response and infection many of us are familiar with the experience af work work work work work or taking care of a loved one or stresstresstresstrestress than we finally relax may we even go on vacation i now i'm finalyng anyo get the break and then we get sick and that is because the adrenolin response crashed and your mun system crashed with it please understand this now many of you might say will how long is it two hours is it three hours a lot of you out there that really specificy it will vary for everybody i would just going to use a rule of thumb when you are no longer able to achieve good sleep what good sleep means to you ple see the episodes on sleep if you want more about tools to sleep when you are no longer able to achieve good sleep you are now moving from acute stress to chronic stress you need to be able to turn the stress response off if i have one wish wi have many wishes for this life time but if ihave one wish to day that i hope we will permeate and spread out there is this idea that we need from a young age but even as adults and forever we need to learn how to turn off our stress response physiological size is one if we aregoing to activate our stress response intentionally by icebas cold showers sicklic hyperoxygenat o breathing a c tumb o breathing or whimhoff breathing we also need to learn how to press the break o k let us think about the stress system it nows how to activate itself now we are talking about a way of deliberately activating your stress system in order to combat infection i do this from time to time i might feel a tickle in my throat or i'm getting kind of run down i will do this kind of breathing i do i wi'll take twenty five or thirty bress exhail hold my hold my breath twenty five thirty breaths again exhail hold my breath for about fifteen seconds twenty five thirty breaths again exhail hold my breath for twenty five or thirty seconds than a big inhal and i hold my breath until i feel the impulse to breathe again i feel it safe for me i've run it by my doctor it is fin im you should not do this unless it is right for you but i do this some people the ice bath i rarely do the ice bath someboy wile cold showers i hot showers i take hot showers but i do this kind of breathing again they are all having more or less the same effect of increasing a dranaline and which allows you to combat the infection because you are activating the mun response o k i's not talk about medium term stress medium term stress is going to be stressed that lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks o kind we mighthing of that as long term stress there are times in life when we are just dealing with a lot ok this particular quarter i havp n to be directing a coreome o in the lab i'm doing this i enjoy all tese things immensely but i'm kind of near my threshold im i'm near the point where any additional thing i could not log on to webside the other day and i'e felt the most intense thing in the world that that moment and i can laughed at myself fortunately i caught it but that typically would not be my response under conditions where i was not pushed to threshal what is this medium term stress what is stress threshold well stres threshold is actually our ability to cognitive le regulate what is going on in our body we have all here to much about we need to unify our mind and body we need to be at one with our mind and body or ut own now i i realize i'm kind of poking fun at some of the new ageyou language but the reason i poke fun is not because i do not think it as value but it has no specificity what oes that mean i mean i think i'm always in the my body i've never fortunately looked across the rom and seen my arm over there or my leg over there i'm connected to my body there actually is a syndrum where people feel disconnected from their limbs this is a real clenical condition these people actualy will seek out amputation they will try ind convince doctors to amputate certain portions of their body is a really terrible thing for people to have a and it relates to it a change in central maps in the brain believe or not most of us want to keep our limbs a whichever ones we happen to have and most of us feel one in mind an body much that when stress hits we feel it in our mind and body a lot of stress anoculation a lot of managing medium turned stress on the on the time scale of weak sor mabium in a couple months r not tiecing about years of stress a lot of that has to do with rating our stress threshold it is about capacity and there are very simple tools excellent tools that will allow us to modulate are capacity for stress and they look a lot the tools i just described they involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our a drennaline is increased somewhat not to the extreme and then when we are feel flooded with a drenaline and normally we would panic it is about cognatively mentally emotionally calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body unlike trying to unify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way and what would this look well this is something i shaly do as a practice because i mention before you can use physiological size and real time you can use the sicklic hyporoxigenation breathing to combat infection if you feeling kind of run down and there is also way in which you can use things colled showers or if you exercise in you bring your heart rate up very high you con go into that high intensity realm where your heart is beating a little bit harder than your comfortable with and that your or your just yu feel a some people think it is lackic as and no one can agree on this whether what the burn is by whent ons latic acirds build up of hydrogen or whatever ind want to get into that but we are all familiar with the intense feeling of your muscles kind of burning because your you are working very hard physically the key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind while the body is very activated and what that tends to do there is a limited amount ofr ra search on this but what that tends to do is intends to create a situation where what once felt a lot feels manageable kithet you have raised your stress threshold or your stress capacity one way that you can do this and this is knd of fun if you's approved by your physician and you are able to do this you can bring your heart rate up you coul do this through an ice bath if that is your thing or cold shower or eclic oxygenation breathing or youcould sprint or you can go hard on the bike whatever it is that brings your heart rat up and then what you want to do is you want o actually try ind calm the mind while your body is in this heightened state of activation and the best way that i'm aware to do that again goes back to physiology not psychology when we are stressed are pupils dilate the effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnal vision it literally narrows our view of the visual world we no longer see in panorama and there is some other effects as well but that is because the visual system through this cranial nerve system that i describe before is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system by deliberately dilating your gaze meaning not moving your head and eyes around but by deliberately going from tunnal vision to broader panoramic vision literally seeing more of your environment all at once you dont have to do what i'm dong which is not blinging your welcome to blink but it means diet deliberately dilating your gaze that you can see yourself in the environment your in it creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a particular circuit in the brainstem that is associate with alertness ach stress now this is very powerful if your running for instance in yourmax capacity ore close to it or you are cont a hitting eighty ninety per cent of maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze what you will find is the mind can relax while the body is in full output and this is a relates to work that in various communities people are are working with this in the sports community military commuse at cetera but it is a form not really of stress and oculation it is more about raising stress threshold that the body is going to continue to be in a high alertness high reactivity mode high output but the mind is calm and this is not about unifying mind and body this is ashly about using body to bring up your level of activation than dissociating not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders but dissociating the mental or emotional response from what is going on in your body and over time s if you do this couple times you ont to dis every work out but if you do t his ever may be once a week or you start being comfortable at these higher activation states what once felt overwhelming and a lot of work now is manageable it feels tolerable that is for navigating medium term stress now there are other tools as well but we do not wanto go over ninety minutes cas ninety minutes is one al treatin an cycl i was tryand keep these podcast to one all treati in cycle an ks you have not notice you can drive maxpom benefit from them baste on ll treatin n cycl principles of learning i do not want to go in to every little bit of this and i want a make sure we get to emotions but i wanto emphasize that these medium term stressers o has been a hard month or hard weeker it youst a stampers on the quarter systems o ten weeks or summester that is becomes more manageable when we train our selves to be calm of mine when our body is activated and if you have not noticed most of the tools i'm describing to day are nothing the sort of voces an do meditation i'm not i'm actively avoiding saying the words and esty ar non sleep deep rest i talk to lot about those tools during the months on sleep and nerl plasticity and of course they are wonderful for replenishing your ability to lean in to effort to learn to focus please do try and check out and esty our protocal see if they are right for you the margins for safety i think are enormous you would basically just listening to a script we have link to them in previous captions ave talked on them a very's pocast before we can provide them again but to day an really talking about tools sleep can learn to dance with stress to in the short term reduce that stress responsible bit if you feels to uncomfortable in the medium term to be comfortable at these heightend levels of activation because life is going to continue to come at you we cannot pick the stressers but we need to be able to function in a higher capacity often and then there is long term stress now long term stress is bad you do not want a drendlin up in your system for a very long time in fect you you ideally you would have your stress go up various times troughout the day but it would never stay elevated and it would never prevent you from getting a good night sleep now that is not realistic i i would say for me three four nights out of the month no matter what i do i take on too much or something happens and life is life and i do not get the best night sleep that i would to get for many of you it is thirty nights per month for some of you it is zero nights per monthind congratulations to u zeron a nights por month people if you are managing your sleep really well every night that is fantastic you really want to be able to fall asleep at night stay asleep for most the night an if you get up go back to sleep for as longs you ne do an order to feel rested that is what i define as a healthy relationship to sleep check out the episodes on sleep if you want tools to be able to accomplish that if we can all accomplish that it can be done and there are tools to do at zero cost tools o casi let us talk about long term stress early are i talked about how breathing can m odulate heart rate through this loop that includes the brain and the parisympathetic nervous system i do not think i mention this and i want to make surethat i mention that breathing controlling heart rate through the sympathetic and parisympathetic nervous system is the basis of what is called h re the heart rate varyability and we know that heart rate variability is good you do not want your heart rate chronically elevated or chronically low lot people think oh i want a really nice low heart rate and indeed if you are in shape the stroke volume of your heart will be greater and you can have a nice slow heart rate you years ago when i was running regularly i you it think my heart rate was down a fifty or sixty or something that that is that is greape but and now it is higher than that because i'm running a little bit less but everone needs to determine what is right for them but you do not really want your heart rate to be chronically low or chronically high both are bad we know that chronic stress elevated stress and especially in the calle type a personalities creates heart disease leading killer of for in most every country but in particulaar in the us because of the way that a drenalin impacts those blood vessels of constricting and some and dilating others it is just that kind of hyp pretension chronic hy pretension is just bad and chronic stress truly is bad i want a really make that clear because i i emphasized a lot of what some of the pozove effects of stress but you want to be able to tamp down your stress in real time you also want to be able to modulate your stress in your your motional relationship to stress in the body in the medium term but by kno means do you want to be stressed out all the time chronically for months and months and months and years on end the best tools the best mechanisms that we know to modulate long term stress might surprise you alo bit first of all there are gon be the things that do not surprise you which is everyone knows getting regular exercise getting good sleepe using real time tools to try and tamp down the stress respons et cetera that is all gan to be really useful the data really point to the fact that social connection and certain types of social connection in particular are what are going to mitigate or reduce long term stress and this is a particularly important issue nowadays where we have all these chroxies or surregets for social connection you were online and texting with people a lot as we can feel connected youn people are the plains about to take off in everyone is tectingeach other the whether not they have fearflying or not they ok see you love you hate you whatever it is that they are trying to communicate to people then plain lands everyphones out see ou love you hate you let us hope it is let few or hate yous but everyone has this kind of need to state connected to one another humans are incredibly social creatures n ow there is a way to look at this whole business of social connection not from just the kind of wishy washy new agy perspective and i want to point out that sometimes i'll say wishy washy new agy i have nothing against that a i just my goal here is always to put a scientific data and some anerchemistry on things that for those of you that are in to wishy washy new agy stuff you also can arm yourself with some arguments for those of you a the the members of your family and your and your life that may be are not am tuned into the typical language around those practices all connection is really key we all get oxy tos and actually did that connection between individuals rarely causes the release of oxytosin oxytosan is released a very particular circumstances post orgaasm baby and mother milk let down it is associate with kind of really intense kinds of parabonding things of mother and child also father and child but especialy mother and child because its orelationship the lactation system a couples post sects a these kinds of things that were reflect deep kind of layers of our biology and oxytosan is not just released when we walk in and you'l pat thedog on the head or we see somebody whwewe give a mahog and i great to see you you knofis bump that is not a situation for oxytosin the way to think about social connection and how it can mitigate some of the long termifects of stress is really through the systems of neuromodulation seratonan and through in blocking certain things that are really bad for us when we feel cially isolated things tacky kind ofnds let me explain what these are seratonan again as a neuromodulator nermodulayers are lobit playless in the brain they tend to amplify or bias the likelihood that certain brain circuits and body circuits are gointo be activated and that others will not seratonan generally and a i realize i'm speaking very generally here but it generally gives us feelings of well being at very high levels tat makes us feel blist and it tends to make us feel we have enough in our immediate environment this is why some of the side effects of anti dopressences the elevate seratonan and actually can help a lot of people woith thepressive symptems but the side effects associated with drugs that increase seratonan tend to be reduced affect they tend to kind of blun to affect or make people feel a their labido is lower desire goes down because the body has much seratonan the brain has much cirtonan that one feels they have enough but seratonan farmatology aside or taking anti te pressencs aside a topic for another time seratnan tends to make us feel good when we see somebody that we recognize an trust sertonan is released in the brain and that has certain positive effects on the imune system anon other systems of neurl repair and and synapses and things that really reen force connections in the brain and prevent that long term withering of connections o sir atonan is tied to social connection now social connection can take many forms as many if i am very attached to my dog i hope he is attached to me he is a sleep most the time i do not know wand even if youples awake i do not really know what i would ask hinbod he seems more or less to o be attached to me as well and there is no scientific evidence that it has to be human human attachment i do have attachments to humans as well but you can have attachments to other people some of those can be romantic attachments theyse could be familial attachments that are non romantic friendship pets even attachments to things that just delight us one of the things that really can mitigate against the long term negative affects of chronic long term stress is not just taving fun we har all the sif you need to play and have fun that can be a little of a tough concept especially for the hard driving people are people that are stress but having as sense of delight a sense of really enjoying something that you see and engage in witness are participate in that is associate with the caratonan system and certainly play is one of those things social connection of various forms those are things too investin some people might say well you kdo not knobody wants to be my friend or snobody wants to engage socially any more i'll be the first to admit social connection and friendship and relationships of all kinds to animals or humans or inanimate objects takes work it takes investhment it takes time in not needing everything to be exactly the way you want it to be i i h've a friend who struggles with this and oftentimes the conversations just circle bak to the faed that when you want social connection you often have to be more flextible you have to eat on other people schedules sometimes you have to eat things you do not necessarily want to eat the most in that moment or stay up a little later r wake up a little earlier social connection is something that we work for but it is incredibly powerful i want of course tip my hat to a not thit is only a proprit t call m the great robert supulsky by my colleague who have unfortunate ato know at stamford of course is talked about this quite a lot i i want acknowledge o roberts incredible work and discussions round this you can look up those materials on line and his wonderful books but primates and we are primantes were we are social species and as robert as said many times before never before in any primate history but improduin human history have we interacted with many strangers at a distance when we are not really connected to them finding just a few people even one or an animal or something that you delight in believe it ore not has very positive effects on mitigating this long term stress on improving various aspects of our life as it relates to stress and emotionality that is the social connection part the other thing is that social isolation that goes too long is associated in everything from flies believe are not to mice and humans with this molecule t ki kinan taki kinan is a molecule that makes us more feo fearful paranoid and in pars are immune system and taki kinan is this punish internal punishment signal its our body in our brain telling us you are not spending enough time with people that you really trust you are not spending time doing things that you really enjoid and i often think about takikinan for myself becaue i'm pretty hard driving ihave a lot of pursuits i 'ls have a lot of wonderful people and and incredibly wonderful bulldog in my life but there are times when i can be gul directed and in motion and tring to accomplish everything that i sometimes forget that about taki kinan and i to remind myself much that iacthi have a little postit above my dessas as taki kinan to remind me the taki kinan is this very sinister molecule that starts being secreted whend we are not socially connected enough and this is why long meals with friends or family where there are we will talk about phones in a moment but where there is no intrusions or even if there are just feeling we are connected suppresses taki kinan and taki kinan is something you really want to avoid because chronic isolation cronically hi taki kinan ants associate with long term stress really deplete many good functions of our brain and body and promote many bad ones including irritability paranoia fear et cetera that is really something to avoid and i want a highlike taki kinan as something to avoid i do not want to completely disregard oxitosen its just that oxitosin has been built up a lot in the media and really seratonan works on much faster time skills now how do if you are making caratonan you do not know in the moment but you can learn if you pay attention to can a recognize these feelings of comfort trust bliss delight and those are not weak terms those are not associated just with a psychological terms they are they are every bit as physiological as the movement of your muscles are the secretion of a drenalin that and many people fokess now on gratitude gratitude is a little bit subjactive and here were moving from of some objective to kon a subjective things but recognizing and in particular writing down things that your thankful for however small they may seem does seem to have a pausove effect on the on these ceratonan system now there are plather of things that will also impact well being in allow you to mogumodulate your long term stress reduce the likelihood that ou'll engage in long term stress and we do not have time to go into all these but of course finding the diet and nutrition that is right for you the exercise scadual the srite you the sleepscadu all that but do not under emphasize the social connection part please as well there are some compounds that are not antidopressence although if you need enter topressence and acclinition prescribes them to you please follow their advice if that is what rite for you there are compounds that are not prescription compounds that can mogulate the stress system and sometimes because of the way that life is we just do not have the opportunity to control life and to control our response distress and at least for myself i can only talk about my own experience i've found it useful in times of chrnic stress to start modulating some of the norchemistry related to the stress response in order to help now if a doctor proscribes you pregnizone or proscribes you some other hormone or something that is important but what i'm talking about now are nonprescription things you should check out examined ot com this free website which will allow you to put in any supplement and evaluate that supplement with they provide linxs in the called cuman effect matrics to pobmet it tells you the exact subjects they were done in if the postmen apozle women was it kids was it normal adults was it people with autism et cetera check out that site for any in all supplements you are considering or taking i highly recommend it af no relationship to them i just think it is a wonderful site that is curated all this important information but the some of these compounds are effective enough they can kind of take the edge off and i'll use them perioticalle o myself and i just thought i'd mention them since their number of you that are interested them the three i want afocus on and one that i think you need to be cautious about that i've mention before include ashuaganda funny name but that is what is called elphianine or theanine it is often called and melatonan let us talk about melatonan first mlatonan i talked about during the month on sleep melatonan is hormon secretive from the pineal in direct relationship to how much darkness you are in not emotional darkness but light suppressis melatonan melatonand helps you fall asleep it does not help you stay asleep i personally do not recommend supplementing melatonan because its supplemented typically at very high levels yo one to three meligrams or even more that is an outrageously hig dose it supersuperphysiological compared towhat you normally would make it also has a number of potentially negative effects on the reproductive axis and and hormons there some people can take it without proms if you it and that is your thing fine i just want acue to the fact that there can be issues you should check on examondot com talk to your doctor especially in kids because melatonan suppresses the pubrity response in a number of species enough about the negative things af meltonan except that people who take too much malatonan chronically often tan when they are taking it to sleep or for whatever reason yes it can reduce anxiety in stress but it also can reduce the output of the adrenals to the point where i can become poproblematic now a note about a drenal burn out there is actually no such thing as a dreanal burn out under normal conditions the adrenals have enough a drenalin to support two hundred years of stress for better for worse the concept of a drenal burn out has origins in the work of noble prize winter honcelie who actualy discovered what he alled the general adaptation cyndrum he disc erd a lot of things about stress he did some phenominal work that turned out to be true that we have stressers there is something called distress he talked about u stress which is posive stress ustresses never really caught on in the in the kind of more general discussion but he had this theory that if stress went on long enough that you would ventually reach a phase called exhaustion and that turned out to be wrong although many of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress there is not really a physiological exhaustion that happens and that eventually got picked up and ran with the general public an they tolk bout a dreanal burn out too much coffee a dreanal burn out you hear all this stuff there is no such thing as a dral burn out the addrals do not burn out there is something however called a dreanal in sufficiency cyndrum which is a real physiological problem where some people have very impaired a drenals and they cannot produce a dranalan and melatonan taken at very high levels for periods of time that are too long can cause suppression of the cardisall and epinephan release from the addreanals and can can create a kind of pseudo a drenal insufficiency cyndrum beware melotonan for that reason please i'm trig i alone cannot get rid of the phrase of dreanal burn out i'm not trying to am give a hard time to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted but it is for other reasons it is not because the addreanals are burnt out unless you have not have a dreanal insufficiency cyndrum i'm not a phanamelatonan for a lot of reasons now i've mentioned several the other is elphenine i've talked about elphenine which provided it safe for you can be taken a hundred miligrams or two hundred miligrams about a thirty minutes or sixty minutes before sleep it can enhance the transition to sleep in depth of sleep for many people it increases gaba thi sinhibitory narrow transmitter in the brain ittents to turn off are forbrain a little bedders or reduce the activity of our con othinking systems and ruminating systems help people fall asleep that is for sleep but theanine has also been shown for people that are chronically anxious are chronically stressd to if you look at the studies that ihave a large collection of studies in front of me right now if you want to see those links i know if you want those go to examined ot calm put intheanine they linked for instance it is known to significantly increase relaxation their fourstudies listed there with pub med links it is known to have a minor effect on anxiety but eight studies have shown that which i think is a o fairly large set of studies some of them in great jurnals it also can reduce task completion anxiety anxiety related to task comple sion not good for the procrascinators perhaps but for those either chronically stress it can increase attentional a bit can reduce blood pressural o bit improve sleep quality et cetera the deviliy has a notable effect on stress two studies in particular that it can notably reduce the effects of stress there is a lot there it also as effects on in psome on some blood blippid profiles and go to examined ot common check it out but this is one reason why i supplementtheniane for sleep but if i'm feeling i been under a lot of stress and i'm not anaging my stress very well with the short term and medium term tools that i talked about earlier i might start taking a little bit a theanine espechaling the late afternoon which is when i tend to start to feel i having gotten enough done and the day is conticarrying on and you can blunt the response to stress elobit which is why a lot of companies are now putting theanine into energy drinks i am not a big fan of most energy drinks most of them have toring which i know some of you wrotch meansthat o tornes great for all these reasons toring also has effects on the microvasculature that least for me were not good it cause bursting of microvasculatur in my sclara in my eyes which is why i'm not a fan of any energy drink that has toring or toring generally but that is just me you have to decide for you i'm sure the comment section thou'll be a couple on torrenni stos out there that will say but i love toring great keep the toring companies in business but it is not for me and i'd people to know that it may or may not be for them the other supplement that can be very useful is aschueganda aschueganda is known to lower anxiety and cortisall there is six there are escuse me six studies that collectively show reductions and cortes all which is cortis all's typically associated with waking up in the morning which is good that is a healthy brief cortis all bump that goes away provided you are getting your light at the right time of days at rit correct times of day morning in an evening but you do not want cortis all chronically elevated that is associate with all the bad stuff about stress there is a tvery strong effect of aschweganda you can find dosages hat examined out come they report in across six studies fourteen point five to twenty seven point nine reduction in cortis all in otherwise healthy but stressed individuals now i do not know about kidsyou have to look at what the what the what it says on very supplements most things here are being done an adult please check carefully but this is great i'm in the opportunity for me anyway to be able to take something that can help me reduce my cortes all that i do not get some of the long term effects of stress and i nok in o take oshragone a year round i would only do this if i was feeling that i was not managing my short inmedium termstress well i do not take it on a regular basis i do take it when i'm in these times when things are particularly stressful it has there five other studies that show reduced stress that is not cortis all measurements but things fatigue cognive emparmen et cetera am it does lower total collestral which mayor may not be good or bad for you up to ten per cent am some people do not want their collestral lowered some people might i'm colestrall we will talk aby this in a month on hormons but collestral is the molecule from which tostostrone and esterogen and cort is all for that matter are synthesize you do not want get your colestral low than thereall sorts of negative effectsbuy do not want too high either am mild effects in good clinical studies on reducing depression probably associated with the effects on stress and some other things as well aschwuegonda is something i use from time to time is con of interesting elpheanine i rarely will use those during the daytime except under conditions where i'm feeling chronically stress check out the human effect matricks on examined out calm again a phenomenal web sight i think i've sent them a few emales before ah that is the only exchanges have ever had with them but i just think it is wonderful that they put together this resource otherwise be stuck mining pubmed they of colated that the par papers from pubmed with linx to pubmet terrific resource social connection and some supplementation of course diet exercise sleep for long term stress and now we are finally in a position to talk about what we have set out to do from the beginning which is spend the month on emotions it was very important that we discuss stress and we discuss in the context of short medium and long term stress that we discuss tools for short term medium term and long term control i do not really want to sigmitigation of stresstresses going to happen but our ability to modulate and control stress in real time off line using tools such as respiration using tools such as dilation of gays using tools social connection may be some supplements sertainly take care of your sleep and nutrition and exercise again tons of resources and information in the sleep episodes you can look there we will do a month on hormons on exercise et cetera but let us talk about emotions because in subsequent episodes we are going to talk about oc d we are going to talk about depression we are goingto talk about mania we are ging to talking about dopamine and all sorts of things but at the cor of emotions is this question what is in emotion well it is complex there is not a single brain area for any one of these things that we call emotions my framework and i think the modern science both psychology and neuro science is pretty well alined with what lisa feltmen bear it has talked about n elisa's at north eastern university she runs a big lab there she is a world expert in emotion she is witten two books that are really wonderful one is how emotions are made which was her first book the second one is seven and a half ex about the brain at's a wonderful book as well came out more recently i hosted lis on an instogram live ones may be will get here her here on the podcast if we are lucky we do not agree on everything about the narrow scince of emotions but i subscribe to most everything that i've heard lyse o say in particular the fact that emotions are context dependent there is a cultural dependence et cetera i look at things mainly through the lends of physiology an naurow science at kind of low level circuitry and one way to thnk about emotions that i think as consistent and i think lisa would generally approve i cannot speak for her but i would hope she would generally approve of this description is that when our internal state of stress or calm matches the demands on us or is mismatch from the demands on us we tend to interpret those as good or bad let me give you an example if i am feeling very anxious very stressed inside and i have a lot to do that does not feel good but it is really no different then if i'm very tired and i have a lot to do because there is this mismatch i'm not in the right internal state my internal state is not correct rather to meet the demands that are being placed upon me in both cases whether i'm too tired or i'm too stress to do what i need to do the vailance meaning the value that i assignd to that is i do not feel good it is not a good situation and i do not feel good i might call it stressed i might call it anxious i might call it worried might call it a number of things but it is not good however when i'm tired and i want to fall asleep well then i feel good because that is what the demand is i need to go to sleep and i'm tired if i'm wide awaken i need to fall asleep then that is not good and i tend then the brain tends to go down the direction of interpreting the situation is a bad one while the discussion around emotions is far more nuanc any more elaborate than this one way to think about your relationship to emotions is whether r not your internal state is matching the demands that are upon you in that way we do not really place much value on whether not were feeling alert or sleepy we only place value on whether not that alertness whether not it is full blown stress or not or are sleepiness whether not were falling asleep or just a little bit drowsy whether r not that matchis the conditions that we face and it is a useful frame work to have in it is the reason in part why i spent this last hour and a half or talking about stress and how to control stress one reason we did that is because i think it is a valuable opportunity to learn some tools and understand stress and really learn how to take control of stress which i think we cout all benefit from doing regardless of age the other reason is that when you start to understand that you have this kind of sea saw system in your body this autonomic nervous system that takes you from alert and calm to stressed to full blown panic it has that capacity or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired to god forbid let us hope never but a coma right that your basically on this seasaw all the time and where you are on that seasaw of alertness or calmness positions you to be in better reaction to the demands that you face whether not the thing that you faces a need to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react you now know for instance that if your job is to take feed back e may be're going in for a job of valuation or ah you are in a relationship where your there was a call for a discussion and somebody needs to talk to you about something and we need to talk about something you are going to thay goodness this is kan o berough learning to reduce that stress response a little bit that you are in a position to hear the information n better and remember from ma previous episode if you close your eyes youl be able the actually focus on the infermision better tets your permission to not looks ome one directly in the eyewhey ther talk to you if you really want to here what they have to say you we will be able to modulate that stress response and lean into life better you will be able to react to things in a more effective way and to not be reactive and this is really one of the important things to me anyway is that much of the language around psychology which i i think is a wonderful feel but poppsycholloge in particular is be responsive not reactive will great but then how does one do that while one does that by modulating their short term stress response in real time not by saying hold on i need to meditate hold on i need a misage and then i can have this conversation by modulating the reactivity in real time how does one for instance be mindful which is a beautiful concet but how are you mindful well i do not know when i'm moving through my day alodtimes i'm just try to get things done and as soon as i start monitering and seeing what i'm doing and it cond of third personing what i'm doing it actully takes me out of the effectiveness and experience f what i'm doing for me sometimes that mindfulness that observer as they call it is it is something that does not help me it actualy hinders me what is important to me is to be able to work and focus and then to be able to disengage to be able to do and on sleep depresse or to be able to still fall asleep even though i been working hard until nine thirty to put my head down at ten ofclock and be out cold sleeping by ten o too that is possible if you can learn to to control this stress response and to do that we cannot use the mind to control the mind we need tools and a lot of the am people being grumpy or anxious or depressed a lot of that provided's not for some underlying nour chemical reason that is chronic a loto that comes from being poorly rested from overworked from feeling the world is bearing down on us and rather than take a subjective view of this i take the view of objective physiology what can we do that is anchor to these nouronal systems in our body in our brain in our eyes in our diaphram et cetera and look to those as tools levers that we can pull on and push and maneuver through life in a way where we start to feel we have some agency we actually have some real control because we are controlling the internal landscape i think that ought to set the stage for where we are headed next which is to talk about all the things that you normally think of when you think of emotions happiness awe joy and we will get into some of that but all of that rest firmly on the foundation of this thing we call the autonomic nervous system this stress modulation this calming modulation system and again whether not your activated or your calm is not good or bad it depends on the situation certainly when you want o fall asleep being activeated is not good when you have work to do being activated is great i hope to day you are able to take a slightly different view of this thing that we call stress not just see it as evil but see it as powerful and useful in certain contacts of great for us in certain contects and problematic an other contacts and as well to think about the various tools that have presented that can allow you to adjust and modulate you are internal levels of alertness are commness that you can lean more effectivele into life which include sleep and social connection and the work you have to do and of course acknowledges that the events in the world are beyond our control what is in our control as how we react to them something that is commonly said in the wellness and self help and psychology world but for which there often are not as many concrete tools that we can really look to in trust in real time and of course there are other tools out there as always i'll say it i i strive to be accurate but i'll never be exhaustive i might have exhausted you i might have cured your insommnia with this a discussion to day but in all seriousness my goal is to bring you tools and information that you can manage better through life think much i very much want to thank all of you for your support for the podcast treally been wonderful if you have subscribe to the podcast on you

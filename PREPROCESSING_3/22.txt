jo bidon believes he is going to win the twenty twenty four election based on one simple idea donald trump is a sic fog bogave tis literally what he says behind closed doors according to politico and the language here is not mine te language here is jobidons according to politico president bidon has reputation for salty language behind closed doors but it nearly slipped down n public during his speech o valley forge last month to mark the third anniversary of the january six insurrection animated and angry he dirided donald trump and is followers for drawing glee from political violence he apparently came very close to saying what a sec blate button private he does not actually stopp short the president has ascribed trump to long time friends in closiates as a sic fog who delights in others misfortunes according to three people who have heard the president use the profane description according to one ofthe people who has spoken wit the president by nrecently set of trump that he was a ask this apparently is the way that jobidon thanks of donald trump and because of that jobidon simply cannot believe that donald trump is actually poise to win the twenty twenty four election now here is the reality by the pulling tata donald trump is poise t win the twenty twenty four election if he just look at the trump verses bidon pulling right now what you will see is that donal trump actually has a lead donald trump has a lead over jobidon every poll except for one in the last cuple months has trump up pretty solidly the latest pull comes from sianen and i has donald trump up forty nine forty five over jobidon if donld trump lins the popular vote for the first timpson's re publican won the popular vote in two thousand for he is going to win the election it is that simple he came close towining the election even losing the popular vote by seven million votes he is also leading big in states that he lost last time particularly in states georgia the latest pulling from jgeorgia has donald trump up eight per cent over jobidon and donald trump is running dead even in wisconton donald trump is running well ahead apparently in michigan not only that jobidon is failing as as a mental force he just he is spent he is spent and and he is begun to dy in to the thibs that he is been telling for years to the plonwer just repeats the mad nausium nobody feels he is in control of the world situation nobody feels lik is in control of himself it is real problem for him for example two days ago he called up the family of an army specialist who had just been killed by arranian proxy forces in jordon and in the middle of this call to the parens he at tempted to do this roeteen tht he is beendn for a long time where he he demonstrates sympathy not by actually sympathizing but by talking about his own experiences which by the way is actually not how you do sympathy typically speaking an unfortunatll had been to lota shie a households right people have died and you going to visit the grieving family members and when people are grieving the last thing they want here is about your grief experience if donald tumpthing they particularly want hereabout because they are in their own grief experience in indicates jobidon does that routineing boty does not just do that he also whin h his talking to the families of service members have been killed he lies to them he lies them at his son beou he is been doing this for years at this point to the point where it is no longer excusable in this particular phone call which was tate by the etlante jounal constitution he suggests that his son bou died in a rock which of course not true bobidon tragically died o brain cancer years after a turning from a rock which obide has been teling this fib for long that he may believe it at this point here he was o e kno e eririrhe in ther ther the parents overcome with the motion when the president reveals how their daugter will be onerd er rier ar oh wow t fee he do not kno that an therthat story about bot is not true he keeps telling it over and over and over and jobidon is prevaricator and he lies a lot but the fact is that it may be if he believes it isbent whatever the whatever the symptoms of his mental decline they are not going to bow well for his reelect effort agan when you look at the state by state pulling downel from his well ahead in what used to be as swing state of ohies up by eleven points in ohio right now he is up as i say solidly in georgia he is running dead even according to new fox newspole in wisconsin it is hard to see frankly how jobidon recovers his standing among various groups in the united states a nucian empulse shows that jobidons job approvalrating is standing at thirty eight per cent thirty eight percem sixty two percent disapproving he is under water with every one eighteen to thirty foralts he is underwater s a thirty five per cent approvalrating among people or eighteen o thirty four among white voters he is at thirty four percents approvalrating even among people of color forty five per cent approvalrating thes are terrible members four jobidon his cannun from is how can he possibly win the selection now his strategy in twenty twenty was changed by one simple fact and that is the change in thevoting rules as i've discussed at nausium the fact is that voter turn out in twenty twenty was leagues higher leagues higher than it had been any time in the recen past the voter turn out in that election was extraordinary you saw he jump in election turn out of at lee almost ten per cent wis a sixty seven per cent voter turn out in twenty twenty thow is the highest level that the united states had experience in trms otor turn out since nineteen hundred basically mean that that that is an insane voter turn out why ecaue they changed all the rules because all the rules change when it came too voter turn out e cause suddenly youre gone a vote three months in advance and jobidon was going to deploy the entire democratic party apparatus to rive at your dowar pick up your ballet and mail it in for you and the entire state apparatus in swingstayes pennsylvania is going to change that you could vote early and and vote by mail again sixty percent of democratic voters in to thousand twenty voted by mail when about thirty fiv per cent or thirty per cent of re publican voters in twenty twenty voted by mail and your trobidon still only squeaked by that was a close election you can run up the scornin places california in new york is people hate trump in terms the popular vote and terms of the actual elec toral college vote this selection in twenty twenty was decided by an extraordinarily low number o vote you are talking abot twelve thousand votes in george atyour tongue at may be eleven thousand vots inarizona you are talking about something forty thousand votes in wesconsin a'm at eighty thousand votes in pennsylvania is are not bic numbers mean by any struction te imagination thse are nopic numbers well get to more on this in just one second first if you are me there is not a day that goes by thyu do not call or tect some one you care about my friends at pure tolk are making it easier and more fortable to connect with the most important people in your life pure tak if you phenominal coverage on america's most dependable five ou network it is the same

wireless wot th company you can be proud to spend your money with again pure talk dot com slash a pro god check them outright now pure talk dot com slash puro get fifty per cent off your very first month could donal trump reverse that tren not only could he it seems yo probably will and the reason i say it is because jobidon is not going to duplicates the voter turn out numbers of twenty twenty and les you be clear about this president win narrow elections and then lose votes between election one and election to ten not to win reelection the only president who has lost votes in the modern era from his origina election to his reelect effort is barokobama and sto one that is the only one if you lose votes bet tween your first selection your second election tipically lose and that is probably what is going to happen with jobidon given the trends tht is perticularlytr because jobidon has decided that he is basely going to a bands in blue collorwide voters the democratic party has been taken over since twenty twelve by this vision and it is to find voth parties actually we have talked about a lot on the show there is a vis ion that was promoted by the media and by the oboma campaign in twenty twelve and that vision was in everlasting democratic majority for ever and was going to be demographically based the idea was there is a rising minority coalition thatwud eventually become a democratic majority in the united states and they would never lose another election could abands in white voters increasingly and could build the coalition on the basis of minority voters and college educated white ladies that was the coalition that barokobamarode victory an twenty twelve despite being a deeply un popular president at the time but that relies on really heavy turn out from groups that very often do not turn out at those rites everybody red twenty twelve as it as a new tren line year instead and turns out the twenty twelves exceptional in terms of voter turn out for a wat whide vrity of grops ecause baraokobamos a singular political character ut that cannot be duplicated bite hillery clinton or bite jo bidon again the only reason jobidon one an twenty twenty is because all the rules of voting change and people marginal voters loa perpenshe devoters people who would not show up to the polling place if it were a normal lection simply filled out their ballate and resending it in because covid that is all that happened in twenty twenty shn go through some the stafture because it demonstrates what exactly jobidon is hoping for whi he is unlikely to ach event and also explains his current political strategy which is not to swivel back toward the middle to tryin win those white voters in the suburbs to win white voters and rural areas thou suppose tobe jobidons pitch by the way is that he was supposed to have a rural white appeal that other candidates in the democratic party simply did not have and instead he seems to be duplicating the twenty twelve obama campagn but ye's not barocobama and he is not con tot get the the changes in rules they got in twenty twenty he seems to be increasingly trying to cater two again this new vision of what the democratic party base should be right now the important ing n understand is that non white voters reprecent about forty per cent of all democratic voters as a huge number forty per cent of all democratic voters are not white cane now the only reason that matters is because if the priority for the democratic party is tet that group of voters to turn out at very high rates that means that you are going to have to pander presumably to that group of voters and that group of voters tends to have views on many issues that are left of were jobidon traditionally has been the same thing happens be truge the youth vote forty nine per cent of democratic and democratic leaning voters are under the age of fifty compared with just forty two per cent of republicans furthermore nineteen per cent of democratic voters are under the age of thirty compared with thirteen per cent of republicans the areas where democrats really outpole republicans minority voters and young people the problem for democrats is that those two groups of voters historically speaking hav incredibly variable rates of turn out the white turn out rate in terms of voter turn out tens not to vacelate all that much itents to be fairly stable but depending on who the candidate is for hese various script i can wildly shift for example here is black voter turn out inthe united states by year since two thousand in two thousand tere's fifty three percent black voter turn out in to thousand four was fifty six per cent in two thousand eight it was ha wopping sixty one per cent and in two thousand twelve that was the year that barockobomal was able to swing an election he probaly should have lost it was sixty two per cent and it was particularly located in swing states ohio i brockobma one ohio be s a heavy black voter turn out in ohio but jus proportionate two share of the populace then s something happen in twenty sixteen the number of verted back toard historical tfrients the fifty six per cent of black voters ho voted in two thousand sixteen looked a lot the fifty six per cents o black voters o voted in two thousand four voter turn out went down hilter clitn't probably lost the election because of that and in twenty twenty there is a heavy effort to get out the black vote but the good news was there was not at much effort to get out votes in twenty twenty is i should quite easy to get out votes in twenty twenty by the wiyh that also explains why the democratic party was pandering sohard to the black lives matter movement because the idea was if you panned a really hard to be alam then they will act as a voter turn out machine in favor of jobidon it is why eveready once soft on the riots in th middle of the summer in twenty twenty in the democratic party and again voter turn out did rise again fifty nine per cent black voter turn out in twenty twenty which looks more the barokaba ma sixty one per cent voter turn out for black americans in twenty ol eight then it tdos likely twenty sixteen numbers for hillery clinton now here is the question do you think black voters are ging to turn out the wy that hey did not twenty twenty for jobidon an twenty twenty four on look that does not it his black voter turn out nomber at me right now among people o color jobidon is pulling at forty five per cent it is are not toe numbers for jobidon that is his job approval rating and not only that there is no personal illesions in anyway shap per form from people of color in the united states toward old white man jobit on that is not eighthing is that voter turn out number likely to go down or is it likely to go up the answers it is very likely to go down in the twenty twenty four election e get to more on this in just one second first think about the joy you feel when you treat yourself and buy something new slipping into a new pair of lounge where it is a simple but delightful experience for me hit is the feeling i get every time i put on tommye john tommy john lounge where is cosy enough to use as sleep where silish enough to wear for a quick stroll to the coffee shop you will not even look o just rolled out about even if you probably did ther

coms lashben if twenty per cent for limited time an tommy john dot cam slash men that is tommy john dod calm slash bends he sign forty tails and that is not the only probet for jobiton the youth vote is something that he heavily counted on really heavily counted on in twenty twenty now the youth vote in the united states people eighteen to twenty nine those votes really heavily vacilate based on election cycl let us go his torically here what the youth voter turn out rates ar historically in the united tates ahetein to twenty nine every election cycl you hear the youth are finally gon to turn out this is the year where we mobilize the youths and the youth turkin out swing us to victory rock dhe vote in all of this cen an nonsense i sa here is the youth voter turn ot by yere in two thousand forty per cent of people eged eighteen to twenty nine voted whoare oligible tevote two thousand four that number jum to forty nine per cent is fifty one per cent in to thousan hte right for brokomama which was the year that every young person voted because man o man hit is transforme even and all the stuff that dropped two forty five per cent intwo thousand twelve which is one of the reasons whybrokobama one feu are absolute votes in twenty twelve than he did in two thousand eight in twenty sixteen it went down even from there it was back down to forty four per cent i young voters were not turning out for brokomama two andthey did not turn out for hillery clinton but the voter turn out rate for young voters in the two thousand twenty election was fifty five per cent fifty five per cent tat is a massive spike a spite from forty four per cent of young eligible voters in two thousand sixteen two fifty five per cent of young elligible voters in two thousand and twenty now the last time any the last time young voters turned out that way was wait for it nineteen seventy two in nineteen seventy two fifty five percent of young voters turned out tha turn out for georgemon govern who promptly lost forty nine states to richard nixon young voters are not obviously where the mentality of of most americans is randingthat mentality of most americans is not the same as mentality of young voters but jobiton is looking ap the stat and he realizes the things he neets heavy minority turn out heavy youth turn out is he cing able to duplicate anything twenty twenty he is thinking not but h's teen instead of saying i'll kay we need to let scrap the stratatue ou blow up the stratat you mean to look at the numbers and we need to in stead focus unwinning suburban white ladyes right which is what they ashally nean to do foks on ring suburban white women blue colowork is in ruspelt states that is where jobiton really should be puttinghis effortright he should write now stop looking at the brokobon twenty twelve motel and should star looking at the billclintin ninetee ninetyto ninetee ninety six model i which is why youwould imagine if they are smart later in the summer what youw'll see from the democratic party is therein a shift twrt industrial policy well for policy and abortion and that will be the main state of the campaign if they get wise if they are not wise then jobtn is gin a continue to pander to the most left wing parts of his base because he is looking at these numbers the same is you an ire looking them right now and he is seeing lower voter turn out among young minorties lor voter turn ou among youth and minorities rather he is he is seeing that and what can he do well he can sure pander he can sure pander and that is why there is all o this hart burn over for example israel's ware against commassand gaza it is why the democratic party seems signally unable she' sounds off on the on the southern border despite the facthat that is a birgeoning huge problem not burging i real real time huge problem for the united states now the problem for jobidon of course thtat if you panrds your left wing bays youare also alienating that center that you need jobidon is really hoping that the only way tht he can hold that coalition together is just ta hate trum trumpsy jerk trumps this is why as i've said dono trump's election trategy is very simple he should go to the basement and he should state there jobidon has an unwieldy coalition that is very unlikely to stick together jobn is notkin to get the levels of voter turn out thathe got in twenty twenty absent covaed absent bealem absent the ability to go after these sitting president onnal trum donall trump should go to the basemen and he should stay there and he will win if he does those things fis the only thing in the end that jobidon thinks he can win on really is not even the policy he thinks we can hold together this coalition by hook or by crook with gum an and sticky tape if he can do that and in king heu's point od trump and clmus sic fa than that'l win him the election that is what that is the difficult proposition jobidon is not any wining position in the selection cycle now the problem for the democratic party is that neither would any one else be because if jobidon were to be replaced on the ticket the question would be by whom and why would not that person faced the exact same electoral challenges as jobidon is curently facing if heu but coma harrison place she is way worse she is not gong to get have your black voter turn out and not only that she isgingto alien at everybody she is super high un favorable ratings if it wre somebody gavenusum theyave a serious problem thmi shollabama apparently dosn't want it theyre stuck with biden and again as his presidency gets horse and as the symptoms of that presidencs he become worse he is goen actually eardly enough be forced more and more to the ratical left in the hope in the desperate hope that he can get the voter turn out on his side up that he can get people whre forty percent propensity toevote to fifty percent propensity devote by pantering to them which is why again we have been sang for a long time reare is the political genius in not closing the border just close the border thete's more on this 'n just one second first thereis something absolutely magical about reliving old film memories of my family when i sit down i hippli i'm transported back in time the flickering images on the screen the're more than just recordings the record how my family works how my parents grew up

jobidon close the border the issue would be off the table for donald trunk but your bidon can do it and that is a real problem because people are seeing the tay for example there is a tape that is now emerged of a in legal emigrant is one of the elleglum brin to attack te police officer im is yon bladob and who is release from police custody after assaulting a police officer and here is vidio of this person as he a smarks at reporters leaving e midtown south precinct here is what a look i there he has flipping off the out flipping off ant reportersy idn i's man i t's my land mi yon eoweweis gesle itlis i associate batoscy and there he is slipping off the mediot o gay even eric adams the mayor of new york is looking at this an sand we need deportation of criminal migrans rightmans prety simple suff who exactly is against deporting eving glemigrans fofre not you are legally and wo are cominting crimes here is eric adams the mar of new york and those migres who i here because they want to bepad of the merican dream that is i we say yesterday but those who all bracan il los il wene to be examine i the los that don allow us il to deplut them il because they you in minin acts wecannot credin atmosphere wel you gant to bing miness in i'll city but i the over womin number of migess in sin cekis il waited to have bork ot to visation or they determination and we need to be clear on thet o get even democrats are starting to say this is too much cebbit the democratic party is a whole cannot abandon what they think is the minority voting base in the youth voting bas which presumably is why there is a vote yesterday two in congress to deport illegal emigrans to commit do you i this seems ake a pretty easy one you are here illegally and the you are driving trunk deeporting you seems a pretty easy solution well the measure pass it passed two seventy for with to one fifty all one hundred and fifty votes agains to deeporting legal imigrans with a du i were democrat all of them in fact that represents a majority of the democratic caucas only fifty nine democrat joined republicans invoting to deport illegal emogrants we are caught d u i the bill would make people charged wit the du i and are in th us illegally automatically eligible for deportation and permanently in admissible as foxs new's reports just last month and undocument ad migran f malsalvidor who had been deported for separate tines was accused of killing a mom an a son in a carcrath that police sent involved alcall what exactly is the democratic logic here why exactly would not they vote to de ports people who commit d iyes in ere here illegally why n't we let the chair of the progressive democratic caucas progressive congressional caucas in num in the democratic cacas my promilogipo who n't eu let her explain but my collegues on the other side of the isle have made it clear that they are not interested in sensible solutions just in sensationalism this bill is another example of that and i hope my colleagues will stop referring to people as illegals people are human beings they have different statuses some are undocumented if you want to say some are a legal but let us not call human beings illegal tired of that language i urge my colleagues to reject the spill an i yeeld back the balance of my time nay this is what the democratic party is now pandering to which is incredible i mean tat's just such a signal failure by them they can even say we mwant more legal imigration into the country but sen you doft want to port people a du iyes that is political malcractise and yen a majority of the democrats in the house voted against a bill to deport people whor here illegally and have a du i that is insane that is totally insane by the way this also the reason why republicans are having trouble getting on board with any bill that allows more executive discretion with regard to the border they do not wanto be held responsible for jo bidon interpreting that bill in the most absurd possible way to keep that border open ot at infightin in the republican caucas right now about a border bill thats can be brought up for a test vote apparently to day it is unclear what exactly is in the bill and we keep hearing from different republicans in congress they cannot rip on the bill until what is in it well how bout you cannot ask me to support the bill until i know what is in it tbecause it seems to me that the status quall which is that jobidon should close the border given the authority oncurrently has i's perfectly sufficient for jobit niclose the border the executive brancs refusing to do its job is not going to be cured by the legislative branch passing more authority for the precedent tha he can not do his job that is non can be the cure unless the legislator branches forcing the executive branch to acturally enforce the law a new bill is not nesterling in to change anythings wi'll have to see what exhapctly is in that bill but the bott om line here is that jobidon is pandering because jobidon feels he neans jupander in order to win reelection and the same thing is happening with regard to the midaleast two separate stories yesterday that are both insane one story is that jobiton desperately de sperately wans to make sure that there is not a broader war in the ideleast well he is running jobidn is willing to appeasoron up to the neck long as aron does not escalate into something resembling morefullskale war he is basically now playing the same game thet barakobama in serious reelect trouble in tweny twelve played with demetre medvidav who is then the stand in pressin nd for vladmerpooten in russia youll recall the brakbama sat with medvadav and he said i'll have much more flexibility after the election which was basically him begging medvadav tell pooton not to do anythng aggressiv until after the election and after the election if he does something ingressive all probably came to him which by theway is precisely what happen you will recalve that barakobama is reelected in twenty twelve is anograte in twenty thirteen and in twenty fourteen russia invaded crimia and the donbas in youcrane and took it anbrakobaman ted basically nothing and you will remember that twenty fifteen barakobama drew a red line in syria and then promptly backed off the red line and handed syria as essentially a protector it of russia worked out beautifully for every one brakobama wins re election russia gets exactly what it wants well the same thing is now happening with ron cording to politico intelligence officials have calculated the tahanon does not have full control over its proxy groups in th mad eleast including thoses responsible for attacking and killing you us troops in recent weeks according to two ou us officials familiar with th matter lets just get the straigt we know that aron is giving the weaponry and the advisory counsil and members of the of the iarg c are working hand in glov with his balla cammas various groups the the coods force in erach and syria the hoothis an yeman the aronians are cordinating wth all of them the ronias are giving them the weaponry the arnians ware giving them the runny but the intelligence officials oure trying to create the tranctunnel a way out wof this terrible bind that bidn is put himself in where his appeasemen orring int that middleastern policy has im bold in the aronians to push on every single front jobiton does an action want to take harsh action against the aronians that ould shut them up because he is afraid that then that will madbe spin into something broader or he is afraid mostly that his own basing tn commandat him e realys in of he is not jobin is not afraid of a full skale worth ronk the ron is not going to go to fullskale war with he united states unless they wish to live under ground and i mean by that not live underground be dad they do not want that war ellget to more on this injust one

dot con what jobidon really is seekin to o what is blow back from is own party from the radicals in his own party jobidon is afraid of losing michigan it is that simple he is afraid of losing michigan that a lot o muslin voters an michigan muslen voters an michigan are very unified in their hatred frasro by pollingdata muslims in michigan ore very much in favor of an appeasemen orient by polling data an a peasman orientod policy toward states a ron in th mdleast and therefore jobidon is trying to find away to a pease now he is basically weaponizing his intell officials to say that aron is not responsible for things that aron is clearly responsible for basically jobidon's white house is now a par agency for a ron again that is not any sortof shock brockobom did the same thing after he signd the aron neucleer deal then it became incumbint on the united states to pretend that tat was actually a good deal and the obomad ministration started to make noise vat how ron was now moderate oron was now good eveness they pursued spreading terror all over the region o now jobidon is in the same bine well eron spreads terr over the region well oron is shutting down shipping in the redsea well oron is in sentivizing who the attacks onchipping and hesbelaw attacks on the north of isrol and commoss rock at attacks attacks on american troops in jordan well eron is doing all of that jobidons in tell ificials r lat oron modo they e anythy irelo maybe ronos in have anything to do maybe it is all a bit goin keting who knows yet probably ther not in control that is a way for jobidon to escape having to take the harsh action that would be necessary to protect american lives if youdo not want fort operating basis for american troups in jordn make the case but ifre gn to leave them there and then american soldiers die you do not get to claim that the power behind the killing was not actually the power behind the killing as a way of cowarding out which is what jobidon is doing right now according to politico the cood's force an yu lea branch of the iarch s is responsible for sending weapons in military advisers as well as intelligence to support milicious in arockon syria as well as the whothies in yemmin the groups have varying ambicions and a chendas which sometimes overlap but teeron is not appear tohave complete authority or for their operational decicion making well the disclosure means it might be particularly hard to predicts what actions the groups will take it could lower the chances of the uus getting pulls into a direct confrontation with oron now again this is their way of escapeto wore juskonpretend the thething is nint happening riggner prton that aron is it responsible for all of this as to avoid escallacion with aron because jobidon does not want to alienate muslin voters in michigan again that is what he is doing howd we know tit iswht he is doing becase that is what to day is all about he is visiting michigan to day he e visited michigan on thursday he met with members of the u a dble you tot michigan democrats have press to biden for months to spend more time campagning in their state according to the washington post but affis chals hav been worried about his visit being overchatowedr interrupted by demonstrators bidon went to michigan he went to michigan am out wt hou a u he did not mee with arab american voters but do not worry he is in to be sending his surrigates to say the quiet part out loud according korren john pier the white hose press secretary sheetstolds reporters on thursday senior bidan officials will travel to michigan this month quote to here directly from community leaders on a range of icsues that are important to them and their families including the conflict of israel and gasa last week july shaves at rodriga as bidins campaign manager travel tommichigan or sho plan to meet with arab american elected officials and community leaders some refuse to meet with her again bidon is trying to reach out specifically to michigan democrats because he is worried that he is going to loose michigan and then lose the election intireartical in political about this a quote presiden jobidon's attempt who block down many of t e young climate minded voters who supported him in the last election is running a ground over the war between israel and comas bidon promised o be the climate president when he won the whitehouse four years ago but that message is in danger o being drouned out has many of those youthful enviromentalists voics their frustration with bidins refusal to demands in imediate sease fire and gaza s again this all comes it you would say is a normal person watchin poltics i'll ka who cars young people do not turn out to vorl the much anyway i just rea direct your campaign energy toward more fertile grounds but the answeris jobidon cant he is toun popular and he now has to cator to all the crazies that is the reason why he has been sangtings iunders hinderstaner pausion wayer shouting out is matixlogan to mhigat it are you i dounte goi rgonan that is why he is doing that not only that he and his team hav been fairly overtly reaching out to verius groups in michigan tetter connected directly with prokomas forces according to the washington free beakan chuck ros reporting the bidin campaign and a bin to shore up the presidents waning support amongt araban musle voters dispatch campaign manager july shovizrdrigas last week to mee with an arab american activist as praise camas and refers to the president as quot geniside joe rodrigas met friday with arab american

outreach comes as subloni and other actives have called to boicot the bidin airis ticket over the administration's opposition to a sease fire in the commaswar sublony told the ap his meetig with rodriga's went very well and not a big shockright there because again jobidon is trying now to cater specifically to this radical voting base which bi by catering to the radical voting base by what you are making conflict and deathin the idly significantly wore likely if you shape american forn policy bases on the needs of radical moslem voters in michigan who do not you because you will not stop isral from defending its th that is likely make for some retty bad policy one of those bad policies will discuss in just one second first it is ground hogday the ground hog might be surprised by

more than scientists pretick the climate at least you can trust jeremy's razors to deliver a grachave every single time ocame meanwhile already whell as we have been talking about jobidons poalcy a cross them at least absolute garbage it is what is facilitated all of this from october seventh and beyond well now in an attempt to demonstrate that he is a both sides kind of guy his unleishe an executive order that is supposedly targening violent settler extremus aso let us be clear if you commit a criminal act against palistinians in the west banks ay you beat up a palistinian in the westbank you will be arrested by the israiling military ta is under his railly military governments if you burn down places in the west bank and your jew you will be arrested by the israily military governments there is in fact a legal structure for you in that particular area but what the by dministration has been trying to do ever since october seventh is tried to establish a false moral equivalents between is raly settlers meaning people who live east of the called green line in judaa and somaria the historic hartland of what used to be the kingdom of israel and he're trying to establish a basic equivalence between those people and terrorists in the west bank and terris in the gosesstrip many of the titis statistic the yor seeing about supposed settler violencs are falsifieder not true not only that what the by dministration is doing right here is making sure in th executive order that there is a very fuzzy line between actual criminal activity which every one should oppose and is raily state policy which includes allowing people to for example build inditional bathroom in a frot a now the bide dministration has not taken a formal position on what exactly israel should legally be allowed to build on in areas that israel currently has military presents in there is never been any sort of a greement between israel and the palistinians on which parts of the territory injuda and somaria are supposed to be left for a palistinian say tha has never been finalize who is separated under the oslo cords into areas a b n c area's a were given over to the paliconian authoriy to govern that bealike gunene nobloos many of the big arab cities aria bee was supposed to be mixed security control an area se was supposed to be sort of four further discussion but large up parts of of area s because they ere four for their discussion thave been areas of major juur setlement about six hundered thousand jews who live injudaa and somaria ol jobidon is attempting to now effectively suggest to moral equivalente between settlers rit large and terrorists that is what he is doing with this executive order d he is opening the dor to he most radical members of his coalition to a sentually set up a boy cot of israel over disputed territories and these are disputed territories historically speaking many centers of jewish settlement have been in these areas prior to the existence of the state of israel intire gushut'szhe own region for example would be a good example an the is obliterated during me forty eight war by the aerab armies and then post sixty seven again lalos area s been built back up by jouish areas in any case bidang sign and executive order on thursday declaring a national emergency notur whites on national emergency exactly allowing him to implement new measures to combat settler violence including sanctions can currently announced against fourt is rally extremests who carried out actsof vilands in the west bank is according to the times of israel bidand set in the order the situation in the west bank in particular high levels of extremest settler violence force displacemen of people on villages and property destruction has reached intolerable levels and constuty seriou threat to piece security in stabilities sobaselys as jobidan saying th when terras o thack jews it is becauses there is some crazy settlers n where time lingate small number people who commit crimes and the are then arrested and go to his raily graiel that that that is what he is saing again it is important to notier that an extraordinary hupl o violence exists against settlers in this area by palistinians a huge number of killings ife happened vr the past three years in these areas people driving on highways and palistinian arab terris just shooting them just murdering them that sort ofthing happens unfortunately fairly regularly in fact there are signs off the highway if you go to you d ansomary theire signs off the highway big red signs and the say if you are a jew or if you holding his rally passport and you drive into these areas we cannot protect you you may be killed if your palistinian and you drive to the junction in gushettsyon your fine you go for a copic offee if you are jew an you essential eu make a mistake and you drive into the wrong areas the west banker dad it is just that simple a but that of course not the view of jobiden who again brings everything back to the centrality of his raily policy this is one of the great lies that you see on both the far left an on the far right when it comes to foreign policy for any western state and that is no one has agency except for the western state it is stupid no one has their own interest nobody has their own priorities it is all just reaction to western activity when there is a terrist attack against jews on the border of gaza which again is not he west bank when that happens ut crolley because israel ded something in the same way that everything when it comes to the united states for both the far left and the far right isolationis is blowback everything is blowback all the time or alternatively palistinians seventy five per cent palistinians in the westbank believe it israel should be obliterated eighty percent to prove the october seventh attack itso what jobidon is doing here again is the predicase to possibility of much larger action against his raliability to live in historic jewish land and that is in fact historictuish land trying to protend that areas mentioned in the bible are some how historic palistnian land is very very weird in any case the the sort of message here is pretty clear is really officials had already told the times of israel last month that security estlone had taken a number of steps to clamp down on the phenomena of an individual setlers comitting violence one of the things the ev also seen is the israilin army will clear what is effectively a a tent village and then that will be declared settler violence the ten village does not have legal right to be there and much of this could be dispelled by simply one drive on route sixty through israel but nobody bothers to do that if ter in the mediusy literally do not know what the hll you are talking about but that is effectively what is happening right here judg jobidn tthis all a a ploy to win to winvots tin michigan that is all this is and that again is because jobiden is inseriously weak position now jobidon is hoping that he is going to be able to recover and that that is going to come on the back of new economic reports the latest economic reports are now out and tom thereis a jobs blow out in january which is good obviously god for the country non farm parl's expended by three hundred and fifty three thousand for the month that is about double what the dow jone's estimate withs going to be the unemployment rate remains that three pointe heven percent which is near historiclothes job growth was widespread in january let by professional in business services with seventy fourthous and gen that is based on perception of inflation basically being curbed at this point according to jeorge matao chief vestmen officer keep private banks has make no mistake itwas o blow out chobsuport it will vindicate the recent postering by the fed which effectively ruled out and interest rate cut in march moreover strong jobgans combine with faster than expected wage ganes maye suggest an additional delay in rate cuts for twenty twenty four if the economy holds up then presumably the federal reserve is not going to rush to cut rads which might reinvigorate inflation the question for the fed is going to be when do they start cutting rates again t' a lot of the a lot of the speculation has been tha the cn to cot rates directly before the election than attempt to jog the economy to boostbidons reelect they are going to do that obviously if job growth continues to move at this pace then they are not going to have to do any of that and i am still sceptical of of the state of the american economy i still think that there is another shoe that is gen to have to drop here ay you might just argue that basically prices and wages have now readjusted to the new normal that inflation meant threis more money in theconomy the the inflation boosted the prices but people were still spending ins that boosts the wage growth eventually and eventually reaches a new equilibrium eu can make that case presumably there is still massive sustain unsustainable that packages tat n gn to come do for te united states says i've said before i've ben sing the saction for several years i do not actually think to what you are going to seein the united states a deep long lasting depression i think wat you are going to see is a long lasting economic stagnation into the future as we sort of reach that new normal of wage is and prices instead the regulattory im pacts of what jo bidon has ben doing in a wive riedy of industries is going to come home and wht you are going to see is lower growth rates basically oboma level growth rates probably for for the for seable future meanwhile the federal government continues just spend money out the wa zo there is a by partisin bill the got past over the course of last week that most people are ignoring it is just another seventy eight billion dollars who gairs thrown money out there why the hell mot tgood piece by kimberly trastle over the walstrgernal talking about it is proving the gan that congress is in capable of anything beyond redistributing other people's money three hundred fifty seven representatives passed another seventy eight billion dollars spending bill do not go looking for a former spending disciplin or any of the usual guop cachwords in this blob the beatinghard of wednesday's package is too long time democratic priorities tincreasing the size of the child tax credit and it is availability to parent who do not even pay income tax abasically this would be a redistribution of wealth to a largely single moms whuld kind of be the idea democrat's bilt this trojan horse in nineteen ninety seven when bill clinton one a five hundred dollar child tax credit the're go since then has been to increase its side n expand to eligibility many ot the basis for a future universal basic income hrepublicans wen from understanding the perfity of government hand outs toping that catchabit of credit fore said income redistribution that is the basic idea here and again that is not totally wrong in the fact is that the child tax credit if you send money to people people have more money on the other hand if you disin sents ofie work you are not acually allowing people to rise from poverty because it y actually require to rise from poverty in a permanent way is not the pendency on government while you actually require is a in income trojectory therebeen a bunch ofstudies abou the child tax credit many of them conflict with one another there is one estimate from the university of chicago reported by the cato institute that takes behavioural affection to account meaning people dropping out of the work force because the child tax credit is vailable or working fewer hours or whatever what they found is that a larger child tax credit without income requirements would lead one point five million workers to stop working eighty three percent of those whould be the sole erner in the household which again those to be single moms then that effect of expanding the c t c would re duse over all chil poverty by twenty two per cent and would not reduce deep poverty fifty per cent of the poverty lind that is sam study estimated that any re ductions in poverty from a larger child tax credit targeted tof families without market income would come at effysical cost almost double that of other stamps food stamps s again on ofthose things that looks good on paper but is not particularly useful in practice and meanwhile the democrats move to the left is on every issue they ife te paner to the outs and the outes apparently are very hot on the tran stuff which is the only possible reason why you woul see the democratic craty resonating to what is the stupidist idea in human history that men and women are not separate categories of human beings are not actual biological distinctions sort of a made up thing in your own mind we have seen a spate in last twenty four hours of various authority figures preaching why children should be trans for example here is a californ a general specualist name johanna olson kennedy talking to an eleven your old untame an saying you are in the perfect place for pubrity blockers yes that is right we neds a puberty block a leven yearls en this just this is mangle a typ exparimentation on children it really is doctor rolson had a decision you are in the perfect place to start on blockers and she promises to begin giving her astrogen the male formones in two years around thirteen that is what i think yes you are not going at at all breastbuds on the blockers but om you are notkin await until sixteen to start that ol a josie received the blockers as in implant in her arm with all the bravery she could muster coul feel littler josie held on timge bravery o i sate o another chapter openin this young girls lis tisin young oy this young boy being monchouse an sindrom by proceed by madam just just terrible stuff jos terrible stuff in the fact thatwe are treating tissus heroism by the parents some the kids fault the parents in the doctor just just vile meanwhile if teachers e're going ito the classroman explaing that they themselves do not know whether they are a girl or boy what seems to be a pre requisite if you actually teaching a child should be to know whether your boyor girl since literally all my children can do it excluding the eight month old we cannot speak yet but definitely knows that he is a boy very umy godness these people i have a small dilemma o i am starting anew job i maday and it is a teaching job the kids t at are going to call me either mister or missus jamy independs on what i want but i as it on by nabeing i do not know

mental helth help from a from pres hopefully a non wolk professional inj e really they ad stuff meanwhile have a doctor name just ic co cisses in she will die on the hill that kins shoul have aces to irreversible pury blockers and sexchanged surgeries over on tiktok which is fostering the sort of stuff as a chinese siop doctor and apparently the sate a taces needs to be considerd what it considers child abuse os it is abusive ignoring the needs of your child when your child is telling you what they meed and engaging in behavior as a paret that could lead them to unalive themselves over eighty per cent of trans on o kime an homselves having thoughts about unliving themselves and over fifty per cent have actually attempted it in these individuals denying them care that we know is seeting is

coming she is very fond of charging re cocases she is now going to charge donal trump and eighteen alleged co conspirators in a giant reco cse according to the associated press donal trumpet eighteen allies were indicted in georgion monday over their efforts to overturn his twenty twenty election lost in the state with prosecutors using a staton normally associated with mobsters to accuse the form president lawyers another age of a criminal enterprise to keep him in power ise nearly one hundred page and nivemenites ninety eight pages in details dozens of the ax by trumbors allies to undo his defeat including beseeching george's republican secretary state to find enough votes for him to win the battle ground state harassing an election worker who faced false claims of fraud and attempting to persuade georgia lawmakers to agnor the willof voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electours favorable to donal trump in one particularly brace an episode ed also in outlines o plot involving one of donals from's lawyers in accessing voting machines in rural george county to steal data from the voting machine company's supposedly although of course the question there is whether they were looking for evidence of the possibility that the voting machines had been hacke or something fulan county district attorney fanny willis announced the charges last night to day mated on information developet by that investigation a flton county grangury return a tru bial of invictment charging nineteen individuals with violations of george alo a rithing from a criminal conspiracy to overcurn the result of the twenty twentieth presidential election invistate tthe inditement in clute forty one felany count an is ninety seven pages long every indivintial charge in the indctment is charge with on count of violating georges racketeer in fluenth in corrupt organate vtion act fru prarticipation in a criminal intialprize in fulton county georgion and elsewhere to accomplish the ilegal goal of alowing donald ga trump to fieth the presidential charm of offith beginning on january twentieth twenty one yesterday was complete mass at the georgia court house apparently there was a brief but mis serious incident in which the county websight put up a list of criminal charge to be brought against before a president was were taken down pretty quickly and then of course something very very similar went up very lye last night trumps legal team says the events that have unfolded to day haveben shocking and absurd starting with a leak of the presumed and premature indictment before the witnessis had even testified or the granjurers had deliberated and anyng with the da being unable toalfer any explanation the indictmen which is ninety eight pages long which cen of smacs of you in forth grate attempting to writ a very long five paragraph assay in the hope the teacher would give you ana even though the esser was not very good that sort of how the indictment reads its very long it is very detaile and it sort of goes over a lot of territory tht is already been trod the accuse trump and his alleged co conspirators of a hundred and sixty one act many of these acts are things has simple as retweating things s f yeu look at the actual indictment it actually says that for example it accuses act twenty eight honor about the third day of december twenty twenty donal john trump met with the speaker of the pensylvania house of representatives in the oval office in discussed holding a special sentsession of the pennsylvania general assembly this was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy meetings are apparently now illegalbit it he calld bryang camp he retreated something from oayan en ththeir people who are suggesting that those sorts of acts are now ilegal that that is not really how this work to understand how these charges work you first have to understand what reco is the raceter influence in corrupt organizations act how that actually works is very controversial law thos passed in nineteen seventy originally was aimed at tem offia and again the thebasic pradicet for the law is that it is very difficult to charge people who are upper level gangsters with the crimes of their subordinates this is why reco was passed originally you would have a low level hitman and he get charged with murder and then he refused to rat on his bass and there is no way to actualy try the bossins what they did is they started rapping together the entire criminal organization and in efforts get the low level hitman to flip on his superior and to get thatkite o flip on the boss that was the basic idea if you indit everybody all together it is easier to flip all of the associates by threatening them with the highest level charges that sort of the goal riat you charged the accountant with murder and therefore the account because t e the accountin is now rapped in the giant conspiracy theaccount does not want go to jail for murder the accountin does one good jo at all into the account on flips on boss that' what raccket hering originally was it comes from the trom racket which ment an organized the illegal activity all thit requires the the violation of reco at least on the federal level in the georgea reco statute which is one this being chargion it does make a large scole difference by way thisis a state case in not a federal case because whon it means that even if donal trump were elected pressen he could not pardon himself of any charge for which whos sound guilty in the state of georgia he could not free himself from that by the way any accusation that the georgea governor whose republican bryang camp the bryn coumnp could pardon donal trumpfor this is not correct the is a panel in georgia that ould actually have to sit and decide weather or not ho res pardon he elso does not have the power to semarily dismiss dias in the state of georgia braan coump sto all of the jabber it it is amazing th everytime donal trumkets in trouble there is always a lot of talk about how othe republic ins haw av or h responsibility to rescue him and very often that responsibility does not that is not even within their power i mean this goes all the way back to january six thats elf when donal trumpet suggested openly that might pence hade the ability to simply toss out electoral college vote that had been state certifideready he did not is not the responsibility of any of these other people to bale donald trump out when they do not have the legal power to do they the legal power to do lease you can make the argument but bran camp does neven have that legal power in anyway anyways when it comes to the state rego act which is very very similar to the federal regal act the way that racateuring basically works is raceteering is broadly to fime as requiring at least a couple of the acts of racceteering activity committed within ten years of each other and it also requires that there be a criminal conspiracy in furtherance of a crime criminal conspiracy an furtherance of a crime la gan what that means is that let say you and i we decide that were gn conspire to go to the walmark together not a crime because that is conspiracy without actual furtherance of a crime he unite as hi regn ta rob a bank together that means that if we go to lalmart to buy a shot gume onle buy the shot gun at the logal walmart or something normally tat woudn be illegal a it becomes a legal because you and i are ow planning to use that shot gun in the robbing of the bank many of the acts that trump and his associates are being accused out our acts cornc in furtherance of the crime the real question in this case is not whether donal trump did all the thingse that the incictement elleges most of tht is undisputed the real question in this case is wether it was in furtherance of a criminal activity another words is it a criminal activity for donal trump to pursue a bunch of legal means to forstall his election loss is that stuffy legal now if you'ad gottentogether muncher's friends and he said let us actually overthrow the federal governmene tiuu lok illegal but then jacksmith would be charging that of the federal level right he be charging him with actual insurrection which he did not he woud also be charging him with inciement of ariet which he did not when it comes to georgia the accusation is the donal trump essentially one to overturn the results of the georgia election through illegal means and who ise pressuring people to do it through illegal means and is it pretty serious charge again i think that it is doubtful that this coul be proved in corporates also happening an elanta just the washington be see case this means that you have a logal jury that is not going to be fremly to presedent trump now as i say i think in to doubtful charge because for example some the things that are being charged here and some the peopal being charge are some of the quonncot false electors riht these are people who signed in a a a document saying that they were the duly elected electors of the state of georgia when they were not but there is a problem a doubt which is that ifweu go all theway back to nineteen sixty for example hoy democrats actually did the same thing howy you believ oure ot was a very sort of razers edge state between publicans and democrats in the nineteen sixty election democrats created and alternative slate of electors who signed a document claiming that they were actually the alternative slateiv electors that was not illegal at the time if you sign on to a document saying i'm a member of the duly elected slate of electors and then the state rejects that is that illegal if you take bad legal advice t is that illegal because it turns out then many of the people who are now being indicted ar donal trump's lawyers and the idea here is the donnal trum would have to show it woud have to be shown the donal trump knew for a fact that he lost the georgia election then he then pursud a bunch of means in order to overturn that elections you come back to the same thing tht you have n the dracksinthe federal case which has what did donal trum know and when did he know it do you think that he actively believe that he won the georgia election and ho is pursuing a bunch of legal strategies in order to assure that win or dit he know that he lost and he did not care and because he knew he lost whos attempting to overthrow the election and that is going to be the open question now donal trump his done himself no favors along these lines and let us be clear about this donal trum actively reach we didn'nt article after david purdue who lost in a senate race in twenty twenty one largely cosdonal trump told ouv by not tovoat in twenty twenty one then run off after he lost donal trump trid to prop him up to run agains sprang com for governor because bran camp did not go along with donal trumps georgia shenan agains david pret ou got is askec by lic fifty points in the primary against bryin cam and donal trump then proceeded to twee out an article suggesting that david prudue had lost becaus o votor fraud it again the case that fanny willis and company are going to make just to be totally legally fair here the case there going to a temp to makes the donal trump dus an actually care at all whether he wins or loses an election heis going to claim that he won and then he is going to attempt to overthrow the ilegitimate results of the election but donal trump also could legitimately believe that he won the georgia election even if that is not true and by the way iit is not true the secretary of state of georga has actually attempted to pry out information from true the boat which is the organization behind two thousand mules and tom th truthvot has refuse to turn over the in formation they stay supports the idea of widespread votor fraud in the state of georgi ab that does not matter the real question is intent is it a crimnal act to listen's bad legal advice is it a criminal act to call up the georgia' secretary state ans av want you to find me eleven thous and ight hundred seveny boats is that a thing that is criminal or 's that just you beng an idiot wright you being an idiot not a crime a conspiracy to be an idiot also not a crime well get to more on this in just one second first i wan't talk to about dailywares most

slashman to learn more two things can be tro once onethis can be a fairly serious charge the donal trump is facing down particularly in an unfriendly juristiction at can also be true that donal trump is being targeed by fanny willis in highly political fashion it is the exact same thing as jacksmith going after him in washington d c although i will say that the george case jostsbased on statute is stronger then the washington d c case the washington d c case has a bunch of twisting and turning to try to fit what donal trump did into a bunch of statutes tot do not quite fit this one you can alleas make the argument legally speaking thet donaltrump fits within the perview of the statutes in a way that that he does not in sort of the dc case but with all that' said why is it that four cases have now come down in five months leading up to the election why that that is a little but suspicious i yet you ave four major criminal cases that hae come down and last five mence against the leading republican contendor for the presidency belts an awful lotlic election interference just to any outside observer obviously as i say this this particular case is extremely broad fanny willis as now given donal trump a deadline to turn himself in and people at the court has mean tol political this is people at the courthouse ardy sanus ginto a mug shot which will easily be the most traffic photo in human history you can imagine the tonal trumple smile for the photo because when you smile for your mog shot you lat cool and donal trum knows that here is a here is fannuwellis explaining the deadline y in giving me the fintift the opportunity two bolly tatleast to winder yoll later then non on fiday the twenty fift day of august twenty twenty three yay donaltrumps going to have to turn himself in probably next week it is worth while noting here that donal trum is going to have one dofence which is the grand jury was essentially preset bat the bias in the grand jury was essentially preset you will recall tht there was a crazy lady who is the four person of the grand jury in this particular case fer name was emily cors and a sho was the wich i believe who then went on a national mediate toure talking about the grand jry workings and was extremely weird donal trump's legal team is going to have something to hang their hat on here here is a here is a flashback of emily cors the grand jury four person who again is a weirdo personally a ren eg off o a jury duty man it is the place where twelve people too dum to get out a jury duty get the deside your fate i yet donal trumps team is ging to have something to say about all of that as well ill get to more on this in just one second first everything is crazy right now and you need to be able to just calm down and take but the way that i do that is three times o day ey according to jewish ricual i have to pray but if you are not northodox yo and you r looking for time in your day to try to you do not comune

months free at hallodot comslash or puro thats hallo dot com slash chippiro o case as i say this criminal indictment here the people are named trump rudijuliani john eastman who is lawyer mark meadows who is the chief of staff john hisbro who is a one of his lawyers as well jeffrey clark who is a member of the d o ja jena alis one of his lawyers and then there a bunch of more local officials including a bunch people who signed on to the alternative alector scheme cake nop how is this gun tof play out is very likely that he faces apparently he faces thirteen charges and up to seventy one years in jail an he heis now facing we are talking thirteen charges there he sacing i believe fourteen charges in washington you see he is facing a bebby of charges in the classfi doccument's case are not trump is in serious juppard of going jail n as we say because this is a state case he cannot pardon himself the argument that donal trump must be elected precedents that he can escape jail which is an argument i'm seeing made right now i do not see how that works i do not see exactly how that argument is even operative in turms of which of these cases poses the largest scale legal threat to donal trump this is the case that obviously poses the larger scal legal thrats donal trump the reason being it is broad it is all incompassing at allows fanny willis to tell this over arking story linking together his activities in pennsylvania and his activities in washington he see and his activities in georgia in this broad base conspiracy in which she can connect to all of these dots but smart o her to charge under the reko act to to be simple about the cit is not a stupid charge for her to do this don you say that it is corrupt yo can say that it is politialy modivate i thn there some truth to that it also happens to be the case that just from a legal perspective what she is doing here is not unintelligent what she is doing here is a weapon desin to take down trump no cau and note no question trump calls her an out of control in very corrupt district attorney he declares the charges are part of a whitch hunt the case again is the fourth targaning trump just this year alone the the this case probably will run all the way through the election because it is very large scoll now she has says and this this part this partys crazy she says shuunts to try all of the defendence at once li put them all in a room together and try them at once sortr that scene where harvey dent tries everybody all together in the dark night that youremember that seeme he brings in all of the corrup mob stars and put theme all in her room together and all their lawyers are protesting and all o the rest of thus and he does not throw scare into them bast part of it an what regoes designe to do as i suggested earlier is to get the account to flip on he hitman who flips on the headman my part of this is going to be an attempt to get people who are a round trump to flip on trump to avoid criminal charges when is this extrican tn take place that is still up in the air willis did not say whether she is spoken with special proscutor jacksmith at this ploint which probably means that she has she said she does not care whether this goes first or last which means that it will go all the way through the election without it out trump wrote on truth sosial the which un continues nineteen people indichted to night includig the form president of the united states me by an out of e controll and very corrupt district attorney who campaign and raised money on i will get trump and what about those indictment documents put out to day long before the grand jury even boted and then quickly withdrawn sounds rig to me why did not they indite two point five years ago becausethey want to do right in the mddle of my political campaign which hunt and again that may very well be the case that does not mean he is not in legal danger two things can be true at once as always as always he can be inlegal danger it can be a witch hunt it can be an attempt to take him out in the election the real question for a publicans is whether they are going to go long with the bate here n the obvious bate is nominate trump said he can take his revenge as hi said before i do not see how that worked even legally speaking if he goes to jail in georgia he will still be in jail in georgia as president of the united states there is the civil suit thatas filed against donal against bill clinton when he as president of theunited states by polojones at went forward it is why the monical linsky scandal happen we have never had a case where a state criminal trarge as filed against the sitting president of the united states before he became president of the united states ow do you knowhw tat would work i'm not ure anybody knows how that would work what say that you get hit with a murder charge and you run for the presidency trum jail are you automatically freed from jail on themurder charge wy get let say the ted cennedy na she got an hit with a murder charge or at least a manslaughter charges he should haveben in the kismaryjo capacna in massachusetts and then he cwontinue to serve in the united state senate presumably he still to gone to jail i do not now hiny others work can much hure anybody knows how any of this works georgia represents probablythe most serious threat to trumps liberty according to a wide variety of legal analists including any macarthy it is it is highly likely at this point as i say iit is hard to imagine the trump escapes all legal consequence for all of these charges ii am not sure how he escapes whatcs can a happen him in washington see or georgia and wh n we say that it is outrageous it is it also means that the glass is now been broken what we are about to see next is what truly what were about to see next is republican to as all over the country star to indite people jobidon four things racket teering and corruption as rices president of the united states once the glass has ben broken it cannot be unbroken the glass is now been broken the predictable result of this is not the donal from canselected president the predictable result of this is that lawfar now be comes the way the political opponents go after each other on the regular in the united states and that is going to be a really really dangerous thing remember donaltrum who ise con sider wildly out ofth bound o propriety when donals from said to hilery clinton that fuselected presiden ent she would be in jail you remember he said the turing in o bate she said well what would you even do if your presden at covater presintent you be in jail and then he did not do anything about int and a lot of people myself included thought well that is probably good we afture do not want people persecuting their political opponents when that would clearly have democrats all over the country from manhatton tou now georgia to washington tu see to florida going after thei're political opponents that is not a bell that can be unwrung get ready for republicans to do the exact same thing as soon as they have the power and the grounds to do that iswhre we standis countryes the things are about to get worse not better all those people on the left who thing that this sort of dit this is restoring rule of law and all the nonsense nonsense all this is going to do is going to achieve a rease to the bottom because again once the law can be used as a weapon directly against your political opponents why exactly which you allow the other side to use that weapon and to avoid culpability for their use of that weapon it is hard to see exactly how this does not and poorly for petty much everybody will get to more on this in one

the co conspirators again the real question hers whether rudi julioni or mark meadows deside to flip on donal trum as the walstr jeurnal points out alod these peopl ll are well known co defendans and the'reall legal advisers now we already know that some of tese people are rudigulyony is highly likely to get convicted in this case the reason t rudy julianiis howly likely to yet convicts in this caseis because he is openly had to apologized to a particular pole worker for suggesting and amplying that she was corruptly bringing in empty ballats to the fulton county vot counting location knowing presumably that she was not in fact doing that one youof people who are caughton false statements it should not be that hard tof flip them sidney pawtlic the question is how strong is theire loyalty going to be donald trump thas had the loyalty of subordinates for very very long time an the class vy documents case for examply as well noto and abut low level aids wor maintaining they are unwillingness tobasiclly flip on him is tht conot hold the sumry sidney powel does is thing sidney pall is somebody who is is going to una stick by her worge here and hold by present en trump hard to see that five of the co ti findins juliany pell johnnesmen kenneth chesbro that jeffrey clark are identifiable though unnamed as cok conspiritors in a separate federal inditmen from jacksmeth some ofthe people whor cn to be called in this case and again it will be telivized some the people who can t be called in this case will include i assume the current secretary of stapebrad raffins burger in georgirum bryan kemp because he was called by donal trump could actually the called to testify in this particular case it will be televise it will be a spectacle and it will be an electoral disaster for republicans if this thing ons al the with raylry election i knowther a lotter republicanswhere n love ith the idea that thes in a backfire on democrats tn that the attempt do plnncl get trump is going to lead to a revenge play by trump that ends with the republican in the white house i've love to see the poll day to supporting that i've get to see one ioda of data supporting that there is a lot of there is a lotidated suggest that the ttargonin of trump has holped him the primaries i've get to see one piece it one a single piece of data suggesting that the american people ar can a react to all of this lawfar against trump bie voting for trump i've got tere's not one poll showing it seriously not one even the most trump friendly poles do not jow that what they show is than majority of the american public believes trump should be indited on something which is a very bad indicator they i think the're wrong but it does not matter what i think tie matters whit the american public thinks caus there one tor can be boting also is trump likely to wind georgia in the twenty twenty four election if the entire case in georgia is about how he was basialy pressuring people interchanging votes or in to finding vots whatever t is isthat going to help his case in the state of georgia remember bryan kemp one his reelect running away from stacy aprans in the state of georgia meanwhile the more trump friendly candiths hersial walker lost david perdu lost do you think georgians are really fond of thie sort of stuff i have doubt if thown trump loses george all the rest of the states onyn matter and by the way that gor tha the airizon a republican party continues to keep doubling down on the sort ofstuf you think that isconto help them an certainlinn help them in twenty twenty two habet wisgonson pennsylvanian michigan is any of this going to help i say this because again whatever sympathy i have for president tfrom being targan i have sympathy for presiden and trum being targeted for shore the question for me as a conservative who stops biden who stops the bad policy that fects me and my family and you who stops all of those bad policies yet you enough sympathy for somebody while still recognizing that the thing that shapes your life as an american is who is the president of the united states and yes it shapes your life that the d o j is going aftor political opponents cause those political opponents could be but the only way to stop that is tower the only way to stop that is to put some oe in the whitehouse wo connactually clean out the d o j if dion trump cannot make it it does kno one any favors to run him this a really serious question this going to linger over the entire election cycle right now the court dates are spread out all over twenty twenty four we already know that the classfie documents case is likely to begin some time in may right right in the middle of the election cyche lay just before the conmentions this case is likely to begin yououldamagion i'll gust september right before the election there is every possibility that the jack smith inditement and s is in a start even before the primaries this thing is in a lurk over the entirety of the election nay have all f these other people whas i say could flip in cluding people raise stallings smith hos in the landtat area lawyer who filed and unsuccessful lasty challenging bidons george victory hous subject he was the subject of a complaint from a legal lat strog group to the stape ar seeking disciplinary messures where robert chiley who is been it with ten counts is a personal injury lawyer he presents a george state sentetrs with vidio clips you claim shot election workers at a downtown atlants o precingt double and triple counting boats and turns out at that was not actually the case and i's the question is whether he knew that or not do yo think these low level officials want to go to jail for years on end fordonal trump do you thing that is ae thing at they want to do and this is why what fanny willis is doing yo youcorrupt as it may be bad as it may be for the country it is smart legally beis the chances of flipping somebody are pretty significant it is it is this is this this is goin to be wild ah and and by while that mean really really herrific for the country run pretty much every single level o cane just a second we will get to jo bidon he is supposed to be captains sympathy and yet he remains a person whois oddly unsympathetic to everybody who does not have a last name at bidon will get to that momentarily first let us talk

importantly fifty four per cent of american said that jobid and cared about people them as uppost only forty five percent who said the donal trump cared about people then will this has always been the lie about jobine he is not onest an trustworthy is not particular likable and he does not care about any one outside of his immediate circle this is why everybody who is a member of the biding family is rich if you re inside the circle he makes you rich if you are outside the circle he does not care about you tand youas put this on display a multiplicity of times from afgannistand to most recently this lahinote fire that killed at least a hundred people according to bloomburg this malli fire is the deadliest fire in the united states in a hundred and five years ninety three people at least have been killed we sold hundreds of people missing the number of fatalities expected to clam further as authorities continue serch and rescue efforts according to the whi governor josh green only three per cents of the area has been searched there still bring in twelve more cadaverdogs to help with the efforts that thath told is definitely going to go up what is jobidan doing during all of this now remember we have a history in the united states of holding the presedents of the unitedstates or even senators from a given state accountable for natural disasters where they are not really hand omic right in themiddle of it just in fall you will recall of course when jeorge stoby bush was perceived as disconnected from the victims of hurricane catrina here for examples montasha media coverage talking that the evils of george ste bush when it came to his supposed the reliction of dutiy during hrricane cuatrina this was a cort from an eratorial a tatterlador what a on pit o the disasters own and annouce the immediate moble o vation of every available retors te cool confident intuitive leader p workexideded in is for term particularly in the month following line eleven hav vanished the new your times a a not on a pectorly ine a time did a tat the paston an felt up a day later than he was needed and the exploriated him ora pearing tactual to the point of terrles fus hi word coming frompen a former disaster a ponsty aric tolber wo tat the government was lot ready and sjept ted a te tantan pom nactual ti aster te piting the war on terror well george w bush to a terrible leaders to jop during that crisis he kind of acted liken othing was happening wrong for the first days he had been in sandiago were e played air catar and then he did the famous fly over being very detached from the devastage ion and that that photograph that damage tis presdence the immensely of him duspeering down at the abess but hit lso seen at all course mon tis refer to present though he was a at was of e was flying ove that fore wan not landing i was peculiar was not at was we stool bato nog eleven we seive to as to he bush with h bullhole in the dressing the fifits as this was a man who who gult the crises when it comes to the public relations hand he lost the touch when it came to catrine o what happened i think it was a a gan a break down at a level in in that paticular case a the the pilots runs tract not to come in it would ave ben more but noblication to bring their wain in i then to land i think it right rospect it wouldhave been better just to be your had to get that tin on the ground there tin heep it hav ben the commander ingeed you remember all this heu remember when tad cruws was in cancoon for vacation and a freeze his taxas and supposedly the senator from texas had to be on sight suffering through the frees despite the fact that really the was a state level issue a again hurricane catrina was a state level issue it was the governor's issued really it was the mayor's issue when i cane to new orleans and when it came to what was going on in texas that really had very little to do with the senator who has very little power over any of that but this is the standard to which we hold our presidents of the united states it is my baracomama a big plotdeds during hurricane sandy when he showed up it new jersing ot a big old hog from cris cristy remember this ans wy of course sore shall be wish got rids of anat elso what a watho was jobidon responding two crises the answers he just agnores them and again this is not the first tond rember that time he said his gin a visit east palisine ohio rem rtrain blew up and sad much of toxic wastin to the air and his own secretary f transportation peopludy judge did not show up for quite a while in fact downal frump beat him there yo memer how jobidon side he was going tovisit east pausin ohio well it has now been monts and months and months no sign of president trobid youmber that time when we had giant crisis on our southern border we know now becase it continues and jidon still has not made a ser eous visit to the southernbor this in fact is the way that jobite governd he governs it a way that i the were any other president it wuld be treated as the sort of duroliction that it is treted as when it is just not jobidon but as soon as its jobidon ralspose to ignore it and really is quite incredible a couple of hours a he he ispeen a couple of hours on rehoboth beach then he was asked about the rising dethtoln whi this aftery tok a forteen avacation andthen he went back for another fordy vacation to rehuboh beach delaware where e sits on the beach thasically by himself being an old man and hereis a picture of the president of the united states hundreds of feet away from the phatographers sitting there enjoying his wife he was asked about the rising dethtol an howi and he said no comment then he went a bicycling which is really important for the president of the united states to be a bicoly bicycling obviously and tat hewas asked about a potential visit to mally and he said the same thing tha he said about east palistine ohio he said we are looking at it here was it jobinta ah you kn wel no comment we are looking at it and am by catulator now if it is heartless for everybody else why would it not be heartless for jobidon the answer is it is heartless for jobidon in fact jobidon is now planning to travel to lake tohonevada on friday an hes get t spend a week there leaving the following thursday forteen avacation followed by a fortday vacation in elaware followed by a week long vacation in taho yu he would not want to break up his vacation folks you would not you would not want him to worry to much about what is going on in mally this is not a carrying individual thi sigo who cares only about himself this been true his entire political career it is why he is congenrtal liar it is why he says things that are untrue on the regular it is why he lied when he suggested that i drunk driver killed his wife and his daughter in a car crash in the god was not drunk it is why he goes to veteran's houses and then he tells them wounded veteran's houses or gold star parent or gold stars abouses and he tells them that he send bo died in battle in a rock or some such nonsense all jobidn cares about is jobidon he is a mean sunbagon jobidon is not in fact a carring president when he says no comment or when he says we are looking at a visit or when he says again no comment andthe whnhe goes on more vacations who were lsuppas to believe this person who has wells of ampathy e honestly this is entire pitchon twenty twenty he felt your pain that was not a god actors it culdn't do it bo clinton but people wanted to believe tbecaus they believe the donnals from did not feel that pantonnal trump of course being selfish and narsicistic and all the rest supposedly well jobidon is far more selfish and narsicistic then donal trump he just quieter about it this is why he has no problem plea torising and getting thrown out of his own presidential campaign for it mean this was jobidon stick for years and years and years and just romains in an object of enormous astonishment to me that the medio willing to go along with this narrative thet jobidon was a decent elderly fellow who truly cares about people you what is the evidence of any of this by the way i what whe people are truly dishonest with other people on routine basis that is a sign of narsis at means they on't care about you the sitrun personal relationships anistran politics when people lie to you regularly it means they do not respect yo it meansthey do not treat you as a normal human being because if they treated you as they would wish to be treated presumele then on be lie to but yobidonosn't care about hat o cas later yesterday morning jobidon try to walk all of this back he treated out as th resident of why even wore in the loss of life an devistation taking place across their eautiful home we morn with them i've said not only our prayers are with those impacted but every assit we have will be avilable to them here is the latest and the says that

devel belong from housing plan and then guys ther lazor focust on getting aihe to the survivors including critical needs assistance a one time seven hundred dolar payment per household offering relief during an unimaginably difficult time seven hundred dollars per household now far be it from me to suggest that we should just throw bags of cashur people but if the idea here is that you have a federal crisis that necessitates a federal response seven hundred dollars a household thet's theving in a paper two weeks of groceries fear family in jobidens america seven hundred dollars is not going to do it thng oun property devishos donto leheina five points ix billion dollars in property damage don to leheina seven hundred dollars then tm begining to scratch the surface we set a hundred

they can take steps toward to move forn in their recovery this includes translating materials in to the most common language is spoken in the out ol my god mean ther aching on o trans lhay goverment materials into foreign languages wow all the sacrifice o the amazing on the ground nature of all of this heasy he is lounging at the beach and were suppose to believethat he gives two damns about this of course he does not jobiden as always cares only about jobiden which of course is why the hunter biden situation continues it is on going cover up tso hundred bidensteem is now very very angry at prosecutors a very angry the deoje andthev right to be angry the deoje because jobidonstheoje hot ta sweethardeal with hunterbiden whel nowsit turns out that iffend teem is really ticked off at the doje wy but because that that pledio blew up in open cord according to the walster jurnal hundred bidons legaltim said late sunday the justice departmen had decided to renag on the previously agreed upon pleagreement ascilating a dispute that is threatening o become a factor in the twenty twenty four presideential race as present by nseects re election a major part of the bochteel hundred bidns agrement to enroll in diversion progam for gunoffenders should stand o the lawyers argued prosecutors had agree nots pers to a seppered felloony gun possession charge against the youngrbidon as long as he remains at drug free and agrees to never on a fire arm again is het turney s t he intends to abide by the turms of the ageement an expects prosecutors to do the same that is actually not what was in there part of that diversion program for gun offenders pleadseal said that anything tangentially related to the tax chargers would also be taken off the board proscues on friday disclosed the pletolks with the president son had broken down h mericarland then name delaware you us to turning gave wise as a special council which of course as we talked by yesterday is completely insane you are not supposed to take the person who was not a special council and was the investigating person and then make him the special council the minute that he gets called out for the sweetheart tea thare's obviously a cover up design of preventing testimony from that person in front of congress it is pretty aimpressive and meanwhile democrats continued to kick those goldposts into the ocean represent of jern moscots says there is no evidence that any of this links back to jowll is not a fire cry from hunter bide never did anything wrong and jo never knew anythin about thus and jo as never connected in anyway there is no evidence to link anything back to joe was true about al copone with regard to murder they's get him on a tax charge dhores because the is no evidence that jo bidon took money to rectly into his bank count os 't meann benefit from hunter taking tens of millions of dollars in's the biding family bank accounts wild statemen here is represent of jern moscots hanging his hat on a a very very slim hook republicans the moner publicans an house now they cannot thin now tra ri he has the tripo crown im an ni cns ri nows to in o the final for i mean hes mading o fous an on every ntman we thought he was going to get at they nothey cannot tae him for the whole i deas then wn i ma jo bitin jos him ho the hadn o biding ban famly lik tome ow jo biin ol e son is tonys to pranen but there is not a single shred of t evidence that has anything to do with jo biton ythis is thes what theyn a hanger had im if were talking tout things you on have evidence for how at evidence the donnals from colluded with russia you an after that for four years habout evidence that donal trumpetcommitted major campagn finance violations youn't have evidence of at you arecharging him criminally in manhatton hv it evidence for the charges the abringing against him in washington do see with regard to january sixth te evidence there is real slim i do not see yuguis stopping your roll for half a second but jam erascan is doing the hamres he s says they have not even laid a glove on joe oh the hackery oh the unbelievbll hackery here and wor et a release o report about all of the foreign government a moluments millions of dollars wichand document that donal trunk pocketed at the hotells at the golf coursees through business deals when he was president in that his family got but theye not laid the glove on joe barten as president they have not been able to show any criminal corruption on his part as presidence they hav be able t jorning criminal corruption as president dhoes hare t even the alegations the alegation is that there is criminal orruptionman whois vice presidence not even naming the same piet by the way the evidence of criminal corruption is that his own ag tried to keep the hunter bidin scandal with a lid on it that is the actural evidenc and we have testimony from iris whistle lowers to exactly th at effect again i think the house of cards that is jobidon's reputation is crumbling i thinks con materialize if republicans have the brains to you kno run somebody who is able to make that the issue democratson or to distract ar of course going to now apparently insit president trump every day of this week everyday of next week and every week to come andht's precisely what your bide onte becaue again when you folkes in on trobidn what you see is a corrupt elderly man who does not care about anyone except him and his immediate family and if you folk sons oa trump don trump is likely to lose that is the simple mather and donal trump makes it easy for his opponents when he prazeis people loura lumer lor lumer is a pretty obviously a crazy person and a an donal trump on friday apparently praise tir pretty fullsomely an a vidioclip posted to social media she flattered him and the he did oppose with her he said it is great to have you you wor card you'r very opinionopinionated lady i have to tell you that in my opinion i that and then she prased samin he praye sir and all of the rest trump had actually offered to hire lumer a little while ago lumer of course has a done things suggest that casy disansis did't naturally have cancer that she fake tor exaterated her cancer shea said the martery telegreene is a beeward who says she is spreadingall the trouth that she is just spreading her legs a lor lumr is a delight an don trump once again associating with thou know people who flatter him but is that a great way to staff is that a great way to run a campaign i have some doubts ou ca meanwhile the craziest judicial ruling of the day according to the your times a grup of young people in montana when a landmark lost ut on monday when a judge rule that the states failure to consider climate change when a proving a fossil feel projects was unconstitutional the decision in the suit held vers's montana coming during summer of record heat ans elywile affairs marks of victory in the expanding fight against government support for oiled gas and coal the burning of which has rapidly warmed the planet julia ollson the founder of our childrenas trusts which is a legal mon propit group that brought the case i'm behalf of miners said quote as fires rage in the wlest fuel by fossil feel pillution to day's ruling an montan is a game changer the marks of turning point in this generation's effors to save the planet the ruling means that montana must consider climate change when deciding whether to a prove or to renew fossil feel projects now it is an obsurd ruling because normally in order to sue you have to have standing he standing means that you are damage by the thing and it is don enough to have general standing if you do not yeure a law and the law damages you you cannot just sue they's don general standing tht you do not the law for example the increased taxas your person who pays taxes that disd nt give you stanmding to sue that is a political question ha nordout standing it is got gi hate you with my car now you have standing to su me but in this particular case the court suggested that the mental anguish undergone by children because of climate change gave them standing to sue montana for not considering climate change when determinang whether or not to drill for oil emily flower spokeswoman for the etterney general said the ruling's obsur not surprising from a j g to let the plantives turning put on a week long tax par fund an publicitys on those supposed to be a trial it is ha bazar bazar case for sure michael burger whoh the executive director of the satan center for climate changelitigation o columbia sad quote this was climate science on trial and what the cuort is found is matter ofacts that the science is rights d now we have courts to justing the science is right and by the science is right that means that if montanna drills for oil then indubitably this is going to create massive climate change that oltilliar gids because now it is the job of courtz presumably sedecide the science pretty incredible ruling first of all not the purbiew of course actually and iu ouht else is nots purvuof cortz to simply give standing to plintus who do not have it in the first place the montanic case revolved around language in the state constitution the guaranties resident the right to a clean and helpful environment and stipulates the staten individuals are responsible for maintaining an improving the environment for present and future generations but the right to clean and helpful environment does not mean that the state does not have to do a balancing routine and figure out whether or not it is worth while for the citizens to say drill now apparently all thse young people can as su and states rangeing from hoy to uta to virginia is the first kind of case this to go to trial in the united states the state contended tat montanis missions are munischule when compared against the rest of the globes the plant tifs argue the state has to do more to consider how omissions are contributing to drout wild fires andother growing risks that it is an insane ruling obviously many of the youngsters testify in about the effects they had witnest now we have fifteen year olds testifying about how they saw tha it was really hot outside and this is now the ground to shut down drilling in te state of montanna thanks to this idiot judge not i've a question i've question why is it exactly that young people could not su wo stop for example pretty much every government program cas the i'll take on debt really why not why why do not they say that the government has a responsibility to make sure that those who cannot vote are not burden wit the cost of policies tht are undertaken now that seems ot a violation of equal protection for example you the theoratically make a crazy argument thut the equal protection claus which says that every citizen intidled to equal protection of t e law should protect people who are not able to vote yet in their interests for example if yo saddle the contry with tate thirty two shrillion dollars to national debt that is con hit my kids and my kids kids should not the abe be able to su and tad the federal government should not beable to pass laws that raise that that if they are actually going to tactually spend money thet may be people who are above the age of eighteen shuld have to pay for that thing is that thet direction tht were going to now have judges going i highly doct the left once to go down this this path first o alls can n bstruct down at the spring por level begas obviously specious and stupid but the fact that this is how the lft with love courtz to rule just demonstrates once again the left has no limitswhen it comes to power they truly do not the will suggest that the right is power hungry when the supreme court says we will not step into the abortion of ate we will insted kicket back to the state in federal level that apparently is an ogregious usurpation of power by the supreme court but it is a protection of rights when a local jodge says than an entire state now has to stop drilling bhecause munch of fifteen year olds are mad which is literally with this decision is pretty incredible stuff well all of the sciety into a realy fascinating piece by david brookstoday over the atlantic is called how america got mean here is what davebrok says says over thastehtyears or i've beenobsessd with two questions the firstes whive americans become sad the riseing rates of depression meen while publicized as have the rising adepths of despair from drugs alkohollan suicide but other statistics are similarly troubling my second related questions is why have americans become mean as recently talking wth a restaurant owner we said he as to eject a customer from his restaunt from rude or cruel behavior once week something than ever use to happen i had nurs at a hospital told me many on her staff are leaving the process profession because patients have become abusive at the four extreme of meanness hate crimes rose in twenty twenty to their highs level in twelve years social trust is plummting into thousin to thirds of american housiles gave te charity in twenty eighteen fewr than half tid the words that tdo fine our age rekofmenace conspiracy polerization mass shooting strama safe spaces we are in mashton some sort of emotional relational and spiritual crises what exactly is going on davidbrooks has a theory as to what exactly is going on here davidbrok says that there are a fewdiferent stories one and tacnology story social media is driving us all crazy second the sociology story we have stop participating ind community organizations at are more isolated third the emography story america long an white dominated nation is becomig a much more nevers country a change that is milling o white americans in a panic and fourth the economy story high levels of economic an equality n in security have left people afraid to alienated and pessimistic he says that he agrees to certainextent with all these stories but i do not think any of them is the deepest one he says the most important story about why americans hod become sadin alienated and roude i believe xuls of the simples we inhabit a society in which people are no longer trained and how to treat others with kindness and consideration our socities become one in which people feel licens to give their selfishness free rain the story i'm going t tells about morals and a helthy society web of institutions family schools religiou scripts community organizations workplaces helps form people into kind and responsibl citizens the sort o people who show up for one another we live in a society that is terrible at moral formation he says the moral formation comprises three things first helping people to learn to restrain their selfishness he says that america used to be goo o thi second teaching basic social and ethical skills and third helping people find a purpose in life now he is right about all of this but he is missing wy exactly all of this fell apart now part of it was the increasing atimization of american society with talked about and this ties back into the decline of church attendants for example it ties back into the rise of social media now the the sort of move toward individual expression as opposed to a communal a communal obligation that led to this sort of break down obviously he says schools began to abandon moral formation in the nineteen forties and fifties he sas the post or period saw similar changes at the college level he says questions what is the meaning of life had liveigood life lost all purchase it is fere after feare people decided that moral reasoning was not really relemant psychologis perfou g gruw especiually in family and educational matters it' vo cabulary froming virtually all public discussion of the moral life of children its be the privatizing morality the the attempt to get away from the idea of a common good he says the moral instincts here are falling into a pattern that philosopher alisetheir mackantire alled emotivism whatever feel good feels good to me is moral which of course what we have talked about is most lust who notice the pross of de moralization as it was occurring thoght a bland moral relatti thism and empty consumers would be the result you do you and all to me that is not what happened jonathan hight says when youre raisin a culture without ethical structure you become internally fragile you do not have a moral compass togive you directhion no permanent ideals to which you can swear ultimate allegiance and people star to suffer from what emil durcime has called anemy this is true i man all of this is true there is something else that is happen though and that is and attack on all these institutions a motivated attack and a reliance on the niceness of te american public to tolerate the attack suit is not just an meanthis is true a lot of the moral education whent away that undergritting niceness its kindness and kindness and niceness are not the same thing being nice to some one means that you just are inoffensive to them being kinds some one very often means yor looking out for them means that youcan tell them a thing that maybe they do not want a here if you have a friend who is a drug abuser and you simply say you do you that may be nice but it is not kind if you have a child who does bad things on the regulark and you just let them do it that may be nice but it is not actually kind but what is happen is over but kindness is undergurded by a belief in some sort of higher good becaue wht it means is that you do have to use judgeme you would do have to be judgemental you have to know that not being a drud gagnet it is actually morally preferable to being a drugatic ar yatuallyhave to say that certain behavior is better than nother behavior it is an act of kindness to chide your fellow when he goes astray but niceness says but that is mean niceness says that that is actually something you should not do and when you have an entire moral system that is base not on kindness but on niceness when you wipe away the moral framework and all you'r left with is nicest of course niceness is going to fall apart because what ends up happening is that people take advantage of the niceness niceness last only long as some one's fist does not tuch your face but it turns out that does not last very long it' turns out twhen youn't have a shared moral framework kindness tdivolves into niceness and that niceness has taken advantage of by people who have no care about you at all and the people whoashy do not abide by niceness are the eneficiaries initialay ar then you have an actural prisoner's dilemma a game theory prisoner's dilemma in which the person who benefits the most of the person who is not nice violates all the rules because while europe playing by the nice rules there is done what they want and the'r getting ahead and they are winning and you say well hold up a second i do not want o play by those rules i net con play by those rules either and then its just a race to the bottom and you can see this by the way in the pulling data democratspor example in the ninty nineties by late nineuninies democrat's thought that most republic ins were actually bad people and republicans still thought that most democrats ore just wrong and then around twenty thirteen twenty fourteen the staffs change and republican strarc say all may be democrats are also bad people and both sides now think the other side is bad people why what because again democrats we are relying on the niceness of republicans well at the same time taking advantage of the the lack of kindness in the system david brook is right when he says that lack of moral education iss the problem that of course is true wha it is also people be agressive in taking advantage of the niceness of others and that means social radicalism that is designed to tear down te institutions that is what this is really about inin actual attempt at dissolving the institutions themselves be this where david brooks goes wrong bec david brooks now he sides for example ted lasso right as as an example op aa restoration of niceness he says in the summer of twenty twenty the serious hed lasto promerd when lasso describes his goalsas socricoach heu culd mention the championships he hopes to win or some other conventunal metric of success but he says for me success is not about the winds and losses it' about helping these young fellows be the best iversions of themselves on and off the field he says that is ha two sentence description of moral formation but as it turns out what tad lasso really ans up being is a moral relat of us he basically in the series whatever floats your boat is the morality of the series by the end thereare no actual real expectations other than sort f a generic niceness everybody else he cannot bild a society on nicess no society functions on nices niceness is a by products of kindness when you kill kindness niceness will not remain meanwhile the economy looks it is about to turn bad i do not understand people who say that basically what goes up is scring to stay up and ever come down s modern moditary thery this idea they conjust in flate to currency and nothing willever happen about that to get forty year high in inflation right now a lot o lets are bring are blinking rythers particularly true in china and by the way china is in incipient rooming disastr area i'v an entire episode my new serious facts villblon you to where it really is seeing a lot of light and also over on ex slash twitter where has hundreds of thousands of yeus sayds probably at about a million views total at the went on various platforms talking about the various promise the chinis experiencing but chinus in serious trouble theyre demographically completely upside own theyve way more old people than they have young people to no ones can rel pite bills they get a serious that problemly gat really serious stemac that problem and they are now pursuing a tarcic economic policies that cut them off from the rest of the world market which means the canovy use their comparative banaged properly they are really in n bleep load of trouble here right now ccorning t the walls for journal chinas latest property crisis threatening to spill over ins the broader economy worrying investres in causing a broad market sell off chinese stock fell in hongkong and mainland china on monday with real estate developers electric vehicl manufactures and other companies in economically sensitive sectors to clining the most the hing saying indects which is loaded with chinese companies droppes one point six per cent taking its ear to date loss to five point one per cends the financial struggles of country garden holdings chinas top surviving privately run evelper thave been frontan senteson sodmiss t interest payments on two u s dollar bonds a week ago the property giant said that over the week end trading in eleven of uont dominated domestic ponds has been suspended and intends to discuss repayment plans with investors the property sectores gone from being a mass of contribute oft contries over all growth to a mass of drag on the economy tht is because china basically had a ciant pyramid scheme going here they would take wretirement funds from the people who lived in china and thy would tell them that if they invested in empty shell of hartments in gos cities that this would eventually turne into real money because those those cities would then be populated and you make a monch money on on those on those shell apartments and turns out that there was no one picking up rental on those shell apartments on the other end thet money just disappeared into these vast cities tat are completely empty at this point all built around debt new home sailes increase in the first few month of twenty twenty three providing a glimmer of hope but the market then turned in april and itiuaide tails of chinas top developers have slumped eversons chinase now tropping into the fleetion households are now borrowing lest because they racked up high levels of saving chinese banks extended the equiplent of forty seven poenty billion dollars in new loanes in july that is down nearly half from the same month one year ago their currency is depreciating pretty significantly at this point again if china's economy takes a serious sdip thas can o have a major in packed on american markets it s tonkin to be all roses for us because we are intertwined with th chinese economy again thanks to a lot of bad form policy decision making over the course of last few decades particularly the decision to suggest that if we intertwined our economy with china that magically china would liberalized which of course they did not meanwhile those higher costs which are going to be brought on the american economy thanks to the cllaps of thechinese economy those higher costs are going to be exasterbated by a new model in the west of subsidization and a tenuated trade lings according to the wallster journal the world's biggest economies are offering huge subsidies and cut throat waste to win the industry of the futures the end the losers are all the countries that cannot pay up but the reality is that theet the losers are also the industries that ar subsidized that money comes from somewhere subsidies you just take money from some one and you give i to another person in the hopes that second person is going to use the money abetter the wise the government picking winners and losers how do they choes who gets to win and who gets to lose subsidized industries by theway overtime ten become fat they ten n become lazy they tend to have higrates of union is ationwench dhrives up labor cost tha eventully to get under cut is the story of the american car market by the way from the nineteen fifties through the ineteen seventies in the nineteen fifties whose american cars all over the world by the nineteen seventies toyota was eating america's lunch there is a reason for that when you subsidized industries to the poin were those industries do not really have to worry about their cost structure they charge too much thatg thy ber such o cost too much their post their part start to cost to much an eventually somebody undercuts them right now the level of em of subsidization is really really high in major developed countries i'm not sure why people think that this is o a particulary good idea particulary when you are talking about totally inefficient industries clean energy the use is now offering three hundred sixty nine billion dollars and incentives in fonoming for clean ener chis part of the infletiont reduction act the starting to see a few people who are on wore building here but mainly because they know that the united states government is in a pony up for a bunch of this this is also combine with the down falled globalization now ther lot people o talk about global soro globalism as a bad ineteea i i agree in the nll said globalis are bat if youe sunglent international governments americans giving up their power to international organizations i agree if what youre saying is that international trade is a bad thing by myour mind you that if wi were not for international trade w if you do not the inflation now wait intill international trade gets cut off af the realities we all benefit from those wide open shipping lanes the united states has been insuring essentially since world ware too when those start to fall apart when trade goes down the costs on every thing the currently pay for its can go up radically it is not just atter of globalization helping low in come countries we are once poor countries south corea or attiwan it is also that the standard of living in the united states is wag better now than it was in nineteen eighty n i you do not believe me go look at the craft people had in their house in nineteen eighty seriously pick up a product to nineteen eighty they suck they are terrible i understand ever wants to believe tut the middle class has not gottin any richersince nineteen eighty bast on false pictures of the wage staffs but that is not true the stuff of the average mental class person has now is better than petty much anything that rich person nanin nineteen eihty that is because what real world economics is about is the cretion of new goods and services that are better and cheaper and that is in effact of globalization as we on wine globilization and as we direct money in substinization we are gongto get a slower economy that is going to be the the end results in all of this and for one of the lucky few in one of these substidized industries you feel real goodabout yourself but if you are not you are costican to gup pretty much everywhere else i'll gate time for some things i and then some things that i hate sot things that i to day it turns out that terrible economic policy has some afrofacts this wy republicans in the united states should take hart in the fact that eventually jobidon should pay for his economic crimes here if republicans have the brains to run somebody who actually has shot at winning thatd be he big one not shing the tolet from coodnwin he could but its campan would actually have to be about the issues not about whatever the legal issue he has to day is about the reason i say this is because right now argentina is showing this the possibility which is kind of wild according to the ner times a far right libertarian candidate one argentine is open presidential primary election on sunday a surprise showing for politicion wants to adopt the american dollar as argentine's official currency and embrace is comparisons tedonal trump hov your melay fifty two a congressment economiss and formert to geep on itscured thirty percents of the boat with ninety six percents of the ballas counted making the front runner for the presidency in the fall general elections it as a clear shot at leading argentina argentin is general election in october which wh could go to a november run off will not become a new test of strength of the far right across the world again the way that this works that if you are anywhere to the right of caral marks according to the our times you are far right althugh hard right forces hafe gained a new influence and several powe fulnations in recent years including yuust germany france italy sweeten an viddlan thif suffere some defeats including in spain and brazil milet has pitched himself is the radical change at the collapsing argentine economy needs he could be a shock to the system if elected besides this o currents his ideas about the currency an central bank his proposed drastically lowering taxes ctting public health spending closing or privatizing all statoan enterprises and eliminating the health education environment ministries surgomas of the argentine scentr left finance minister finish second in the primarih just twenty one per cents of the boat the third place finisur patricia bulrich is it conservative and shes in third place o seventeine which means the to out of the top three are conservatives and nearly the top to the sunday results showed that argentinas three supper coalitions have similar levels of support make an unlikely that anyone will actually win in the first round thesen to right colitions candidates received to combined a twenty eiht percent of the ote on sunday the centra left received twenty seven persent both slightly less than melas total as well mula said were not only going to and curchonerism that is reference to former president cristinthe fernondos the cerchener were also going to and the useless parisatic criminal political cast that is sinking this country he also o thanks his sister and all of his dogs who are each named after a conservative economists which is ousum men this is the result of bad left oing policy see this way poltics works when left run things thy to a bad job people swivvel to the right if you give them some one who is capable of talking out the issues people actually want to here about oke other things that i you to had to apparently reverse course after they adtempted to throttle a vidio that we did for our new serious facts we did o viio onu tob about the organization garm which is essentually a a consoresium of advertizers that work to shut down all advertising on controversial platforms by contrversial the just mean basically right wing platforms even if their very main streame well you to then demonotize the vidio claiming that it was conspiratorio medio research center press tu to aabout why monetization was suppressed apparently you to effectively refused to acknowledge the platform had limited th vidio in the first place a yue to espokes persons thad in order for vidio tomootize on youe wet must comply with our advertiser from the guidlines which are publicly accessible and apply to all creators poner view the vidio in question is currnatly monotizings they reverst themselves which is of funny because tom they dn't tell that to us again they they claims that we discussed the new world order which they non monotizable conspiracy theory but there is nothing that is conspiratorial about the actual episode which simply names the various subjective guidlines put in place by these advertising collusive regimes i'm glad tha you to backdown eon masque did see the vidio and he actually suggested that maybe the wit dissolve this would be to have a basket of safe content in a basket of unsafe contents that of course is not right because the probem is who gets decide what is safe in what is onsev the samixack groups ar currently using exactl y those guises in order to push censorship whatl we actually need to do is blow up thes collusive enterprises entirely and then advertisers get tho eside on their own what they want put their advertising on if they did that thoy'd be a lot fift they would be a normal market mechanism as a poseed sort of collusion they were seeing right now o kat time for a thing that i hate michael or you remember him he was a popularized to th former and i

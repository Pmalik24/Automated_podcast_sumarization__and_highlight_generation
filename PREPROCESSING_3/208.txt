time of five o seven p m new years eve the did of a promising linkth o vaxination locations but when doctor namark clicked on that lank with her information she found there is nothing for dentis in new york city it is not justhat they seeme to be at the back of the line it is the lack of in formation that iswhat gets ta doctor name ar she finally did learn when the state would be vaxinating dennis but it was not fom any official source someody she knew jis texater he vexinations wre supposee an a start this week tthe week t began monday january fourth ta fourth week of the vaxine roll

who care directly for coved patients and nursing hom staffs and residence when i ran tot by doctor namark she agreed it seemd sensible the nobody had told this to her nobody is pretending vacine distribution is going well in new york wright now the state is only manage to ad minister about forty per cent of the vacine that 's been given we's thactually better than the country as a whole which is used abut a fourth of the vacene thit is out there wut still the frase ofros do handus to describe her own feeling about how it is going was this what can it anshe take off some of the many many whogis tical challenges they faced figure out which facilities could deliver the most shots and hw to staff and schedule and track hundreds of vouses of people getting vacene they a decreate scheduling sophware and figure out what to do in smaller health centers people do not show for appointments which is an issue cause once you have opened a pravial of th vacene you have to use all the ten doses inside of it in a few hours ore they go bad their health senders who haveben told to vacina people from other kinds of facilities men al health providers and t om how anter ar n i a a how aout ition tob ha how ma a ta other commider a can tey commina how can a get the people ettere to com en te heal unter war it her w get em aba i cute mei it is on i do not knogh the details are cund

just literary how do we seadour gictle from this facility in to a time when we can get enough of them to use ol the dose in the vile ye hae tats we were getting stock yet and i thin bo arly where ut utpeople wooking back ot a do not get about brait aba wees hee's no no about prize for that is kno no about prize for scadoing people my person finally did geds gedul doctor namark tho the only appointment that tet is her could get was forty miles away this it tracouarin now said the sedy sea made a carefully thought out plan for who should gt ing in ours first and second and third and then that plan collided with reality and when and where were all get our acene is going to depend on these le gistical details and how well they are managed to day in our programme we see just how common this is we ave other stories of this happening scarce ry sources that need to go to somebody and how the end of getting allicated whether those researches are place to stay for the night for love and companionship being redistributed in all kinds of new ways since the pandemic but be easy chicago it is this american life i'm er glass stay with us a lon god committee we starver this example of a very pure situation a people have beng given the difficult task of trying to figure out how to distribute something important in fact in this case life saving medicine ther deciding basically who will live or die and the very idealistic slution they came up with loly sollivan tells story wul start as you miexpet wit the medical break throup back in nineteen sixty ae doctor name belding scribner had a pation a young man with kidney problems tere was omething doctor scripner had no way to treat we had to send the guy home to his family to die the case haunted doctor scripner one night he woke ap at for iam with an idea ae way he could have saved that man ae tephlon too that could be stitched into the blood vessels of the arm an stay in planted there it made long term dialysis possible for the first time they would pulled the blood out of some one's body clean it the way kidney does and put it back in tpeople called ot a medical miracle and artificial organ that could cheat death there was a problem though the machine they came up with is big and complicated they built it from a seers ro buck freezer that they would modified with a bunch of other parts tnurses called the machine the monster because it was big and unwealty an every patient needed to spend dozens of hours ach week connected to it and only five of these machines existed this is onle exscerimental sages they only take care of a few people and therewere thousands of people dying from kidney failure every year in the coun try on one hand a miracle on the other doctor scribner had trated one herrowing problem a medical one for an equally herroing ethical problem had do you choose which few to save and which thousandse would die doctor scribners or to getting flooded with requests from people desperate to be put on the machine the pressure was crushing hin saying no was ensuring a persons death he went to the administrators who were helping to oversee this whole project anasked for help the administrators took it from there the first thing the administrators socidet is what this is not a medical decision at all this is a societ ol decision they decided to assemble a group of people they chose these people not because the people had any medical knowledge or really any relevant experience at all these were ordinary people hand pick to represent a cross section of moral american society wy o mae iill tironi her ia warrer this is from a documentary from nineteen sixty five i y beleru i'm a half why i am a pargon the money atono boosero cominy o meble ma mon oono ply o pooona cimemacin the committe was strict about ananimity the document ary their heads are darkens we cannot see their faces these people had just been going about their lives when the dialyses centers administrators asked them to come in one of the people in the group a young minister toldthem it was not for han to chos who would live and die the doctor said we are not asking you to decide who will die this is all ready determen we are asking you to help decide who will be given the opportunity of extended life the minister agree to do it they all did a few of them said it would be too cruel to force this responsibility on to some one else officially they were called the admissions and policyes committee of the seatl artificial kidney center at sweetish hospital but a lot people called them the god committy wat the time againd this is in nineteen sixty there was no blue print for this the doctors gave them no guide lines the commitee considered first com first serve or drawing stras bhut they been told to use their consciences they came up with set of principles and rules the first rules were clear cut the treatment was in siatle they'ad only look at applicants who lived in washington state washington tacxpaers were funding the research they also decided no one over forty five there could be medical complications a d those people had at least had a shot at life and no one under eighteen the treatmen was physically in a motionally demanding no one knew how it might affect kids but those rules only got them far they decided they would base their final selection on something else social worth theyd tried to save the person whose death would most hurt society they made a list of the factors they would way marital status number of dependents income that worth to pay for the treatmen sax education occupation a motional stability pass performance future petential and personal references they made a policy of never meeting any of the candidates an person or even knowing their names tecause denying a person you would met face to face seemed too hard they once let a journalist come see how they made one of these decisions they just had a meeting where the doctors had presented them with five abligations tand the committee could only pic two they walk the journalist through how they made that choice tredery create for her the conversation they just had here is a transcript of their discussion tbanker just to get the ball rolling why do not we start with number one the housewife from lallawalla surgeon this patient could not commute for the treatment from aurralla she would have to find away to move her family to seattle banker exactly my point it says here that our husband has no funds to make such a move lawyer then are you proposing we eliminate this candidate on the grounds that she could not possibly accept treatment if it were offered minister how can we compare a family situation of two children such as this woman in wallawalla wit the family of six children such as patient umber four the air craft worker this is something they talk about a lot i've one candidate has one kid and the other is two should you pick the candidate with two kids they go round and round try to answer a question that has no anser labour leader for the children's sake we have got a reckon with the surviving parents opportunity to remarry and a woman with three children has a better chance to find a new husband then a very young widow with six children surgeon how can we possibly be sure of that how the rest of you feel about number three the small business man with three children i'm impressd that his doctor took special pains to mention that this man is active in churchwort this is an indication to me of character and moral strength housewife whucd just certainly help him conform to the demands of the treatment lawyer it would also help them to endure a lingering death housewife if wer still looking for the men at the highest potential of service to society i think we must consider that the chemists and the account have the finest educational back grounds of all five candidates in the end the people they chose were mostly men white and well off people them which seems inevitable given the creteria they would come up with the select for what they called social worth education future petential income the treatment cost about fifteen thousand dollars a year that would be about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to day and it often was not covered by insurance they would written all tese rules to try to be fair but they would created an outcome that was anything but sometimes when yu try to guess your own biacees you come up with tha very incomplete list in a letter the minister row a few years later he talked about how he would been extra careful to guard against his own biaces and not favour people who were good church members the later on he worried that he might have gone too far they unfairly hard on religious people the final thoughits were always made by consenses they said that gave them some comfort o but o a w the with a we we ar rar a bor but comity a ut e bo choi a wi for to maor as hor to find manhy recordings of doctor scribner ut i found an oral history recorded decates after all this happened were he talket about the god committee this was wyly criticirs afterward the prower just in a word was you were face was a morable sol as all all right o course it was affair at all but thet was the best we could do inther doctor scribbner y ot he talked to these patients constantly he could not have the distance of the god committee had a talctor few of his patients they ell said he was a really carrying doctor tere was one patient he particularly liked a patient whose experience undered up changing everything for dialysus and for the god committee she is a tea nage girl named caroline a tolctor maum susan she had a study personeli she as a very happy happy happy girl a very likable one oh a well rounded i would to say on how did that doctor scribner liked caroline much i sot of instinctive is a mother you at the feeling for if somebody to keet er nat carline is fifteen i ged student scoutleader tot piano when she was sick the atlets would carrier up and down the stairs at school ged som her youthscrup at charch o don'i blood when caroline's kidney started to fail doctor scribner subitted her case to the committee heven though he knew the rule no one under eighteen did he tell you when he put caroline in front of the committee did that it was going on ah did i know what was going no no i did not know until after the fact that that is what he had don oh i did't know there was a committee ta hose who lives in dies and act she was turn down but was that for you oh i can' remember the conversation i just know i was totally silence oh trying i guess to obsorb what was being said i do not know how you ho put into words the feeling you hehave when youd deliberted dest sentence that your the pard of you dies no i ou just everything stops in is still does when i think about his the matder far were you ever angry that the committhe down just i that she it an't lest nater or now nreally me may have their rules and regulations no where you may have a hundred people in can only take too you pretty much after uno haftor stick by the rules doctor sribner did not see at that way doctor scibner was n tat content with that decision he thought he had a good case ind it pleaded it well an i i really thought he he felt that his co hortswud go long with hin he was a highly respected man and i do not think he was used to having anybody say now to him doctor scripner tried to find away he told the committee a'l treat her on my own time nights and weekens just let me use the machines they said no he could not accept it he had another idea something he would been thinking about for a while a smaller machine one that someone could take into their house and run themselves without any medical staff it was no wean mer ready to be tested in thats where we lockd dout and that he was tin to whatever it took to keep her round intill that machine was ready he called the guide whod helped an build the dialis's machine an engineer named albert bab he told im about caroline said do think we could make this she only has four months albert asked doctor scrimner will not the committee get mat they ere going around them doctor scrimner said no this has nothing to do with them i'll get other funding the engineer wone to help his halting dit they wre n technically supposto they wre at the university and there was was t we working on something else but they work non stop to do t they decided not to thelp the university concerned the gine would shut it down some one on ther teine would actually to dean watch as they called it to ping an eye out for the deane and warning their team over the innher com if they saw him in ther lab they put their designs and sketches on sliding pennelse when the gene entered the building they quickly switched the panels around to hide their work on the machine to get around the god committee doctor scrimner set at up independently as he research project caroline would use the dias's machine at home susan would run the whole thing it was presented to us as being a strictly family manner to see if a family could run it correct i believe it miss fray seven night can lamen non professionof people a soon the row of engineer and nearest can lay people be trained the engineers finished the new machine in four months and rushed it to caroline's house and august of nineteen sixty four susan learned how to do what before had only been done in a hospital run the machine that would remove her daughter's blood from her body wash it and feed it backin through her arm exceptos happening in the basemen of her house an e special room they set up for caroline i would put her on the machine usually between six and seven ofclock at night and that would mean taking her off after nine or ten hours i it was early early morning and then she woul ju stayin bed may be for an hour in any breakfast beforshe went back to school and you take her off round three or four iyam sho you would wake up in the middle of the night and oh i was awake on night o yeuer only ta oway anl night our machines as experimental lily our alarms were going off all the time and then we have to fi gure at wat was wrong with it a constant problem was that her blood but clot and clog the little toob the little chont the doctor scripner had invented and caroline's arm i would have to get out aterin and saying in a serange and un block the clot if it ws uncloudable now that was very painful for her in it hurt me you kno to pain her that way rush if i mean yeu had to get the blood flowing again in i had na alternative but to do that o that was probably a our biggust hurdle was just keeping her blood moving were you ever worried that you would get something wrong o shure sir a sir sir ime prence when sonmays life is in your hands i men lest when i fell her life is in my hands i was always aware of it some could go wrong but it i better not let it happen the after concentrate no do everything just right tis she was at she was sick and tat i think my feeling was il i hope she feels better after this is she was sick and in just a few weeks caroline felt better oh yet she div her i sparkle an she was talk at ovmen i felt this is a beginning of a new champter in or life how did doctor scribner do how did he feel when he saw that it was working o of cours he was just tublant oh he was just grinning for me ito ere this research project was supposed to take three years to show whether or not home dialysis could be a viable treatment but within one year doctors agreed this would work this is what they would do susan kept dializes in caroline in caroline kept getting better she graduated high squall start to college tut dialysis is a treatment not a cure and was still experimental person's veins and arteries would often scar over and stop excepting the treatment as the doctors had said it was a chance that extended life in caroline's case that met for more years am she dused up oliver a musible a bains an arteries and am there having a very difficult time a putting round dialysis i that during the time she was in the hospital that ias two or three weeks i think ii would dializer there is best i could a fir wear may be as little as an hour before the blood qit an ahm and then it she just acurirated lily i'm sorry a she was an intense of care in the hospital and she died at night when i had had gone home ah we knew a that she must not gin a command of it am but s i guess i was is prepared is anybody could be a noin it am knowing that we had done everything coid an it the bot o mine is we would left to o se for all the rest of these people in thet not only our country but in the world that a that have bhat can live because of foot we pided meer aftor susan and caroline show thet home dialysis could work doctor scribner immediately put dozens of patients on home dialysis people aroun the world started building these machines it got cheaper and with way more access to dialysis they no longer needed a committee to playgod the god committee story now it seem as a dark moment an medical history heple octually point to it as the birth of bioethics we had to invent an entire field to deal with these questions we have agreed that having people vot on who makes the cut to liver to die was a bad idea although the truth is we vote on life an det decisions all the time to from a greater distance theciding things who gouds health insurance but where the best hospitals go wich in a pensemic to make all the difference wecide thes things a lot e just do not use the words god committee it is easier that way thilyselleng one oft prieces of u show she isan brukitch the momin that stoy that if youse bak she was ninety one after her dought er carolin dige spend the rest of her life teaching people hat a dilives tof family numbers the oaf to winter's pone s when it comes to whol love that of course's not seded by ponel f experts somewhere wech decide for ourselves who wuld to be with whone of our producers on a baker has noticed the way people are deciding on that siding wen who makes the cut who get's first date it becomes part of the life in a much bigger way in yerk tity wise gids shes all that is changewaywy have you heard about finding your winter i had not either apparently it is a thing single people in new york have been doing since covid basically over the summer and fall people started scrambling to find some one anyone before winter in a second lockd down back in august completely oblivious to this phenomenon i went on a date with a guy we met on hinge the dating ap our first date we would spent six feet apart in a park for a second date we met at an outdoor restaurant it was going well we would just put in our order when he said what do we do about hinge what o you mean i mean do i deleave my proile why would ou suallea your profile because i'm met this really great girl and i'm totally into her i hot is it me yes of course i was compute i'd had to pull up hinge right before the date to remind me of his name and he was ready to be exclusive i am not new to dat this does int happen straightmen in new york city rarely want relationships the whole game is to stay single at best you get invited into their harem one of three or four people their sleeping with no one ever wants to liminate the possibility of other options quickly but then it is kept happening i'd go on dates and everyone wanted to have road trip style marithon bonting sessions that lasted hours longer than usual they wanted to see me again they sent me flowers they even help hand this was my first time back in the game for a while i'd taken a break from dating for nearly a year i gone through a bad brik up i left town for a while did sintharapy meditated and now back on the scene i felt ripfan winkle waking up to a world where men suddenly wanted commitment i went on ten dates of them nine wanted to keep seeing me by comparison three years ago when i was last single i went on thirty five dates of them two wanted to keep seeing me i thougt did i get hot all those months of work on myself had really paid off i told this all to my friend homset did i get hot did you get hot he could not stop laughing you idiot it is covit that is when homs explained about people trying to find their winter a friend of a friend named christine a single woman in her fifties told me in her experience it is not suttle we know one or two men has seid o me winter's coming and i'm really hoping to the somewhat to spend the winter wit they set that ianother person i talke to kelse twenty two said she recognize what was happening early because she used to see in chicago every winter before temperatures dropped to below zero and going outside was a non starter peop l would rush to couple up she said everyone called at cuffing season as in hancuffs i was out i was capsing is guy casually and we were out one night and on te're sitting down at the var cou of talking and yo was o by the way were together riht and i was ol my at you do not know me no and it hon'e hunt t the exclusively with you and by the end of the night you gone home with some one else ba sically i iwas it was musical chairs he as trying to sit down in my chair and i sud know and you found another open chair and youas done and it was ad your great cuffingses in and i'm sure out relationship ended by this bik by the time people were going out again kelty says now

would not normally be in to around thingsgiving and then another one laughd and is now living in a ran and colrada with a next boy friend that she does not want a dat but i think she did not on him for you and you her mere new york that an extreme cuff a justination cuf ben wt i guess you would think o be nice after all these years of rejection guy's being into me right off the bat or being texted a miss you hours after meeting but here is the problem of what they are doing projecting building up an entire fanasy based on barrely knowing some one that is my thing you cannot take my thing one time i ti i much after meeting him once that i spend a week imagining all the dates we go on together including one where we got stoned and bought cray on spontaneously and colored in colouring books by the time we went out again i'd been on many imaginary dates with him my bring genuinely did not know the difference between real life and what i'd pretended we done but only one person can do that at a time otherwise you are both two into a way too soon and that is bringing delusion to delusion an acancels the whole thing out now i feel i'm on the other side of the ecquation i'm watching people try to find their winter i am watching what i used to do and how disturbing it must ave been i get wie thirty three out of thirty five men passed on me it is off puttig i told kelsy it'n this new world of musical chairs wer living in but the real question is do you mee to chair i've just really thisit i do not ik tid much rather yuse be dancing around and not of a chair ni i sit on it i chair an i'm sometimes he got to sit on a chair sometimes don a silla cairfe it it is an uncomfortable chair you are getting more miserable in the chair than not in a chair id ha a i do not now i had this omagat i was getting out of the subway thai was getting out of the sub way and this guy approached me and yeet a mask on and he was excuse me can ask you a question and i thought for shrwsgin to ask directions i said yat and he was a i i ie just bought a farm up state and i'm a growing my own locally source produce and i'm looking for a girl to get in a relationship that i can bring up sone is this something had the interested in oh my ag and i i was you ae givenen my number i've interesed i li iv what is happening to the world is is this truly the end of days also cause i'm used to guys using i were in fine answer i have for nucral stability using things til i i real me in but never crops no one has ever said ano i got some cro t os but it is totally us using use te spakies ye's i have fresh air in la a capital ra now tat i's told er its total capital ray now i get that its hard to be alone but this level of desperation is a bet much he was a step away from saying i ave a van two shock guns an a cana gass get in we can make it at least two weeks before the sanbe's catch up to us when really all were in danger of his watching netflicks alone ti thought i could enebe this way but as i talk to people i admired the single minded practicality of some of these new yorkkers my friend micha is a psychologist she says people suffer when their isolated heople need to be touched she went looking for a winter to preserve her mental well being she is not deceiving anyone she is clear about what she is looking for a warm body which doesna sound very romantic for the fillic that is can werwer that wher i map in this moment she you just want somebody for how long ell i tell hom a vaxn i in you are totally fine with it being some one that you would not normally be attracted to or want to spent time wit wll i'm having to come into th and having a lermous standards would you say that you are picke si guess i use to me picke i had my icass i had my list that how to be checked off money in the bay good credit also a gentlemanand a has the same vision as me ri were a line and we both want to build in community and you don clothes e racial weld cap what er e be a blib black black power couple used to have a my on my life diin profis i would just say looking for the baroctoma michel that is all i would put some one i standard was baroco bama ye but but brok with michel because michel smarter than him better than him and he values that yet she pushes him to greatness and now now all if you can hold conversation you do not you are not overtly an asspol and you are smart enough im yet heven these new lower standards were not low enough she match for the guyuik kids which is usually a deal breaker for her and was a quote film maker which is another deal breaker because she feels film maker is a job everyone in new york claims but she agreed to a first state he told her hed baker a pie she was expecting an entire pie he just brought a piece he would eaten the rest but she was willing to overlook it i was you could even tell me that your filmclenuncle hopus into that whatever i listen to your stories bad an old pantin dern wemot learning whatever i'm willin but for their second date he insisted on coming over she kept pushing for an out door restaurant when he said no she counterd with how about coffee finally he confessed he would spent all his money on thanksgiving dinner and he could not afford it she is still seeking a winter most people i talk to were in as pragmatic as micia if anything e's been kind of stunning seeing people who were players before covit suddenly questioning their life choices and wanting families or at least real love my friend an who used to be more of amicia of all the people i saw searching for a winter i was most surprised by him when en is single which he usually is he is prolific he would as he put it order men on apts to come to his apartment you order food on seamless he alsidates women but the pandemic broke him something about being alone all those months during the first lock down you k an't help it if you are we the end of fight club with a the world falling down around this you better grab on to some one's hand or else you ging to go through it alone being would bike through the abandoned city it was empty he laid in the middle of fidamene one afternoon it felt a pocaleptic being alone it changed him when he was stating before they were always un limited options always some one better when you stop seeing everyone is an option you cannot help but stirtseing peoples thelone for better worse dramatic the shift totally were living in a very dramatic time when things get when it stern to get darkat to pia youn upjoys to be i alone now alone in the darkness now i'd rather have some one ext to me we will figured out later being alone also changed christine she is us to being superbusy she is a successful peater person she has took kiads her ecs in her would traded off week to week and she go from haming a full house to being completely alone she lives facing a highway and for the first time ever there was no traffic sound and i can remember os woke mor morl or farml slol and just my tad and and sorro wisshin or there with some btle with r i con halls ans or i cold just just hard an o on be reth or or mor fals an rou i ventually farmesofl sto frnama o i i did to i about a teddybare she got a un a corn and rated in a baby blanke christine and een hey're not looking for some one to win ter with till they get their rack scene they want to find the person they want love i think the guydes i've been dating during covetor looking for that too i think they genuinely believe they have found it in me our minds complay tricks on us when we need a break from reality the guy who told me had a vision of the woman who e wanted to be with a month before meeting me and that when i walked up to in in the park for the first time he recognizes me because i was literally in the woman of his draim here the guy dated for a week who told me i was the one and that he never felt a connection this powerful these are lovely men every one of them i think i do not actually know them adown ta baker is one of the puces of our ogramm coming ot working a hot line we help people who are in desperate need realizing doing one of the caus that you recognize the voice of one of the collers that is in a minute te cogabubagratio when our programme continues tis mer on from our reglast to dayes programme making the cut in the stiffical moment that we are all living through with a pantemac in the economy the way it is we have stories of people who need stuff and how decided who is going to get the stuff they need we have arrived ot at three of our programme ac three reluctan pure crats when producior katy mangle starty to put together a series on homelessness for the pot cast ninety nine per centi visible she learned that if your home is in the bayery ar the first thing that everyone tells you is to call this hot line two one one that is how you get access to shelter or housing she is youward here about this hot line all the time for people who were experiencing homelessness they usualy when people mentioned it they were frustrated they would say i called the number it did not help i did not get anything and she wondered what is going on here over the past few months katys spent sof time with the two one one operators as it took calls and it turns oup whether you get access to certain kinds of help dependsnn exactly how homeless you are consider to be not everybody makes e cut here is cate ruschana robinson used to answer to one one calls from a small offics about half way between oklen and sanhosay now because of covet she takes the calls from her dining room table if there is time between calls she moves around the house a humming bird preping frood for dinner proo freeting her daughters homework doing sit ups to on one is a crisis hodline for people in need since covet they have been getting more cualls than usual from people were hungry or need helpping bills or rent the operators can refer them to programs that might be able to offer assistance i thougt to a home one or the other day sfor almost an hour losing her home thot to some one else that ons a day kar losing it may lose your house said she losing her mine devastatin sdevastating calls now lot more work non stop i'lla me to counteets well non how can help you the most common reason people call both befor and after the pandemic is homelessness to on one can fine callers a shelter bed for the night if there are beds available often there is not on a good day they may have four or five to offer this in a county whether at least eight thousand people homeless on any given niy one wune before cllers seeking something more permanent longer termhousing eliton there is not much of that either but to on one can help get callers on a list maybe o it all depends on how they unswer one question and where o ouslee birst day last night here ruschauna is screening a cller to see if she qualifies as literally homeless you are literally homeless according to the county guidlines if last night youv slept in a shelter or in some place not meant for human habitation a ten or a car they lastn but the caller she is been couch serfing for the past few weeks and last night she tells her shna shes slept in a motell pay for by your sell or yes the caller says paid for by herself for housy but that is not the answer rochana needs she cannot forward her on to the next step to get longer termhousing the welcome li this technicality what does and does not qualify some one for housing it is upsetting to the callers it is upsetting to ruschana too she thinks about it even when she is not at work i gl wer ma don old se your my sister in union city that wol else tix that is always all tipe of lasttion over there i she this family going in there must see them packing all he is that three or four kids rah and it is lit oh they are homeless but they cannot get help that is foct up ntheiser kind people that will call me and i say cannot help you cause she is stay hr own last night sthat and i that side sidwle now i hear you is fill you i know your homeless an nost saying you are not but i'lla me ta county guy line these are the stipulationsif callers meet the definition of literal homelessness they can go into the system and be put on tha list there they get ranked by how needy they are the people considered most in need might get housing in two or three months but a lot of people just language at the bottom of the list never get anything and end up calling to one one again it can be a madening cycle and sometimes people get exasperate it that the yellat rushawna she tries to listen not take et personally and move on to the next caller not get too attached but every once in a while a caller will stick with rushawna long after she hangs up i've heard her recall name o folk she talk two months ago and in january of last year she how a call she still thinks about the many thi giv e fialimy to cay wil on apn al you e i'm calble al be to couty with the per all i ere the caller shounded familiar to rushawna whshe said she and her son were homeless and looking for help and bike you wi i ta get at the bar bi bike hal being ap the word that it we e we o it a will not e mov anywhere that i con get up rushauna starts asking her usual questions have you called to one one before bhut your fone number what yer name e my i ten o in my lat e now rushana knows why the voice sounds familiar and you can hear her take it in the person she was talking to was her cousin the two had not seen each other in a long time and her cousin did not seem to realize she was talking to rshawna o a one moment she puts her cousin on hold and turns to her co workers fuck this is my cousin she tells them when she gets back on the call she seems not to know what to say at all she is lost the script completely a hey i finally she recovers a bit d makes her way through the screaming questions and be any friend te counly i eywit wo rushana once to tell her cousin ats her ut there deep in the call and she does not know how to say it she sticks to the script at it is now nine minutes into the call and she is finish with the screaming interview i o ka to ou have been deparment cu be litterly homewid a ii have mee county gi lie you havbeen to cane to bou litterly homewit rushaunna tells her cousin that since she is literally homeless she can pass her through to the next step she might eventually get some help and in the meantime there is one space available in a shelter in oklin that she could go to right away a ti ell i e ti at ere i wont ter fayit a te or it te the pin it te the in i iyou ge a er am finally rushawna finds the words tit te piny tiny as rushawnas nickname te te i on er ti te batla te rit not your mat o me at rig now oye im e feri t an o bat e o ao appen i y but i get ao pick en ube for the wort at it o i it i wel i iy ano for the next few minutes the two cousins catch up a little both alluding in vague ways to difficult and complicated family history yet tay av be har it men i not i no i talkety i i fer te ic tet gev better for you a i tat e be you no year you ke me you' o be a go giterate it i the way to do it a me i tatter may rshaut is not the only to one one operator to know some one who became homeless nearly all the operators who work for aleme to county to one one or women of collar and homelessness is disproportionately affecting black and brown people in the bearia one operator named gwen told me she would been homeless herself for about five years not that long ago at the end of the call rushauna transfers her cousin to the place where she can get on the list for help with housing avent a connect you i got you cun a cu o gan i iv i i i eer a i a a a rga have't a cac yo ma o gan i can lov you hav la you co i looking back on that call rushauwa recognizes thet some of her hesitancy around telling her cousin it was her had to do with her own doubts round what she was ready to offer i did not really one a fully at that poin exdidn my hand has in a place this day becaus i did not the i was in the position to do that i just then one to be face with that is in my heart i would have had the heart to be no you cannot come here rushauwa had been in thi situation before not with this cousin but with another family member and she knew once you invites some one in you have to be willing to let them stay until they find another situation after that two one one call with reshauna it ended up being about six months before a cousin was able to get herself back into her own place when these operators actually do have something tangible to offer their collars they jump at the chance at the end of one of her workdays rushuna answers the phone for a coller who needs a shelter bed to night luckily she is just gotten word that five beds have opened up in a shelter an oklin she has something to offer only there is a problem miste ree the clieng is a cross town at a kinmy dialice 's senter your nio needs to be at the shelter by six p m it is currently around ten minutes at her five you need to get over to eo s p by six p m is there any one there no com down comdown is lookin is there any one there that would be willing to give you aride do not ot now six six yes six to night this collar whis name is james reese was panicing i if he could not get into the shelter he imagined he would have to sleep outside that night oa er o wayr o o i let me let me placyo on ae clic cald to see what i can do about trasportation ol ay then me play to one one operators do not really have a vuget to help collers with transortation but there is this very small fund rushauna tells me for lift rihes although she does not think this situation meets the criteria to use the funding am you do not have a way to even take the best on misterese no i e er o oyo howart rushauta puts mister reees back on hold and opens the act for lift on her computer her brow was for o her curser is hovering over the request ride button she says to me this is where the humanity comes into it most of the day it is do you fit the criteria are not call the number read the script go through the proticals but now she is gt to make her own disisen t poquet er miste rese gen a get you a li frie it is rare having a problem she can solve even if it means pending the rules a bit mister reese has forty minutes to get to the shelter but it is a thirty minute ride with traffic ill you will be getting picked up in three minutes by a ricardo he is driving a white honda court o e ag op i e o hav a goigh breshaunta hangs up the phone but on her con peter screen we can see that ricardo a driver has pulled up to the address mister reescave he is just sitting there why is ricardo just sitting there if mister rese is in his car he is weens wen in o i miste rese he is there to kamy wen a hurry misteries that that he is now left in the ride wits cancel o em at all a secon serese she puts him back on hold i'm not sure if she is get to get him another lift or if that was his one chance it is five thirty he would already be late but maybe not too late rechaunta tries again robell in a greentoyota priis will be picking you ut in six minute o i'm still here misteri o an to stay on with yeu till you get in that ca h five more minutes ce o tegu o cor oh he is there he is waiting for you green toyota prea ther amer alqe mister reee you may have to walk around and look for gran toota priis come on let us look for the a vehicor o yes you can get in there we can see the driver's blue dot hovering on the screen circling the block but they do not seem to be finding each other ill cant let me try to call the driver holt on a second there are four or more agonizing minutes i'f back and forth on a conference call between reschanna mister reese and robell the liftdriver mister reese is describing landmars describing himself finally they find each other gin te cor a you are in the car perfect you are ging to be a few minutes late but just calmly explain that you ere told to come he thanks her she hangs up ged he is on his way well yes tet that is the the bidthing a i guess that is what keeps you going even if its one person that gets ta place inside to night in chgetting mister reese to that shelter was one real thing before the days end one person who rechanna new for shure would not sleep outside that night it does not always go that i had not thought about it that much before this but puracracy's are not just frustrating for the people trying to navigate then they are frustrating for the people working inside of them too no one really has any age ency no power to make a decision that could really help some one all the operators told me the best calls are this one when they feel they actually have something to offer but calls this are rare mostly resha nows to be the voice telling people they are not gan a get what they need not right away and may be not ever

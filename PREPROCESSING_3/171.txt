young sixty ween years old from a degenerative disease she struggling to speak she was not a pain is nice to think of her past all that then it happened a second time few weeks later jante was back home in w york city ever twenty five hundred miles from bagus wheremam lived and dide how ghost would get from one part of the country to another as a question that i certainly would have if i believed in goes does it you knon't just jump on a commercial jet naces janteis on ar couch i was again scroling on my phone 'm just shopping for shoes or something and again she just pops up oh and it startled me and it almost startled her that i saw her that i recognized her and she apologizes for startling me and un is oke just figure out what you ont to say and she says i do not want your dad to be sad and i said why do not you tell him that you do not want him to be sd she says but he does not listen you to and then i thought about how even in life i was the translator between my parent oas etra as the mediator beton an she would she would give you messages to take to your dad yet yet did you get a chance to ask any other questions now i just said oke i'll carry the message no probleme wai did not you have questions what happens to us after we die were are you what is his experience oca she visits again i'll make sure to ask i did not even occur to me at the time really yet all of humanity whut would not know the ans er i man speaking on bea myself ut also when they have of all other wivin people this is tue this is ture oke if she comes again i will ask her and get back to you shan they did o over the message to her that do not chante ye her mam's rite e has not was not well sometimes the third and last time her mam shod up again jhante was sitting on the couch this time i was watching tvy and then she decided to appear while i was watching to be i had to posit and i was oke what what is it this time and she is oh just waing to show you what i've been up to and have not been talking to you i'm taking care of this girl she ways taking care of kids aand that is what she said she is doing right now and the other realm is she is taking care of another kid and ias oke you are hanging out with another daughter i'm here you cand hang out with me when did you say thet i was not gin a say it ti just thought it wai did you have the feeling if ike in some way she wanted you to give her permission to do that yes she wanted to show me why she had not been around ah and that is a little bit permission but it is also i'm doing this iu'n busy i'm busy yes exactly how her ma'm was often in wike off busy doing her own thing and and i say is is not what chante wants to hear from her dead mother and she does know what you want she wants her mother to say something about her what she meant to her man i'm supercurious she was such an independent person annd and she wasn' particularly expressive with emotion or affection and you ways wonder who who am i to you the are you saying you are saying you you want wont more sign from her that she really loved you yes ye and she sus is not de wuivering she is not delivering this is a well known psychological phenomenon that after somebody dies they appear in some form that seems very real to the people who are clossest to that lke l see them thou'll hear ther voice the further presence this is a well known thing going back to the nineteenth century froid i wrote about it and called it wishful psychosess i'm n there is a study in te nineteen seventies of it was of two hundred ninety three welsh widowers and widows and found that nearly half with them said their spouse had returned yet that seems to be what has happened i'm is this some sort of self soothing is this some kind of lich in my brain glitch of grief or in something that tike we wanto be haunted oh yes but if this is you trying to comfort yourself in some way you are doing such a bad cob i mean she is not saying the thing you wanted to say to comfort you not at all yet exit is not working wll this is the problem with ghost is that ther they do not do we want them to no she is not at all they ant a programm the problem with ghost expect such pecific things from them and they rarely deliver really do wanth them to be something they are not which frankly is unfair they are dead and still the sup us to put up with other people's expectations do not wealleas get reliefe from that in the great beyond to day whon a programeve stories of all kinds of ghost ghost ave been ignored and mis understood famous ghost ghost who have ghost ted thost who love them yes they gos to why do you think they call them ghosts they beo beasy chicago sise american life amera glass sthey were thea han the ghost indestrial complex fo people

ghostevery night in spand of the historic districk ise packed with ghost tories guides taking people around with ridiculous ghost detecting a quipment tors and open top hure says there is a lot of drinking on these toris the general is the podcaster that a bunch of us heare at the radio shown nout chengeri comunica rasing a heard from a friend of his george whecn eighth generation syvanan i something weirid is happening on these ghost tories eorge tod cenjeried that the guides actually talk about the brutal reality of slavery cenry thought rarely on these tors the gon for that genjry was the cos to the podcast on civil which documented the typica ways that white sutherners present the history of the south but they usually leave out i the violence of slavery when to see for himself what was happening i went down to savanna i went on o bunch of these ghost tores my friend george told me to be sure that i went on one called the spirits and scoundrel tore i pulled up on it about ten p m on a saturday night was being led by an older white de drest a pirate we baggy pans an a black scarf round his head silver rings and daggers hanging from his waist kind of jingled when he walk wel ledies an gentlemen walkcome to the spirits and scoundrel tore i garanty we will be walking on the ded this evening and as far as i know we may well be standing on some as i'm spi as we walked every once in a while he would stop on rom from font of one of these large mansions and tell us about a murder and some kind of ghost sihing all of this was toldly predictable on a ghost tore and also pat a while not into ghos stors but then the pirate pointed down to these bricks and said they were sunken down in the sod one because they were bodies of people buried beneath us i told you as toll have us walking on the dendis evenin dedno ba ally ien wunky round bu get yown either these bricks were walking on are the original bricks hand made by the enslaved folk ince o vanna you will see these all over the his storic des trick and when you do take a moment to look at them clostly tbecause you can alten find the indintations of the fangers of the brick maker you can see the pinky fanger the index fanger tht what fanger her the small size of these indicates the brickmaker was either ol woman or a child suddenly we were not just talking about ghostlany mores the pirate it snatched us into this kind of weird black history archaeologing n honestly caught me of garn keep him mind people walkame past us with beers in the hands it is not quite new orleans but it steapily wen down town drinking vine the pirate knelt down and held his fingers above the indentations in the bricks when i find em always to put my fangers and i feel it gives me it candaction with the brick maker when white people acknowledge slavery i'm not gon to tell em do not do thetbut at this moment i'm not sure on buyin this connection this was a tor guide trust l ike te pirate leading mostly white folks who were here to find ghosts the only other black eye on the tor was this due to was may be in his thirties and i could not help an noticing clearly we woere not the target demo graphic for this store when we saw each other he gave me the nod i walked over to him i fell by fthatug just lost of black history t ona he looked directly at me as screnched up his face if you look up seriously brough in the dictionary this gofs face would be there i could not help a laugh we both did his name was grag soon enough we had another weird slavery moment on the tore we stopped in front of the big mansion called the mercon williams house according to the story the former owner of the property humercer told eight of his enslave people to stand in the front of the house or and then ordered em to face to the east neold down and before any body knew what was hopinin is a leddgs to a pulld his pistol from his pocket walk behind tow pa pa a pa shot all laid of him in bak of the head is the pirate imitated the sound of the gun he also acted out the whole thing pointing his fingers at imaginary black heads in front of us the then is a ledge to have take an to bodies and put him on each corner of the mansion their heads coming to gather at the corner and the foundation stones lahd on top of them this was likely some type of voo do richal after that harifine detail he is on to the next thing i thi that was just another fun little storie i fell back from the grew to wolk next to gragg ay man won wwhich he think wic din bou that man he skilled on a hol alout o was no e nowe tid a she stuckim of the built the house tor grandwords and that story about all on the slave e they have named enhe whoere rovety shot that is wont invess agan and i wantded the same thing i wanted to hear more about the blackfolks than these stories they not just their deaths and in every tore i went on this happened over and over gides would breaze through thse violent stories of in slave people getting killed for pure shock velluy a laughs i when the pirate took us tho what he said was a slave burial grow ehe said te bodies were pruttyg much just thrown in the dirt ad then he kept that off with he jok and after while we thank we have such loch beautiful green grass he here other grathric moments of terror a trama got other punch lines one to our guide told us about for rent away slaves who would be headin an joked at their ghost haunt the square and if you listened close you can hear them singing i are not got no body ethink i was expecting these tours to acknowledge slaveryn the way that would check a bold box or something yew somber sentences acknowledging hi slavery was bad before they got back to ghosts ethis was more than they were really going in a lot of his stuff was cart twonish histeriof typical but intentinally unintentionally they would do un something ot called for many times getting groups of white people to could front the violence and colld bloodedness in slavery and whi were southern mostly white people paying to go on these stores in their time off it is almost if you turn critical ray theory into a book of ghost stories all the white folks who hate it would love it i talked to some one who had an explanation for why this is happening time miles as a his storian at harvard and she sto ble do not to a tour this cond of ona whim i was visiting te savanna it happened to have beand a rainy said of days that i walked by a home called the siral weed house as i walked by i was called and beckoned in bi a woman who was standed outside trying to encourage people to come tocatour the store is presented to tya as a historical tour not a gost tour ti loves going on history tours i had never heard o this house before and i was perience i went in i took the tour and that is where i learned about molly molly is the person at the center of which probably the most popular go story down in suven her story is the spoo he climax of nerly ar re tours the tourguides all stopped in front of a big orange mansion with palm trees and spanish moss and he way they tell me this black woman molly wholived in duie in the house was own by wealthy influential business man made francis surround and his wife matilda molly's caught up in a move tring francis is having and a fair with her that is the word ans only matilda his wife has no idea then one night matilda walks in on frantis an molly and catches them in the act the tilda distraught to learn that her husband is cheating that she walks out on the balcony and jumps to on dect some even believe she was pushed a few weeks later molly is found bed hanging from the rafters in the slave cours francis is a suspect in both tenths tour is all over the city exploit this tragedy by claiming molly still haunts the house where she was murder and remember because these ar gost stories that et told when a whole bunch of embellishmenth and the slightly different versions on different tours i will say that what is interesting as matilda om she was actually really close to molly molly was cone an on official farafist for herly confidant in some tors molly matilda come off as if they were lesbie an lovers here is a letter molly supposedly wrote molba loved sister wul tilda how i yearned for the the slightest with of yourwisofen and one guide when is fars to end a detail about matilda holding a hot boll of suit when she walked in on molly and frances tos ae starer o o and there is france wan moll get mitl a r ara a r o i a a y a r a ma o there was only one tour guide who talked about it differently not coincidentally the only non white torguide we had letina guide mamed sara because of the power strackshare that this was some one who was ollen by francis this was not consential for bout people this was definarat that is how tya saw it too everyone us as this sort affair to my mind the way i interpreted was she had been explained that she had been abus and she had experience trle pain and suffering after that first daytime tour wer tia learned about molly she came back for a night time tour which takes you to the room where molly died and the tourgude described i cans as i tell you this i feel my tomic tightening the tourguide described that she had been found hanging fram the rafteris of the the slave quarters at this particular room and he took us to this room and he invited us to go insy tya stands frozen the threshold of the door while the other torist push bire they jus went on in as if this was only nojust any kind ofs story but there was kno way i was going inside these were white ges were white lother foor petispents for whife folks everybody was but me and they did not seem to be having the same sense of the gravity of whad if where we were were in the slave quarters of what occurd they jus when it they did not have a sort of reverence for the space anything that no one seng to blink an iye and the touri gide was om careis madic he was i was jo gen and he was certainly making light of the story and he was narrating it as if it were some kind of horror show that people had entered into forfun no to get a hollowing scare by b choice t this point the torgod takes out of phone and placed this audioclip that he says was featured on the tevy show ghost onners they filled an episode in the surral wheet house but tia heard was a woman's voice screaming help o god help and the muffled sound of her crying hard of me was shocked an apalld at what i was herrin and that same harme that was shos in apalled felts just a rush of a sense of protectiveness for molly for this young woman who really was a tea nature who is just exploited be used eused and then blamed and then kills but another part of me and this is i think that the scholar inside how do series of questions running the whole time questions about how does this person know what it is that he is telling us how does he know about molly how does he kow about the affair how does he know about the suicide wha does the evidence behind the story ouldid you decide to do about all this i decided that i had to research molly story and the srell family and this hous and to find out who she was she knew it would not be easy if a double deat had happened related to a sexual scandal related to an interational sexual relationship in the nineteenth century the white family would not have been happy to disclosed it right they would they would have tried to keep that quiet she started with the more accessible records and trike down francis and matilda e found evidence suggesting she did killed herself though not in that house but to confarmed that they own some one name molly or anyone in that age range fi started out by going to statein local historical collections she colned through purchase records of people the sarrells an slave do not through national ar cives and senc thes records of a slave folks in georgia scoured local newspapers from that time found letters from neighbors she even discovered a memoir by one of the sarrelle sons and at the end of a year of exhaustive research there was kno molly that is that saint that otor that otor that we got u to stop thic as i mean after i meou just describe to me this whole drama about molly and now you are looking in these records and you do not see any record that no no name of molly o no not a single trade on a single groun nothing nothing if ti had told me that molly story was exaggerated in certain ways i do not think i would have been surprise but no molly bat's actually a fiction that somebody had creaded and what i realized that i felt enraged i felt enraged about the notion that some one had enrade all this up tye was appalled that she decided to find out if this was happening anywhere else turns out plantations and old mansions all around the south give tors this and she went on as many as she could she discovered a whole industry built around fabricated stories he storical sights ginned up with vate tales of murder and torture and she wrote a book it sposing this part of the torism indistry called tales from the haunted south hearing this thought back to my tor with the pirate and that story he told about the shooting of eight an slave people by humurcer there is no evidence that happened and those finger prints of the enslaved in the bricks we walked on bricks that due existence ovanna but probably not in that location but it is not jist that much of thi stuff is made up the closer tie looked at these coast tores the more she saw a disturbing pattern in the kinds of stories the tork i had tol they were stories were in slave folks betrayed their masters ar poison their masters a seduce their masters the gore and sensationalism of stuff this actually hides the realities a slavery by turning the victimizers their masters into victims if he look at them as little moral fables the message of these stories is that everything would be fine if every one just stayed in their place to ty is book te bunky molly came out in two thousand fifteen but when we took this a rail wead house night tore molly story was still presented his fact and it was the focuss of the tor i want did know how they could justified why they still telling this lie the manage of this a ral house agreed to talk his name is calvan parker and i was surprised to learn that he is black it is work at this a rale house on and off for ten years and gives tors himself but the o the historical tors that happened during the daytime and they do not mention molly these days he says molly only gets mentioned in the night time tors after we discussed im basics about the house i got right to the point when i took tho tore the stuff yalla dono it was but really some sensitive and ittent stuff but i got to say man it seems this story about molly that was a huge part of the tor i took is not true what is what tortage you take i'm ot to the night toreis thoug when i'm talking about i i de ideal with more the history portion of them of the business we do not mention that whole story because we do not think its thas fact toras most people think if is ot oughter i just i'm clear you agreed that the molly story this being that i heard at the tor is a lie ii do not i do not i do not know if it sir a liar not i then git is some of that is that spen sud sommany times at just it just stufk tit this point i realized that this conversation was going to go very differently from what i had expect tells e cause iv thought calvin was going to defin the molly story lik sight evidence and show me documents in fact i'v spend the night before preparing counter evidence we were going to tryal calvan told me he is changed tescripts of the daytime tor their facture but he insisted that even is the manager he has no control over what happens in the house yo nighthe says he was promoted to run the daytime tors four years ago s and only the daytime tors the ghost tore portion of this business is always been ran in emanage by ofl outside parties he says this year for the first time they have not had people from these outside company's running that business for now guides have continued giving te ghost stores with no one really supervising them calvan says he is te factor in charge and hoping for a big overhall i have to say i feel for calvin is a black man he is in a tough spot as some one stuck navigating a situation created by other people's lies bt still have this very real feeling that wats going on here as wrong and i could not hold this back if i'm bein told that some one was hung in a room in a house i believe that that they should have some verification for that i grivat you but what am ask you just is homming tor you tikt in a city i i lost count maybe five an how much of thee torg be refactural how does that help us understand mollyas you nin cause your ha understand torism after understand how these torgides are training ho they how they how they work there is a lot of tores in this city that well say things that are not hundred per sent lot of the tores in the south are folk lor lot of tores in sout for hand don past ou several times and sometimes those stories sickle people if those story sickle people i cannot help what they say i can help what i say i hear what you sayin calvin about you rol where youre read how you approach history but i just wonder if you can understand that if feels folks have been make him money hundreds of thousands of dollars off of a lie about a black women who was that their saying is sexually assaultit for entertainment and now there is no account ability i i do not i do not know what you mendersay to that because there is a lot of stories it is a lot of torsim the some what happens in this business and all i can say is i do not do it and i can try and change ot but but we talking about the surrell house do you think there should be some accountability at the surrell house for ta lie that they have been telling and make him money off to sell it to white people i do not think that is a i do not know i may not i'm that is god question next year the go thing is i'm one of to taken control lot ofat lot of that part of the business and the lot of things wile definitly changein me at the helm y you going to change that part of that are going to change are you stogoing to tell the mollys round now now not not in that i cannot why not i i cannot find fictural things about the story it is weird that any of the ghost tores in making the stuff up to shock people because there is no shortage of real horrence ovanna's history it is hiding in plain sight slavery used to be the city's main business you could still see the infer structure around you the boats came in at the doc negro marts wheren slave people were sold or throughout the city do not picture an auction block these were just stores whose merchandise was human beings and there were brokers and bankers that funded all this people came ti seva from all over the south the biance slaved people the problem of these tours is not just the tourest ongutist since of the actual lives thet by real black people hundreds of years ago it is also that they do not get any picture of the economic machine the builts oman the built this country made much of what we live in to day the tell us

that we expect all kinds of things from ghost and they usually do not deliver we arrived at ac toof a programme a to wedding crasher since next goestoiy takes place at a wedding when uninvited guest shows up on abaker explains the wedding took place on a cold night in february just one month ago it was big celebratory there was an hour of light food in drinks and then everyone walked out into the court yard for the ceremony to door opens e's double doors and the first people walking out is my god holding the groom and their holding not even holding hands directly they are holding their their ebows intertwiet this is abbey it was her younger sisters wedding the last of the kits to get married it felt the end of an era this wedding would be the grand family fanaly you have the whole family the immediate family the extend ed family the grandparents it is the closest people of my life as a child are oll there thet abby does not say hide at any of them she cannot abby as standing behind a fence a little ovher fifty feet away on the sidewalk the uninvited guest it is her abby was tisown by her parents seven years ago she grew up in williams burg brooklan in the hisitic community there it is a tightly nit world of orthodox ches in long dresses and black suits and hats it is own little cultural ego system tucked inside new york city abby was standing pretty far from the ceremony but just in case she were a face mask a big coat and a hat no one would recognize her she thought the distance would make it feel less intense but standing there made her feel she was at the wedding it totally throuwer off gard you can hear to me usic playing you can her here the person who is running the ceremony singing in the micephown and on everything is very familier but at the same time i know very consciously that i can just go down there be part of it when abb first questioned and then left the scity community at twenty one it seemed things would be o cay her parents stood by her which was rare at the time but also made sense her family was really cloves she would still come home on weekens but then a few years later abby came out as trans tit was a concept s o foreign she says it took over an hour for her father to grasp what she was telling him but the second he understood he stopped making i contact with her looking over her shoulder he said this means and never going to be able to talk to you ever again abbey says she asked if she could at least say good by to her mother he forbade it not talking to her mother was unfathomable before they would spoken almost every day even though abbe's one of thirteen kids hermam took a special interest in her and when abbey broke away from judiism her mam loved hearing about her life in the outside world in the weeks and years after abbey was cut off abbey would call and call trying to reach her mother one time her mam picked up the phome an i told in a said hir is when a call you an hi she happy new yearn what ever and then she just ask me aw you coming back he coming home which did not mean physically coming ho and spiritually and religiously and i said ta i did not call to argue tissome that she is if you ot comig home a cantal to you and she kept repeating that almost a taperquarter some one told her to say that abbey was later told that her father consulted a rabbi about his decision to cut her off and that this rabbi told him your child is dead now when she actually dies you do not need to sit shiba now standing outside the wedding abbey was being forced to watch all the people she would lost parade in front of her she studied her father's face his hair and beard were finally turning wite but she knew that she would seem pictures of him on line it is this moment of rcogniing that i recognize my death from phodos that who is alive i recognize how he looks not because i know him or that i have seen him but because i've seen phodos it is the moment of seeing a person who in my head has this personality of a dad o my childhood i i i cannot really grasp it this is person whois dear but is not i am here but i'm not i am seeing him but i'm not i'm there but i'm not therand what has happeningeven though abbey knew going to the wedding would be painful she felt compelled to go because she would always imagined being there for years after they cut her off she would told herself by the time my youngest sister gets married will have worked through this i'll be back in the family throughout the ceremony abbey kept waiting for her mam to come out with the bride she knew about when it would happen she would been to many wedding but still the moment they actually walked out it caught abbey by surprise suddenly there she was her mam with her sister they tart the circle the groom an my mamas walking towards me to speak and it is that was the moment when i remember cried o she sanding to the right of my sister holding my sister's her left hand i i in the right and holding this candle and almost imagine a statue of e liberty moment if amost fo thinking bag in my head it wanted to be that moment where she is holding the candle to me or something that and to me dabt was that that was the most that was the most intense moment can i play that virio by do i think them ye did the sound give the sins we hold a they play the song n tat ben in the family for ganation t momeng standing there looking in to my looking on the outside you might close family listening to a song composed by my great grat wet over grandfather i am suddenly feeling i am afly on the wall it a moment at the moment where you are suppose to be next to the bride and the groomd the most important people at the wedding of the out their parents in their siblings it is not i'm not theear i'm dear but i do not have about we have a believe a teaching based on the on the mystic teaching of the thirteent century that all the ancestors specifically if they were wholly come down to their weddings at's sols as ghosts for the of a betteterm and theyre oll daer i am suddenly feeling i am one of those dead ancestors that is coming that we believe that we are told that is coming to the wedding i am the ghost she watch is through this chanling fants it is this literal thing saparating madam tut even if it were not there there would be no crossing from where she is to where they are miin my life in general my parents live seven miles away from me i it feels theyr close but they are far away and and my dat frankly whatever when i gaa ya but wit my mam there is many tays that wake up where i just when i ask or woght to do about my headach or what is a good dish that you think i can make for tis holiday or i'm having friends over and i know she would have some great ideas and all of doubt all of that comes to the forefront at that moment were i wish i was not a ghost i wish i was seen not just seeing her the way you just said when i wake up by imagine talking to her i imagine asking her whet i should cok to nay that is a thing i i felt about people i love have died i do not want to talk to people i do not not talk alver people who have literally lost apparent but to me it feels worst i thing that te part were people use ghose sometimes because it it explaints it it calks bout something more intense than being det the fact that they are alive and i cannot talk to them the fact that they are it is that moment of being close to them that would have no doubt been easier if i did not go if i was not that close to them it much easier why i do not hae to face it co co abby br ida girl friend to watch the wedding with her it was the strange moment for them bot a kind of bazara meet the family these are the people from all the stories i tell you this was once my life wat what was the last moment of the weddingly how did you leave it after the ceremonies over the briding groom hold hands and walk back into the ven and this is the only tine thats pothitic couples hold hands in public is ad the wedding as they walk off from the ceremony and never again abby takes one last look at her family and then she walks away with her girl friend i arreth was right away if you i think that we waiged until we left the socitica we did not wone to hold hands to women in the lydicar be once we left and nd we did and i rememer thinking that i have some thing none of my simplings to i can hold the hands of the people i love in public an i left that fothey walk down into the subway to get there and get on the m train each stop taking them far there and far there away from abby's old life in closterd ad the place she now calls home tdon baker i be stine as a memoir becoming eve by leaving the hacitic community entranceis hema tray sayons viction the losstory happens in a moment in history when lots of people were believing it gos this is the oarly nineteen twenties nineteen eighteen foopen to make it just killed some fifty million people world wide ijust er skll that is way more than the number of people whofe died of coved far he number people on earth which is a forth then what it is now at to that the millions of deaths in wore were one and well chance of pretty good that if you lived in america or europe youre morning somebody you loved all the loss wet to this peculiar romen thit seems kon of an fathomable now with the idea that ghosts are around us just within reach was not some far fetched or fringy kind of thing his main stream shohn cold explins what spiritualism it is this religion basically tha surged during this period believers thought that it is possible to talk to the dead they attended saencses lots and lots of siences sittin darkened rooms often pitch black holding hands furniture would move your voices from beyond i cannot really beeven begin to tescribe how pervac of this spiritualess rage was this is david jeer history writer wrote a book that delves deep into this whole world you had all the nof these great american sciencists who were trying a substantiate proof of psychic phenomenon proof of an after life the harvard psychology department were all bunch of ghost chasers i'm in the head of a harvard psychology was also the head of the american sopsoty for psychical research n acharles werechet was a noble prize whenephysisists wo coing to ter bacto plason ac to plasn that stuff in the ghosts blusters movings at richet was actually a physiologist and while you may not have heard of charles rchet or any of the pscientists who were spiritualists ran with spiritualists there these two guys you definitely have heard of both incredibly famous back then and even to day who got swept up in this movement and a way that came to really defind their lives the first is the world renowned magician and escape artist hairy whodini at the time of our story he was grieving the loss of his dearly de parted mother and this was no ordinary mother son relationship he wrote romantic letters to her used to rest his head on her bosom when he was anxious and when he was thirty five years old this by the way was before the whole world was talking about the whole metible complex thing and he would never refer to her as his mother he would always refer to her as a sainted mother or his beloved mother he old doctoro called thudeni t a last o the great mother lovers ho denia denified with all the bereved who were seeking contact with dead loved ones identified with but he had a rally hard time believing in spiritualism in the same way and for very very good reason hu deni before he became a magician he actually made a living as is a fraud medium a fac menia yah no ken he knew all the tricks he was in a sense the world's expert on sycic frat but yet am he was also seeking that one sychic who he could believe was genually in touch with the spirit of his mother and this is one he befriend sor athor conan doyle yes the guy who wrote all the sherlock home stories he is the other famous emic famous guy in our story conandoile lost his son his brother lots of the men in his family either in some world wore one battle or in the flue pandemic and during the war a he believed he was in contact with the spirits of his his his lost loved onces a through his children's nani who supposedly had psychic powers and she would hold the saance sas and he became a believer and not just o believer but really the defact o lieder of the spiritualism movement he might be familiar with his part he travel all over the place giving presentations and lectures about the virtues of spiritualism which lent the movement a lot of credibility he was thi sguy who had invented this character who was the pinacl of rationality in deductive reasoning of course you were going to give him the time of day and conandole acknowledged the other a lot of fake mediums out there but thewre legitimate ones too hu deni's mom had already been dead for the better part of a decade when he met conendoi he presented himself to conandoil as a seeker after the truth and conandoyle thought he could help him talk to his dead mother they came to really each other in nineteen twenty whou deni travel to the uca to do some shows and cnandole sent him around to all these meniums that he trusted but with every one of them who deni could see the pupet strings because again he had pulled the same stonts himself once upon a time and he claimed to have attended a hundred sance as and in england right one a dayr yen hudeni had a tentency to his acterat ia i doubt very much if he hadtinted a huntred sianceis but he did i see a number of these mediums that conandoyl recommended and he struck out and and he told conandall that and conandoyle thought it was because hudenie's mental state with turbulent that he basically blocked any any kind of possibility of am psychi communication when he participating the siance as and he tolludeni you cannot pursue a spirit the waya terrier pursues a rat way you have got to come in quiet and reseptive and he thought hudeni was to blame for thus which of course his a conversation you here in a lot of spiritual houses if you cannot get in touch with a spirit whether divine ere just your cousin sbecause he do not believe well enough that is forward a couple of years nineteen twenty two conandoyle comes to the states to give some spiritualism lectures brings his wife alon and they hang out with his new best but whudeni and hudenie's one and toward the end of the conndile's time here the four of the maretta resort in atlantic city hanging out at the becher whatever and conandole's surprise their magician friend with a suggestion cona doyle's wife gendole is also a psychic medium an cur has an inxpiration the week gan that whudenie's mother is going to come through and present a a manifestation of her presenc she just comes up with that on er ound l apparently aam she is hit with this psychic bolt oca an sa conendoyle invites eudeni for a sayans and unbeknownce to the doles this weekan was eudenie's mother's birthday sort of in yeure coincidence already and who denie he is agreeable actually eager he wrote about this saying quote i was willing to believe heven wanted to believe they go up to the conandoyle's hotelgrim sir arthur closes the curtains and puts a writing tablet and pencils on the table this was to be lady doyle's mode of mediation automatic writing am the idea she is in a trance and she is spontaneously possessed by the spirit that takes hole of her hand and she is just writing unconsciously oh it is a wigiboard where the spirit takes your hand a he moves ah that is that is a good way of looking at it am it is a very intimate scene conendoyle says a prayer am there holding hande it just complete silence then lady conandole start's writhing around making all these jerky movements she pounds on the table which is the sign that the spirit is present lady conandoyle asked the spirit do you believe in dod and then pounds the table three times which means yes she puts a cross at the top of of one of the the pads am she as are you the spirit of eudenie's mother again she pounds the table three times an then heudeni kind of lets out this gasp and says mamma are you here just thinking about whudenie sang mamma you heare it is really moving it is really moving and i think i do not know i i cannot picture him saying that in any other sayants i think that is expressly something that he was vulnerable enough to say at that moment lady conandoyle starts writing furiously every time she gets to the end of the page sir arthur tears it off the tablet and hands it to hudeni luckily whu denie held on to the pages after all of this we know what is on them i asked david to read some of what whudenie's dead mother had to say oh my darling thank god thank god at last i'm through i've tried oh often now i am happy why of course i want to talk to my boy my own beloved boy friends thank you with all my heart for thus you have answered how is whudenie seeming through all of this is he likein motional during it to see according to conendoyle he was completely silence he seemed on the verge of tears am he lookd somebody who had finely found am what they were looking for to having just beheld te meracle is life of mine it is different over here and we see our beloved ones on earth that is such a joy and comfort to us tell him i love him more ever ears only that is conindoyle's fors the story hudeni is left pale and trembling a new believer hudenie's feelings about it become evident about four months later he writes an article for the new yorks son saying he is never seen any evidence that any one can communicate with the dead quote i do not kno of any medium who is not at some time been detected in some fraud conandole sees the article and writes a letter to his friend whoudenie saying am parphrasing here dud what the hell i watched you teer up in front of me also my wife is not a fraud whu denie wites in backlike dud that was not my mam the fact that his mother could only read writ and speaking german whudeni cannot understand how the message from his mother in a could sound some victorian on plotitude it it is not her voice victo victoring platitude in english in english and there is also it sounds a spirituales sermon god bless you too sir arthur for what you were doing for us for us over here who neet to get in touched with our belove ones on the earth plain if only the world knew the scrat trut how different life would be fror men and woman go on let nothing stop you great will be there is no grat bia graphical raference t anything between eugeni and his mother including no reference to the fact that it was her birthday think she would ae mention that plus that cross that lady conendoyle put at the top of the page when she started channelin heugenies m were jewish conindoile has responses to all this ad first of there is no language in the after what she says maybe a trancemedium would come through uttering the exact words of your loved ones in heir native ton but automatic writers ar more translating their thoughts and feelings not taking dictation and as far as the cross goes conendoyl says his wife tas thot before she presents any kind of spirit wriding because it is protack from lower influence says i aways home it tae cross on top of the page o of course i ma you doft want dark spirits and ful trading your say on and i not taking hold of the medium n be terrible no that the cross perens tha and conandoil maintains look you told me you were walking on air you told me you were deeply move a i i cannot reckon siw what your saying now with what i saw with my own eyes at the time how you were sponded an the things that you told me sense which indicated that you were convinced he is conadoile's pessed at his friend conadole is very hurd the atlantic city sayons was the last straw for hegeni from then on he was not just a sceptic of spiritualism he was an all out crusater against spiritualism he would sneak in to darkens say onceis in disguise china flash light on huckster mediums as they pushed furniture round that was supposed to be moving on its own he devoted a big chunk of his toringshot to just bashing spiritualists demonstrating exactly how shisters pretended to channel your dead relatives e even testified before congress in favor of a bill that would outlaw fortune telling for hier did not go anywhere but the hearing devolved into total maham mediums and other spiritualists flooded the capital geering hudeni as he gave his testimony security was called in to keep them from laying into each other he screamed at them tell me the name my mother called me when i was born the way hudeni saw it the called psychics they were just fleecing money from the bereaved people who were grief stricken of course they were ready to believe anything it wounded him cause he knew how they felt ejuncle s when the produces of oursel

recognizable afterwards the man doctor tatam treated was move to rehav to recover from what cove did his body but it did to his life was different there is nowre had for that bodn som mans o producer on her sho at on bad bless america in apr when we first started talking to the staff at henry ford the intent of carriuni was strugging with something they had never seen before all these patients whoich is not getting better these recovied patience would either die for theyd stay stuck on fenawaters for weeks and the staff had no idea how to get them off when the doctor red odt is sh we heard the beginning of the show which circulate through the hospital talking a staff and checking in they all knew that she has a very particular approach to medicine an patient care bout making meek welcome back hagan ira yhat renas whole approach to medicine comes out of an experience she had back in two thousand ah she was a doctor here wit henry forward and then she landed in her own i see was a patient she had milti system organ failure went on a ventilater and she told me her coworkers acted she could not hear them but she actually could what shocked and at set me the most was over hearing a resident in the whalway say she is trying to dye on me an hearing in the operating room she circling the dran the sonser scared to hear that yah it was an difficult to imagine my own recovery when everyone around me was talking about me as if i was dying a i i had said similar sanes she circling the train ye an it was a culture a forvonem and it was showing that you were untouched my suffering it was that it did not manner and one of the things ive always felt for to be shamed aboutis thet er patients have been telling u tespings for years o when she recovered she returned to her job at the hospital with a new mind sat it was all atout ampathy thet empathy would make her a bet ter doctor not worse which was the opposite of her training she been taught that to mich neeling clouds of doctors judgment she an a small team revamped the way the whole system toks to patients and renner what a book about her experience that now used in metical schools but wheldn't covet hither i see you it became impossible for the staff to do some of the things ran up in place before coved when someone arrived unconscious orcidated into the icy vew hit aways asked the family would you think her love one would want me to know about them families would put up votos and bring quilts personalze the rooms the staffley that they really wanted to get to know the person they be caring for but under covet all that was impossible fammies could no longer come in get to know the staff i had one nurs farme just yester go i you all my patien for the fame likeuhat does not mean all the same and in this case they all have covidnemonia there all proned there all in the venilater and there was the risk of of d personalizaion frar the patiente she thait getting to know their patience was a part of their job but they really got a lot offat iffaction out of but they did not wholly realize that until covi took it away this change throughout the hospital was biggest for the nurses therge the one to spend the most time with covid patients and our next troy is about the nursing staff and pod for the i see you and hemryfor is broken up into these pods pod four was one of the front line in the hospital's cova nineteen effort it was the very first pod designated as all coron of iris patients for the other i see you pods also became all coved all the time ban calhoun spent weeks talking to the nurses in pod for by mid april the nurses in pod for had adapted to the alternate universe of covid nineteen at least in certain ways what i mean take just the p p e that is the personal protective equipment they had to wear to go into covit rooms this was a high stakes thing at this point people had seen ten icy ustaff get covit two collegues were in ventilators one nurse had died some people got superstitious about ilways put on my gloves in this order ialways wear a scrub cap under the paper cab and then i will not get sick what i did not get about the p p e until talking to the nurses and pod for was the mundane relentless crazy making this of the very gear keeping them safe this arduous virtual of rubert glovs tie up gowns pe one hundred respirators that look gas mass clear plastic face shields it took five minutes to put it on to go into a room five to eight minutes to take it off when you come out you might have to do this as many as two dozen or more times every single shift how long it took to get into a room because of all the p p e is actually a good example of how covid changed what it was for people to do even just the basic and normal parts of their jobs avan gaffi is a nurs in pod for he says you have these ic u rooms with windows out on to the hallway all ship long you hear people banging on the the glass windows ecause they need be eunly wont into the room and they forgot ther supplies to to draw blood or they forgot one medication that is a regular sound yes it is very irritating oh but we are all doing it to each other that there is a little bit of a boombooboom oh not again yet ye it was hard in the new world of coved to even communicate with these patients to explain where they were and what was happening and to reassure them and to connect with them in the way that they are used to the way ran otish toks about it were still puzzling out the ways to do that these patients many of them were sedated alone in a room with the nonstop sound of the ventilator which is loud it is ike a vac nurses had to shout through their peop one hundred mans which is a gas mans and a clear plastic face shield over the roar of the ventilator now its ireallyn you are speaking through your eyes is that is rearly all i can s anthony valary another nurse in pod for you got a speak through your eyes because they cannot see it or you just explain to thet that you are smiling yongly times i've said that i said im i'm saying good morning with a smile on my face raight out then april a month and a half into all of this the nurses from pod for seem people who were in the throws of a crisis but also people who are used to crices the first ime i tok to evan asked how he is holding out ah objed ye you n i wuld a good ability to cindo weave work at work non the second i leave i can kindogist na think about it but amfome ot good sara david is another nurse and pod for she would been hoping to take on extra shifts because her husband lost his job thanks to covid but you asked how sheis doing she is got the same kind of i see you nurse toughness which i torter grew up around my mind was in new natal i see you nurse she talks evan whe talks sara i cannot kind of what i i do an most of us do here in the i ho thing a hard but we ci what i kindofayif you put ta panton any do it you cannot complain about it that you canto make it worse than you did you ye gont do it wby may a month later things changee now it seems likely that pod for patiens who ad been stuck on life support for weeks most of them uld probably never recover evan was used to helping patients get better or giving them a dignified death now he felt he was seeing too many situations that were neither the nurses had not seen this coming sara davis told me she' braced herself for the surge but nobody in vision this part you you go to work because you on help people that we be patient any patient or why we go to work in the morning ne and when we cannot when we cannot how comebody or word to ina ol ben dam jut get through the day when a lot of that and that i do not want to to cum the wrong way but we know that they'r probabe nockon to make it out of there i are not ma o can i an i you ow i'm a not person optamitic by nature too and recently in i feel that and i feel i have changed i'd more i'm more of my husband in the rea li thing i and i'm not an it the now i feel we are ywe are kind of changing platit when i talke to evan guffy an may he tells me about what he struggling with the most that families are continuing to tell them to do everything they can to save patiencs which he gets but there is a patient who cone o typifies what he seeing the man several underlying healthy shoes who is been stuck on life support for weeks he is heavily sedated breathing to down his throat eventually the man's kidneys give out he is on constant dialysis his lungs also give out and even when they stop sedating him he remains unresponsive it is now what what are we you now what are we doing here we are just tcontinuing to you now' make these people suffer in a way it is tolk to see those people suffering every day hooked up to all of these different lines and toos and there esensually on responsive yand we know if we were to cut a couple of the interventions off they would pass away very quickly n ums i think i cause a lot of frustration with the nursing staff you nowt cas we we feel in we are prolonging be inevitable some of the frust cration o proto yesterday om yan we wont of or nurs s talking with their positions about ligell when when is enough one or we done evan means that the caring thing would be to let them die i do not know maam iar no but fond lie thatery one oy rom when i culd tell from the rounding there just really firsti it biculi er for fwe to in mac e since oron the same time ren odd is checked in with errand dix evanan saris baus they were standing outside the nurses break room talking about exactly but evan was sayin they feel i vrery mean ro a yet e ther preventing te atitable and every one we do is not do anything we know in no us i mo right n h we all they a et all yelie yet yet wlike there just kee ting somebody alfe when thereis nothing we det is change no o i i now completely understand lag wo noer know to talk about how podfour nurses are stuck in the worst positient in medicine the caught in the middle between patients who they worry or suffering were clearly dying and their families were holding out ho tut's not they on't understand it its abstruct no te wewould not believe any of us if we were it here ray no no it is oany you dont un less y te yeiday and an tay all yet al an letting it every day you anl undersaid that you you cannot have the feelings that thet we all have and its ut ive been wondering if thereis anything we should try to prepare to do differently may be o tor the next wa o it is an i hen oman b i know bi giv there are different time linds for these conversation by these conversations renamins conversatients with patient's families she wonders if doctors and nurses meed to change the language theire using with them takin when a patient is a getting better ye were tire a ot the the ther day thing of how we thining i teat of tang when ther han then on ti o tang you seen pogress to day maybe we say we seen a change to day you

nurses i talked to sara davis she had a day were too patients died and neither of them had family in the room with them the first was a man he was intibated he could not speak sara stood with the doctor and held an eye pad wrapped in a plastic bag an front of the face of this dying man as woman said good bye to him and you hearing that conversatiin with that women who wul talk ing to the patient who could not beak back to her om yo thang how much tit she wo can man mato wit e pleasure i have him i have him in her life an yo jo really jo how much tatn it hom in normal times sera would not even be witnessing this kinal private momet families would come into the room hdoctors ard nurses would leave an the second death is the same shift sara and others in pod four gathered outside the room of a man who was dying alone nd they prayed with the mans son he was on speakerphone o that an al that with hard probably less than an hour after that sara says the other patient the man with the ie pad a couple of family members were supposed to be there when he died but things went wrong the family told the hospital take his venilator too boud and will be there to say good bye at seven thirty not long before seven thirty sara was in the room he was extabated but then thes man starts dying much faster than normal and his family is not there yet o is waiting for them to come but why all om who wo i was waiting for them to come and i was making him comfortable and om an i fayed with him while he died but before his family came o and he anded a hatting right before his family came i cannot stress enough how different this is from sara's normal job being alone with the dying patient since covid it is common for nurses though in hospitals everywhere but this man sara stood by herself and held his hand and stroked his head she told thim he did a good job the she stared through the window hoping desperately that his family would appear and thend i came home and you would appreciate the te your cenan om i thought i wen o ay and i'd come home mi cip te normal weep are not i de pt in the room that that they were in and they both i were looking the we tinping out o kind

have been furload are coming back to work specialists who would been a signed to covit ice used go back to their normal jobs even the delly reopens some people tell renna that their surprised to find themselves feeling upset about other parts of the hospital going back to normal not because hof jealous but because it makes them feel this awful thing they would all gone through was being erased and for the staff of pod four with their sixteen ice u beds their still a hundred percent covid patients and the cove patients are going to keep coming ranatoc to meki about it a not tin rumy i thin fa no

hospital in this half we turn to the people that they try to save we have arrived at at two of our show at two stands good day and we fiund about the patient in this story from a recording made by a young doctor named stan winder who worked in the intents of carry unit during the second year of his training at henry ford studying his special tees in afrology and critical care he said that i he

along in the first say that i met her she was struggling to breathe rally struggling to breathe and you could tell that just by how fast she was breathing but she was in that same moment comfortable her fce was hotal comfort it was sort of ery to see how fast she was breathing forty to fifty times a minute that is very fast that is almost one breath a second for you to inhale and exhale that quicklythe takes a lot of work takes a lot of muscle movement to do that eventually some one will ti her out and then he will stop breathing before the patient ended up intibathed had ti have her call her husband on the fone we could have a conversation about what would happen not only to my pation but also her un born child that is an extreme conversation to have within five minutes of meeting a person and she was on the ventelater for seven days and ended up getting extabated on that sevent day and she did great fer a couple hours after she got extibated and then by noon everything went hay wire and she was adimat adimate that she would not she absoluly did not want the two backain and i spleaded with her because her heart rate was up she was she was breating fast i thought she was gen a

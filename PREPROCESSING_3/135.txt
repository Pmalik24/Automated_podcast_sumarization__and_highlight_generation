american craticardett it is a stunning one trillean dollars has one o the bid on white houses favorite companies goes belly up carrylike once to run for senat again and ohiovotes blue on a big republican at proposal i'm beenchper this is the bench barro sho the day showsponsof expresve pians you a web histry being seen and sold to advertisers now meaneither get ex fressly pian right out expressle pianti com flesh men well folks bidanomics is a giant fail ind we are seeing the wages of by nomics happening right now here is the thing bidonomics which is basically the idea that if we sink extraordinary amounts of tax pair dollars into jobidon's favorite companies or if weblow out cash spending on a wide variety of causes that help jobdons favored political friends thet if we do all of that that somehow jogs economic growth and leads to economic dur ability it is a ly it is always been ali but here is the ting it is very difficult to explain to people why it is ali because capitalism is much more subtle and interesting conversation then is corporatism corporatism has always been in very easy sell corporatism is basically te idea is started by musullinian the early twentieth century that if you work handing glove government and business together and then you directs those business is in a particular way this will lead to economic prosperity because it cuts out all of the evils of competition and we all work together instead of working against one another in in fact the idea of the corporation as sort of a corporate body again goes back to early twentieth century philosophy particularly prominent in fashious circles fasioust economics looks very much what much of the west pursues in terms of a mixed economy right now meaning government subsidization of particular business got a government telling business what to do and business just going and doing it an an what that actually results in is scertain levels of economic stagnation because it cuts out inovation when you are subsidizing certain businesses at the cost ofother business is then what you are actually doing is youare twisting the incensive structure in extraordinary ways adwhen you hear people in the united states where varynestalgict for the nineteen fifties that whik cannot whik can we ave an economy i nineteen fifties where the government was heavily subsidizing particular businessis where unions were really really strong the quick answer to that question as we cannot have the nineteen fifties unless you wish to destroy literally all of the western economies on plan and earth except for the united states the reason the nineteen fifties were boom time in th united states is because every single export market for the united states was completely destroyed destroyed tha we had to spend billions of dollars giving those countries money thay could buy our product that is what the marshal plan was if you do not wish to devastate the entire worl the conomy and then have the united states be the last one standings that we can you will pay the unions off for manufacturing product the could easily do elsewhere well then it is could not be kind of hard to square that circle but jobidons cuorn'tqut industrial policy his entire redistributionist policy it has real costs and weve been living with these policies for quite a while now and they are not going particularly well we are looking at slowing rates of growth across the west as governments decide to move away from where free market oriented economics and more toward again in this corporatos model the reason i'm ranting about the corporatous model right now is bese i do not thing it is only aby nomics problem i'm also seeing it happen on the right i think there is a par t of the right it does not understand hawfree markets work and why they are good there are couple of reasons why fremarkets are particulally good one you as an individual human being have a right to your property this is the basis a basically all inovation in economic growth it also happens to be moral if you put work into property you own that property it does not belong to other people if you then wish to live in a community where you share that property that is your problem and you can do that and in fact that is what religious communities over time have done as i've said before i give a lot of charity to my local sintegog my mincal cynegog distributes that charity among a whide vriety of cause i hep oup friends i give them jobs ar the is all stuff that people trititionally have done but that does not make my property not my own property freely alienatable and freely keepable ry all of that is very good geston a moral level but the other thing that capitalism does that no other system does is i creates positive extranalities capitalism ends with creating innovation now looks wasteful capitalism because look atall tese people whorin competitionment why can' there just be one pype of chump lon the sholfret this burneyg sanders is reaching why do we have all of these different champoo companies making tons of different hipes i will mein what whut of chumplo for the scrirgihaw what the reason is because the competition makes the price lower it makes a better for the consumer choice is good for the consumer competition is good for the consumer and the samething is trewn the stock market when people look the stock market and they see it as a speculative enterprise the stock market is not about the speculation is notabout some dued getting rich day trading the truth is you are not cin to get rich day trading the number of people whave gotten truly wealthy day trading is very very very low that is not how good investors invas the way the god investors invest is they find what they believes in undervalued property and then they buy it and ten they hold it this s worn buffets intire strategy worn buffet is a student of benjmin graham and theyve dod and his basic strategy is i find an under value to asset where i the business and then that own ashare of the business and then the business grows that is why worn buffet is successful because very discipline investor he does not speculate in the stock market infect he does the reverse of speculation he investigates the business is that he is looking at in than he invests in those businesses when you see the stock market as a speculative gamble it becomes the speculative gamble for you but that is not what the stock mrket is meant to do in that is not actually what the stock market does what the stock market does is it creates giant pools of laquidity those giant pools of laquidity make it possible for new business is to get off the ground some of those businessis will fail but many of those business is we will succeed it allows innovation to happen and that innovation creates profit markhi in that profit margin allows more innovation to happen this is why the sort of socialistic idea thavt profit is bad is really stupid profit is the incentive structure that actually alows people to create new and inovative products and wen you take money out of those markets out ofthe stock market for example if yofre the government e's just stuck money ins the government maw and hen you blow it out on your favored progects or if you are a a sort of right wing industrialist proto industrialist policy guy and you think what if i stuck money out of the markets and then we just blow it out on a manufacturing centere in ohio you are doing the same thing you are taking the money from where it is most efficient and where it is most likely to generate better products better innovation and more economic growth andyouare taking it puttng in a place bher tat is less likely to happen naw can pretend that that is good for the economy as a whole it is not it is good for your friends youre say as good fair friend's fine that is at least a fair argument i'm taking money from bobnam giving it to steve bes i steven i do not care about bob thet itleast a fair argument butbut but to pretend that leads to over all economic growth is alive an that sort of policy under girds bydonomics and it is leading to terrible the facts for the american worker for the american consumer for every one because here is the thing when we talk lit the wages of the nineteen fifties we bout bringing back the nineteen fiftys economically speaking you would not want to live in the nineteen fiftyes economically speaking you would not can you went have a selphone we would not have a really nice car the carser nineteen fifty were not nearly as nicens froms of the features and things they have as the cars to day your fridge woed be broken half the time you probably would not have air conditioning by statistics an nineteen fifty no one wants to live in nineteen fifty wheneverybody hav has economic and a stalga just remind them that right now you liv in a magical timewhere you take your selfhon which they magical device thet connects to a cloud in the sky y suppose a a magical cloud and then that magical clod alows you to buy any product on earth source from tend to from countries and arrives at your doorn to days cat anybody in all ofyoumen history look to that in they think the're living in some sort of magical universe and you are sitting here big i wish ot ver the nineteen fifties again in industrial policy it is ridiculous hit we will get to why this is actually failing in one second because jobine's economy is about to start sliding introcession i know the everys happy talking this thing all we escaped proscessions wo first of all let me point out stagnation was allwas coming i've ben taying for two years now than inflation was not the long from threat to the united states stagnation was long from threats of te united states jobine when yeu came into office wa's promising that fr a tectate we would not grow and above a two per cente te pe clip that is not enough to keep up withthe kind of debts that we have ben assuming as a nation stagnation is the problem an stagnation s created when you remove the innovate of sector of the economy and instead you toss it at your friends in steady tossit o your political supporters it is tre on every side of te ile tfree economics creetes better products cheaper products it creates better joubs creating those cheaper and better products can you work abut our job than your grand po ded yourn menistolger for the nineteen fifties remember or your grandpo was sitting on a line somewhere riveting for ten ours a day s that is on amazing your sitig in an air conditioned office and wining about hor your getting siatica from typing which one of those jobs is better here there is no question about this wll get to more on this in just one second first let us talk about the economy as we have been saying jobine's economy not fantastic plus is economic policy also less than fantastic this is why i'm diversified leat little bit into precious metal since the turn of the century the world's dollars supply grew three hundred forty for per cent each dollars purchasing power has declined forty four per cents leaders around the world our questioning the value of ownig an ascet with un limited supply in a steadily toe clining value which is wi many people are looking indiversifying into goll that in cludes by the ay te brick cnations brazil russia india china and south africa they'e looking into new international super currency fully back by golds or other commodities which drive the price of gold up this part of their long trm plants supplant

becomes reality me very nice have some golds rely upon again tex ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to get started o case o what is the fall out from this kind of policy this condum in dustrial policy wre spend rules in rules of money on un productive companies that could not survive in the private markets well the fall out is that places go bankrupt the fall out is in flationary policy in which you hollicop for money all over the place ndthen your shocks when al the prices go up for example if you look at jobidons total in flatian rates inc he became precidents of the united states the total in flation ra lice when you when you actually add all that up consumer prices since jobidon took office are up sixteen per cent that is eight huge number that is a really really big number how about real wages real wages since jobidon took office are down three poin five per cent is that means that your wages went down through pon fie per cent and your prices went up fifteen per cent which means thaeyou nohve a delta off twenty per cent that that is a real problem for the vastmen jority of american consumers why wol becaue when you hellicops for money all over the place it gives youple the impression they have more money then they goin they spend the money and then they spend the money in the prices go up well right now the fall out from this is going to be eventually the party comes to an end and somebody is left without a chair and some of those places are going to be companies that should neverhave had money in the first place one of jobidon's favorite companies whys a a company called protera a protera is an electric vehicult parts supplier tand you'rby nectray spoke about protera and the magic of it in twenty twhenty one here is jobidon in twenty twhen one talking bout the magic ol protera rigt nowe ron away behind chida i you girs are geing us in the ga you gars are geing thi in te gan an make a lot of difference werei ated up allefuiture i thank if you ke we carni r de on when you start mankin a thousand busses year wenna n at e mor room fyour customers ac her tur o the electric busses naws we know commla heris lovs electric busses is one of the reasons why the government decided to get behind protera back in two thousands whenty one heres commall heris yesterday praising the magic of the electric busses wwhere they need i i'm there is only one problem yesterday electric vehical parts of latter protera according it two roiters filed for chapter eleven bankruptsy then get the latest company to go belly up an an industry grappling with supply chankcon straints slowing demand and a funding drought werth that huntingdrou coming from it turns outh wen you get addicted to government cash eventually the heroine supply stops coming the

in january twenty twenty one protera was valued at one point six billion dollars including debt in emmerge or deal ith a blank check frorm and it was jobidon who is touting this this firm now the difference between the government subsidizing a firm and you subcdans it and you subcidizing a firm i've made investments that gone bust and i lose the money when the government makes the investment and then goes bust you also lose the money that is the way that it works and that that is why thse sort of industrial policies are ei fail meanwhile the bidon nomic team they keep out going out there in proclaiming that everything is going swimmingly when we all know it is not here is commella herris lyine yesterday sing that wages are up an inflation is down well that all depends on you'r starting point if you start from last month then that is true if you tart from when jobidon became president it is wildly false again in flation is up almost sixteen per cent from one chobidon took office if you arelooking in to the price rate anvereling at wage rates the're nown four percent during that same period in real wages i love these sorts of talking points in flation has fallen twelve months in ero i'l kat which it which us sort of saying that you are doing better than you did over the yesterday and you are doing better yesterday thanyou did the day before and that is because twelve monhs go you are hit by eight truck right ever since then you'e be im proving rigt youre missing the pary git hit by the truck gay what would man amazing is if the inflacionray had not been a allivin per cent that ud n amazing and we brought it down month of by the way when you bring it down month over month that is still means that the inflation is continuing is just the rate is not changing in a positive direction that is you are filling the bathtub and the wateris still going up is just filling a little bit more slowly than it was a minute ago but if they lied you often enough they figured that maybe the will get away with it heu's again they can just point to it whenever you have a system ere can point at concentrated winners and dissiperat loosers it is much easier to pitch this is the beauty of industrial policy and corporatism you can point at individual companiesyou to ow this gi to winner and then you say what did you lose you lost a couple of bucks he he had a chance it whenning amazing the probm is when you have this many disperate post they start to ad up e're seeing that in spades right now for the american wage erner we are seen this for american business is and that the future of american growth is very very precarious right now ill get to more on that just one second first it is time for our meet ofit questions ponser by goodransers where we gets the meat of a hard hitting weekly question question is with all the recent investigations into both trump and bidon which a merican political family do you think is the most corrupt well i'mean this a long list of of corrupt political family you would have to put up thare the kennedies the kenny family ad some serious serious corruption issues going all way back to joseph also going ba c to yu no tentykennedy leaving a lady dead in in river you would have to look at theclin family both bill and hilery wildly corrupt selling pardons for cash andall the rest of it and of course the bidin family is extraordinarily corrupt as we have ben talking about at length well while some political families may attempt to disguises their form business dealings as completely innocent foreign meet can discguise itself as a product of the united states yes grocery soreshelves are riddle with meat from other countries disguised in a product of the u s label if you prefer to know without a shadow of a doubt where your meet comes from instead of guessing you need good ranchers they sorce one hundred prercent american meat they deliverit sur dor no disguise is no surprise is just american beef chicken and pork amazing meet conveniently deliveredwhen you ned it what exaclary waiting for at this point enjoyd that real met ind real service stday with good ranchers that is a goor ranchers dot com use my cood bend for thirty bouts off any box that is prommocood ben at good ranchers dot com good ranchers dicom is american meets delivered o ka the american consumer is is going to start feeling it pretty quickly now because the money is running out and can see it it is starting actually forget about the consumer look in to businesses and i point it out that there is in fact a different measure of economic growth different then g d p and that measure of economic growth does not look just at consumer and product spending which is how keensians would look at it this is why they always believe that goverment spending is going to juig chety pe becaus government spending goes into consumer growth if if the oernment spends lot of money on a product thn this is called economic growth that is really not the way that it sould work but thereis a better measure called gross output that we have ben talking about gross output is how businesses are investing and how business is are spending and what you see is that gross output remains ready precarios right now it is not look in fantastic because businesses are pulling back your singls in pretty much every area of american life right now for example according tothe walster journal new lending by mortgage reats as now dried up if youare worried about comercial real estate takint ive you should be worried blackstone mortgage trusting cak cay our real state finance trust two of the biggest mortgage real state in vestmen trust have now halted loans to any new borrowers hay that is a serious problem that

that is what bankrupt did silican valley bank there sme other banks that have similar math we are looking right now at persistent high in flation in europe tight financial conditions in asia a slower

creticards rising ballances may present challenges for some borrowers the resumption of student loane payments this fall may add edditional financial strand from any student loan borrowers accoring to

when those balle out stop which eventually they will then people are going to be in really hard situation that is when the will get more calls for more overnment spending more government regulation this the beauty being of corporat has to when your policies failyou just call for more cowbell you'se blam capitalism and suggest tha it was capitalisms fault that all the stuff happen when it was not

corpora policies are also starting to dry up those are the preserve of the privilege in the same way tha environmentalisem is to preserve of the lobal privilege the only people who care about the environment are people who can afford o to to do th're not people whare living in africa whor burning dung for fuel and tryingto make sure that ther their one your old stays alive it it is much rich people living in the west were deeply worrid about the polar bears and the arctic ice caps well the same thing happens with regard to the economy we have loose money policies bad companies get money and bad corporopolicies get promulgated whell nat ye can see again this actually it is a good sign for the future of corpod a merica but it is also signe of an economic down turn that all these corporate firms are now getting rid of the stian and d i s g nd d e i ar just drags on the profitability of these corporations and corporations were able to do that and the 're able to virtue signal with their money and with the stock market they are able that hey're able to do that long as the money was still flowing when money stops lung the first thing to go is alve the virtue signaling which is why the walster journal is reporting to day that conservative legal active s have successfully challege the use of affirmative action by universities now the're going after diversity initiatives widely teployed across american corporations some companies are already re considering their efforts in lawsuits sharehold to letters ampetitions to the e e o c active ies are using some of the same tactics that progressive groups have uws to advance diversity equity inclusion or d i programs there arguing companes are biolating rules against race and sex discrimination including those drawn from

offering special benef t's to black or lituno owned delivery service contractors starbucks is being sued as well and as you r seeing essent p is now dropping yst sores from det ratings which is exactly as it shouldhave been in the first place but when the money was free and loose you could be just as left as you wanted to be it' when the money starts to get tight that everybody turns into a conservative again according to the the financial times tessenp globall has now stopped handing out scores to corpora barwors on yst criteria the det wrating agency has since twenty twenty one publish scores from one to five for company's exposure to ech elements of environmental social and governant' risks payment's company visa for example had received two for e and ss and a three for g first

comprise analysis of a companyes yestru matters the rating agency said what we have determined the dedicated and litical marative paragraphs and our credit rating reports are most effective that providing detail and transparency on yestyou credit factors material toorrating analysis they are going to continue doing the aratin an alcaspout the not can given to number which means affectively speaking it is noc kon a matter any more moodyes is still rating yestyu criteria in a one to five scale why is this happening whell supposedly its because of evil republican pressures oncofvevil republican pressur it is because corporations ore saying well ou nought i do not need nor to be profitable you are yst garbage in a fact investors are looking an the're going om i just want to in fast in the company that is going to make me money in the company that is profitable and run well and what i do not careabout whether they are showing tiversity h arvidios to their emploividio it is their employs i do not care about that that makes no difference to me does the company earn or does the company not earn does a provide a good prodctor service or does it not essen pe is walking the stuff back and yen tht's the first indicator that we are about to go in to a fairly serious recession because again when you look at the stuff that just you in your household all your frivolous spending when it is an economic downiwas n we lose a job the first thing to go is your ight out af the moviesan and yourestauruntrips well when it comes to corporat america the first thing to go as ys g and d e i when the cutt'scom corporat earnings are down that means the economy is going to drop he just get ready for it and well jobidon is happy talking this thing you'ld be important to up to start protecting yourself but wut with all of that said republicans would be poise to take advantage of this if they new haw to speak in fre market terms o republicans have left that far behind andther's a serious problem in the effort to win over people in middle america the called rusbelt the the suggestion has been made that those people are desperate for manufacturing policy tha quoncl reshores jobs and all that is is nice sounding stuff that effectively means subsidzation for som at the expense of others that is not actually by the way why republicans are winning an ohio an indiana the reason republicans are ein ohio indiana iwa ol these midwestern rusbelt states there is very little to do with manufacturing policy cans guess what most those jobs in come back they 'll e shift it over i pitsburg used to be a steel t own and now pitsburg is actually a health carrytown job's change o does not mean people do not get lost in the shuffle which is horrible lifft if i'nd better ways to transition them to new careers but's find better opportunities for them but the idea tha your bringing back the entire manufacturing base of the united states is something that both the republican party andemocratic party keep sayng and is not going to happen in large sloss the manufacturing economy in the same way that agriculture used to be a main stay of the american economy an now agriculture is worked by a tiny fraction of the work forse in the united statesyou do not heare people samng whle whut all those farmers who lost jobs we need to find ways for them to go back to farming and that that is hrs not something people say any more and the reason for that is economies become more inovateve they become more efficient the actual reason by theway the republicans are winning in red states has much more to do with the bizar cultural policies practice by left cot ouleft coast elets than has to do with industrial policy in the midwest as the republican party embraces the idea that entitlement programs should never be mess with hat we should continue spending just democrats do only on different people it is a race to the bottom of that point it really is it be nice if somebody in american politics hat the actual ballst to talk about the beauties of the free market which is what has made america vemost prosperous country inworlds history bar non without a doubt instadwhirch s can a blow out our debt and weld continue ignoring all the systomac proms of the economy until wehitdecliff at which point we hittocliff and then because a merica as perceived is capitalist but actually is corporatist at that point they blame the free markets and the calfomore government interventionism and it is spiral to the bottom if that sounds cond of darkets because it is atagain would be really nice if somebody in political power had the capacity to speak clearly and cogently about the economy but om that is likely now organ toget instead it is going to be a race of personalidies speaking of which apparently carry lake is now preparing another president another senate run sheur ran for governor she lost to a wet rag in caty hobs in arizona everybody thought carrylake was going to win that race if thutchers in a win that race bisagain caty hobs is a terrible candidate a truly awful candidate carrylike somehow found a way to lose the race by essentially saying to a bunch of peoplein themiddle i do not want you to vote for mam an she actually said that prety much now she has declared that she one and if this is the republican plan for victor agot usi it is really stupid declaring tht ou want a game that you lost does not make you the winner of that game nored should it make you the favorite for the next game there is no game of which i am aware that you claming victory makes you the victor in the game if you just declare that you want a baskeball game after you clearly lost a baskeboll game does that now make you a winner who moves on to the next round and yet this seems to be denial is notcusta river in egypt tdenial is apparently now a republican electoral strategy if you pretend that you did not lose an election andthenyou say bunch o stuff about it tat is unverifiable then we give you the benefit of the dout because we hate the left much that we have decided that everythng they say is a lie up to an including election results that is not a good way to win a realect effort the arizona republican party is destroying itself right now and it is a disaster area for the rpublican party nationally because if republicans lose arizona which state to the make up in a presinential re member and told about five years ago arizona was entirely red if you go back two thousan and sixteen the senators from arizona were john mac cane and jeff lake it was two republicans and dug ducee was hee the republican governor of arizona and now there is a democratic senator there two democratic senators and democract govrnor in arizona is the arizon republican party shifting back toward the sort of mavric state statustatasho lass it to win in the state nope apparently carry lake is not only running in the senete race sheis now the fareign away favorite in the primary race there which i got a say is just wild it is wild especially because this is a supervulnerable seat for democrats cirston cinima the curince independent senator in arizona she is running against rubin gayago rumingayego right now is drawing ap hlorality of the vote senima is drawing some of the republican vote and well if you had a strong republican candidat who say did not alienate in dependence maybe fewer of those independence would go over to cirstin sinima right now cristentin mas when ng leke thirty seven and thirty ight per centovote gayego is it forty something and carry lake if sure in that race is in the twenties ay that are not gon to do it and yet republicans in arizona seem obsesed wit the idea that if they just keep relitigatting twenty twenty and twenty twenty two and presumbly twenty twenty four for he rest of time at this will be an electoral strategy that leads to egestdo not understand how the zever worke name a situation in your life where looking back on a thing and just nowing on it over and over and over has made your life better name name literally one situation in your own life or something is gone wrong for you and on it just sit there and youin just obsess about it endlessly and this is now made your life better going forward and yet theies what republican party seems to be doing not only over twenty twenty but over over twenty twenty two is well now according to acio suptential threeway battle with crit with ckirston sinima runin as inndependent exposes deep divisions in both parties on whether to appeal to their basis or independence lake still is not concedo gubernatorial lost in twenty twenty two the race offers a state leblic speriments on the implications f a possible threeway presidential contest to ca cinima is playing these sort of no labels candidate right now if lake wins jo pece primary next august she will likely face down gayego and cinima in the general election zinma has not officially announced wheather she will seec re election but she has a bunch of cash onhand again republicans cannot afford loose arizon it is the simple maybe it feels good to sort of ste in these issues but i'm just wondering again whether it is beter to stewin them or it is better to win yourepublicans could do the same thing in georgia i notice that for example bryan kemp one going away as governor of georgia one going away even as republicans stewed over twenty twenty in georgia brynkhamp one running away in georgia over stacy abrams who is the scourge of georgia in twenty twenty supposedly here your choices you caneither it there and can naw on the past or you can win those that tere's no third choice here which is whyagan if dom trump is the nominy he is gon a need to not relid gate twenty twenty as his key motivation to victory that that is not going to motivade in dependence just not no one wants to relitigate that other than te re publican base and it may feel good and you may believe youre right and mayb you all right o kape i onling the poof is there ounting the evidence is there that voots were tallied in the middle of the night false votes were bosto into fultin county by the box and then lodin to machines i think thevidence does not exist for that but let us even say yofre right question if you just say that over anover dos that make donald trum president be cause what carrylake is doing on a states on a state level is what donald trump is doing on a national level and the thing is donald trum if he is the nominat he could read apploy and go against bidon he does have that capacity but he is gin a need the insense of structure to do that thatn sens of structure is gon to com from the re publican bates not from the media who wish to wit they the medial want nothing bot donald trump relitigating twenty twenty for twenty twenty for that is their favorite thing it means that dotinald trump does not become president of the united states

when it comes to donald trumps race he can egen run one of two races one of them he could win one of them he is almost sure to lose the one that he can win is th one where everyone just highlights jobidon's failures been talking about it in cessantly tobitn is a failed president he is a terrible president there 's not a thing that he has touch that is not turned to garbat well hureis donald trump on that topic yesterday and this is totally fine stuff everyone can see to stunin contrast between our incredible success in jo by surreniris fail years than that is one reason why were leading sobe an the well that is really there iason i think it is ey more enthusiasm now then twenty sixteen or twenty twent because you have s ede how in competent these people ar it is it is horrible i gateso all that is fine tif however donal trump runs on the basis of his legal casis it is not likely to go amazing s yesterday he said i'm not nioa there is reason o not ni what iscaus my legal cases how can my corrupt political upon true cu jo bin put me on trial doing an election campaign that i'm winning by a lot but forsing me nevertheless spend time and money away from the campaign tr e ode to fi bo is made up accusdationson tais o to to i'psar i will not be able to go to i wen o day i will not be able to goe hamputo day because i'm sitting in a court room on both because cha get again i agree with him on a lot of the stuff but i's that con al went to presidential election with independents is that can be the line if line is jobine's terible president he can win if the line is i cannot campaign today beause i'm in court that is not a winning line and no matter how much republicans can have to get out o theironheads they really are and this is trun nearly every issue republicans oure inside or it be agan i get the lack of credtability of the left i also think they lie frequently near incessantly i also thing that they say things that are not true that they twist the narrative that they do things that are truly bad i agree with all of that it also does not mean that if we are constantly looking in the mirror and just seeing what we want o see the weare gan come away with an accurae reflection of what politics in america looks i'll giveig another examples last night there is a special election in ohio tit was a special election on it what they alled issue one on the ohio ballat this election wasabut whether to change the ohiostate constitution to make it s that amendments basically required a super majority in order to be passed soif you wanta change the ohoustat constitution right nineuty jus the shur majority but instead of that they wan to make it a super majority this is what was up for debate however this tdebate actually was not about the constitutional amendment it was about the ohio re publican party doing that and the left saying what they actionally our tempting to do it is pre vent you from inshrining rovers is waighed in the ohiostate constitution but they really want to to hi ban abortion in state law and they make it impossible frust to overturn becusethe have change the rules of the constitutional amendment s that iswhat was on the ballat last night and here is how the associateod press described the result first of all the ohio resolution to essentially it is stabilized the ohio state constution at went down to flaming to feet fifty seven to fority three here is how the eih p described to quote ohio voters on tuesday wresounding the rejected republican backmeasure that ouldhav made it more difficult to change the states constitution seting up a fall campaign that ill become the nations latest rough rund ham on abortion rites since theu us supreme quort overturned at national ly protections last year that a feet of issue one keeps in place a simple majority threshold for passing future constitutional amendment rather than the sixty percen super majority that was proposed it is supporters said the hirerbar would protect the states foundational document from outside interest groups fotter opposition to the proposal was widespread even spreading intetraditionally republican territory in fact and early returns support for the easure fell far short of donl trumps per formance during the twenty twenty election in nearly every county sasjas shaw points out over at hot air the were ta bortion peared nowhere in the tect of issue one tores a proposal to raise the bar forom mending the state constitution to sixty per cent support rather than simple majority that is arity in place in a lot of other states however however it was red by the voters as an attempt to basic le protect pro life positions he says even a quick glands of the national poles will tell the same story about state oplayine american politic to day youbidn is among the least popular president in modern american history resons investigations hav made it increasingly clear heis almost certainly among the most corrupt nobody approves of him but yesterday's results in ohioor all the roof you need such results is not going to happen a giant romp over jobidon and the bine could sti hold on tothe white house that is be cus if we allow democrats to make nextyurs election all about abortion theire voters that a number of moderates an intopedens will ig nore massive failures than the deplorable state of their country hold their noses and votes keep the geo peout opower any cost there is no more prolife person in america than i am iam fully pro life all the way back to point of conception no exceptions for rape or incest ow i'm is pro life as it is possible to be also politics exists republicans sang over and over to themselves thetf we take to hardest prolife position hat every state in union that will lead to electoral victory is dumb it is not correct you are going to have to gradually convinced the american people of the ratness of your positions because if you do not the back lashes going o come strong from the othr side your seing this s in state election affor sate elections whish hapening kansas for example where in overwhelmingly republican population voted two actually enshrine of bortion in cansas constitutional law if republicans feel they are the only voters in the room if they feel they vote on the basis of carry leke's race in twenty twenty whyr they vote on the basis of don from being victimized by law inforcemen or they vote for their nominese on the basis of who takes the most prolife position and promises thare gn a ramic down in law even without any political support for that position they are going to lose ca gravity does exist the left has been assuming wat the aconome gravity does not exist and left for a long time with regard to things crime assumed the gravity did not exist gravity continues to exist in the political realm reality continues to exist in the political realm now i'll be honest of yun i'll tell you where people are straying from their central principles it is one hundred precent true that if you goe for a ten wek abortion band that is not i full abortion ban nor t is remotely sufficient to protect yuman life it is also true if that is the best youan get that maybe bes youcan get thn they are lot of people who make a great living telling you thatif you do not go for broke all the time every time they are neverganaget anywhere andi's precisely the opposite if you go for broke every time all the time you are going to lose from here till the end of time he is going for broke every often may result the victory but the other ninety eight per cent of the time it results in laws and that of the nine get precent time at matters in awful lot more youre really does victories are one in crementally the pro life movement defeated roverses waight over the course of fifty years o building up an entire legal movement specifically dedicated to interpreting the constitution as originally i intended they took fifty years of incremental movement do you think that to morrow if we jus scholfor broke that matually the country is c in a snap in to a place of virtue i do not i thing it is a long hard slog aving to long hard procets of convincing people and working with people and yes taking in cremental gains and recognizing the gains for what they are while also recognizing what they are not that is what political honesty would look but very few people on either side of the political ile actually do political honesty these days instead their business is telling you about how pure they are on every form and and they do not worry about winning instead what they worry about is can they long foot the other guy and make it look as though he is actually pucilanimis on an issue when what he is really saying is the only way to i greeve the on misione the only way to get to the poin where you win is by pursuing these very practical steps ore alternaively can shout at the win and any can loose thay its it maybe it feels goodish out th win feeling good is not politics feeling good is not victory victory is victory and thre's no substitute for it i meanwhile speaking of left toing liars the advance placement board they that the college board theire just liars they lie on on the regular they lie routinely they lied about their a p african american history course in floridas suggesting that it was just it could not even be taught in flored becauseyou cannot such black history for its just crap it is not true at all will now the college board has announced that is going to pull its a p psychology class from florda chools is not florta banning the a p psychology class a flord did not do that it is the college board saying we cannot teach are a p psychology class in florida schools they say quot florida departmet of education has effectuavlly band a p psychology in the state by instructing florda superintendents that teaching foundational content on sectual orientation and gendera identity is e legal under state law ofm that is a lie there' that the florid departmet f educations has quote just one week before school starts the college board is attempting to four school districts to prevent students from taking the a p psychi course the other advance corse providers including th international bacaloria program hat no issue providing the college credi psychology course suit is the a p that is removing the course not florida florda did not a cannot teach a p a p said you cannot teach a p in florida why well a cording to the a p standards on psychology one of these standards is describe how sex and gender influence socialization and other aspects of development and also articulate the impact of social an cultural categories on self concept and relations with others now there is nothing there that says that you have to teach abounch of weird gendard theory garbage you could not why you coud just teach that sec of course impacts socialization because girls are girls and boys are boys and gender is deeply connected with saxyou could totally teach that in the contects of the a p psych course but what a p is saying is that we do not want you to teach that what we actually want t you to teach is this gender oriented nonsense and thus if you will not teach it will pull it as a colomnist for the federalis points out the college bor is equatting the women's placed on teaching these two skills with removing a cornerstone of the course this saying that neglecting to explain all the unconventional ways punctuation is used for itsorical purposes somehow makes the whole class illegitimate and the r eal reason for this is because the a p a theamerican psychological asociation which has always been is a deeply deeply partisan political organization groups that are arguing that a p cyk should actually incly more contents about gender and sexuality the a p a c o arthur evens has qut an advance placement course that ignors the decades of science studying sexual orientation in generitenentity wut deprive sdudents of knowledge they will meet to succeed in teir studies in histcal anbeons o first of all i giren to you h what their teaching a a p psych does not actually reflect ab the best science i promise you tbecaue the best science saze with regard to for example psexual orientation that there is no genetic marker for psexual orientation that is what the actual science has right now there 's no clear and convincing genetic marker for sexual orientation that is what a study of hundreds of thousands of human genums by the humangeuno project mount will that appeer in the a p cy course ive serious that is that will apear becaue it conflicts with their entire narrative howabout gender identity there is no none convincing science that thereis thi there is somethin wul a female brain in amale body that is a myth that is a nostic myth it does not exist in science becaus no one can actually label what a female brain looks in amale body because te brain is part of the body it is nonsense will they teach it anyway that is what they wantitege flora's just tang tht we cannot actually teach that stuff tand the a p sang whele you must teach that stuffso is that florda's falsers that the a pecefault again florida did notband the a p course a p band the a p course the stop blaming florida for actually making sure that it is kids are nots in doctrinate instead blame the a p for attempting to indoctrinate the kads ok a time for some thing s i and then some things that i hate things that i to day there is a a book that was enormous in the nineteen seventies scosen and the art of motor psycle mantenance it is written by a m a guy who used to be sort ain english composition professor and then got very into psychology whencsyounverseive chicago this book sold just millions and millions of copyies than in te art of motor pcycl mantenance it is one my dads of favorite books i first read ot when i was in myteens i re i reread it this week because he kept talking bout ous i a outr early remember it that well the book by robert parsic receives a hundred and twenty rejections before it was actually published it' initial sells ore least five million copies world wide at this point probably sold twice that it is the be which makes it by theway the single by selling psychology book probably in human history you have not hard of it because you din't grup in seventyes the book in the seventes was perceived as an attack on conservatism it is not is a deeply conservat a book basically what the book is than in the art of motor cycle mantenance is it is a story about the author and his son taking a motor psycl trip across the country and it is interspersed with his flash backs to his days in psychology because it turns out hat he hadnan actual psychological brag and whose hospitalize in giving electrotheropy and all of this and it is it is a it is a travel logu interspersed with philostophical musing is an investigations into what it was that made him go crazy about psychoabout philosophy in the first place well the book says lot of the same sort ofsuff it that gorn peterson says now a lot of the book is about the magic of fixing his motor cycle is ht youre nove to be by the way a motor cycle enthusiast atually enjoy the sort of stuff i'm not and again what i what i actually you enjoy is what he calls in te book qualityes the central idea of the book is that thereis the sing called quality what is i know hat it is andi's undefinable when you tryd to to find quality in any particular situation an of a very hard time categrizing quality but what it is rigt down in the cockles of your own heart that batoven is higher quality than cardybe everyone knows that and andy attempt you say that that is not true everyone knows is crap everybody knows that i's bull crap it is post modernis nonsense and he says is that this quality has been lost wise ave been lost and he he briaks it down into greeks into greek philosophy and he basically says and there is an attempt to separate off the true from the good and that was because if there is no wey to find the good then presumably truth could get lost b what pears suc says is we should stop running away from the undefine term stop pretending thatyou can define its from theyou cantifine quality or the good because that is the thing that shou drives human beings and you can pretend the ou can categrize at that can nail it down a butterfly on a piece paper but hoe cant actually do that what it is in your heart because that is the way that we intracts with the universe is through the prism of that good of that quality and it is not entirely quatquled subjective it is between you and the world that is why there is widespread agreement on what a mouncs to quality in a wide variety of areas a cross human life now what he does not he can hints at pbue what he does not actually say is that that good that quality is god right that that that system of values is in fact the ivine and that is how we intract of the world is through that prism that is what religion fills the gapuk ie comes very close to basically saying that inthe book we does not quite say that but the book is really i a much early aversion of make abed there is such a thing is a higher value and tht higher value is the thing that orients you that science is not that higher value co science has no value is because the empiricle cannot actually separae cannot bridge what they call the is ought gap from things around you in the universe in the physicall universe to what you ought to do nd what he says is that is an artificial gap in the first place because the way that you actually address the world is always going to be oriented through a particular perspective of quality ak you is a human being again appoint that my friend gorn peterson makes al the time ifyou is a human being when you take in your sense perceptions around the world you are discriminating among sense perceptions ou are not taking in every thing around you and n equal rat if you did you go crazy very very quickly which means thereis automatically in orientation process that his happening between you and the universe and that orientation process says peersig is quality and that bridget it puts back together the true and the good because it turns out that they are in fact in mashed with one another because you cannot actually see the true unless you acknowledge the good th the book is well work the read it is really can of riveting reading cycholo it philosophically speaking i highly recommend it robert persigs zan and the art of motorcycl maintenance ok a time for a thing that i hate i do not knwhat a pansexual is or howto first from a bisexual apparently a pansexual means that we ought a hi everybody hide the cookery apparently want a stup a pan or a pot or something that and i grab that spaxual and go at it wane brady has now come out as pansecual here is what that means says the washington post when you have to explain this than that means that it is nonsense term but apparently being a pansexual is now in identity i just bang and everything insight is now and is now an identity the host of the gameshow let us make a deal said he had suppresse his sexuality and felt worried about people finding out whill also feeling shame about not being honest about himself in an exclusive interview with people always by the way it demonstrates how much privacey you seek when you do an interview about who you want a bang with people it is always an astonishing thing to me puic i want my privacy give me my privacy my private life is my own i want a bang that one 's ay at o what that the first part that argument was a complete gap with the second part of that argument i oi notice you do not actually want your privacy what you actually want is all us to cheer and celebrate who you want to bang which is a weird thing for you to want us to cheer an celebrate considering it has no positive societal impact see here is the pantric thing about marriage for example there is betwen a man and a woman has positive societal extrnalityes the reason society celebrates a marriage between a man and woman is because it is made man a non ogressive creature whose a threats to others and domesticated him and it is taken woman and is put her together with man and now they will creat a family and a home and sholdrin and future generations all society shoul celebrate that but now becase we have completely separated sex from family everby just wonet people stand around a clap with the i to bang that furry ah amazing that is terrific for you ah and it is private it is also private i i noticed it is not you did me interview with people magazine which means that we get to mock yu for using the term pansexual pan sexual here is what you need you kow about brady fift you wantod pansec firs li did not eedet know anythin about at washington post iw's perfectly happy not knowing anything about it what you really mean is what wane brady neds us to know about who he wants to nail i am pansexual brady said bysexual with an open mine what is a bisexul with a clothes mine what is thatlok sure members both sexes and theonly two of them all that boght him also open minded brady added that pan means being able to be attracted to any one why dentifies as gay straight by transexual earnon binery being able o be attracted across what liman that does make his pool extremely large every human who walks the plan it s i guess congratulation to him on really expanding his dating possibilities brady spoke bout how he as felt to tracted to certain men but push that aside becase of how i was raised and meaus i live in to day's world and it scary as bleap bray said he was taught from young age caingson when gay was oa way to hurter amount us of this gon be all about how evil society is of course i' only i'm gay y but what if i feel something for another man that is still gay he said well i mean technically it is if you are a duded you wish to nail lother dudes i feel it got pretty gay that is not stereo typical that is definitional i was alredy bullyd rout a bunch rether bleep bi dn't on to add a tophad on top of that suit the single entertainer said that during his path of self discovery he realized you't always loved his daughter and his family but heeded to work harter on loving himself oh thisis always the basis of it love yourself love your's n younursel the bible says love thy neighbor as thyself right love thyself is a predicate to doing good in the world that is what it use to be now love thyself is in order to love every single thing about you requires no change no restriction on your activity embrace of everything you are or ever could be what does pansexual mean and here is the washington post effnishion ready people to find pan sexual in varying ways lug is were done here it could be anything in varying ways brady took pan to mean that not only can by i be attracted to any of these people are types physically i could be attracted to the person that is there i do not even know what that means that is a meaningless phrase not only could you be attracted to the type of person but any one you culd bet or i c jist cls of a bisexual man glad to find some one who is pansexual as a person who as the capacity to form enduring physical romantic and or emotional attractions to any person regardless of genera identity psycologist caroll queen which is a held the job tells teen vogue the greatest of our publication there is no exact definition for panseuality people who i dentify his pansexual might want to be ready to clarify their own specific take on this identity to people who are confused about its implication i love this i do not kno how to to find it people who say ther pansexual should b able to defind it what if you do not have any definition of this at all what what what how did brady's family reacts him coming outs as the washington post the first person bradie came out to as his ex wife mandy i just said great as i knew coming out would help him be happier she told people there twenty yoar old daughter mailey brad you respond with a shrug an an oka during theinterview with a proud smile ah proud proud why not i mean after all pans pots vere is kitchen implements spatualas grill cleaners all of it that is that is where we are because you have to love yourself already got the rest i shok continues ry nang nocon one

welcome to the huberman labpodtans t ga science science pace to s fr od i may inder huberman and ofm a professor of nerobiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine recently i had the pleasure of hosting two live events one in siattle washington in one in portland organ both entitled the brainbody contract where i discussed science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance my favorite part of each evening however was the question an answer period that followed the lecture i love the question answer period because it gives me an opportunity here directly from the audients sto what they want to know most and indeed to get into a bit of dialogue se really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms of particular tools how best to use the tools for things focus and sleep we also touch on somethings relayd to mental health and physical health it was a delight for me and i to think that the audience learned a lot i know that many f you were not able to attend those events but we want to make the information available to you what follows this is a recording of the question answer period from the lecture in siatl washington i hope you will find it to be both interesting and in formative i'd also to thank our sponsors of these live events the first is momentous supplements which is are partner with the huberman labpodcast providing supplements that are of the very high squality that shipunter national and that are arranged in dosages and single ingredient formulations that make it possible for you to develop the optimal supplement strategy for you and i' d also to think are other sponser which is inside tracter which provides blood tessandean ates you can moniter your immediate and long term health progress i'd also to announce that there are two new live events scheduld the first one is going to take place sunday october sixteenth at the will turn theatre in losangelists the other live event will take place wednesday november ninth at the beacon theatre in new york city take its to both of those events are now available on line at huberman labdoc calm slash toor that is huberman labdot calm slash tour i do hope tht you learn from an enjoy the recording of the question answer period that follows this and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science am what is urmost used proto cal massuming that you mean the pro to call the iuse the most i genuinely do the morning sunlig viewing in this evening i went tot the sunset every single evening and i absolutely do ten to thirty minutes of some non sleep deep rest pro to call every single tey every single day am the reason i calle it non sleep deep rest is because while i love the classic traditions of and things yoganetra on my fear was that if i call things yoganetra that people would get spoot am but i also have to say that i rather loath the fact that scientists use many a fanc y terms that it also vaults information from the very people that fund o the work i have a kind of axto grind with the scientific community to non sleep dee reast was my attempt o an put my arms around a number of different things yoganedra which i have great reverence for and other tools that i do that usually in the early afternoon or if i wake up first thing in the morning and i have not slept enough we are not that well i'll do thirty minutes of yoganedra and i feel terrific after that i'll just mention a brief anectote i am i learned about yoganedra while researching a book that i never am may are may not ever be publishd i would not spend a week in a am trama center in a diction treatment center in florida and saw some amazing work of some amazing people in some amazing transformations and it was a big part of their daily routine for these people to do am yoganedra and non sleep deep reast andi thought theyre really on to something here almost religiously for me everyday ten to thirty minutes not that it matters but the seao of gugles really int anesty are i do not know im am but there is he is witten about that a number of times in seattle sunrise varies from four thirty a m to ninam depending on season are you re commending to very yor wake up outside time with the seasons somewhat am you do not need to see the sun cross the horizon that would be great but not everyone can wake up with the sun a you want to get call low solar angle sunlight why cause of that yellow blue contrast that we talked about before many people wake up before the sun is out if that case if you want to be awake turn on as many bright lights as you can up here i do not das any one here you do not have to admit this if you do not want to but maybe nod o raise your hand if you'r comfortable me that in the winter you feel last well or typically in the transition but yats hudrup here it is really it is a mazing and then when you are on campis or that is whre ive some time you see rainy air and that is the blossoms are out an you feel almost ih because that is dopamen animals that have white pellege in the winter and then it turns dark in the summer in spring months that pathway the melon in pathway is from tiro scene which is the preaker sir to dopa men and also to melon an production in the fir the whole system is lenked it is not rigged it is length what do i suggest i suggest in the winter months getting thirty minutes of sunlight viewing i know it is a lot but it is a it is much better than feeling lousy all day and then the real key in the winter is to trying catch some sunlight before it goes down if you are in doors and it goes down and thyou go outside and it is dark you are brain an body do not really know where they are in time and then you flip on ozark and you are watching ozark and then you really do not know where you are in time i've one more episoe do not tell me what happen that show is when i was at postock i used to o recommend the wire to my competitors truge i go to sleep fired up ready nexcide to do whatever it takes when i wake up that drive is to pleaded why and what can i do interesting have not heard that one before but if i were to venture a guest it did not spend much time to night tiking bout the autonomic nervous system this kind of sea saw that takes us from very alert potentialy panic but to very very deep sleep even god forbid your going to a comats cause the pari sympathetic nervous system is over active relative to the sympathetic nervouses o sea sob autonomic function you may be sleeping very very deeply and when you are in deep deep rest the last thing you want to do is get into that forward center of mass thinking planning predicting right in again an yoganneter agan non sleepy pressers this common theme in the script of going from thinking and doing and predicting to being and feeling they say and ofn not making fun of them as moment i hear that go just going to be and feel what you doing your actualy just moving into sensation but no planning right there is nothing mysterious about it sensation but no planning now in sleep a very deeply para sympathetic sleep state what is happening you actually that visual aperture is actually big right you are not in panoramic vision your eyes are actually closed space and time are from past present end future are invited into your thinking you are in a deep deep state of relaxation and it may be dustin that when you are waking up you are having a hard time transitioning out that because you are sleeping deeply you may be waking up amid sleep cycle many people find it useful to set in alarms that they wake up at the end of a ninety minute called all tradian cycle there is some sleep aps that do this on the phone i cannot recall their names but rather than sleeping seven hours you might be better off sleeping six or seven and a half hours right waking up at the end of one of these ninety minute cycles try that that would be consistent with what we know about the biology but i think it is common to if you sleep very deeply to wake up and not necessarily want a spring out of bed i've heard of these people that is want a spring out of bed an attack the day jocka willing for thirty in the morning as cassiophone ave watch i'm seeing his watch when as ape for man ill again these people are amazing i must be doing something wrong but these are i do not wake up that way tigger i'm i want water i want sun light ninety minutes later i want kafine ndwhat are some on your favorite books that have had the biggest impact on you cilogy think you call u gosh many for non fiction well oliver saxes a autobiography on the move had a profound impact on me ou know people hated him the scientific community tried to kick him out they said horrible things about him created all sorts of scandals it was not intill awakenings became plock lester movy that suddenly he got appointments that and why you and columbia ah then now they wanted him back and the revered nerologist incredible right but he was also a real seeker and the cuttlefish thing and hhet a lot of internal struggles too some of which i relate to some of which i do not actually i've been in touch with his former partner begsit actually moved to topang a canyon for a short while just case oliver live there i thought if i go there i'll actually finish this book guess what just movingsome place does not lacking to finish your book he lived into pangass that is the key i did not work and people wondering why i was a hangin around their house all the time cause it was oliver's former home that is an amazing book and tells you my obsessive nature the other books that have had a profound influence on me i would say in the nonfiction realm well i learned how to make a decent stake and a few other simple recipes not well from tempharris's book the for oursheff cause i really needed help m that was a fun one i robert green's book mastery because i've had amazing mentors and that book is all about finding mentors and a signing mentoris to you even if you do not know them and as you can tell fom my stories about oliver who i never met and i and a few other folks that i've just decided that they do not know it but i menturing them at their mentering me excuse me that book was was really im portant for me and that a menter menti relationships always involve a break up either by death or by decision or by consequent your circumstance rather there is something happens and there supose to break you are not suppus to apprentice with somebody forever that was an interesting book for me i would say in that in the fiction realm i you say infiction realmets oll childhood books cause it is been a long time since i've read fiction i real lot of poetry ma big wendill berry fan i poetry because poetry to me is is the subconsciens it the structure is all messed up and you think you understand what they are talking about but yo do not really know and it always feels important and consequential even though it is your own interpretation and then i love the psychologists i love young i love erics an i love i love the psychologist and could read endlessly about the early days of attachment theory and things that because i find that stuff to be fascinating those books have been a lot offon and i love picture books with animals and if you can get a hold of jolsartories a instrogram account the photo arc he decided to take picture s of every animal on the planet specially the ones that are endangered is a amazing phrtographer am but his books are even better if you animal books what excites you most about the future research of mental health treatment particular anxiety and depression we michael thank you michael well there i think that we are in exciting time i i am i'll just reveal my biasis am iam quite pessimistic at the idea that we are ging to have better medication soon for most things what i do think we are starting to approach is a time in which we understand how broad categories of drugs impact broad categories of chemicals which kind ashift our mind in broad categories of directions what is all that mean i think we are starting to realize that because their different recepters for all these chemicals all over the brain and body that that side effect less drug is unlikely to exist for mental health but that the combination of maybe some pharmachology but especially behavioral tools people actually learning how to drive this thing that we call our nervous system is potentially helpful maybe very helpful now in cases schisaphrenia autism and i did not put those next to one another for any reason by the way o c d eating disorders and i'm very mindful the fact that you kow anterectse as the most letal of all the psychiatric disorders right amazing an sad fact i think for those conditions we are soon going to enter a time in which is going to be combination behavioral drug theraby and yesbrain machine in her face i do not mean putting chips down below the skull i think there is going to be and there are things happening now of people using devices virtual reality as well as transcranual magnetic stimulation placing a magnet on particular location the head combined with a particular maybe drug maybe psychodelics may be not to enhance plasticity i rge i a vote for psychodelics and i want to make a serious point about psychodelics five years ago when i well four years ago when i started doing a bit of public facingself i was absolutely terrified to say that word terrified i thought i'd lose my job i really did i thought donsa psychadelics and i'll be very honest at you no i for me i i think that om the clinical data on mdiamand on celisibe an are very interesting very interesting i do not think they are the first and only pass at rewiring the brain but it is clear that the brain can enter a state of heighten learning capacity but it needs to be directed toward something the goal of opening plastisity just it opens plasticity that is not the goal it is running the goal isnit running the goal is to run in a particular direction what i think i's really needed is to drive that plasticity in particular directions and i i would love to see more directed use of those in of course the safe clinical setting where it is appropriate and a guesse on the podcast matthew johnson who is at john's hopkins i asked him what is the deal with the microdosing and you knowat his answer was i was very surprised he said mackro dose and i thought oke i'm not a gui who you hav i'm not int i'm not i'm not a pushing this i'm not a proponi said you are kitting me why why why would you say this a runs and and i h funded lab at john's hopkins school of medicine a why and he said because the one sesstion with a trained professional that is triggering rewiring plastisity that is guided is as far as they know from the data can go back and listen to these are his words not mine but he is the expert in the saria are encouraging plasticity in a particular direction and he thinks that that is far more useful thend just kind of nudging the system a little bit without any particular goal or outcome very interesting and very surprising and again a trained academic at a one of the most illedenstitutions in the world i think we are in very exciting times for those am compounds and a the're there are studies tat stamphord and elsewhere on kedamy ane and other things but it is early days young people should be very cautious young young people and adult should be cautious specially people with preexisting psyciatric issues and people have a the pency for diction although some of those compounds are being used to treat a diction i'd be an idiot and i would be lying if i did not say that it is very exciting timefor psychodelictherapies where do you see the biggest area and i've done only one clinical trial true i was a i i took part in one clincol trasi do not speak from a lot of experience are just a little bit i was a subject in that trial where do you see the biggest area for performance in hancemen within the illedathletes and operators that already hit marks of proper sleep in nutrition a meg young thanksfor er question meg om ye i think that well first of ll very few of them hi marks for proper sleep but for those that do once you have your sleep diled in and you got your nutrition diled in and the modivational component is there i think where there is a lot of work still to be done and where people can really get outsized effects is in this weird little cavern of human existence that we call creativity and i did have time to talk about it to night but there is a very unique brainstate that we call creativity which is taking preexisting nurl maps and starting to combine them in unique ways to create new ways of performance performance can be visically sumrise in any domain a essentially for stages you 've unskilled skilled mastery which is when the brain can generate movements or cognive computations that create very predictable outcomes and then there is this fourth tear this fourth layer which is virtuosity and virtuosity by definition means inviting back in a component of uncertainty what this looks in terms of operators as this looks in terms of athletes or even we can say musitions or people who are in the cognito fields or poets or writers is what it means is introducing that uncertainty about what is can to happen next and the way to do that is to destablize the system in other words to create states of mind in which there literally sensory desruptions it is what i would to see is more training in a kind of a funhouse of mirrors type environment that is when you start to see incredible performances emerge and virtuoso is invite in uncertainty they actualle do not know what they are going to do next and this becomes a a bit of a vague concept and what i'm about to ten you next might seem a litle silly but one of the best ways to access creative states is to no surprise use your visual system to view things that are highly unstable and uncertain i do not just love fish tanks i love staring at vidios of acquariums in tokio and actually watching the fish because it is completely unpredictable there is some evidence that doing things that or people will say oh i was in the shower i took a walk in nature and then i had this idea act you do not think it was the walk or the shower it is that nature is filled with unpredictable visual stimule auditory stimule when you can predict what is going to happen next you have very little opportunity to uplevel your game to speak it is only by way of unpredictable sensory imput that you can do that if you are a coach or youre working with people who are very high level performers do you want them to stand on one leg and spin around and then do what ther not necessarily what you want to do as trying get them into brain states that are different thin the brain states that they arein when they normally enter their practice the limital state between sleep ind waking excuse me the limitl state between sleep in waking as a very powerful one for acess in creativity many people access ideas as their waking up in the morning they have creat insights other people while strolling in nature i do not think it is the strolling or the waking up i think it is the lack of as we call it top down regulation on rules you are able to access comminations of nurl maps that are unusual you can play with the sylobit a lot of people throughout history have used compounds drugs to do this my great writers would get drunk and then trying write or wake up and they w that yid the amount of self abuse that people including athletes and creators put themselves through to trying capture these windows of cognitive ability is pretty intense and i i do not think that is a good idea i think one should be an explorer and try and find these cognive states in ways that are non destructive starn is on my mother with all this he'l flips on lock no kickflips next question ta on there some scapewarders in the audience my first nonbiological family or there is some amazing scape worders in this honants and omnocan be th one doing a kiclip bangtime soon but they are great to have one of the reasons we built the podcast with the help of the great mike blay back is because a i learned a long time ago that if you want things done right and you want to do them outside the lane lines and you want to have control over how things come across you do escape warders cause oat did not come from a community where i did not have parents at my sports games and things that thanks to the scape warders in the misfits in th in the those folks you have any tips on how to improve memory yes a ronvred yes o gad this is a wild literature and i love it and it is changing the way that i do things i thought that to remember things you are soas to get really really excited really focus and remember them guess what that is not how you do it there is there are data and there are stories going back to midiaeval times that they used to teach kidsthings and then throw them in the river there is a beautiful annual review of nurol science written by the late james maga brilliant research or who taught me that in this review and it turns out that if you want to remember something you want to spike a drenaline after you acquired that information after that means the doublest presso and the ice bath after you study formath immediately after and you think about this that makes perfect sense right think about the wone trial learning that nobody wants to experience which h s a car accident or some tramatic thing you did not get the spike of a drenaline first you got the spike of a drenaline after again i discourage the us of excessive stimulants or anything that but if you are going to try in remember information you need to get your brain anbody into a high autonomic arausal state liter you need to deploy a drennaline into your system after you have made the attempt to learn some information much that if you give people a batableocker after learning a motional in formation they do not learn it as well incredible just incredible date inanimals anhumans is the the beautiful work of larry c hill tat you see ervine and james magal s that is how i would foks on remembering things better and it is also true that if you tell yourself that something is really important ou you will you will be able to learn at better if you meet people an the tell you their name and you forget two seconds later well you shripobe thinking an now i do this i meet people and i think oke would what terrible thing to this person do tos tryn spike my adrenalan or something that it is a terrible trick bi have not figured out a better way but that is actually one that data supported way to do that a easily a dozen or more studies inhumans on that very topic how do you manage social media diction paul ohe well we should be careful with the use of the word a diction because here i think it is entirely appropriate when youare engaging in a behaviour over and over and over again and you are thinking to yourself this is not even that interesting you are officially addicted that is the lipmas test for addiction not this feel good people tok bot the dopamine hits of social media those only come at the beginning but then when you find yourself scrolling what am i doing maybe it is that narrow visual aperture you are a hypnotized chicken but maybe also you are seeking more dopamine hits because guess what that dopamine wave pool is depleated iat least for that activity it is true that dopamean you have a base line and then you have peaks on on that ride on that base line i do think that we can have dopamine for one behaviour not for another but it is a it is a generalized phenomeno how do you manage it you have to stop seeking within social media and i've taken on the practice of turning off my fhone for a couple hours each day it is incredibly hard people get really upset to by the way it is havena notice these tethers that people expect ah we record to podcasts recently in it i i do not want to go into too much depth now about a tachment and grief and we all have a map now you n understand wit the maps are of space time and i dimension call closeness to everyone that we know space where they are time when they are dead alive whenill i see them again et cetera ind closeness and the phone has allowed us to tap in to space time and this closeness map which define all our attachments on a very regular basis you can understand why it is valuable to people yeuknow the plain lands an everyone is texin the plains a got everyones textings i where are you with the plains in the air there is the thing call flight track or no one cares about that anymore you want o heare from the person i do think that i use to do in every odd hour of the day my phone was off and half the relationships in my life dis appeared they could not talk they could not tolerate it i loved it but i loved them too i would say take brakes and i would say at least an hour and if you find yourself excited to get back on the phone that excitement that is the dope omin system syee can kind of learn where it is for you but if you find yourself scrolling mindlessly and it is not doing anything for you you are driving that wavepool down down down down down hopfully that an owgeyou will help t we are to call myself doctor he remann i in my business if you referre yourself in the third person it means your officially anarsas as i'm just going to start with were you nervous to night is what did you do to prepare bran i you saw my nervousness did not you now the i asked myself that question i'm i was excited and i think i'm good t line to myself an telling myself that autonomic arousal that might be nervousness is excitement but in in truth ah i was not i was was an am really excited to tell you all these stories and about biology i know this might sound a little bit of a line but ashy dont feel myself as a as i a person when i do the podcaster i do this stuff i took a walk before i got here and i have to be careful that only two topics that make me cry one as talking bout my bulldog the others talking about my graduate adviser iave to be very careful but i took a walk and i imagine that they were here and i know and i do not make me tr lex freedman made me tri on a pocass and it was a really unfair and he was digging and digging and ther yew people in the audience that no costello and it is ah and i just kept thinking myself before coming in here i i love them and miss them and i i'm costelle would be entirely bord with this hole thing i justtracted myself a bit and not nervous i do get nervous about things sure i'm human but when it comes to biology i think i still feel that lcater jiust wants to tell you all the stuff cannot help but is learning from failure equal to learning from success is one more efficient than the other rachel thanks for your question well on a tral by trial basis we know that when you fail at an attempt on the next attempt your forebrain is in a position to to engage better and this makes total sense right you feel that frustration you will not get the next one right well you are harboring or i should sa funnling more nurl resources you'r focuss that aperture titans now youhave to be mindful of that to because when you ha of a failure and then you'r you are going to hit the bulls i'm thing about a dartbork is 'm terrible at darts sober i'm terrible at darts i do not even drink that next trial but part of the promis is that focus can narrow much that you can start to lose access to information that might help you if you are just to relax a little bit in dilate that focus litle bit but in general on a trial by trial basis focus is the cue that your nervous system is going to be position to learn better on the next trial now in turms of life experiences gosh i i wish for everyone fewer failures and more successes but failures keep you humble and i've had a lot of em i mean if people ever wantit and they i'd be happy to tell you ii mn i'v made a tonomistakes in life i ton of mistake some of those were mistakes of persistence dum decisions i ge it is goin to change it is goin to change is clearly never getg to change and then some were failures of misjudgment about other people are situations and a lot of them were just plain failures the experiment an work were the they just was not the right thing and you trying to reframe those i do think that we owe it to ourselves and to the people that we know to try and generate some winds here and there and try and help other people generate wins m in running a lab over the years and i still do a you realize that you want your students to publish a paper and feel that success pretty early that they can experience eh how much work it is they pick problems wisely but be they can feel that i can do this and i think that am you kow this gets into the psychological as well i think that yes failures help but success is help and there i think you non't i function bess in a team and i think that for those of you that are feel your fighting some challenge alone i do think that thereare great resources to be had in tryin to access other other people as sources of support i i think that that is a great tool there is is whole literature scientifica lirture around social connection and how that can help us reframe motivation and goals anyway may that is a topic to to expand on another time but a failure is important on a trial trial by basis people who do not experience enough winds for a long period of time the brain is a prediction machine after all and they start to predict failure or takes a bit more work to wedge oneself out of that when yeou're ging to start training jugitzo lacs made me asked rymflorse look a heare's the story with that lec said do you want a tried jugitzu i said sure lec said o k it will be great to show people beginners mind said sure we went and did a ugitzu class he was very nice nice nice russian nice aa then he puts it on the inner net with me in a rear naked him putting me in a rear naked choke it was actually lacs freedom and choking out andrew huberman there i just talk abow myselfin a third person damn it am et it that one i have not had the time for jugitto i my ears the way they are have ever seen these people that du ju gitzu their ears literally look stumps no i i should do it it it looks a great sport and unlike the other sports i've been involved in mind my life boxing please do not do it it is not healthy scake boarding all is you you do not really damage your head doing jugitzu no i mon to get you back for that lonelax hok ah can you go through ho wow a john edward there is a joke that my friends used to tell about the supplements i take us to say a some would say what supplements you take and they would just go all of them i do not take all of them but i have been very systematic for about thirty years i've been interested in compounds that change the nervous system and i do think that they the events of the last few years have changed the way that people of u supplements i think that more people are starting to think about how to take better care of their health and they people are realizing that obviously great sly mindsets social connection exercise nutrician and forth are very important but i i should do not know anybody grant or run with a strange crowd but i do not know anybody that does not take something nowadays i could go through the whole list but i would say the most fundamental things and there is no product pitch here the most fundamental things are the things that are going to support your confoundational health for that is going to mean mainly getting either by food sources or supplements is going to be getting sufficient amounts of these essential fatiacids important for some people that is taking liquid fishia oil for some peoplet us capsl shums with eating fish out the wayfish taste unless imen siattle by ththe sea foot here is amazing i'm not much in california i think i the essential fadiacids and then i'm big on the data there i say out of stamfhor just in soinburg's lab and cris gardeners lab that these fermented foods of which all these cultures have interesting fermented foods kee fer an sour crowding kimchee and youno piccure piccure fermented food that those seem to really in courage health of the got my crobyjom i started eating a lot of those in taking no probiotics except in a few of the supplements that i was already taking i i've not try to dodge the question but i think by nd large of your eating well and doing the other foundational behaviors well you can get way with a minimum of supplements the three is seems to be lot of people to ficien dy three but not everybody i think u that those are the main ones however i do think that nutrician should be the primary an treep ont again it should be behaviours first then nutriciand then supplements then prescription drugs only if you need them and then for some people thei'r brain machine nter face t amass an things that are going to be useful but behaviours change your nervous system no supplement actually rewirers you or changes your nervousist an behaviors do that hope i did not amdoge that question tally i do take some of the things that we talk about on the podcasts to do some focused work sometimes alpa g p c but lately i've been doing this whole thing of cold water exposure to spike myner drennalan cause i hate it and it spikes my a drennal and after learning based on the mgon k hill data what would be your best one or to piece of vice recommend reprotocals from proving learning retentiron r graduates tunes and science an medicind we try to sleep sometimes a thank yu j g o great a u u w j i used to teach this course at cultering harbour on career development for scientists and the there is a lot in there but the two things that are most important ar i for it of answering this question i would say ar fine non destructive ways to reset you are dopomin and your energy levels and do those at least every three days for me it was kind of a atough thing to take a long walk or to spend i si work really hard on mondays really hard on tuesdays and i would not go in until the afternoon on wednesdays and sometimes not at all and then i go in thursday friday and work really really hard and then not at all on saturday and then maybe doall a bit a work from home on sunday and i was very productive that way the those braks ar absolutely key and that is not in courage much in academic or tet or maybe anything now i hear about much stress and overwork i say you just do it and tofind the culture and let the results and your focus be the the thing that defines you not how many hours you are in there but i realize there is a huge cognave load and energetic load and for that i do think these nonsly deep breast protocols are where it comes in really handy there at least two faculty i know at stamford one whos ha called poward hue's investigator whose big is those are big deal appointments they get tons of money et cetera et cetera and they do amazing science most of the time these individual certainly do and they take two twenty minute naps per day in their office when thiski came and visited me years ago when i was at different university he took the time that we ares pas to meet in my office and talk about data yesto be could taken nap and hy gave a great talk that afternoon there you go i do think you have to take control of your scaduland do those things i hope that helps and then of course for some people exercise and on is the way they reset what research your work ore youre doing of the your colleges are doing they yaure most excite about lately glen ya i one projects in particular i hope thi s bavor saccepted soon it is been out for view forever if the rears ar in the audience please just tell us one wr or the other we did a very larg skale study during the pandamic we meaning david spegal and i and an amazing pht name amlis yoll she now is two last namescuse me balbon yilma's balbon and molise we assentually equipped people with remote monering devices and measured sleep and heartrate very ability in a bunch of stress and bunch of other things and we gave them a very brief set of probreathing protocalls and it turns out that this thing that i'm talking about a lot on the podcast these days of this double inhal long exhale the called physiological sigh was the most effective breathing practis for allowing people to control their heartrate very ability reduce over all heartrate access better sleep and these were extremely short protocalls some very excited about this i did not discover physiological size i love the idea that people can do a very brief protocall once a day maybe even just while walking down the street or in a moment and actually learned to control that autonomic see saw bhetter some very excite about that and then we we are geering up to do some studies on people have more severe forms of anxiety in panic attack using a mainly a respiration but also looking at some of these a i vision related ways of controlling than nervous system i love that stff if i keep talking about it o men to give yo a dat o presentation some on o turn arout how does dopeming factorin to neuro plastosy if it all a call and great question it is a very strong trigger of plasticity much in fact that a there is some work that shows if you stimulate with an electro the brain area that releases dopamene and you pare that with anything anything even just and e kille hurt's tone eh the brain remapsins o i love that a't killahurt's tone remember dopamn is dum an is jis dum and its jis is costello when heto this dog i could hang a rope from a tree this dog was lazy would not cross a room for a stake you had to give the stake to him but it would run across a field he would run and jump on and hold on to that rope ould he would some night bite through his lip with blood dripping down o omi gies breaking my heart he loved every set that is dopame turns us into idiots he was he was a smart about what he need to be smart about dopamin if you triggere dopaming release with riddle and at or all to a lesser extent a'll tyrasy and and certainly please do not do this but cokane an phedami whatever you are doing seems superinteresting it is true and that is why it is such a slippery slope it makes anything you are doing seem interesting and important and acth i'll use this as an opportunisay something about the psychodelic thing earlier one of the issues with m d ma it is a very unusual brain state it is hi dopamean high seratoneent completely synthetic compound there are other things in their that it does as well one of the promas with people i see with the promel people to taking emdy amay just it at a basic level is that if you are not pushing that toward some theraputic outcome music sounds amazing everything feels and sounds amazing but it is a very nurochemically severe state that is why i think if people are going to explore those things do it is part of one of the university supported clinical trials one of the those drugs make every thing seem interesting even stuff that is not terribly interesting now they also have the potential for troma heeling capacity these are the map studies and on you have to be very careful with what you pare with dopa men and what you pare dopamine with and for those of you that are high sensation seeking novelty seeking and everythings interesting to you and you wantd more and more and more experiences iyou basically have a eight cylinder car in you and you nee to be very careful how you drive that thing any high performance automobile it skin a spend more time in the shop learn to drive appropriately what if ice can you offer to future scientist who want to make an impact you have rynoboil get ten yer first no i'm getting the o i ave this weird history an science and i'm not looking for simpathy year but a my undergraduate adviser who i adored s a father to me my graduate adviser and my postoc adviser who i also adored all three of them died suicide cancer cancer really young the joke in my field as you do not want me to work for you an but in all serious all three of them had a really morbid sense humor all amazing people but it is this kind of weird curse that i've had what scientists what what advice well ben barrass the late ben barrass died of pancratic cancer an amazing individual tharactuly making a documentary about bend's life he is transgenderity was a totally irreverent he said whatever he thought he offended everybody he was awsome brilliant too ben and i had a conversation as he was dying i recorded a lot of conversations with him and i told him i was interested in doing public facing education and he said well you are tenurd now and people are can to be upset and i canlike it and youre colleagues of prolegan a hat it what ever you think you better make it good and is a wile that does not really help much ben and he said you seem to have a compulsion for it you was right i think that if you are excited about science share en sharing what then do that and even if it seems supernurity man there are these entim i think toy call themselves untimage the inthe insect people they n they make insects seem really really cool and if you are excited about spindle canatic sir whatever tell people about it i really mean it i think that the one caviat is that i do think it is important to get a formal rigorous training in at first i think that youill go further and faster in the long run and there is some amazing people out there thre's a postockat stamford i think his name is ben ren i think he shorten it up on integraments ashy brain be brain cause he works he talks about brain science that is why it is where b b r e i and he does a great job and he is a really good example o someone whos still on the ascent with his career doing serious science in doing science communication bu e ouht to be careful it is time consuming look you people will dislike you for whatever i made the mistake once of saying that i eat butter apparently that is a sin on the intern little bits of i actually a lot of butter by tryin eat little bits of butter but somehow it is there is this idea that i e stix of butter yot to be careful i at of the things i've heard ired a was dead that was cool the am you ought to be careful and remember everything is stamped in to the the cloud now and that the the metaver whatever it is called i would say here are the rules that we have at the podcast and oncs here is the rules that i created for myself i truly do not do it for me i do it cause i think people wanto here about it but i've een ting myself that is in selk six years old the other thing is never ever ever do it just for your own gratification you shourd really try and think i's any one gentng get anything useful out of this potentially that is the gull if you are doing that it'l work out for you if you are thinking about how to get followers or something that it are not can work out that is my advice is age six sy six too old for neroplasid no no i'l's cut myself off to begin learning a sandra ters ar no did i pronounce that right thank you sandra no a richard finemen the great richard finemen taught himself to draw when later in life he was also really into flotation tanks did that yes he is also into bongo drumming naked on the rufa caltec richard fineman you i did many thingsthat would get most people fired nowadays he is just lucky he was alive when he was you can absolutely learn at sixty six an way beyond there is an amazing study from rusty gages lab at the salk institute years ago showing that even people who are very late in life terminally ill in fact ore still producing nunurans in the denti ciris of the hippocampus these people at work gracious enough to allow researchers to inject them would dies that would lable these narans for analysis postmortem after they died absolutely you can learn what is harder is focus oftentimes what is harder is sleep as well but the same mechanism supply there is no evidence whatsoever that nero plasticity disappears at any stage despite what huwon reasl told the baby s how do you tackle reading research papers you have a specific stragy and on yes i do i do i i take note on everything i try and i swy there is four questions that we teach students and that i think i that i use the first one is what is the question they are asking major and more specific second is what did they do what evere the methods uize what did they do you do nont to know all the details in the methods necessarily but be versed in those methods but you have to come to understand are they looking at my they look in humans is this a i did they have people in two different conditions or just one yet tunderstan what did they do then you asked what did they find and then the last questions the most important one and you should write down the answer to this is what did they conclude and then you look back at the first question you go do they actully answer that question or is it something unrelated and those four questions are are sentialy the way that i pars each paper learning o pars papers is tricky for the podcas i i use the telephone i call people and i badger them and i aske them now who is doing the really good work in this area n i spend a lot of hours doing it and then the best way to remember science is to tell some one about it before each podcast i'll call hen i haht did that these to throw kids in the river after i do this and my sister my poor sister and she is a ye messenger by the way it does not watch the podcast i she is a therapist and sus ak heg i learn this amazing breathing technique li oh ye really tell me thaut it ns some one else is and you ni have a podcash is they i do not your podcas an old older sister ellder sister it she is not lying what is your favorite sauce coniment seasoning sas is one in every audience i the spicy stuff we have been for menting our own food at home a its kind of cool you put the the cabbage in the stuff in the ld syramic thing outside and then it goes it makes this amazing sound in the make your own sarkrob and that peppers and th for menting that stuff it is really good look can theye telling you one more questions well do to what is most ot work from your eighty eigh ah gabril a a lot of questions about eighty igh to for people on medication ar not on that occasions i'll do i'll answer both for people on medication i think work with somebody really good whose willing to work with you to allow you to find that minimal effective dose and also timing that dose one of the keythings that we know now is that from that waking up point in your morning until about eight or nine hours later we have sort of name that fase one of the day for lack of a better naming pro to call the systems that release cortas all dopamin an epan effran or essential ly more effective at producing those then they are in the later periods of the day which makes sense if you think about the way that the autonomynervous system were its et cetera there is an important question that i cannot answer for you but you can answer for you which is if you are using riddle and atter all vive ants these things that enhancs dopin dofpamnergic transmission modafinal armodafinal by the way for the people in the audience me who did not go to college when these things were all in use the numbers of people that use these compounds on and off prescription is astronomical it is incredible i did not realize it i think something a eighty per cent of college students use these at some point incredible caus they put yo into a narrow aperture tunnel of concentration you want to with a physician support of course to help get permission or not to figure out what time of day to take your medication now for people who are not on medication i'll just go right back to what i said earlier which is that you can train focus but it feels terrible to train it it is hard again there thes large scale studies in china and elsewhere of people literally teaching themselves and yes they blank although less often to focus their vision on a narrow aperture and to really battle through that agitation stress and learn how to keep their focus now focus will drift right focus is not a constant focus will drift and you pop out of focustates and then refocus aid papa out and re focus that is something that you can train up i've heard from many people of manage to train themselves oft medication or to lower doses of medication and look some people cannot do that they absolutely have to maintain their standard medication protocalls a this is a larger discussion obviously as it relates to eightiato were gon int another episode on eghtiat you because the datar coming out fast what future episodes are in the pigte line davin when o k i thank you for that question we have one on grief we have an amazing episode with aguy from the rockithall university on the this is my ladsads can it be my favorite episode i love all the guests but this episode just bloomy away on the relationship between language speech dance and music and i have no musical talent i 'm not a very good answer that is been generous amazing interplay between those things a exercise in the brain o c d balemia bingeeting disorder am peter teas coming on he will teachus about everything medicine and longevity and i'm kind of blanking at the moment i david anderson from caltak on aggression and emotional states amazing and then their number of people a least a feldmen bearit or bear it feldmen owways get i backward sorrily saw on emotions in the brain and really we do o take suggestions about who to bring on the podcasts very seriously what i'm we are mostly looking for we are mostly looking for the people that no one else as heard that people have not heard of who are not going on podcasts every week and that people should ababsolutely here from and then i will tell you the're ging to kill me for saying this but i'm to do it anyway a we have some short series coming up with aexpert professionals i've mean to do a short series on trama and my hope for this series is that you will actually get to see an exquisitely skilled trama therapis take some one through excuse me i seem excite spitting on the audience iscuse me it to take some one through actual trama therape this is not stage as is somebody as actually in a point of near suicide old grief and trama taking them through it in the course of the podcasts as people can see what this process actually intails that is a a very meaningful project to me for a number of reasons am we are really excite about that and yo to be honest i feel there is just such a treasure trova of information out there at jst when i grab it all and tell you all about it until i always say if nothing else i'll cure in somnia nea than you we shoer thank you much for your time i really appreciate every on coming out on the week day and i'd be remissif id did not say thank you for your interest in science

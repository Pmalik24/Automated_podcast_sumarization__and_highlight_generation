well the michigan primaries were last night and there'r some interesting stories on both sides of the isle the bigger story of course is on the democratic side of the isle where the incumbent president of the united states only one about eighty per cent of the vote not sounds a lot texcept for the fact that a huge number of people in michigan voted un committed that was a conserted attempt by crazies in the democratic party in michigan particularly crazies who support comoss many of them in dearborn michigan who decided thathey were oing to show jobidon that unless he swivels his support from israel to commoss he his somehow going to lose michigan to donald trump and this raises ha serious question why is jobidon dependent on the crazies in his own party after all jobidon came into office running against the crazies in his own party you will recall it you all the way back to the twenty twenty primaries that he was running against a crazy person burney sanders whoas a nutjob old socialist and jobidon was running as the moderate and in fact it was only because jim cliburn in south carolina in dorsed jobidon and the entire democratic party yunified to stop burney sanders the crazy guy that jobidon ended up winning the nomination and then defeating donal trump in the twenty twenty election and then jobide made a signal error he decided that he was going to be l b j he was going to be ftar not e play holder for the next generation of democrats but he was going to be a transformative presiden and vou're on the left being a transformative president means spending more money than god or man has ever seen if you are on the left thand being a transformative present means embrazing all of the most woke versions of politics ranging from diversity equity and inclusion to transpolitics you have to embrace the most radical possibl position an drag the american public along with you it also means on the foreign policy front the the reality to formn policy exist for every president which his wife virtually every president talks one way whenthe're on the campagn trail an then they get to office in a realize the way the world actually works and they swivel how they actually governd gjeorge gol be bush came into office pledging to be unisolationist and the nine eleven happen berokobama came into office pledging to be an isolationist and then he involved us in a bunch of middle eastern conflict donald trump came into office pledging to be unisolationist and thn he broker the abrahamicords and to pretty harsh stands against russia in china jobidon came into office pledging that he was going to get out of afganistan and make americoless involved in the world and now there are two major on going wars in the world in which the united states has indirect involvement in other words jobiden never really had the opportunity to be full on left wing when it came to forgn policy because being the president of the united states basically forestalls that his one attempt at doing that which was the disastrous pull out from afganistan cratered his presidency if you look at his approval ratings throughut is presidency jobidon's appruvaratings dromatically sank in the after math of the afganistan pollet and they have never recovered they have remained in the lowforties ever sinse all of which means that if jobiden had come into office then governed as he pledged he was going to governd as a left wingmoderate a liberal moderate somebody who sought consentis somebody who as just going to restore as sents of normal s and moderatio into american politics he would not now be in the direstrates that he is moderates have fallen off the ban wagon in dependence are now looking at trump and by the pulling data a plorality of independencs favor donald trump over jobidon right nout which is why donald trump is up in the polling against jobidon how jobidon loses independente to donad trumpson amazing story becaus gen independents are very off put biy donald trump on a personal level they voted against him in twenty twenty late breaking independent voters in twenty sixteen voted two to one or donal trump in twenty twenty late breaking independent voters voted two to one for jobidon and now they are shifting back to trump tere's only one reason for that and that is that jobidon allowed his ambitions to be a historic presedent that theyw'ld make statues of to overcome his good political sents he did not want to be a clintonian vote way presiden he wanted to be berocc obama he wanted to be somebody who people fought of for generations to com as a transformed ofe presedent in american history and because of that he is now alienated the actual base that he wants help and that base is now looking much more seriously at president trump as is rival and that means that he is in thrall to the crazies and that is the story of what happened in michigan last night get when you look at these statestics what you see is that jobidon one approximately six hundred eighteen thousand votes first of all ats a very large number of votes for in in cumbent preseden in a in a primary if you go back s twenty twelve and you look the michigan primary in twenty twelve for the democrats what you will see is that borockobama in the michigan primaries in two thousand twelve when he wis the incomment president which would be the same position as as jobin right out he only one about a hundred and seventy four thousand votes anothere is no one showed up to vote in those primaries why did noin trup to vote n th primaris because everybody cenias a whatever who cares he is goin to be the nominy why might even bothering to show up but for jobidon a lot of people showed up six hundred eighteen thousand people showed up to voe for jobidon but the bigger story of course is that a hundred and one thousand people showed up and voted uncommitted and there was an overt attempt again by the crazies in michigan led by people richita tolyb to jack up the number of people who voted uncommitted another twenty three thousand voted for marian williamson another twenty thousand voted for deen phillips jobidon ends of winningabout eighty one per cent of the vote total in michigan but again that big stories can be the un committed voters because the idea is that if those un committed voters decide not vote for jobidon in the actual election in november thnd e could very well lose the state now he wan that state by about a hundred and fifty thousand votes last time a hundred thousand is a lot o votes our all the people can a vote actively against jobidon probably not but m say half of those people the side that they are not going to show up to the poles for jobidon becaue they are unhappy with jobidon well that means that he is in real trouble in michigan which means again when you steer a wave from mittel that means you are more reliant on your remaining voting bases and his remaining voting base is full of crazy people and that is why you are seeing jobidon constantly in bracing crazy unpopular positions in the reality is that the pulling data suggest that when it comes to for example the israel commoss conflict the american people are broadly support of of israel the latest harvard herris pole shos that eighty two per cent of american say they supports israel more than commos alcomos voters arnin the democratic party sixty eight per cent of americans say that israel is trying to avoid cevilian casualties in fighting its war with commos s another words thereis pretty heavy support america remain to very pro israel country but not inside the crazy wing of the emocratic party and that is the part that jobidon has made himself totally dependent upon and we should understand that that democratic party that the crazies in the democratic party they do not even know their crazy that is the thing to understand about crazy people in general crazy people in general do not know that they are crazy they think they they are perfectly seen and yourk crazy these folks are nots and the can yuan tell that they are nots they deny the level of the nuttiness jobidon does too jobidon pretends this is all normal politics as usual it is not it is not normal politics as usual to have a hundred thousand people vote against you because youcite against in actual genecitle terrorist group that is wild according to the walstr journal uncommitted blue paste their original carget of ten thousand voters and clocked in at a figure substasially higher on tuesday than it has been in recent michigan an primaries then they have now tallied about thirteen per cent of the entire tally by comparison un committed dre about eleven per cent of the vote in the twenty twelve tht michigan democratic primary one by presenent brocobom but again the numbers way lower in twenty twelve theyvid acobid is former senor adviser to abomise and michigan is going to be a martional state this fall if the voters who registered their protest walkaway this felt it could be decisive he says this was a costry vot the s good point to may an the follo will be a choice of much greater consequence and other words if you do not votes or if you vote un committed in the actual election than all those voters in deerborn here theg n mo for trumpthanas pro israel presiden in american history good luck wutd dap again this goes to the broader point jobitin has put himself in thrall two the raticals and the raticals have him by the short hars which is why the yor times has an entire piece today titles young voters sav their discontent goes deeper than israel and gaza the energy on michigan college campass is ahead of the twenty twenty to midterums student said was electric armed with promises to protect a bortion rightes democratic handidate tell large campus rallies drawing crowds wo can prepared t cheer rather than to protest on election day students showed up in draels but before the democratic presedential primary on tuesday the energies seems to have more oftinto apathy or anger young actvis have been at the forefront of sustain back lash the president bidon staunch support of israel andits military campaign in gaza interviews with more than two dozen students across the state indicated a deeper well of disatisfaction not just wit the un commen president but the prospect of once again having to choose between bidon and trump people deckades older than they are voters under thirty who back to bidon at by more than twenty points in twenty twenty are unenthusiastic about a rematch voters under thirty overwhelmingly voids their opposition to the conflict in a new york times siana college pollsing israel had not done enough to prevent sivilling casualties in gaza and the military campaign sion stop again when you make your entire campaign dependent on the low pr pencity voters in te youth vote when you make your entire campaign dependens i'm people whyre not only low prepensity but radical that of course is going to shape the rest of your campaign tand you have only one choice at that point and that is to steer into the radicalism the jobidon is dependencs i'm the crazies in his base that he has to steer in that direction and explains every thing that he is doing right now and the radicals know it which is why youf pieces one in political today about the michigan waw maker the democratic floor leader of the michigan house of representatives man in abraham iyish who is denouncing jobiden he said he stoopid nose pine and did not deman piece for palistoniuns not did not deman piece for his railies instead continues to fund a genocide he is now thirty and he is the first arab american house majority leader in the history of thestate of michigan which again cudos to the michigan stay republican party for being completely in competent in their jobs really well done but this is the the narrative the dhemedia have been pushing andthe'ae gingto continue to push in out jobidon does have anothers stragegy he could navigate away from the crazies in othe words jobidon could take a motera position i'n everything from sat the border to abortion from spending to israel he could take the moderate main streeme position the eighty per cent position but we have moved out of the realm of normal politics in this country really have it used to be that the best way to win an election mus to take a bunch of eighty percent positions find the eighty percent positions thn gs where americans were eighty per cent pro the position and then you do that but instead we ave now decided to a bandin those in favor of forty three percent propositions and then hope that there enough people in that forty three percent horgan abote t out way the people on the other side who presumably are unenthusiastic or not going to vote it is it is an amazing amazing thing and make no mistake these folks are legitimately quite crazy for example cornell west who is on the left of the democratic party and he is running as an independent but of course he is a far leftistan is quite representative of some of the crazies in the democratic party cornel west spend his day yesterday suggesting a moral equivalence between israel and commass these are the people jobidon is going to try to panrty can see his policy already shifting you believe in the idea aradicating a terri group camat which did such barbaric thanks to innocent to telians we one oma you and i know that a jewish life as exacte the sang thay as a paliston in life ot paliston an baby an the same bay with a jewish babyn the question as hado to get at the rits of it any time you kill an innocent person that is a crime against humanity did hamost commit war crimes absolutely murder is murder now i believe in just war combadens can kio combans i'm not one lut the king i'm not a pastofis but combaden must not keo se villias are innocant people no matic woot it is idea or hamas but but the problem is you going to call hamoth a teris group tan the idea i killin innicent people their caris too get guornowest is an absolute clown but again representative of a huge clown bays inside the democratic party it is an amazing thing byt by the way if you really want to know the extend to which the raticals in the democratic crat democra partarin control look at james carville shojames carvall this is the partet's amazing the moderates in the democratic party have decided they need to cave to the raticals james carville is one ofthe more moderate members of the democratic party rad his clin he is the the designer of the clintonian third way he and dcmorris for he people who basically desined triangulation james carvill has bee the person who is been on the ramparts in the democratic party saing you ned to stop talking about men in women's bath rooms and used aur talking abouts at economic issues but here he is tasically acknowledging that the crazies now run the party he says that if we get to chicago the democratic convention which has goingto happen in chicago this yeare again i got to say just amazing writing this year of trump when you have the democrats going back too chicago for the convention thes same place that the nineteen sixty eight convention took place in which you had a a hotly contested democratic primary fight the assassination of a major political figure in ar of cay in which you have massive riots over the veonome war that is where they chose to hve their convention this yeare just really well that heres james carville saying that if we gets the chicago convention and the gozawar is still continuing then is goin to get wild your dian wars talking about this uncommitted vote in michigan because of a that the word gasa there some democratic act of this ur san they want they want to see democrats vot un committed in set of for president vidin what do you think about the concerns about that are they well founded as this being blown out of proportion what do you think the coko con gravulation go you we show a mone of the orter tha shanik yis yesur te and i think it is the wa e the just prograssiv bat that its a young people or cali campesies a a the prarvile can give some carto ses fi take this a the fa a o e cis i got it it it is damage politically is prety subsantia and it we get to chicago at the convention and is thing is sill a o aoon think abot is ca aa ter can now understand that that when james carville is caving to the raticals that shows you that they have to he is not want to they have to and then of course you have the great mineds tof the near times who elso are urging jobiton tcave to the raticals that of course to be moreons comasfreeman legitimately one of the dumbest people in the history of foreign policy commentary thomas freedman a man who gets all of his advice from cab drivers in random places and an this moron is still advising the bide administration on forgn policy has a piece in the yer times to day taught titlco israele is losing its greatest asset axceptans was that israel's greatest asset i notice that israel has another asset and is alled the very powerful military if jews were waiting for acceptance for all of human history that was a strategy that failed pretty dramatically until israel actually arose and had you kno in air force a notis the thomas reman seems to the jews having the good will of the world up until the point where they defend themselves and start killing terrorists he says qhart i've spent the past to days travelling from newtelly to deby in him on i've an urgent message delivered to present abidon ind the ise raely people i'm seeing the increasingly rapid erosion of israel standing mong friendly nations a level of exceptance and legitimacy that was painstakingly built up over decades and if biden is not careful america's global standing will plumment right along with israels he is o where exactly is is he is he feeling the legitimacly drain away he says the legitimacy is draining way in the arab world oh shocker i cannot believe it a it but wys he really doing that the reason that he is doing that thomas reman is not only because he appensto be wrong on forin polisy literally all the time but because he knows everyone else knows jobidon abandon the thing that got him to office in the first place and now heis n't serious trouble which means thet now he is putting pressure on israel in themiddle of a war against a terrist enemy israel has now reduced come off his serious control over the gozastrip to the city of rafa it is in the south of te gozastrip everyone knows it is a final climactic battle in the goastrip and what is jobidan doing as israel is prepared to go in and kill presumably yet yes in mar who is the leader of komass the mastermine of the october seventh tax he is selling israel effectively to back off according to axios the bide ad ministration gave israel until midmarch to sign a letter tprovided by the ouus on tuesday that is assurancis it will abide by insternational law while using uus weapons and allow humanitarian ad into gaza three ouus an is raily of ficials told the axios the assurances are now requirement under a memo issued earlier this month by present bidon while does not single out israel the new policy came out for some democratic senatoris expressed concern over the is really military campaign in gaza if the assurance is are not provided by the dedline uus weapons travencs fors to the country will be plaused now here is the problem with that idiotic noshin international law is a cimera it is a law international law is largely design by people who do not abide by it under any circumstance is an only apply it to people they seek to hamstring international law in other words is a joke that is neverhav forn policy has run the willsonian notion that there is some sort of great congress of powers that gets together and decides the morality of the world dthat international law now applies is silliness it has always been silliness and yet that is what jobiden is now is now pushing and the why s he doing that he is doing that because he wants the voton michigan that is all it is very simple the memoranzum was issued by the white house after pressure from sener a crisvan holland of maryland three youus officials told daxios the senant majority leader trecumer told the wite house that he was conserned in amendment would divide the democratic cockas in the senten senate and what it what asumer do instead of standing up to isown crazies he toldjrae biding just do it as an executive action again not a shock at all this is what the democratic party is now sop is jobiden are the m crets likely to placate the crazies the answer is know because they are crazy this is the problem once you are in thrall to the crazies everything runs out o control fri tee quickly who are the people whare voting uncommitted in mishing well the probably people the people that we saw last night over at brirkley over it you seeburkly there was asper are usual arrangement a massive protest that turned in to a riot itwas a private event and jewish students were threatened assaulted and prevented from attending the speech by a jewish speaker on campas sudents were called to rogatory names dirty jew or u jew here is some tape of what is going on a brokly they decancil the event an evacuate tho hall normoaing to see the i ege m protesters who are blocking justunes from entering thevent this is at this what they do they tese ofe the people that jobiden is caterington precisely the group that jobiden is aterington college a uden iton that that is those r the people that jobiden is very very hot on getting and what is amazing about all this again is that by and large americans support israel against commass if jobidon had shown one ioda of t e actual credible leadership rather than trying to have the baby to placate the nuts then hou be more popular on thes issue not americans they hone american allies actually win wars they do not whene americanalis moozewars you now we know that because jobidn lost a warn afgannistan and it tanked him jobiden's failure to secure anything approaching victory in eu crane jobin's failure to secure anything approaching victory with ra to israel and commass is a bad thing for him politically because he if you decide that is a shrinking base of nuts and he is he he wants he wants the nuts what is amazing about that is that of course puts the nuts in the driver sy an let us be very clear jobiden has now done that internationally not only domestically because who knows they are in control now commss jobidon the other day he a he made a claim that a seese fire was mere moments away he was eating ice cream and he made the claim that a a sees fire was about to happen all would be well and tom and then commass was nope and the reason comoss said no is because they know that they can jack jobidon around the more intransigent commass is the more they make demands that are not fulfilled the more pressur biden will exert on israel not on comass and no point is jobiden ever say to commass okaguis you kno what we tried to make it theall the deal is not forth coming israel have at it and no point o jobident say that because he is afraid that i he does that under any circumstances he loses michigan he is now handed the bat ton two the terrorist group in a variety of ways as we' discussed over the last couple of days for example the palastinian government not the head ofthe overnment mochwe aboss the dictator but the rest of the palistinian eelected goverment as he electics ther no elected government resigned tou make way for a comas lead government and then jobiden is going to tap that government on the head and call it the new palistinian government new boss same is the old boss except the worse in the wess bank and now comasofficial san tuesday there was no break through in the mediated talks with israel am to plausing the war and freing the remaining hossages and the gosastrip that can one day after jobidon sad that a sease fire was imminent ba semanae ma comas spokes person send an a text message the militant group had gets to formerly receive any new proposals since senior is raily officials met with cuttar egypt and you us in paris laswy to advance a possible deal another comasofficial acamad ob dohadi said the group was sticking to its demand that israel agree to a long term cease fire and that leaks about the talks resign to pressure comas to soff in its position by long crumsees fire they mean leaving comas in place which is the only thing comas needs in order to clar victory understand that in the normal traditional war when you degrade the enemy's military capacity the way to israel has done comas a comas does not have offensive projective capacity at this point now normally be considered a wind that is not the ay that works in the midelest tin the mddaleast the way that it works is if you provokeal wardn't get your ass absolutely kicked but you survive and you wave your flag you are somehow he victor tht 's heway this idiotic regime works in the middleast and comas knows that all they are looking to do at this point is survive how crazy are the crazies there crazy that the moderate among the crazies are still crazy for example there is a tweetos going around yesterday av ru's laughing at it but it does demonstrate hes sort of standards that proponent of comas and the and the palistinians more broadly it does demonstrte honuts alot of these foks ar there is a person his name's mahommed elkward he is a palistinian writer and poet and tum he lives in east jerusalem he is born in east jerusalem he a and he apparently graduated from the savana college of art and design with a bachelor of fine arts degree and he a is studies poetry at prooklin college as well he is a correspondent for it the nation a you now a well respected member of the propalistonian left obviously he am he gave a speech not all that long ago in which he claimed that quote our day will com but we must not be complasance our day will com but we must normalized massacres as the statist quo tongmat october sevent lot the other day he treated out that is quote you cannot protest peacefully you cannot way cot you cannot hunger strike you cannot hide jack plains you cannot block traffic you cannot tromolitas yu cannot self femolate you cannot heckle politicians you cannot march you cannot ri it you cannot descent you just cannot be and tht tells the wholestories the crazies that jobine has turned this party over to not the malhammed alcurd is a is a is american citizen who can vote but his allies in the united states can nat us on i analyze this for a moment because it tells the whole story of the of the arab is raily conflict in one tweet his version of just being agan his version of leave us alone u leave us alone is is a pretty well respected argument tat is made by people on all sides of various political isles leae us alone is a brig otd argument right leave leave meal i'm not bothering you leave me alon butt his version of leave us alone right eleave me be is blocking traffic throwing molleto cock tails self immolating and high jacking planes riggmat's a crazy statment you cannot just let us be it is it is difficult when you will not let us high jack planes it is hard when you on't let us throw mollatof cocktails or set ourselves on fire these are the people the jobiton has has hitched his boat to good luck to him by the way things aregoingto gout worse before they got better because of all of this the great lie inthemiddle east is that when you broker these temporary hudnas thes temporary seas fires that the somehow calms the waters in the iddleleast that is wrong the only thing that matters as always is victory the only thing that matters is power and control that is all that matters in this region of the world there is no baseline agreement on values that means that comass survives commass is there for strengthen is bella is strengthen and by the way just a note the ouble standard here it trulyis amazing according to the losre journal the start of romadon looms as an iinformal but urgent edline to strike it is rael commaseas fire ats the millton group called wednesday for mass protesta during is lomic holy month that isral fears is part of a plan to spread the conflict outside of gaza is rally leaders have said they woul launch on offensive against commases last stronghold in goza if a deal is not reached by romadon set to start around march ten the us egypt and cutar ha've warned israel against the ground offensive in rofisat couldn'nt danger negotiations negotiations by th lat ckomases totally playing for all they are worth on wednesday is malhonea they had of commss's political bureau from his five star hotel in cuttar called on palicinians outside gaza to converge on all oxamasqu it is the routine that happens prettymuch every year round romadon in which muslims are allowedto gather on mass at alloxa nd the the start hurling molletof cock tells and rock tat his raily soldiers and then when is raily soldiers quashed they suggest that it is some form of a brutal occupation and evil army actions wo stop them from worshipping on the templamount which as a multiple time visitor to the templemount therere only restrictions on me as a do there are no restrictions on muslins ore worshipping at aloximasqu zero if you go theire worship our fine if i go up on the temple mount and i openly prey i will be expelled from the templeamount that is the way that it works up there christians too by the way but not the truth does not matter in this region of theworld al that matters is power and again the amazing thing here is that look it the west cant even comprehend wit they cannot that the west is now allied itself for p ar purposes with groups commass ore the palstinian authority because once you try to broker a deal and you legitimize one of the sides of the dealtat is a terrorist group as i legitimate side of the deal you now become the proponent this exactly what happeling barakobama and ron he sent a terrible orondual and then het as spen the rest of it his administration running cover for te aranians because if he had acknowledge the aronians we are lying and sponsering terror everywhere thn it wouldhave looked he was a sucker head sunk cost fallacy about his own arondule and the same thing is happening here with regard to thse negotiations the united states let us to negotiations with commoss an mosli all i let us do it and then the'e doing whatever they want to do and the us while we do want them part of the negotiations jobinza wall you we we do want them 's part of the negotiation n that means we have to treat their demans reasonably meanwhile theyare literally looking to weapon up for their holiday now ju's theve question for all the christians jews non muslims in the audience and moderate muslims in the audience by the way why would you why would your holiday be the occasion of wanching a vast terror attacks lash war it is amazing double standard here if your radical muslin not only can you use your own mosque as he shield for your weaponry whith routinely happens not only can you use your own holiday as he shield o my god you cannots attack us on romadon it is very holy dus also what dn at kill you becaue it romanon and nowts our time but aught thes a radical muslin propositions but also when you gets have a holiday that is the best time to attack again october seve was im cut a which is on the jorish calender probably the happiest day of the year and thow was the perfect time for commoss to russ across the boader and slaughterswive hunder people jobidon has wetted himself to this and he has done this because he refuses to moderate on any issue his vision out weighed his capacity he wanted to be transformative and he has been all right and once you are dancing with the devil that dance just gets faster and faster and it is not just by the way with regard to israel and commossel though it is the most clear cut example becaue what is happening an missingan it is also with regard to the border the obvious question on the border why will not jobidon shut the border every one wants him to by pulling data jobidon needs to close the border he used to take harsh action on the border donald trump is destroing him on this issue in all pulling data it is now jumpe to te top of the heap among issues that american's actually careabout and still jobidon is dithe ring and doing nothing why cersly why when the only possible reason is because he is in thrall to his crazies he is in thralls in the nutjobs for example correnjon pierre yesterday she said jobide is heading down to the bordersho as asked is he going to announce any exacutive action or anything to stop the giant flow of i legal magration the note actually note herso i do not have anything to av lik can at get ahead of the presiden don have anything to to anoute that this time we have we spoken to that cat ive actions th've spoken to that many times we think the bottom line es thewe to hav dolt with this border the jallant that we tik the border we see with this emigration o broken emigrations thi em thas been broken for decaves is if we if republicans have e ford with wih the by partson deal that came ou out of the senit o caso no that is to no they are not goin to do anything about any of this meanwhile by the way the bodies are stacking up bilmalugan who doesnat excellent chobe reporting on thse isshues over the past twenty four hour he just been reportint crime after rime for example local media in washington do see reporting a salvadorn legal imemigran has been arrested in connectio withthe murder of a two year old triald on february eighth ice says that he was released from costody after arrests multipal times in twenty twenty three after the local jurisdiction ignored ice detainers the two year old was caught in the cross fire of a of gangwar that was not the only illegal imigrant serious crime over the course the last forty eight hours to to pop into the news according to fox eight live in nineteen year old honduran man has been arrested in cennera louisiana following a series of violent crimes according to believes the cenner police department says the investigation began tuesday february twentieth when it was notified of the rape of a fourteen year old girl at knife point the suspect was then identified as in emigranta honduran in the united states illegaly apparently police say a man was getting out of his vehicle and was approached by this person and demanding his property during the robbery police say that the perpetrator stabed the victim a multipl times in the face and the back officers of the scene found the selegalemigrant covered in blood the chief of police says on documented emigrants are difficult to identifi due to lack of documentation this person had reportedly used to alius is in the past including elvan locket then according to chief jason oent was the twenty six chief of justborter patrol quote in the last seventy two hours just borter patral agents throughout the south west border region have apprehended eleven individuals the violent criminal histories ther criminal histories include chil molestation aggravated assault rape mortder and manu facture and trafficing of firearms an trovbidon still will not close the border he sto will not close the border there is only one reason for that and that is because again once more once you have a band in the middle you have to tack to the extremes jobidon has made that decision and now we are all reaping the whirlwind from that in just one secon willget to democratic coliticions who do not actually wone to reap that whirlwind particularly first to morrow is leapday that day comes once every four years if you are born on leapday congratulations yeu'e still much younger than the rest of us jermy's razers is offering an insaintial and by that we mean you would be crazy domissit to morrow only an get a precision five trialset a toile true travel bag left tos chers tumbler and jermy's microgression chocolates all bundled together for twenty nine bucks that is an eighty dollar vallu you dont want a miss the deal this once every four years sale is tomorrow february twenty nimesh its for one day only sedrominer whatever you have to do get a tomorrow a jermy's razors dicom before the offer ends o cam meanwhile gat there are democrats who do not wish to go down with the sinking radical ship that apparently in cluseric adam zeric adams ran again on a more moderate platform as mayor of new york now he is saying that he wants to deport migrants accused of serious crimes now you might think that that be a normal proposition wrong the democratic city council is trying to oppose him according to the near to imes for years nurkc city leaders have relished the status being a called sanctuary city were local la en forcement co operation with federal emmigration officialsis limited on tuesday meri eric adms made a clear his views re differentif he had his way he said he would permit law en forcement in york city to work openly with emigration authorities to more readily to port migrants were suspected of serious crimes there is some people that feel thy should beable to remain here keep their actions until the're eventually convicted he said i do not subscribe to that theory a reporter asked to adams about to process that they din't give do process to the person they shot or punch are killed there is a philosophical disagreement here the city council says there are no plans to revisit these laws again that divide is the democratic party in a nutshell which is wy the democratic party is in fact in a process of shrinking away now the democratic party has also get to take advantage of positions on which the re publican party is not in the eighty per cent take the situation with regard to urane the united states is bunchrcan flicting data on what americans think of funding for ucrane according to a recent ugov pole in the united states the forty three per cent of americans believe that the west should continue to support ucrane in its efforts against russia tuntil such a time as russ with draws from the country even if that means the warrents fects last longer some twenty three per cent of americans say they want to incurg o negotiate a piece to and the fighting even if it means russia stell as control over some parts of ucrane a plurality of americans still believe that funding free crane would be the proper way to do this and when it comes to whether the west is doing enough to prevent the russions from winning in ucrane the united states forty six per cent of americans say the were not doing enough twenty five per cent say that we are doing more than enough or enough gand de ugov pole from january as far as the level of eight being cent to urane thirty three per cent of the american public believes that wesould maintain the same levels of support to ucrane some twenty six per cent believe that we should reduce are level of supports fom twenty three per cent believe we should increase are levels of support oneof the big questions when it comes to funding freeucrane is weather the reduce position is redded stadus quoll whether te increase position is read as status quell because generally americans canelic statusquagle gook cay fine will just ep spending what we been spending we do not want sylc radical uptake in the amount of spending but only twent six percent of americans are expressing that they would actually to reduce our levels of support according to thes ugov pulse that is a minority proposition that americans desperately want to reduce the commitment that has been made to ucrane with that said ther' swingstaye voters who do believe that we have given too much to ucrane a pole from the uca telegraph this is from january early january fines that in for example michigan thirty two per cent of americans believe that america has given too much to ucrane twenty one per cent say too little twenty nine per cent say the right amount eighteen percent say they do not know can bottomline tho is the hard and fast opposition to more aid u crane long as that aid is not yo wildly over dromatic the vastmajority of american voters are at least of vasplorality are still in favor of continued au crane they do not want to just cut off you crane at the nees right now which is why it is very strange the republicans continued tou not negotiate over the situation in u crane now the democrats hav failed here signally to convince the american public that they actually hold the middle ground the question on u cranes who holds the middle grund the middle ground on ucrane is the one the americans want most americans want to provide enough aids u crane to help them withstand the russian barage but not enough aid that it is a serious cost to the united states or we do not want to shore up their buracracy or anything that which is why there republican back bentures who are now proposing an alternative aid u crane bill which presumably is pretty popular with the american people that is u crane aid billts being proposed by tactually a by parsing colition including representatives branfit is patrick of pennsylvania and sare golden of mane and on bacon of nebraska it is called the defending borders defending democracies act it includes bort control measures including that migrans coming over the southern border haf to remain in mexico which would be the biggest single policy prescription that was reversed by jobiton that in of itso would be a huge one remain in mexico being in shrine in law would be a major win for the united states if this bill wered passe the house and the senate and the bill includes forty seven billion dollars for u crane priorities that is down thirteen billion dollars from the proposal approve by the senate the house law makers excluded these senates seven point eght billion dollars an government budgethary aid to keeve saying why wepaying their government expenditures we just want to pay for the weapon reace that they can stop the russians from invading the bill would also fund uus military operations in the red sea whuld spend three billion dollars on helping america bill morsumarines and it would spend four billion dollars re filling israel stocks of air defense interceptors which make sens because youon a stop heron from for example firing a missil it israel israel needs that aid presumably that bill is being proposed by a by partisan colition the house speaker johnson has ben unable to bring for d anything and hereinlies the unworkability of the republican house snatching defeat from the jaws of obvious victory gand there there are thousand ways republicans can win this particular piar battle and they seem to be ignoring all of them because again the house speaker is dependent on a single vote the house majority is down to vo single digipts and that means that if speaker johnson does something to cross four republicans he loses his speakership now maybe at this point he should a say oca fine what but that is the job the job is i pass bills that i thin e're oing to help the republican party winsay the next congressional election and help donald trump win the presidency because let us be real about this jobidon is now running against congress tht is what he is doing that is what for examplt yesterday here is jobidon saying that the consequences of an action in ou crane are dyr that is a hard case to make if republicans were passing say a forty seven billion dollar aid package that includes ser his border provisions is suppose to passing nothing he is counting on republican in action telp carry him over the finish line again is the only placewhere he can even attempt to grab what he believes to be a moderate middle position is oneu crane and tht's only beng made possible because republican toave not make clear exoctly wat to how they want the're completely divided here is jobide you rd rrori crerire in bottom line here is that at's some point the republican leadership is going to have to stand up for the majority of its actual constituents and take positions that may alienates the more radical parts of the base the p again even inside the republican party its a minority proposition it still is to completely cut off aid to you crane tht is still not it is by polingdata that is not a majority position inside even the republican party and if rusher wer to over on keev who look even worse for republicans as yourbidon found out when he left the talban over on cobl t's our republican's going to a lowby t whoever acts not crazy winds whever seizes the middle ground in the selection cycle winds that is presumably wby republicans are also discussing the possibility of averting a government shut down the speaker johnson he said that he is optimistic that we would avert a government shut down this wekan and this is in fact the correct political position i know that there a lot of people who government shut downs bcause they belie they achieve something a'm only in favor of shutown if oe get a wind out of it but it turns out that this shut down is not likely to achieve anything the substant of win you need nor to offset the par catastrophe that would be trubide running against to congress that is completely this functional there is johnson yesterday the other big priority for ou con try of course is the fungin of our government and we have been workin in good faith or round the clock every single day for monts and and weeks and over the last several days quite literally or hon the clok to get that jup dot we have very op to misstic o i a hope that the other leaders cannot can told to the sam we believe that we can get to agreement on these issues an prevent a government shut out and that is our first to responsibility again it looks as though johnson will avert the the problem when it comes to the govrnment shut down mecs again why han democrats o political victory for minimal gaine but when it comes to ou crane again that is where bidon is going bids gen run on that republicans have the advantage right now on the border they hav the advantage in metal eastern policy they couldalso have the advantage on you crane if they would simply articulate a policy that makes any sort of sense but again it is too fragmentary in the house and bidon's own vagueness on policy and on what he actually seeks there is is not going to is not going to make up for republican failures when it comes to even passing a thing i figure all we want pass the thing in the house that is what the houses for just do that an jus take an toer example the house had proposed the passage of an israel aid only bill and jobidn threaten o vito it but why not ake himvito it why not make the senator's vote on it the republicans and how still have not passed that out of committee it was rejected for a sort of the the giant voice vote that happens whereby by popular consent youre just lad pushd thebill ford does n't mean republicans cannot do it they can the lobitof smart politics evert go a long way because again jobidon is incredibly vulnerable cayn't just one second we are gong to get to the republicanside of the eye what it means that is nonald trump was able to win almost seventy per sent of the vote n

the benshpirshos monterbakexpress if vepien prhapes he is a right not a privilege te fend your right that express vepian da coms lish men yesterday comela harris said something extraordinarily wise it was a rare moment of shining brilliants from our very historic vice president here she was every electso thi alway talk about this is thenos election of our lifetime lorenth this on is i have been in for sentan blestan thering the courso ting bypresent ha many thitsuations were it becomes clear to ma that there in a people of every agan antante by the way couti something about being the first that let than ano thet omat to be a limited by other peoples limited a understanding of who can do wlat yes indeed twenty twenty four is shaping up to be vmost election of our lifetime not just an election the most election in other words a complete osho while america awaits the supreme court ruling on whether or not colorado can bar donal trump from the ballat other statesturn out considering how they can folow colorados suit and barthe leading republican cansidate in america theu likely nomina for the presidency from the ballot entirely according to the yeur times there least fifteen other states besides colordo considering barring trump from the ballat including four state lawsuits in michigan oregan new jursy and was conson and eleven federal lowsues and elaska arizonan avout a new york the mexgo south carolina texas fror mont virginia west virginia and wyomen right now the caseis in arizona and michigan have already been dismissed in trum favor but they have now been appealed if the supreme court does not take up the colorado cats vust leave it there then trump will remain off the ballot in colorado and we can be sure this insanity will be repeated anywhere there is a democratic supreme court or legislature and governor in fact jest yesterday the california lieutenant governor alena coolanackus wrote a letter to the california secretary of state begging for her to quote explore every legal option to remove president donal trump from california's twenty twenty four presidential primary ballat hileriously cenolaccus is apparently illiterat she writes in her letterquote the constitution is clear you must be forty years old and not an insurrectionist actually have to be thirty five but same difference now it is clearer the colorado supreme court is legally in the wrong even trump's biggest atractors say here is trump's former turning general bilbar whoas hardly been a trump ally in the days since the twenty twenty election as you knowi i strongly oposed on a trum for the republican nomination but i think that this case is is legally wrong and untenable and i think this kind of action of stretching the law taking these hypergressive positionce tho try to a no trump at of the race a ar countopordoctive the back fire as i eea feeds un grievants just a fir feets on oxygon and this is can and a as agrievance that helps and here is cris cristy who is running a campaign simply and specifically to throw dirt in trump's eye i do not believe tottle trump should be prevented for the cristylites this place court o these should be prevented for the cristulates tis for the votors of this country well that does not matter those who hate trump believe that it is morally justifiable to use literally any means necessary to keep him from the white house according to a brannewpoll from yugub fifty four per cent of americans approve of the colorout of states supreme court's decision to boot trump from the ballet including eighty four per cent of democrats majority of americans according to this poll believe that the collar om statesprimcourt should boot trump from vallot does not boat particularly well for the actual election cycle that is not because these people believe the legal theory behind wat the colorado supreme courtjust did it is because they believe that any club available to slam trump in the skull must be used hey're in the same camp as merry trump trumps neese who know one had ever heard of five years ago but who is now made a nice crer for herself bashing her uncle fabulousny to day from the colorado supreme court a who ruled the donald trump yastonal trump the insurrection is anti american anti democratic fatos to for some pis or reasin is leading the republican dominated concess by fifty points or something is not eligible to be on the ballad for the republican primary in that state this is amazingnews yes it is going to go to a the united states supreme ourt but if they are able to read english they should concur with this decision this legal scholar who is a psychologist by the way has for legal thoughts jo bidon is fomenting all of this by supporting the rational behind the colorado ban yesterday he was asked about the colorado state supreme cortruling and he said that trump was certainly an insurrectionist and that should presumably bar him from the ballat ter zero question says our dottering old president no wonder republicans are up in arms if democrats are going to claim that the law can be used as a club and simultaneously that they are lawbiting citizens merely following the law trump hands are similarly ina pick up any club at hand tht's why trump fands are increasingly cheering his applause line about temporary dectatorship here is some of those fans for example they cannot say that he is while there ie man they are saying tha's coming after his political oppoents but littely that is exactly everything theyre accusing this man of doing his littely what has been going ong at for the last that is why have no wan day one dictator that is why have no onever dictator means he is doing to drill baby drill i'll s n me upf that dictatorsip anywher o gay again the idea is that trumps language abat to tatorship anall the rest of it by which you really means just usingt executive authority in the same ways thet bidin anobama used executive authority when people say this sort ofthng the reason their saying it is specifically because democrats claim tat they are protemocracy at the same time they seek two thwarted in a variety of ways and if democrats truly seek to bar trum from the ballad across the country republicans will presumably do the same thing two democrats hures texasis lieutenant governor dampatric arizona try this about ten years ago tut our lawis different it simply says that our log forcement can arest any one a take the men a do backrad check photograph to finger prents if they sawl them cross the border il legally a we can do that or if they happen to reveal in the arestop that they across o legally and then the madistrict will send the back and we will escort them to the border and theyave a thoice they go to jail or they go back if they go back and try to come back again a we are restom agin the penal to get thiev at the higher were fat op in fac see what happening colorado to ny lar makes me think except we believe in democracy of texas maybe we should take jobag off the ballad and texas for allowing eight million people to cross the borders since he is been president again section three of the fourteentho menmen does suggest thif you take sides agains to america if you take side to the merica's enemies if you undermine the constitution maybe that acts as caused to emove somebody from the ballot america is indeed on the precipice of something truly dangeris question are there now any conditions under which republicans willaccept a biden victory at this point if tobidin winds the twenty twenty four election how many republicans are going to simply say o ka done here and elections an election on the other side are there any conditions under which democrats will accept a trump victory and if not what comes next the answer is nothing very good twenty twenty four is indeed going to be very election the most election as comela harris says get ready in one second we will get to the polls donal from waig out in front nationally ut some interesting things happening in new hampshire in the primary first are you traveling for at the holidays if pure talk has he covered because they just added international roaming to

per cent off your very first month of coverage okasup looking at the national pollsdonal trump is experiencing on surprisingly a fairly significan bump after the coler at of supreme court just did what it did accoring to latest quinipiac pole trump is up nationally sixty seven per cent to eleven per cent for to santis an eleven per cent for hailey two thirds of the national vote behind donald trump in the various states becan se trump continuing to leed fairly significantly in iowa the latest fock business poll has trump up at fifty two per cent to santis at eighteen and nickey hailey at sixteen even if you combined both of their per centages theywould be at thirty four per cent eighteen per cent behind donald trump he has a significant lead over in iowa new hampshir is a bit of different story according to a new s b s pole new hampshire trump is at forty fore but nicky hailey is at thirty per cent chris christy is at twelve per cent if you added together chris christies support an nickee haley support if cristy wore to get out of the race as he showd that wouldlook a competitive state they need move down south to south carolina and things could theoretically get a little interesting bse ofporse nickee haley is the former governor of south carolina nationally speaking the trump verseis bidin poles they art tightening a little bit quinipiac has biden up one forty seven to forty six the conimist yugof has them tide at forty three morning consult has trump up by two at forty for to forty two and again this is hout works as trump gets back in the headlines the poles ten to tighten but tween trump and by this is why anybody who is suggesting that is can be a run away for trump i do not see te evidence for that anybody whos suggesting tha is can be a run away for biden iwon'c to the evidence of that either this thing could seriously go either way and a lot is to pendint on the candidate strategy jobiden is going to try to run a basement strategy andasi can work ould se the curent precident of the united states donall trump should be running a basement strategy if donald trump runs a basement strategy in twenty twenty tforf he does exactly what tobiden did in twenty twenty f just goes down to his basement and watchers sharkuee from now un ti the election very solid shot that he becomes president again but one ofthe big problems that the aran se is having is this is a big election youare nochus for donal trump but fror the republican cenate for example republicans have the upper hand in a bunch of cenete races that they need in order to regain the majority in the cenate but the aron te has no cash cos all the money is getting sucked up into trump world and trump does not spend the cash on re publican candidate in these various areas according to rob priors whois a political tunkee research director for the calforine targebook he has statistics on aren se cash on hand at the end of november by year in twenty sixteen the aron se had twenty one million dollars on hand in twenty eighteen twenty seven million dollars in twenty twenty fifty eight million dollars twenty wenty one sixty five million dollars as of twenty twenty three the aren see cash on hand is less than ten million dollars being no one is giving to the ar rend se at's a real problem if you are loking in a bunch of competitive congretional races and senate races where donal trump is not cling to spend one igoda of his time tatet that is the reality of the race and again the at the idea that trumpto con a walka way with the thng i understand that trump does not strategy and trump really does not planning is on the ground game is not really existent he serve throws it out there and then hopes and praise that victory will murge maybe it will i'm not saing it canps i'm just saying that right now the arensy is short on cash trump has no ground game and no actural strategy in a lot of these states the best thng he could do right now it is get him prose on board to actuallep run the on the ground get out the vote campaign if he wins the primaries which presumably he will and then he neds to go t the basement and shut up and watch jobide be bad president speaking of which jobidon's presidency it continues to be a mass he cannot take clear political positions on nearly anything on the one hand you have the state department for the united states saying that israel should basically be allowed to defend itself by taking out commass which is good your secretary state tony blinkin saying that yesterday what is striking to me is that even ans agan we here i many countries urging the and to i s conflic witwe at all to see i her versually noin sang demanding a amoss that its stot hiding behind civilians that it lay dot it is ars that is surrender this is over to morrow if amoss does that this would ive et over a month ago six weeks ago if amoss i done that and how could the how could it be that there are no demands mad of the aggressor and only demands made of tevictim it would be good there was a strong in anational voice pressing amoss to do what is necessary to endthess it obviously that is good bat the same exact time the united states is dow negotiating with the most i sleeve international politics a wretched hive of scomman villany the united nations in order to facilitake the passage of some sort of uan security council resolution about sees firers and humanitarryan aide andall theresg that its ssta mess of policy inside the bide administration because apparently they lack the courage of their own convictions

american interes nor to thy advance the cause of security for our alli israel we also believe it jeppardize zefforts to destroy the terrist organization commoss and secure the release of all hostages from our positions on the intelligence arm service and forein a fairs commtt wehave consistently pushe for israel to shift its milistaries military strategy there h's been no significant change now i've a question what is it what its eclite that changel plike seriusly all recomendations welcome people keep saying that israel ought to be more humane than eud preserve civilian life better they needs to go in on the ground and be more careful israel has lost but a hundred and thirty soldiers in the gosscrip already all of them very young men and israel is sacrificing those lives in order to save civilians obviously but there is this bezar mentality that now prevails among many americans in which war does not exist or if war does existed supposed to be clean it is pmost be precise that is not how war works this letter includes the following idiotic line by the y we know from personal and offan painful experience you cannot destroy a terror ideology with military force alone and it can in fact make it worse well the way the you actually destroy a terror ideology is with long term occupation pasctification in counter in and counter in surgeoncy tactics that is actually how you destroy a terror ideology over time it is certainly is not by making consessions to terrorus which is what a sease fire would be as blinkin correctly stated and meawhile commoses openly thanking it is

shipping lanes the woothe rebels vowd t retalliate if attacked it despite rising tentions in the redsy on wednesday traders reacted with relative calm even as shipping companies thatverted more cargoes twall turn if rooves while the threat of more severe destruption persists the responsife energy markets has been muted compare with dramatic moves in prices sparked by some other passed atbrics violence in the middles will yimen to compares nineteen seventy three of course s there is the gint oil in bargle fom salty arabia but the reality of the situation is that when you have again ragtag whoth you pirates in inflatables with rones are holding up one of the key choke points for global trade that is a serious problem and as not just a serious problem because of what happening in the red sea it is a serious problem becaus once states that hate the united states one's countries that have interest adverse to our own realize that they can drive america off the ball in the area of freedom of the seas they can really affect the global economy in significant and severe ways onasha ya map this a map of maritime choke points across the world and a lot f people do not think about exactly how the stuff that you want gets to you but the reality is that there are these choke points on places where huge percentage of trade actually moves s if you cannot see the map there are again a bunch of things labelled on the smappl try to describe for you places that trade moves and in these are bottlemaks places that very often are are close to nations that r adversary ultit to the united states the number one choke point the primary choke point for asia is place called the strait of mulocka it is very close to china and has the ability if you close it to really affects chinas economy alternatively because it is very close to china you could see china attempt to make a gressive moves in the strait of maloka it accounts for about twenty five percents of all traded goods and a third of all seaborn oil and that that is it that is a choke point another choke point the tiwan straits in china is threatening tiwan they are also threatening the tiwan traits which is a place where a lot of trade moves if you look at for example the straid of hormoos is oneof the areas the ron is currently threatening thirty percent of all oil traded on the world's oceans passes through the strait of or moves is it moves from the middle east and down through the bab elmandub strait which t another place where a lot o oil moves ad then up through thes to us canal again all these places threatened bit eron and aranean proxies soy have china which is threaening the tiwan traits and the stratamalocka and you have middle eastern contryes adversarial to america aron threatening the straid of hormoos the babelmandub straid as canal forcing people to travel all the way around the southern tip of africa the cape of good hope which the much longer trip it increases all of your prices what this really means is that again if america does not guarrente freedom of the seas then what you are going to end up with is a crater global economy at the be has of countries that hate the united states and seek to curb our power and the chinese are seeing the weakness apparently according to a b sanoes last night chinese present egusian ping told preseden hua biten directly at their recen summit the china will reunify with tiwan it was unclear whether basion plans to use force in its efforts to reunify with tiwan but she indicated they will try at first to do peacefully k words there being at first s has said as much publicly what is notworthy is that he said this bluntly to the president at a summit intended to thaw of their relations john kerby told oreport is qhat im not can get into specificts of the discussion between the two leaders i think you can understand o nokon to read out that private conversation he said presidenci has been public and clear about his desires for reunification that is non something different or new we have been clear and the president was cear with yougis an with presdentgue we still at here to the one china policy we do not support in dependents for tiwan we also on support a change in the status quo unilaterally and certainly not one by force and as the president has said there is no reason for thes to come to blows asked about whether you us involvement in two other lobal conflicts you crane and gaza alters is previous commentment to defentiwan from any chinese military action bi and reiterated in november the u us position in favor of the one china policy which is basically just blet us not talk about this one chinapolicies sure tiwan is part of the one china policy and also if you attack tiwan will defended probably ti stretegic vagueness bidan said look i reiterate what i've saids as i've become president and what every previous presidet of late has said that we maintain an agreement thereis one china policy i'm not gon to change that that is nonkon to change and that is about the extent to which we discussed it apparently in a read out of the summit chinas at quogisian ping elaborated on his principal position on the tiwan issue and point it out the tiwan issue has always been the most importan and sensitive issue in sino uus relations china attaches importance to the relevant positive statement's made by the united states at the bally meeting china will be unified and inevitably will be unified according tojust military in telligence g has been instructing his military to be ready by twenty twenty seven to invade tiwan that obviously is a timline that could be moved up pretty dramatically if g sense is global weakness by the west in unwillingness to use for example naval power in pursuit of the freedom of the sees that coul continue to be a serious prob and it goes also to a general belief in the united states that we can randomly sort of cut off our own military without real consequence t the american people we spend o much money we shuld be more isolationist and all of the rest that is in fact also a massive problem when it comes to american under investment that is particularly true with regard to the navy the navy does the bigest share of the lifting when it comes tue war making in suring freedom of trade and did a recent facts episode all about this you go check it out on you tue but the navy represents about twenty three presen of our annual military butch that slower than buth the army and the air force not only that thu s has fure operating naval carrier staye than it did for decades to go thou us navy keeps tung amout growing while shrinking relying ond better t acnowledgin make up for lack of ships one of the things that we have seen historically with you uss military policy is whenever the us militaries well wi'll do it fewer but better that tends to work out not particularly well with you talk about the occupa tion ofa roch or the or talking about invy it nom using much more military technology but doin graduated ascollation that does not actually work you need e lots of ships in the water to challenge to the chinese we have three hndred fifty five ships now they do have what they call a gray water navy meaning that they are really relegated to coostal areas to do serious battle but the thing is the time onstrait for them tha s basically a coostal battle admiral charles richrd commander of youistri each a command sedin twenty twenty to as i acsess our level of deturnsagainst china the ship is slowly sinking it is sinking slowly but it is sinking as fundamentally they are putting capability in the field faster than we are as those curves keep going it is not on a matter how good our operating planes or hw good ur commanders are or how good our forces are or not can have enough of them that is a very near ten problem undersea cipabilities is still the one true a semetric advantage we have against our ponents but unless we pick up pays the terms of getting our maitenance protmis fix getting new construction going if we can'p figure that out we are not konto put ourselves in a good position to maintains trategic toturn to national defences on quote again when s is threatening tiwan the reason he is doing that is because if the united states an italies cannot even to tur the hoothies an hagan in to tur a massive military power the chinese and that does have serious spill over a facts an know everybody to preten that war making and economics are completely disconnected from each other that isolationism has no actual consequences that is wrong not only is that wrong its connected to a bazar view ha've how the economy works in general i'll get to that in just one second first i've ben

vacillation it is connected to a a deeper view of the american economy that i think is totally and deeply flod if the reality is freedom of the seas has allowed you to live a better life style freedom of the seas ye spread of democracy the spread of liberalism the possibility of free trade all these things have a real world impact on you atarkey in the united states is possible but super duper expensive itis basic e con one o one you get youn go down to the local mcdonaege ioug pick up a hamburger for a couple of boc do much it it take to produce that hamburgr in your back yard i grot thet tos go and buy a cow to then slaughter the cow process tfoe cow to grove the wheat to grow all the ingredients to do all the stuff a lot of money supply chains supply lines comparative advantage all of these things manter it is why efficion ces are created tat allow you to go get pretty much any proct you want on amazon for an a fordable price it is why people have been living better lives consistently over the course of time it is because of the rise of free trade it is because the broadening of supply lines it is because of that comparative advantage that many people to rip upon it is because of for lack of a better turm libertariang economics now i am not a liberatarian when it comes to social policy beause i think libertarianism is ignorant of what it is that makes human being tick when it comes to social policy because we are not just atomized individuals wheare members of communities and iwas it is really important part of being a fulfilled human being capable of living e full human life and experience and building institutions and raising families and all the rest however when it comes to economics there is this phrase that is been used been toss around a lot by people on the right of late i'l ay that two cheers for capitalism and always think o myself that is that is that is a dum phrase as suppose of three cheers for capitalism why i's capitalism does not solve all your problems well da i mean da i'm i'm always confuses why any one would think capitalism would solve literally all of your problems only a marksists materialist would think that economics can solve all of your problems economics cansolve all you probles it consolve some of your economic problems but a cantsolve spiritual problems it cannot solve the romis youre having withyour wife economics is not going to solve whatever family issues you have or whethe youare church is breaking down in fact depending on t economic system it can exascrbate some of those conflicts what economics can do depending on the system is make things better and cheaper and more plentiful and innovative that is what economics can do when people say two cheers for libera for i for economics or to two chers for capitalism i think myself tin thing two cheers for a hammer well no i mean it 'depend what yu'r doing for hetting a nail three cheers for the hammer if you are if you are holding a baby zero ceers for the hammer what what exactly is it that you are attempting to do with the tool what is the system you are describ it the reason thas comes to mine in's because i've had sort of this long standing debate with tucker carlson about the nature of economics in the united states and what we should be pursuing tucker n ie to this really interesting interview couple years ago now prily long in that a five years ago now where we talked about of the role of the government in the economy and tucker has a significantly more socialistic view of the economy tha i d just platonlys tha evin he is in dorse for example many of the plans of senator elizabeth warren i's not a slanderig and sucker i mean it something that he will say openly and clearly h ho was during an intervy the other day with glen greenwald who is also bee a guest on my program and dom an theyre talking of an econ economics and tucker went into this rans about the evils of libertya rian economics and i think this is short sighted i i i think it is really damaging to the future of american prosperity and it relies on a bunch of falsehoods with regard to how the world works no i'm won ter listen to this bes i again i think this has spill over effects for foreign policy it assumes that the best policy is going to be protectionists thet high teriffs around america's borders are whatcan make american people wealthier and better off it assumes that in uninvolved americ on the world's fear of somehow going to make american citizens better off its all predicated on this notion of economics that ignores the importance of comparative advantage and price structure and all the rest in favor of vaguer concepts beauty now again i'm not anti beauty but when i need a hambogr i more interested the hambuger than i am in the venostomilo in any case huris tolker n han i won break this downelopics it is interesting i think a lot of people ill have a waging tre being ow demonstrable fact that libertarian econoomics was a scam perpertrated by the beneficeries of the ecotoc that they were defending thet created this whole intellectual onevera second i'd i do not lit i do not this conspiracy theorizing about the nature of libertarian economics libertary economics as the government should not control the free flow of goods and services that is all the breturn economic ses a free market has property rights for you and government cannot get involve tha is the opposite of a conspiracy theory i conspiracy is when a group of powerful people restructure in entire economy a round particular interest for example if you were to push for it a protectionis policy that is a policy design to protect specific people in your country in a particular industry from competicion from other people on the contry and also elsewhere that is the goal of it that is an actual codra of powerful pople shipping the economic system for everyone a baseline rule which is that you have freely alienatable goods and services you can alienate your own labor you can some one can pay you for your labor at a given wage a that is that is not a conspiracy me giving you the ability to actually trade with other people i'm i'm confuses to how that would be a conspiracy by me not may not end to the benefit of people who are less competitive in a particular industry and there may be very good reasons to protect certain industryes for example for national security reasons i think that we shul be cutting down on trade from china becuse i do not think we huld en riching are enemies that is a different thing from saying that economically speaking there is its grut this thi secret group of libertarin economist who for their own benefitliy milton freedmen wath sittng inthe backromanies i neen to be rich and the only way i'm going to be rich is if there is free market economics u that is that is just not true it is just not true there is a a kind of politics that lot of people are engaged in these days called emotivism it is a basic philosophy that suggests that the reason your opponents are doing the thing they are doing is because of their own emotions are doing beause ae badly motive it becaus they want the worst for you i thinkt oan ugly way to do politics nmust ac actual evidence that that is the ca es it is a conspiracy way to do politics it turns out that some people have ideas thatae diferen from you sometimes it is because theyre corroptor the're being paid o what ever it is but many cases it is becaue thea just disagree i only tucker saying what he sayingttye's being paid off erecause he is a vested interest and stoi account of object to this idea that anyone who disagrees dis agrees because they are frunch actively harm somebody else i i do not thing that is the case when your talking about for example free market economics here is moretucker watural frame work to justify the private ecquhity calltsure that is hall it ot the country that is e min personal unic seen at a close my who life i think it is a fair syspent i'm i think a smarter way to i sassin economic system is by its resalts you can assigne whatever name you want to the economic system of the nite stages can cal it market capitalism you can call it wem youcn call all host to different things but i i do not think any that is useful those are boring conversations tthey cn't you ask does the seconomic system produse a lot of dollar stores and if it does it is not a system that you want because it degrades people and it makes ta lives worse and it increases expenentially the amout of ugliness and your society and anything that increases ugliness is evil and its just cot lets or star there if it is suching it system whyde we have allwayse dollar stores ook that that is not amazing statement why exactly are dollar stores the revol evil first of all i should point out a this plant that according can some reports eighty eight per cent of americans shop af dollar stores at least occasionally my family shops at the dollar sore at least occasionally almost a thord of respondence in the twenty twenty one can sume report survey they shop at dollar stores more than once a month this sees a really leadest attitude it seems om dollar stores are good you buy things for eigh dollar or a least you did until jobiden took offisin and flay to the currency now's the five dollar store it is good to have products a your disposal for cheaper this a good thing why are we frowning upon this it seems to me a much much worse systems a sistin the produces no dollar stores a system that produces more expens if goods and services that force your family to pay more a system that for example relies on gilds and does not prettu stoutt or relies on governments i our bred lines better than dollar store cas there are few choice sys when it comes t economics dollar sores are actually not in out when he and then he shifts into this discussion of it increases uglines nomp wen' ic out uglines r we tolk aouik to physical stature of dollar stores thesornotlyc gorgeous gothic edifices es it t the're not beautiful to look at whell obviously that is true obviously it is true that is dollar sores are not beautiful to look at they will lik big box stores also that is one of the reasons you can get the product for cheap at the dollar store it' if they look dothic cato thedrals that if the upcharge you on product in ordr to pay for the gothic cathedral looking place ere you buying your tomadoes whic you be weird t there is this kind of break that is happening here where from an eleat perspective they do not that it looks bad tat there is an ugly store at the corner of own that makes it possible for you to feed your family that seems rely eledis to me it also seems to be disconnected from history if yhe go to hungary which is a country that a lott of people love and and has a lot of history to it and allot of the arctecture that is spectacomin wood pesh is an incredibly beautiful city i can tell you because this is theway tht worked an hungary for hundreds of years nobody was running the farmers market from the church that a hut outside the equivalent of the dollar store in hungary is not a gothic cathedral a gothic cathedral is a gothic cathedral the equivalent of a dollar store in hungary for hundreds of years was an out door stall in the market that was significantly worse for produces than for example ai dollar store here is a thing about america america as always one the beauties of americats the reason wy weare world power this wone hers we have always been a nasont and then obviously dominant world power it is because in america function frequently defeats beauty as a priority isamericans are a pragmatic and practical people whor are seeking to better the lives of their citizens throut things economic opportunity which means more tollar stores not fewer dollar stores not only now shop at them tons people work at them go back to elecsus to tokfill ready in eighteen thirty one and this is nothing new i i oknow where this idea came from that america was always filled with gorgeous adifices it is not true the vassmajority of early american history was filled with abandoned log cabins here is woat elecsus to toefil wrihtes in democracy in america quote thus the european quits his cottage to go to inhabit trans atlantic shores and the american who is borne on the same coast plunges in turn into the solitudes of the center of america this double movement of emigration at never stops it begins deep in europe it continues over the great ocean it follows a cross the solitudes of the new world millions of men advance at once toward the same point on the horizon their language their religion their moors their moories differ their goal as common they were told that fortune is to be found somewhere toward the west tand they gloff in haste to meet it sometimes man advances quickly the wilderness reappears behind him the forest is only bent underneath his feet as soon as he has passed it recovers it is not rare when passing through the new states of the west to encountar abandoneds wellings in the middle of the woods often one dis covers the debris of a hut in the deepest solitude and one is astonished to come across partial clearangs which at tast at once to human power and human in constancy in europe we habitually regard restiveness of mind an moderates as ider for wealth extreme love thof independence as great social dangers it is precisely all these things that guarantee a long and peaceful future to the american republics is elecis totokefill ready in eighteen thirty one to centuries ago without these restive passions the population would be concentrated around certain places an wood as among us soon feel needs difficult to satisfied what a chappy country is the new world where mans vices are almost as useful to society as as his virtues the american republics an our day are companies of merchans form to exploit an common the wilderness lands of the new world and busy in a commers that is prospering andthen he talks about what exactly log cabins looked in america he says quote at the extreme limits of the con federated states on the boundaries of society an wilderness stands a population of party adventurers who in order to flee the poverty ready to afflict them under their father's roofs have no fear of plunging into the solitudes of america and seeking a new native country there scarcely arrived at a place that will serve as a refudge for him the pioneer hastily fell som trees and raises tha cabin under the leaves now might build a dollar store nothing offers more miserable aspect than thse icolated dwellings the traveller who approaches them toward evening perceives from a far the flame of the hearth glittering through the walls and at night if the wind comes up he hears the roof of foliage rustling in the midst of the trees of the forest who could not believe that this poor cottage serves as he refuge for corseness and ignorance yet one must not establish any re lation but tween the pioneer and the place that serves as his refuge all is primitive and savage round him but he is to speak the result of eighteen centuries of work and experience he wears the clothing of the towns he speaks their language he knows the past is curious about the future argues about the present heis a very civilized man who for a time submits to livingin the middle of the woods who plunges into the wilderness of the new world of the bible a hatchet and newspapers it is difficult to amagine how incredibly rapidly thought circulates within this wilderness there is scarcely a pioneers cabin where one does not encounter some odd volumes of shakespeare i recall having read the feutal drama of henry the fifth for the first time in a log house and the sort of scorn that is being poured on people who shop at the dollar store in the name of the people is very weird to me i do not understand it it does 't make sents what makes lives better four middle class and lower in come americans is freedom of the sees trade better product at a cheaper price and their lives contract public opinion arganig but well get to more on this and just one second first the benshipperosho is supported by grand canyon university and a fordable private christian

it i's put up in in a big box you steel frame building thut that same cretip couldhae ben label it coul av been levied at track housing across america the nineteen thirties fortys fifties houere the golden ero when every one was seeking a house by thewy our houses now much bigger but these were the this the golden ear according to many of the people who are now proclaiming the american economics has done us wrong those track houses are ugly they are not beautiful but the purpose of the track house was to give a man a plot of land to live on and a house to have and they were built cheap if youare been these wood frame houses from nineteen forty they were thrown up and they all looked the same and here is a picture of track housing incincinaty this look beautiful to you this picture of track housing incincinaty this it not beautiful this is not this not ad to the beauty theres oni gorgeous about these track houses incinsinaty except for the opportunity provide to a person to live in his own home with his family maybethese people shop at the dollar store i do not know it turns out that more than forty million housing units were built in the united states during the thirty year period folloing the en of world were too at least thirty mllion of those were single family homes and a huge per centage o those were these track houses and again thrown up do not look eastern colonials are not beautiful all they did is provide people with opportunity that is what libertarian economics actually doz tpeople buy these tracks of land they build track houses an then thy sellthem and as for the notion that libertary economics as sort f hollowed out america i'm sorry but it is not true it is simply not true there certain industries in the united states that have gone away as the world supply chains have become more broad and divers we do not make lot o tea shirts here in the u ninted states any more for example but has life becoming easier for the normal american over the course of time absolutely it has and anybody who denies that ho take a trip back to nineteen eighty and see how the walkman is working tho trug but the cost of food for example according to maryan to pe writing over human progress they started with the nineteen nineteen nominal prices of forty two foditems ranging from a pound of surloin stake to a dozen oranges han they assessed how much timeyouwould have to work in or to buy those things in nineteen nineten and then forward to to day they say quote we find that the unweighted average time price of our foo of our forty two food items fell by eighty seven per cents between nineteen nineteen and twenty nineteen the total time price i eithe nominal price divided by the nominal ourly wage of our basket of forty two food tems fell from twenty seven point three hours of work in nineteen nineteen to three point eight five hours in twenty nineteen by thewat is an excellent way of measuring whether life's gotten easier or harder not on terms of wage numbers or price numbers because those are fungible there there changeable to twinfleetian statistics in value the dollar andall the rest of it the question is how long you had to work in order to earn a particular good well when it comes to food you hads work eighty seven per cent less to day for the same basket of food for which ywe have had work a century ago does that mean that libertary economis betraye everybody then sound it to me sounds far from it to me an again the problem with all of this is that when yu throw that out whn you throw out that entire system you fail to recognize the counter which is what happens afterward when you get ridof the feedom of the seas when china does grab those choke points when the sus conal is closed when we go isolationist when the united states retreats within narn boards d you think life gets better for americans or worse for americans markedly a lot worse for americans when all those dollar stores to sappearicas nothing costi dollar any more do you thin it is easier for american slive or harder for americans to live and by the way youcan have a lot of time left over and money left over to build those beautiful gothic art architecture pieces that is the real question america has prospered because a merica is free when it comes economics free market economic suddensolve all your problems but

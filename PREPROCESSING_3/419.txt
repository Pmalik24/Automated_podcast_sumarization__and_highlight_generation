whelcome to the ubermensciencescience pacetoi am endrhubermen and ofm ro professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor emily balcheddus doctor balchedisis a professor of psychology at new york university her laboratory studies motivation goal setting and tools for successful goal completion i learned about doctor balchedis's work some years ago because i'm a vision scientist that is i study the visual system and i heard about this incredible psychologist at new york university who was studying how vision that is how we visualize problems can predict whether r not we successfully overcome challenges and how we stratagize in order to set and meet goals and in twenty twenty i learnd of doctor balcheddus's book which was written for the general public entitled clearer close or better how successful people see the world and i read both the hard copy of the book and listen to the audio book and i absolutely loved the material as you will learn directly from doctor balcheddus to day how people visualize a problem that is whethe or not they think of a goal or a problem as residing at the top of a very steep hill or on the top of a shallower hill or whether or not they visualize a goal or a problem as far off in the distance or closer to them in the distance visually in their mind strongly dictates whether or not they will arrive at the challenge of meeting a goal wer overcoming a problem with more energy or less energy indeed it dictates whethe r not they can push to immediate milestones or whether or not they will think they have to overcome the entire task all at once basically doctor balcheddus's work has discovered that how we visualize a problem or a goal in our mind has everything to do with how we lean into that goal whethe or not we think of it is overwhelming or tractable whether or not we think that we can overcome that goal and then it will lead to yet more possible rewards in goals or whetheror not we feel that we are going to arrive at the finish line ad than just be overwhelmed with fatigue in other words how you visualize things in your mind and when i say visualize i mean literally how you visualize them as a visual problem or a visual goal has everything to do with whether or not you will be able to meet those goals and whether not they will lead to still greater goals that you will be able to achieve to day's episode is an espessially important one i believe because you are going to learn about quality purereviewed science from the expert in this field of goal setting motivation and pursuit and you are also going to learn an immense number of practical tools that you can apply toward your educational goals your career goals relationship goals goals of any sort by the end of to day's episode you will be better equipped to set and achieve your goals doctorabalchedis also shares with us her own experiences of how to set visualizes and achieve goals and she does that within the context of harol as apparent as somebody navigating relationships of various kinds and a demanding career again i think that you will find the information to day to be both extremely academically grounded in terms of research extremely practical and realistic in terms of how you might apply it in your own life before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is element element is an electorolike drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar nowsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephosits and cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to elector ratio of one thousand miligrams thats one grahm of sodium two under milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kond of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element dock com slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el emente dok com slash hubermen and now for m discussion with doctor emily belchettus e thanks ore being here hit is my pleasure i've been looking forwar to the for a long tine because thre's a vision scientist is also very interested in realize tools and goal setting and motivation your work land squarely in the middle of those interests just to kick things off can tell us just a little bit about the relationship between perception and in percular how we see the world and goal setting and goal retrieval it is a vast landscape but you are the expert soi turn that over to you and then as time goes on i may have some additional questions as it relates to diferent kinds of vision but what is the deal with vision and motivation how do those two things lincon totally i meu not iliver me when pthy cholegist ask epi how are you what r you doing to help ma progress on your goals is thay all kinds of things couple of tings always top to the top it is i shok myself in encouraging ways himself self peptok sor i remand myself of how important it is to to do this job or now i'll put up posted notes ov ow and i to a constantly benagging me about what i need to do theses are common tactics that people use what will notice is that is a really effortful having at constantly remind yourself having a constantly talkd yourself having a create those postted notes remember to look at them all of that takes a lot of time and effort and committment and what is surprise that people burn out it is exciting to work on a goal when youe when you first sat it you might make some initial progress but an eventually we get not even to the half way point but before things get real things are our challenging and we fall by the wayside and that is i think because os tactics that are are go to strategies are themselves a goal to maintain it is double sited were putting much on ourselves to try to advance the thing that we originally set out to accomplish thet i with my team as try to thing of lok what are strategies thit do not require as much effort that we can automate that we can take advantage of what is already happening within ourselves within our body within our mind that might overcome one of those challengeis that will be easier more automated and that is what we started to land on the idea of vision we look at the world without even thinking of it for those of us that are insited and and we thought what the arth there are strategies that we can use to look at the world in a different way and that we can automate that might help us to overcome some obstacles to make progress on our goals to may be literally see opportunities that we had not been able to see before we started playing around with the idea of visual illusions to see do be believen know that there is other ways of seeing things around them can we tweak that ares te room for intervention can we encourage people or im to take a new way of looking tust to see things that they havn't seen before and that is what really opene us up to trying to look at that intersection between vision science and motivation science scrat and a i we say in here i'm strongly by used as a vision scientists tht your vision is the dominant sense by which we navigate the world in survive i love this idea of rereal world real time access division and i'm certainly familiar with how gual settingers or posted and in magnets on refrigrators can have an immediat in fact wit an overtime an they become part of the visual landscape that you overlook them an we know as vision scientist if something is stably in the environment eventually your blind to it that makes good sense you have publish a number of studies in this area but a maybe could highlight some of the more awhat you would consider n important findings in the area of how people can a just their vision in order to meet goals more quickly and more efficiently an perhaps also how we com we all arrive at goals with different visual perceptions and that in some way may divide us into highly motivated and less modivated people inother words a what is the link between vision and moivation and how can we leverage that in order to better retarcles totally iu know we started thinking about what are the gales tat aur most important a people that they struggle with the most we asked hundreds thousands of people what their new year's resolutions are we look to all the other pols that that do the same kind of work and regardless of where you look or who you ask for when you ask i people's number one goal is something related to their health right sod to lose waigt to exercise more to to get out get more steps for mental well being physical well being and and that is the number one goal every january first if if we were able to accomplish that goal you think it would drop a little bit in the rankings but it doesnat because it is really hard we thought i wonder if there is a way for us to make some progress on that on helping people to exercise better more often stick to it longer and and make some progress there we know diets do not work and why it why do not diet's wrkt for the same reason that that self talk does not work is that you kow we go in it ful bore hard core and it requires a major commitment an effort to a life stile change again we were looking for something that might be easier than that that could produce big big pay off right that is that is the golden ticket is something that requires last effort for a bigger pay off whne are the first things that i did was a go over to brooklyn to this old armory building you sood theuse to be a military armory spay sand and o ther bi yes a beautiful building out the houses a lot of businessness rord wiplants on the walls theether business is there is a couple armories all around on the the the borrougs here around new york city and ant in one in brooklin in paticular is now wym s a right it is a family why m s a that is within as beautiful old red brick building that youse to be a military establishment long long ago and whats really cool is that one winter after afternoon a yeu somebody had invited me a physical tharapists said you should come out on and check out whats happening here with your interests in exercise and trying to find new ways of helping people an you tactics that they can add to their tool belt i thin you caon find some interesting people tat are working out there they was showed up i look around there is families there is new moms there is kids that ar in a moms trying to get kids to burn off some winter energy that they have there is people that look their just there for there every couple of days goine out for a run there some people that look their training with ha team and that is who this physical tharapist introduced introduced me to is thet was the coach of this team here is a mutch peole evwer sitting down on the ground and i would be hard presse to know who ise the high school student that is in this group and then who as it turns out are some of the fastest runners in the world one of the peoplethat was in the the last olympics before i showed up when the gold metal for the for hundred meter and and from the looks of them i'm mea course the're bodies are in better shape than mine but there is nothing pretensithe course are not wearing their meals ors nothing pretensious about how there walking around or anything that that would led me to nother hi's person's amazing and they probably have some inside that i do not have once i got introduced to them in new who are these people that were par of this a pretty a leat a training team that happen to work out at this family jim ah i the chance to talk with them about what strategies do you use now i am not an a weat runner and a having recently had a baby i'm not really a runner right now at all but i thought when these people are running i but they are hiper aware of everything that is going on in theyr surroundings where are they relative to the competition what is happening in their priferal vision wats going on on the side whose behind them who is in front of them they probably have the slike master sense this master visual plan at any point in time and that is what probly makes them a lead in a certain asking them is that the case tou do you really pay attention to what is in your surroundings what is behind you whats on the side they said know likeall of them said no and sometimes when i do do that it is a mistake it does not work for me that was surprising totally win against my intuition about what they do that likely contributes to their success what they said an stud was that they are hyper focust they assume this narrowed focus of attention almost a spot light is is shining on a target now whenthey'r running a short distance that target might literally be the finish line the line that they are trying to cross but's a longer distance they set sub goals you knw the person the shorts on the person up ahead that they are trying to beat or they choose some sort of stable land markd a sign that that they would pass by and a spot light es shining just on that or they have blinders on the sides of their face that is all they are paying attention to really narrowed scope of attention and that was a strategy that they that all o tese aleat athletes said that they used in those that were better rather than im that then slower were once that used it more and i thought let us something the can play with ilikethey are a leat and they are accomplished but that visual strategy is not it necessarily something that you have to be in the perfect physical condition to be able to adopt and i wonder cannot help the rest of us who are not competing for an olympic gold and who have no chance of ever getting on but who want to exercise better have a better have a better time doing it and maintain a commitment to that exercise goal t they might have that they might otherwise you kow't by february are march be giving up on if they had said at at the beginning of of january that is really where the work started was what you might call ik focust groups are case studies of these incredible athletes and a and though we dids other studies looking at you on't people who are notolympic athletes but who are competitive and new york road runners runners and how are they running in races and what we found is that those people have better pace faster pace better time a they use that narrowed strategy more often then this more expanceeve or open scope of attention nd tere seem to be a correlation between that better performance among a wider swath of hundreds of of runners e're doing it competitively but still you now could be the person that you are sitting next to in the office or yourself i and the more often that they did it the and the more am consistently they had adopt did that that technique of the narrowed focuss of attention that seums that they were doing better in their runs then we started thinking my coqe what about people who who are not competed runners what about my mom we can can can she do that or me when i'm trying to get back on the band wagon an exercise more is this ta tactic we can teach people the answer is yes we can tell people about what these olympic athletes are doing you can tell them about what the new york road runners runners are doing and just using the same language that i dist use with you right agin that there is a spotligkt shining just on a target choose choose something up ahead the stop sine two blocks up that you can you can just see and you n imagine that you you have blinders on tht you are not really paying attention oft people that are passing by or the buildings of the garbage cans or the or the truck setter on the road tone those out and folkus in on that target till you hit it and then choose another one right recalebrate choose the next goal an we would test cannot people do that ifyou are listening rigt now we how weoure imagining that experience too in the answers yes i can imagine that i know what those words mean and i can do that and our work found that too if people can do that we have them say out loud what is it that is captured your attention and of course some times something in the pifery movement captueres our gaze an and wer our pulled there for for an instand but than we can refocuss up again and adopt that narrowed attention now one are the first studies that we did was was teach that strategy and juck suppose are compare it against a group that we said just look around naturally ou know you might see that finishd line up ahead and ther's things on the perifery whatever your eyes want to do whatever you think it is gon a work best feel free to do that untils what ou're looking at then we gave them a finish line we created sort of an exercise that is moderately challenging a but possible we put ankle weights on that that accounted for about fifteen percent of their body weight told them to lift their knees up sort of high stepping to a finish line sothis woud be challenging a for them to do a but we said you knowsn't indicator of over all health and fitness some of these people had narrowed heir focus of attention and some were just looking more expansively or naturally and what we found is that those people that we train just everyday normal people doing this this moderately challenging exercise they were able to move twenty seven per cent faster they coan do the exercise more quickly and the set it hurt seventeen per cent less the exercise was exactly the same for all the people we set we set the weight and we set the distance it was in you kow our labsbay it was a con constrained anvironment everybody was in the same sort of circumstance but yet their experience was really different we helped them to move faster burn caleryes at a higher rate right exercise more efficiently the amount of time they put in as gen to produce a better a physical out come and it also i did not hurt them right thei're saying it does not hurt as much we were really excited about that right because it meant that this strategy we could use on on people who were not at le athledes it coun be easily adopted a quick training session t can teach people to look at the world in a different way again this narrowed a tention was different tand whatever they do naturally the comparison group a but it had a big outcome it had a big difference on the way that they were engaged in the exercise those some of the first work that we did and then since an we have done thatdozens more studies til lok an what happens a that and an what else can we do with playin around with this o those are impressive differences at's a consequence of narrowing visual attention couple questions about the actual practice of narrowing attention is there any indication of whether or not subjects a are constantly updating theire visual tention for instance if atets say the goal line is in view literally from the beginning i can imagine just holding visual attention on on the goa line but am if it is a oval tract or it is a trajectory out long a trail or through a city how often do you think they are updating their am their visual aperture ind setting a visual goal and i could imagine that there is some energetic expense to that that a meaning how you wouln't want to do every crack on the sidewalk unless those cracks on the sidewalk werrey far apart rbecause i think it some point that itself would be exhausted am is their an optimal strategy or a semi optimal strategy yes those olympic athletes that we that we started by interviewing they tended to be sprinters they were mor often sprinter short distance printers when they said yes i narrow in more than i assume an expansive focus that is because they are not going that far right they have to do it as fast as humanly possible but they are not going not far and we sert at asking that question too about would not that be tiring and the answer is yes when we start to look tha wle people who are not sprnters who are accomplished but who are more long distance runners that is what we find that they do is that they an ou know they are using that narrowed attention strategy stratigically and it increases in use they use it mor often as the race progressies and they really start to do thi in a major switch an a about the half way point of say a ten kilometer runs people who are seasoned runners they really start making a switch with what they are looking at about half way through am and not's were they more often more frequently and are more intentionally adopting a narrowed focus of attention when they are in the last couple miles of a run when maybe ther resources are studing aget more thin may be their motivation starting to fad tat tipping point in the middle is with any kind of goal where people struggle most aand nots when they are doubling down on a strategy that they know to be effective you knon at first longer distance runners are are not using that narrowed strategy there as they are looking more expansively an because i think that that first of all distraction is a thing if useful not necessarily that they are distracting themselves be cause people are still trying to hold peace and jostle among proably and more concentrated group of runners an but it is a strategy that they use and then sort of wen off of n as the b ase goes through and at's particularly effective when we are looking for that last push right the last push to get over the finished line when l you might be literally neck and neck with somebody that you'r you are trying to to just be out or when you are most tired but tha lst push yeu do not want a you do not want to drop off am you ynowing you wen a when you want to push through hard through that finish line nout whem people are using it at its peap level of intensity i se ye i to me this makes total sense why it would work a without going down the the rabbit whole of visual nur science uf on the cor another time when we do these vergents ig movements when we bring our as to avisual target it is clear that some of the brains semd circuitory for alertness gets a engaged ato a greater degree the other thing is hat we know that when we focus on an object that yet the objects of the eye change and narrow the visual feel that brings about this is a very detail question bat 'm sure the audienceis is wondering if lets ay unfocused on a goal line or or a intermediate goal ore the focus gon a specific qaintors it can of the entire horizon of that goal because the finish line is indeed a line am in of course is is it is impossible to know what some one is actually doing in their minds ey but how do people report this do they see it literally is a spot and if how broad is that spot yes it is tha tha the lengt of of their aperture rather than the may be the diameter wit the fer sper size of it am you kow in our interviews with people are our sir focus group studies am it seems its more a a circular point and nots in fact what we are teaching people what we are training them to do rather than going broadly looking across a line from left to wriht we are encouraging them to they imagine a circle of light thats shining on some target now cross o finish line is a line but if they'r staying in their lane the're on a track right you can imagine that there is that there is a circle shining just on where and their lane il cross that finishd line or if its a stopsine you coand imagine a circle of light illuminating that that is what we are teaching people to use in that what seems to be effective to maintain that focus rather thans are being pulled to engage with perferal vision andther're some amazing people i'm some runners in history jon been wa samuel sand shes one of the first a female marathon competitoris who as want as one multiple marithons she is canady anything she is on filfhry to correct me li ten marathons and in her life aand she talks about sort of not assuming this te this wide but but narrow what wide but nots deep or tall a attentional focus she talks about finding the short som somebody ahead of me and focusing on on those shorts until she passes them and then resetting that gal in her interviews that she is done with runners magazines she talks about it in terms of this the circle of attention i think i've experience to solobit am because we are busiy new york now to do this interview and a runners here seem more competitive the recreational runners youre see more competeve walk people walking in the street seem compeio youre walking at near pace to somebody they'l quickly speed up fou speed oup they will speed up i thnk here been some studies about walking speed indifferent cities an new york ranks among the fastest walkers round i will not mention the slowest walking cities cas we do not want a cast any judgments but a fascinating a and again makes total sense space on the way the the vicial system measures both space and time and way ll getting to libit later but a'm curious whether not this the whole thing works in reverse as well meaning at do people who are very motive to exercise do they think this way naturally a people who are raverse to exercise or who find it hard to get motivated to exercise do they view the world differently literally i have much that i can say about this im if you will humor me il give you a couple different a stories about now we can answer that do you dn't ove to do a deep dive in o vision science which of course you are capable of doing a but but what i can share with you is sum animal studies where this work an a first started this is in the nineteen forties nineteen fifties rat labs mice labs and they were looking ou knot those were the first models of of a of human behavior that people were were trying to understand motivation motivation science within they would ou know deprive these poor rats and mice of food or water that they were motivated to to get it they are hungry and they were thirsty and they had practice running a maze wo they knew where they could find that food or water whatever that they were looking for and what these resarchers wer studying was the peace of of movement through the maze as thes as the rats were going through the maze theythey found that even though these rats were hungry and their having to expend limited colloric i am energy to make it to the finish ling they ashally ran faster the closer they got to that finishd line once that finish ling became nearer to them they actually no use their resources probably in a suboptumaly to make sure that they crossd the finish lining got their reward it was some of the first early work that that was showing that proximity to a goal increase as the investment in in resources of people that animals iews to meet that goal even when they do not have that much to spare and with the mice the same kind of thing they were the actually had the little harnesses on them theyare looking at how hard do the mice poal a to try to make it to the food or the water that they were trying to get and same deal the closer they got to to getting their reward the harder they were pulling even thoughthey did not have that that much energy to spare and they had already use sum up getting to that finish line that was that was that early animal research from the nineteen fortiese nineteen fifties than spurred a whole wave of of work in humans to humans do the same thing and even when they are tired but they can they can see or they can feel that their goal is close do they double down and work even harder to cross that finish line yeither a literal finish line of for tunking about exercise or metaphorical finish line of word talking about any other ken of goal that people might have and the answer is yes they called that the goal radient hypothesis te closer you get to the goal generally the harder people and animals work to to finish that goal that is what led us then to think oka those rats those mice those people are seeing a finish line may and it is when there may be seeing that finish line seeing that reward seeing me goald or hoping to accomplish that is what is leading them to you no try harder to invest more that they can finish it off what if we induce that allusion of proximity what if we can induce a visual illusion a visual experience am that approximates what the real rats in mice were exwere actually experiencing as they got closer that is what is happening that is what is happening visually when we create that narrowed focus of attention when we tell people imagine there is a spot light on the shorts of the person up ahead or the stop sine that your seeing it induces an illusion of proximity that then is responsible for people trying harder walking faster feeling that it defie their expectations and tha it was not as that as they thought it would be we do things measure measure their visual experience how far away is that finish line course we can ask them to report in feet how mamy feet is it but that is challenging right nobody really knows what three feet verses four feet really looks but what they do we can ask them how many feet it is we also ue these other measures of visual matching measures to know that distance of the finish line looks about as far away is as as this other tar get their matching up their visual experiences what we know is that in ducing that narrowed focus of attention is creating an illusion of proximity that goal looks closer to them and then there is all kinds of down stream motivational psychological effects that happen from feeling your closer by by by visually misperseeving that space hey can have a really positive consequence your first question was which way does it go does it go both ways that people who are better runners happend to do this thing yes some of our research showis that that if they for whatever reason happened upon this strategy and continued to practise it they tend to be the better runners but we also know from our experimence in the lab but we take people who do not know about these strategies and by a flip of the coin we randomly assign them to either learn the strategy and use it or do whatever comes naturally to them we can create that illusion of proximity that has at direct and causil impact on improving the performance when they'r exercising yes it it goes both ways that you can also teach yourself that you do not have to disrely onunluck luck of the draw for being a person who happens to be that er at exercising or whose eyes happen to do this on their arm i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens ath letic greens now called ag one is a vitamen mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional neens i've been taking outh letic green since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereason i story taking outh letic greens and the reason i still take outh letic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that i need for got health our got is very important ce populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiotics enouth letic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition ith letic greens contains a number of adaptigens vitements and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastecripe if you to try outh letic greens you can go to ath letic green stock calm slash humormen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up outhletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d three k too again that is that letic greenstock calm slash humormen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitem ind three k to the most pressing question i have in my mind is can we i all of us use this strategy to make the starting line a goal point because for a lot of people it is not about going from start to finish it is about getting to start and you i would say here i'm estimating but fifteen per cent of the content on social media is about motivation and how to get motivated to do things on nor chemicals dopamen of course being at the heart of motivation i in my mind making strong links between some of these visual aperture effects and gollines and dopenine a that we could also dive into but the simple question is can i use this finish line strategy to make the start line a goal and get my system more engaged or motivated and is there any physiology or physiological changes i should say to reflect the idea that may be just visually focussing on the start line would acshl get me more excited as suppose to make me less excited to engage in effort there' certainly vision science that is tied up in that very first stage of of gol setting identifing wha thatcal is in the first place in taking thus first steps a lot of people's go two strategies tat involv vision are our vision boards or dream bords or hostet nots riht theyre creating some sort of visual representation of what it is that they want to accomplish where is it that i want to be in five years ten days ten years whatever whatever that time line is that their working under the idea o vision boards or dream boards is that you almost a scrap book collect visual icons that reflect where you want to be to motivate yourself the really common tactic that people use and it is not that to do that wright for some people just even knowing what they want in life is a made your accomplishment defining the goal cannot be really challenging for people and that is astrategy that works and involves our visual experience it is not just people are not saying what n't you just sit around and and imagin what you want your life to be in ten years the strategy that people are suggesting is know cut out the pictures put it on a board and stick it by your bassroom mirror you see it every day ranig a list make a list is whan i begon these lists i lood friends wil yu have made your list yad the list of things that you insist on having in the context of titniss relation should job its etter its etter the seems worn work home yat totally in the ideas writ it down writhor telling you write it down or or create a visual manifestation of it a and yah that that is effective for identifying what you want but it may not actually be effective for helping you to meet the goal to get the job done colleagues of min at your university a have probed why why is that whys just ino thinking about what you want in your life and a instead of putting yourself vicuriously into those shoes imagining what my life will be if i can accomplish everything on this list why does not that wa walfers of all does at work thancers know and why does it not work a because what happens these colligues gabryal utengen and and her and her researcham have found is that on a going through and dreaming about or or visualizing how great my life will be when i get exlianse done a that is that is a goal satisfied i have identified what it is that i want i've experienced it even if just in an imaginary way i've had that positive experience of o thinking about wut how great my life is goine to be when i get this thing done and its starch a sort of rest on their laurels she is actually measured sostolic blood pressure and heart rate and they found that people who do that who go through that experience o visualizing how great my life will be when i get expiansy done the're they are sostolic blood pressure the bottom number on your blood pressure reading decreases okey now i'm all about finding ways to relax especially in new york right you are constantly living at a high level of stimulation and cool great maybe i should just think about how asson my life will be when i get my buck bye bucketless done but motivations scientists know that sestolic blood pr sure is actually an indicator of our bodies readiness tick it up an act to do something now that can be the going out for a walk going out for a run hitting the gim it can also be things doing mat problems i even if it is it is something that is just mentals to stalk bly pressure actually goes up in anticipation of your body or your mind needing to do something taking the first steps on a goal then it is it helps us to understand of i oke if i've just created this dream board this vision board and put myself psycho logically in that space of a goal satisfied why is it bad that blood pressure goes down because it means your body is chilling out it is ire acral i just accomplish something pretty major iad actually now do not have the physiological resource is at the ready to take the first step right now to do something about that that was a pretty monu mental i'm a fine thing from motivation scientists to understand thatly creating these dream boards these vision boards or to do this might actualy back fire because itn in it of itself is the creation of a goal and the sfatisfaction of the goal and people understandibly give themselves some time to disenjoy tha positive experience much for the secret exactly exactly guess now the secret folks will come after me works i tri i never say the mam i i'm not for any say the a o my ni imagine that certain strategies myt work for the people but i everything you are saying again is consistent what we know about the physiology of dopomin circuits for motivation i 've of a good friend who perhaps incincidentally perhaps not is a cardeologist at a major university said that a one of the major errors that people make with book writing in completion is they will tell people they gon to write a book and people will say oh you deafunly shou write a book ever ones gata lof your book and the never and upwriting it and his theory is that they get much do not peme reward from that immediate feed back with all the protection of never having the book criticized that they never write the book i'm sure their exceptions to this but 'm i guess it raises the question what is the better strategy yet i'm not saying the people who enjoy a dream board creation should stop with their doing that is not the take come message here and it merbord no deafly not that nothere is enogh anxiety ind fear in the world wee dont ee doing ridge more of in but the process of goal setting shon stop with articulating what the goal is a at that same point that we are trying to figure out what we want to do what what is my vision for the future in those planning sessions we need to simultaneously a think about a couple other things one is i how are we can get there take it out of the abstract take it out of this i i dilic of visual i canography and sare thinking about the practical day to day we need to break it down into more managible goals not just my ten year plan for myself but my to weak plan what what can i accomplish in the next two weeks and the two weeks after that is gon to set me on the right trajectory that is probably not surprising ten nybody who is been thinking about how do i set goals better plan plan big picture think bing picture abstractly but then also break it down more concretely that is prbably not surprising but it is an important aspect of the goal setting process thend again gabryel outngen mi department has identified a third often overlooked your under appreciated stage that has to happen at that goal in the goal setting process and that is thinking about the obstacles that stand in your way of success and that it will actually help improve motivation in the long run and sometimes you will think that that his counter in to itiv you are saying for if i want it increase my motivation have more motivation than i need to think about how hard it is going to be all the ways that i'm going a fail how is that an aljas me up hows i goin o help me get through when i actually when when when things get hard but it does because it is coming up with a plan be a plan see plande in advance of actually experiencing that if you were on a boat in the boat started to sink that is not the time you woen t start looking for life jackets you aredyo want o knowher one is you can go to it right away and's the same thing with goal setting is that you want to know what are my working towards time yoan to get there and if i experience this obstacle here is what i'm n ta do about it you may never experience that obstacle but if you do you'e probably gon to be shy on time hen on resources maybe experiencing an anxiety that high jacts your brain you are not functioning at that optimal level of judgment decision making hou want at already have the snap next step in place you can just hop to it may we not can to do our best thinking when we are in crisis mode a but we do not have to if we have used if we have already used our resources in advance to come up with that plan be or that plan sea michael phelp's incredible athlete right this is a man that he and his coach have routinely incorporated into there a into their training i love the story that back in two thousand eight he was hot hot for the first time on the international stage was the bajang olympic michael felps was on the brink of doing something that no one else in the history of the olympic games has ever done which his whin a gold metals in a single olympiad at the time of this story he had already one setven and he had just the two hundred fly in front of him before he could do what no one else has ever done when the aithgold metal and the fly is his thing right this should have been this should ave been easy a no brainer he is goin to win thas he is goin to break alympic history as soon as he dove in to the pool his goggles started to leak and by the time he had done three langts of the pool he just had to flip around and and come back to the to the starting line flash venishe lying back to the edge a by the time that happened his goggles were completely filled with water in hewas swimming blind i would a panic i would a sunk to the bottom a pool i wouldn have t been in the pool to be honest i'm not a swimmer defley not going to be in the olympics but ah but for him he did not it was not a moment of panic yould probably would have been for nearly every other person in that situation because he had foreshadowed t hat kind of possible failure he hat imagine that obstacle hitting him in advance and not even tos imagined it but practiced at what will we do he routeenle practised swimming with his goggles not fully secured on his face coach notoriously wut iripped the goggles off of his head smashd him on the ground for maybe dramatic af fact or something that he did not even have any goggles possible to grab as he is as he is in practice because he had forshadow that possibility an the solution if my goggles start to leak then i will do in his case start counting my strokes then i'll make it through he knew exactly how many strokes thit would take from him to get one end of the pool to the other is tare to counting his strokes he one thahe won that race the two hundred five one as ate cold metal and you goon to win fifteen more in his career e might not all be swimmers we might not all spire to olympic level performance but i love that example because i think itat help sort of de mistify or give us an alternative perspective on the importance i and the motivational reasons why thinking about obstacles and advance thinking about the ways the two three four ways that your plan might go ary is actually effective at helping us to overcome the obstacle that might otherwise lead us to throw in the towel that is an beautiful example i'm going to spring bord off that example to ask a question that has also been on my mind which is is there really anything special about vision because in the example you just gave it was indeed vision that michael phelps was deprived of and it was counting strokes counting as another form of incremental measurement the nervous system obviously am there are others that could be the sensation of of the hands smacking the water breaking the surface of the water there any number of different variables or matrics that one could use i could imagine that setting out on a let say a three mile run which for me as a decent since run it is when i do a you times we come also not a runner but i trying complete some runs a few times a week at very slow pace just from my health i could count every step that would be count of exhausting but if i knew that three miles was i ma an a estimate here outn o a couple o thousand steps i could count backward i could count forward a count every ten am i confess i spend every morning trying to fying sonlight to get sun mise to set my circatian rhythm and i do a hundred jumping jacks i'm the the guy people are looking at strange on the street but sometimes a count every tend sometimes account backwards on the at count forward is there any indication that it matters or is it simply that we attach some sort of meaning to that increment and the mode of of reaching that increment because it does seem ther something special about vision maybe i've an will but more why that is but at a very basic level how broadly or i were finally should one set the increments and does it matter if your counting staps or counting strokes if you we a maybe it is every other song you can listen to an entire albl something that i nogh people do anythor youan listen to a whole playlist and then listen to it again and you are get a wrong as long as the playlist is completed twice you can not resee see what i'm getting itbat i know peopleare going awont implement these tools and i have to guess that the nervous system is is somewhat a indiscriminante when it comes to these things but that thet might also be some pecificity i think vision especial and i think you do too a it is in for for variety of reasons when you start you can really nurt out on how cool the brain is and how cool vision is within the brain and when you do than you start to find somethings that make vision unique riht more more real estate more neurological cartex realestate is taken up by the visual sense than any other sense more than taste touch smell it vision gets more real state gets more neurological processing space than any other sense why is that well because evolution has let us to prioratize that visual the visual experience there is some cool illusions where lik maybe somebody is mouth is doing something different in what you are hearing when people said i create these in a wear tricks that might go on you toobe and go viral a and and people are trying to figureout what did i hear what did i see his mouth doing and what comes up is that people people priortize what they see over what they re hearing when the two are incompatible ore kind of out o sink every tone yet every time right if you have to bet on it bet on bet on what it is that you are looking at rather than what you are seeing why is that e i gess a couple other things you rit lat we can see superfire you can see a flickering candle on our horizon if it was a totally in a clear sky a several miles away you can see the international space stacion floating up in the in the night sky right khundreds of miles away our eyes are amazing and a and we priortize what we see that and i think that is because we never we rarely get the experience of having our visual experience second guest often times were having conversation may been allowed restauran and we know that we did not hear the person right and we say that goa' did you say that or i though you said this now ic know i did not say that rights an people will correct to us when our ears get it wrong or we are tasting something amazing and we cannot quite figure out what spices were in here and we know that our tongue is not quite picking up the the the taste the right way and that is why we read the manyou to see what are the ingredients or we asked the sheff what did you put in this it te amazing we know that our tongue is getting it wrong ore you might be touching something andyou look at the tag to see what sort of textyle was use in this really amazing piece of clothing that ou're looking to by we know that our our sense of touch is not quite getting it right but rarely do we have that experience of having our eyes get up dated were we are looking at something i think i' looking at my mom op no actuallyi was actually my husband cay that never happens am right that we have gotin vision as wrong as we might get any other thing that that we are ex eriencing through any other sense we trust our visual experience we have a sort of a naive realism that what we see reflects the world the way it actually is because it is never really fully tested we never get the inpet or the feed back that you have seen something wrong intill a visual lusion pops up on social media riht the dress exampll or the last week or there is been that horse seal lyine drawing that is been all over social media to what you see i see a horse omsas i see a seal on them yen o chaos or rups or i thought the dress was blue o i thought it was go i do not member the option cause i see it is blue a right and t and it is dividing up families and friendships because you have seen something that the other person literally cannot see and that is why we love those examples when they pop up in social medium when they do is because it defies all of our previous expectations ere's a really amazing if if this interests you i'm there is a really amazing visual artists and each kopoor who plays with these ideas too and his instalations are or just fascinating i saw one aat a museum once where an i walk down this long hall and is just a big black erectangle that is painted on the wall s this kris superfamous what the hell i's just a big black erectangle painted on the wall what is this about but oxe now this musium paid how much but whatever but then as you get closer you get closer in your eyes streth to settle in and the adapt to the different visual lighting realise it is not a black square painted on the wll it' a huge hole he is carved into the wall and there is a whole other world that is back behind ther that you cannot see right away until your eyes adapt to the different lighting conditions is amaza visions o i hav to see words as sexum it is not upright now i've i've seen am there was a retrospective several years ago that was done a insidney but his work is all over the place a nichkopor dothly definlly worth looking up because because it on the dress example or the horse seal line drawing or artist anichkopor's work that is a moment that that gives us a different unexpected insight about the world that it challenges us to to see something that we had not seen before or it induces or tricks us into seeing something that we would not 'f otherwise have seen a it it is those rare moments that i think are actually really important for understanding what to our eyes normally do because we would not find these examples surprising engaging shocking if we had routinely got the experience of realizing where not seeing the world theway that it is that is why i think vision is is special and why it is it can be thought of is a tool that we can add to our tool kit a for how to better accomplish our goals i'm not saying that we should only focus on imagining the world through a an attentional spot ligkt but maybe tht something that we can employs trotegically on occasion when we think it is getting best t help us when we need an extra little push to cross that phis the literal or metaphorical finishe line but it does not have to be the only tactic that we use just it is not bad to use vision boards but let us use something else also it is not it is not bad to talk to ourselves in encouraging ways but let us try adding another tool to our tool belt i in case that is not enough to get the job done i do think that there is great power in thinking about our visual experience alongside other tactics that we might use for meeting our goals and another one of those tactics might be the the new merrics that your talking about houe how do i think about mig jumping jacks in terms of groups of ten or as a set of a hundred you do it routinely you might be able to set a goal of a hundred and have that sustain you through number sixty number seventy when maybe its startying to get harder but for somebody who is just starting out and wants to be able to make it to a hundred that is probly no can work that is going to be maybe really that could be quite challenging for them if it is the first ten thathere trying it and instead setting those micral goals of groups of ten its goin to be useful because as we start to get to number eight or nine or number eighty eight or eighty nine and it is really getting hard we need that extra little hidonic hit of pleasure of accomplishment the migrow doplamean rush that you might get by hitting another ten nother decade miles down another group of ten miles stone and wanc to be get that little hit of pleasure excitement ore self congratulations that might be enough to sustain us through the next challenging physical obstacle the next group of ten that we might experience there is not any prescription that i would give and say every person should decide that twenty five jumping jacks is the goal no we have to be idiosencratic and in introspect about where we at with this goal this thing that i'm trying to accomplish and set those goals realistically but inspirationally as well we ont a set a goal that will challenge us but is not impossible we do not wan to set goals that are too easy because we are not in a trick ourselves in a feeling great about doing one jumping jack pey great lypretty sure must peopoal if that is a goal they can do one eugen a feel great when you hit thacal no because it was too easy you did not have any doubt that you could do that one but what about twenty five oge thai magh feel pretty goodabout that will hat about the next group of twenty five and now i'm at fifty those or gals that might seem just beyond the brink of what is possible but i will feel good when i hit that and nots gan it give me the next sort of boost of energy that i'mean a need to go a litle bet further either that time or the next time yi think vision is special again i'm strongly bas to your my youthe reason i i initually learn about your work o was well now you have this amazing book but at the time there was not the book ther were just the scientific papers and of course upon which tha the book rest o and those papers are really important what was the relationshoipd between vision and i obviousyis our sense of space but how the sense of space and time ore related and to on the the idea quite simpl fo thos listening when you narrow your visual window your measuring the time ben also get smaller right which make sense when you hear it wereas if you take on a huge visual landscape you ashy carving up time differently it sor moving from a slow frame rate to a fine frame rate ou n a slow motion camera as ashaly taking a lot more snap shots risesy measuring distance over time more finely and were strode would be the other example which as strode is very low frequency you are going here here here as opposed to ou n a slow motion riht strode gves a a course a the course view into the time domain and high speed for tardby gies a fime you in the time to make i'm almost certain without any knowledge of underline date a am i'm but knowledge of the mechanism them i am almost certain if not certain that by placing a narrow visual aperture we change the way we perceive time now i have a question and i to be os i know the answer in advance but i'd love for you to tell us a bit about how some of this works still further in reverse meaning how unfit people view the world verses how fit people o ther world or how unmotivated people visually see the world as sopposed to highly motivated people y you talked about the easyly runnerse yive the michael phelps as example but a'm maybe could describe that study i think it is a particularly important one mostly because yes it identifies a perhaps of physiological or psychological differences between motivated and unmotivated or or a fit and unfit people but it also provides a a path to to remedy that yes o u no there is out of my lab but also out of several other labsers been work looking looking at that relation between states of the body and visual experience as i'm they have not necessarily tried to to to integrate the motivation science element i'm to it but they were looking to see divisual experiences change as a function of different states of our bodies they looked at people who experience chronic fatigue i'm the elderly people who are overweighed im those that our in wearing wearing heavy back packs and wve ar sort of put into that experience of being over weight what happens to their perceptions of the environment what they find is that distances look further to those that are overweight chronically tired older rather than younger weighted down with i with extra baggage i'm distances look further in hills looks steeper we have we have done some of these studies too where we try to i give people mor energy or or deprived them of of energy ensee does that change theare their perception of space and we did that by know i sort of classic tacneque of a double blind study where the practicemen does not really know what their experienceing a thooung a sa double espresso that is also i god psycholagical experience to give people a y a double blind experiment where the parcusbeen does notreally know the the full extent of what what they are doing a their experiencing and and the research or whose inter acting with them also does not you don they do this a loted medical studies yot give somebodea a drug and you give somebody a placibo a sugar pill and then importantly nobody really knows who ise got what untill you have analyzed all the data and the results are revealed that that these are the people that that had the drug the active agent same idea ind the psychological research an this case what we did is give people coolad to drink and for some people that coolad was sweetened with sugar and actual coloric entity it could give them energy other people drank could sweetened with splenda ye it is sweet but it actually does not have any coloric value you are not giving people energy you are just giving them that that experience a of of sweetness now some people of course are really good it identifying what is what is real sugar in what splenda but when you put it in a coolad a pretty noxious powder it actually masked it for everybody and nobody had any idea as it is gorbit li garp a you go i la an i'm sure ther many people that love cooly by yas els ar coolad wul wll reveal te theer ye i grew up in nebrasca actually where couolade is from it originated in nabraska i do feel i'm betrying my routs slagly by im by casting some shade on coulad but a but but that is how it worked is that we aske them to guess what they got we tested them afterwards and they were wrong nobody is able to guess a with accuracy what was youre drink sweetened wit which is important because they were blind thae the way that scientists use that they did not know what it was that they were drinking we give it a we give them about ten to fifteen minutes for that sugar to metabolize and we measured a they are circulating bood blucosts levels to make sure that we had in fact to given their body circutly no circulating blue coast energy that they might use in the next im activity and a and the research ar again did not know whether they had just served sugar or splenda then we aske people to estimate distance we gave some people more energy or we kept others sort of at whatever their normal level was and what we found is that those people who did not even know it but who had been given more energy by drinking coolid sweetened with sugar perceived their space as as more constricted they that visual illusion of proximitdy was in duced they felt that their finish lyine again in the contects of an exercise task was closer to them in just the same way that these other physiology labs vision science physiology labs found that people who are chronically tired who do not have do not feel to have as much energy or those that aure physically weighted down and for whom iu moving within an environment is more costly a we could create that experience for people we did not experimental version of that that if you have more energy the world looks easier the distances to have finish line o look as far that was some the experimental evidence that we had i'm to show that people states their body do impact their visual experie ence now i'm a motivation researcher for me the big question is well what is the point of that study then besides to showing this connection between the body and tha eyeis in the visual experience we think that that is fundamental to one of the reasons that people experience difficulty when their exercising when it is really harder for your body because of its physical state to move within a space why do not want you might say a whyn o hey tos go exercise because the world looks harder to them because that distance that that they are supposed to walk because a doctor tells them to or that a partner encourages them to or a hill that they should hihe up because someone told them that would be good for their health it looks more challenging to them than it does to somebody who isnat who wh is in whose inpisin better physical health now if it looks that way if it looks harder if it feels it might be harder then psychologically we know that it is when you have set yourself up psychologically mentally for that kind of failure experience i do not know that i have the resources that to get this job doneis this looks really hard you are already motivationally in a place i for this task to be closer to impossible for you to put it altogether then what we know is that people whose bodies might make it more challeging the for them to exercise i'm alr seeing the world in a more challenging way and that is having these downstream motivational in psychological effects that makes it less likely for them to try to take on the task in the first place or to experience it as harder than than other people would or do a is the solution the same however meaning if these people are taught to adjust their visual go line or to set a visual s spotlight on an intermediate gol can they overcome some of this a this challenge that they face simply by virtue of their scue perception yes in all of the studies that we have done a'm looking at that connection between this narrowed focess of attention and improvements an exercise we do not find that it only works for the people who are in shape or that a back fires for people who are out of shape it works for everybody this is a strategy that everybody can adopt because it is just simply about i what ar you allicate attentional resources to what are you sort of ignore and what are you focus on and that in that visually induces the same kind of illusion for everybody regardless of whether your overweigd or your or your at your target wei or for struggling to get their are evardy accomplished where you want to be that visual lusion can be induced for everybody and it has the same kinds of consequences terrific reallyer i made a joke about doubles presso but now make a serious statement about doubles bresso which is that it contains caffine on caffine is a stimulant all other stimulants a cause a change in our visual world im the most sailent one is the one that plece officers look for apparents suspecting that their kits have a injusted substances of any kind look for which is if somebody is pupils are unusually large forgiven visual environment u that is in indication of high levels of otanomy carousal i in the street drug translation of this ion of people take infediming or cocane wavery bipupils people vera relax of small peoples however ever once that peupil size also is dynamically regulate by how bright ofvisual environment there multil things controlling pupil size however we know that when we are very strast were very aroused in any way positive or negative the pupils get big but within the visual system whath that etquaits to is a narrowing in the visual aperture rather than justing sugar which have not guessing most of the world certainly the you asknestin just lest sugarly that is over herin osur ther few sugar you sucrenise does out their sucrosiseos who will also come after me with pitch forks but let us face it most people produ better off in jesting less simple sugar but kaffine is a great motiv ator because of the internal sense of arousal but it also narrows arfisual window i could imagine using healthy amounts of kaffine combined with a may even blinders of the sort that o horses were may be a hoody an a hant a maybeen blinders in order to get over some of those more challenging milstones as there any evidence that people are doing this without on well obviously people are doing it without knowledge of how it works but are there any studies looking at how adrennalin or aponeferin or any other stimulants in pact modivation i do not know honestly ye i mean energy drinks or a big thing now ye yet for for sure they are im and if if you actually are more physiologically aroused or jas or whatever he know jumped up or you just think you are in our studies we have found that they work in the same way that it can produce the same kinds of consequencs and i that because it tells us that you can actually change te state of your body to induce these kinds of experience says or you can tread o you can just think that you can drick yourself you can placebo affect yourself out and produce the same kinds of effects i had to give up coffee twelve years ago an not because not for any story i love the taste and o kaff is my jam but it cannot drink the kaffine because it it did not actually do the thing that it does for many other people make me feel more energise and more awake i jus got sweady and gentery and anxious and a con focus as some people who already have ey fairly highbase line level of the tension and motivation they find tit puts the autonomic see saw too far in the simpathetic tone ye no and i happen to marry the same kin person he also cannot drink kaffin but loves the taste o coffee the interesting thing is that we both have to have coffee in the morning to feel we are ready to go for the day it is just part of our routin or whatever to have that taste and have that sensation to feel a ready to take on the day even though i mean yad ye caf still has some caffine in i but were not drinking that much of it to probably actually create a kaffinated experience in our body but tricking ourselves sachologically and to anto doing that thing that in years pass used to work for us both im s that is a mean to keep in mind you might have a hoodiy that you can wear to induce that visual an allusion or you can take advantage of the power of your mind at the end of the day i'm a psychologists and i believe that we have some non seral power over what our mind is doing what were thinking about what we allika or attention to i'm that can do the tsame kind of thing that a hood ie might do or tha cup of cafine might do i i completely agreed the visual aperture is under our conscious control that is an amazing feature of origual system we can narrow or expand it takes a little bit af practice i thing for people that learn how to do this without moving their head around to expand their visual aperture and how to narrow it uwhat i ways tell people is a just imagine a really troubling tex messag yure of reall exciting text message coming in alsand you forget about the world around you it is it is it can be triggered by these outside events and we can learn had to anchor orvisual attention ad love to ask about other kinds of goals meaning non physical goals because many people ar trying to read more i would hope am or or music or a language or thinkgs that really in volve cognitive goal lines or a internal goal lines reading one chapter out of a book each night is a tangabl goal am the other that i've often wondered about or these am systems that allow you to high light individual lines or even words on a page that is very visual obviously and everything else is rolled out except that word i've always wish for books that would naturally high light each page as i say the some one put in the comments as proble existed for ten years and i'm just showing how when a lod i iam but am is there any example that or re tactic that people could use to am better approach cognive goals at school wor recreational to when that do not exist in in the kind of fitness and sport stomahoty yes just as shot out to my brother in law who has done some of that research a where it does high light different parts of words and paragraphs and yoe sounded to be in effective way for english as a second language o learners to to pick it up that that is that kiing that vision to the process of learning language is effective and im there iseen a whole cool body of iv work and resech as looking at that say you write about that if you want to mention what he does i a is is or place that people can learn more about that we can provide links i ame we won'l provide ly ty sources i want the nis or y and try n to learn a sicond language frolong ti i will note i speak spanish pretty weakly but i aud love to get better at a oll prrtulator my five year old sun speak spanish better than i do at this quaint ii yes i was thinking that to en of we we started this work within the contex of exercise but of course that is not people's only goal that they have in life im and in i it is not mine either i have interest outside of of improving my exercise game a couple years ago when when i was writing the book i i also had a child the same the same month that i had the opportunity to pull all this research together is the same month that that mysun came to be and and i started to realize i became a lot less interesting once tea was around he was fascinating but i was changing dibers and feeding a in that was it people come over what is at ave you been i tell me sonmieng that is going on in your life and all i had to talk about was as what was boring and i just felice i've lost myself i used to pride myself on the crazy adventurers and problems that we get myself in and i was a great story teller and tot all the sudden disappeared as soon as he came into the world because he became my world then i saird a thing hinee to pull back some coolness in if i ever had it the first place but i need to be a cooler person that i'm coming across right now i decided i woin learn to play drums i'm an i woung o be a us one hit wonder as as a rockstar drummer i only want one song cause i know i'm not tine able to do more than that i'm not cordinated at all from the beginning of time in fitzgray to have this really vivid flashabld memory of playing baskball for the very first time i lost my footing i knocked into my own teamate pushe herout abounds what she had the ball we lost the game and i was not invited back on the team for the next season and that formented myself definition of uncordinated i am a musician but i'm not a drummer and the idea of cordinating for limbs in real time was if i could do that be proud that is a goal that i set for myself at the same time that my sun came into this world when i wis also trying to think about goal setting and how to improve my bility and out all of our ability to to get a job done when your face with some pretty big obstacles i got to practice all these techniques that were talking about on myself and see for myself when i tell people hey try this thing narrow folces of attention does that help with something becoming a better drummer and the answer is ya you tactics at least work for me sometimes under some circumstances and the dow for other people who try them for other golds that are not necessarily about exercise im mean a one that i found particularly helpful was overcoming my bad memory that everybody's memories are faulty may everybody has sert of a a warped perception of the past it might be scewed more positively than maybe we deserve or might yousceen more negatively if you feel that what looms large and your mind as you reflect on something from the past or mstakes that you have made of the things that the socialful paus that you had or challenges that you faced at work when got in trouble with a boss or with a colleague that is what really stands out in your mind or the good side of all of those possibilities we probably are not getting the world rigke and and that is something that our brain has vaulf to give us a faulty memory to level and sharpen to not in cod and remember and be able to recall everything that we have experienced with accuracy and precision and that is a problem when it comes to assessing our own gold progress when we w ant to be our own a countant and try to determine how are we doing if i want to become a drummer am i on track for getting there befor exs before my time runs out an mi get to make it or not and i think that is in experience whether they won to be a drummer or not that a lot of people can resinate wit trying to determine is this trojectory is his rate of progress going to get the job done by axim on a time while i have my swim suit body by summer or whele i save enough for retirement by the time i hit sixty five for these goals were time is involved and there is a dead line ah we do take moments to assess our or trajectory and if we just rely on our memory we are probably going to do a bad job of assessing that them that trajectory of knowing whether wor on peace to meeting are deadline and i found that to be the cases i was thinking about mi actually cang be able to learn this song i mean i know that it is going a lot slower than a probably wood for anybody else but to give myself a dead line and a commimen i decided as goingto put on a show iwas gan invite everybody i knew and also people i did not know nd i's goingto play my one song for them a thofs wall reading you book yes ot a jo ye whend you read the book you will you will see my my story and it is the real truth of it a i man i did play that show and it was fine a and then i've a because i wote about it in the book than some other opportunities to play it publicly have come up and it is i right i told people i can play drums betters you show them that i actually stilk can play this song a yes that that is been fine i have become a one hit wonder if you asked me to play the song again uncore it is just goin to get that same song a second time thou literally won it wonder but in the processess figuring out and mi coan be able to play this show i sent out invitations the date is committed people are coming to listen to my one song god bless them a it how is i gin a go and and it felt awful it just felt i am not making progress here because there is a lot more things that actually are pressing right the kid does need to get fed i do have to go to my day job the editor is asking for the next drafted this book and that is going to take precedence it does for many people that that things command your you'r band with even when you have this goal that you have committed to and that you have got on the books and i just felt this looming anxiety about this this goal that would require did not have to be dailyu practise but you cannot you cannot cram that kind of a a goal it does take committed investment for a sustained period of time i had this looming anxiety that i'm not making good enough progress but that is because i was relying on my memory and my brain to to recall how many times did you practice what was at the last time you practice what was tat when you tried to play this bit this rif two weeks ago have you got in any better since then and it just felt now have not practise enough i do not remember when the last time i played was but a deatly does not feel im getting any better then i thought what i should stop reling an my brain to tell me where am i at and is is and myi on an upward slopeier i need to look at the data i loved data scientist love data i started o colictit on myself what i did was down lo this ap that a friend had tolld me about called the reporter apt or's lots of these kinds of things out there basically it just sets up your phone o randonly ping you with whatever questions you want your phone to ask it records your answers you can down tho the dat i could make pretty grafts to see and my getting inout what is my change and how i've answered these quest ions over time i did that for a month for a month i had my phone ask me couple times a day maybe twice a day really did you ractise since last time i asked you my phone says did you practicse if mostly it was kno and if yes then it would funnal a couple other questions how did you do how doyou feel check a couple different emotion words now about your experience o when you played when i and i did that for a month after a month when in in my office down to o data and first took stop before i looked at the number is how do i think i did over the last month and i thought same as every other month i ad i did not really get anywhere yet i practise that i still feel awful and i cried i cried having to practicse i i was upset with myself for setting the scol and feeling anxious about all i remember that i cried cried too much about this personal conquest that would not matter to anybody else honestly really does not matter in t in the scope of things anyway and not goig t become a a drummer professionally who cares if i embarrass myself publicly but what i found from the data was my memory was totally wrong actually had practised far more times than i remembered and when i looked at my emotion words that i used it was a clear upward trajectory ya i did cry that part i had not misremembered ar made up but by the end of that month i had got in a compliment from my husband who actually as a drummer and they pay u that was not that bad and ethere was one exclitive you were ing amazing at that one thing youd been practising at but look yo find ieus my husband or iis you' just it the moment it didn' really feel that grea and i downplayed it n as resulted in stick in my brain i i remember how stupid it felt that i cried because i cannot do this i cannot make progress and i downplayed in my mind the thing that actually should have been a legitimate indicator that progress was being made all of which is to say i needed to see to collect that data on myself and to look at it objectively accurately and completely because my brain was not doing that for me that visual experience of of downloading that data and and looking at ik what was my actual experience i gave me better in sight as i was trying to a sess the trajectory of my of my progress i became more accurate a countant of my own progress which is important for setting gold or resetting them when you need to calibrate in light of of what is left to do and how much time you have to do it in wll it besically if i understand correctly when the when the intermediate goals of sa daily practtis retwist to day practise or reading our math et cetera or not a visual goal line it really does help to visualize some aspect related to that nonvisual golline in the scase the reporter ap was a useful tool i've never heard of it i plenty to use it i'm sure number people will be interested in it son ther others out there but that is the one that you found most useful ye yet there is another one too im that is even more visual than that than the reporter apple though that has visual components and is really effective if you data in one o collect numbers on yourself for your experience there is another one called one second every day ap a this is really autem because the ap ism mechanism im to to to record one second of your life the goalf there is such an awesome community of people that just live by this and love having these experiences a it and the the creator of it i got to a chance to talk with and he has done this he is taken one second vidio of some aspect of his life every day for twelve years thirteen years or one sic yet one second and and then what the ap does is ll ex smash from together and give you a chronology of what your year or your month ore your last decade of life has been and presents it as a streem my nvidiopher you se you ju see these flashes aof your life over however long you tell the apta creata creata montage for you and when you see these vidos that people have made especialy those hav be doing it fairly long time it is fascinating i did that for myself toyou i tried at one second of to day's drumming performance another second 's not enough to capture and my actually doing a good job of drumming or whats my trojectory for drumming but the gon who made it says one of the most awsom one second vidios that he ever made is of a brick wall is lead aneta vidio of that what is the ball doing it osn't 's not crumbling it is not an earthquake ly under something that it is just we know slightly jettery one second of a brick wall how is that motivating or exsiting to you why as that you been doing this for thirteen years every day one seconand why is that the one second that matters to you most and he says because when it comes up in my montage it reminds me a of a rally horrific momen in my family that was the first wall that i saw when i walked out of the room having heard that my sister in law had this awful awful a experience her in testan started a twist up on themselves and not up and she i was on the brink of death and we had just found this out she had just gotten into the hospital they diagnos this issue that required immediate surgery and our family was there to hear about this and we are all stunned that she might die li could right now she might die and that is the first thing that i saw and it reminds me of how precious life is how important family is and how the rest of whatever we were doing that day did not matter because we all needed to be here together right now and that is all of this emotion a and the purpose in life is conjured up or reminded when he looks at when second of a brick wall as it cops en to his vedofe if you are visually or reented and you do want ways till i remember what was life but as ma year and review what is it what is it look iti's an ossom ap once thi can every day that that can help you do that these are great recommendations and a a couple of reflections first of all a the brick wall example is a beautiful way of a highlighting this other feature of the visual system which is that the brain largely things in symbols it is very efficient it itbatches entire experiences in to symbols an this case the brick wall can be attached to a whole set of experiences that are very meaningful to this individual that brick walls do not mean that or did not mean that a to me until hearing this i think that the it highligtes the fact that the the actual symbol is less relevant than mwhat we attached to that symbol but that symbols are efficient that even in one second view of something we can attach to it for better or for worse a the other is that i i ma absolute a almost rabid proponent of people getting morning sunlight in their eyes as the fundamental layer of setting their circating rhythms and sleep an health as a zero cost practice that believe ore not can be done any time of year anywhere and but it does to take a luibit of effort you may have to get outside you cannot do through a window or win shiel to for it to be efficien but it has huge outsize effects on human health this is now been demonstrate again and again and again and a i geto just do a sort of call to action if people are already doing this i'm going to start using the one second aft to record my a morning sunlight viewing and prove that even through cloud cover you are getting more photons than you are indoors and then it is worth while helse woed love to do this for my next dog to go from puppy to a to full sized dog and may even to the end andas am great these are wonderful tools ayu've given us a huge number of of practical tools which frankly is not always the case an on these pycasts we always strive to do scins and science spase tools is are kind of montro but you given a a rich set of tools here to apply i just wone of briefly back track to something and then and then a final question a earlier we are talking about how unfit people see the world is more challenge and maybeen hillsas steeper distances as further and how a shifting people into a state of energy either cogntively or through the ingestion of real glucos to get a energetic lift or may be through caphine if that is within their practice and span of a healthy behaviors they could do that there are many people are suffering from depression which it one of the ke features of depression as a lack of energy even though ther can be anyanxiety associate with depression a i have to wonder whether or not some of these tools are being deployed or will be deployed in the context of mental health because depression is this vicious sloop right people feel a lack of energy and hopelessness and then things just look harder and that it just verifies their negative world view i its a downward spiral that is why medication n some cases and social sportet that or can be helpful because they feel more energized the side effects off inour problem however have been have there been any efforts to implement some of these visual tools to create this increase of sostolic blood pressure in account of readiness an willingness to leang into what people perceive as events challenge and if not for any one listening i know we have a lot of listeners in the mental health spaseand in the helping space to speak i can imagine these are zouro cost mi they we all provide people are sited i have the apparapi to do it are you were of any studies thisters your laboratory volved in these studyese olodies jo see in imimmense value of imimplementing the sorts of tools that you have developed ye we have not explored that those ideas directly call to all the scientists that aur out theres is there is a great opportunity to start looking at these tools within the mental health space you are right other researchers though have a not this use of narrowed inducing a narrowedatentional focus and can they now feel more energis to go for a run but they have looked at the relationship between anxiety depression an visual experience infound over decades m evidence that people with depression or with anxiety what their attention is captured by within the bigger global surrounding world are those things that are negative or reinforcing of their world view now that happens for everybody that things that are on our mind ten to tit pop out that if whatever were thinking about we might start seeing it is some version of it showing up in the world around us that captures our attention that is an idea called priming what were thinking about might then lead us to to to attend to the world to see things in a way that a lines os what we e lready thinking about it is just that when what were thinking about are those depressive ruminative anxiety fearful a thoughts when that is what is cognitively accessible when that is what is going through our mind then that is also what captures our visual gaze when we think they the world is hard the world is full of sadness and not's the thought in our mind and then we start seeing the people with frounds on their faces or whoare experiencing anxiety and and that is what captures are attention even when there is other people around that might not be seeing the world or experiencing the world that way it becomes reinforcing when i think that the world is is threatening and then i notice the threats that are around me confirms what i'm thinking which heightens my anxiety or my fear and then at further leads me to to narrowly focus on those elements of the environment that are alined with that world view it is really hard to get out of that that is where the vicious psychal can come from that has been in a really well established within the medical community this this selective attention relating to have states of mental unwellness an that is that is been pretty well established and am and there is been some interventions done with people that have depression or anxiety trying you knows samely now here is a an array a photograph of bunch of different faces yes that is artificial kind of looks a page from a year book a high school year book but look for the faces that are smiling look at the faces that are smiling try right now spend ten minutes having your eyes focus on those an and look at those people tha it is an effective intervengin a try at improving people sense of self efficacy of what can have accomplished next they feel a litle bit more energized it does not cure depression it does not cure anxiety ndthese are literals physical i afflictions that we have that is nt a quick fix but it can produce tha temporary change that might be away to start getting out of that rat yen i think nowadays there is in increasing attention on tools that will help people orient as they are start to vere towards suicideal depression or vere back into a depressive episode or anxiety episode of en et a the trying to reverse an entire sindrum or set of sendrums is far more complicated likewise in the health space just trying to get people to deploy real time tools to a just or anxiety or to exercise more often am and on as at kind of a final but also on a highlovel question i'm imagining that an i i'v pland to use this visual goll setting of spotlighting i've been using an actully for some time on runs it works trally well yesterdi took a run near the water front here and and the entire then i did it somewhat incorrectly the entire run ofsing by getting back to the statue at which i started but i did find that i ran fastest in the final twenty meters wr admittedly was not fast at all but is faster than what preceded it am it works and it makes perfect senses to how it works you have done other studies a exploring some of the other features of vision the luminosity how bright something is and how people preceeve that that was an incompletely different contact but is there a kind of a higher level a cound of a black belt version of what we are talking about here where not only my focassing on a specific visual location as an inther intermediate or a long termed goal er i'm using an apt to ask me a question and tappen to how i'm feeling create a visual representation of my modivational state but that i'm also making my phone as bright as possible i'm also trying to take that visual window and an actually pay attention to more of the details at that location ors it simply a matter of cind of a in in geek speak visual norrow science we would just call this low spacial frequency jus ort of grabbing a black and white snop shot of something here r there in my mind if i attach more detail and effort to the specific thing that i'm focased on isthere any evidence thats more effective it certainly ou nor changes what a brains are doing ou know how do we define effectiveness that is a question for philosophers and that scientists will i eavming runing yeit will when you use it throug tha under your run dust new picked up on a yes there is athere is cool studies that narrow scientis not not i not ming from my lab that nerow scientists have done looking at dut what is it what is it doing to your brain when you have decided that you are gin a focuss your attention on on this element of the world and not pay attention to something else is that just sort of tricking your thoughts or is it doing something different to something more basic more low level and the unser is yes there is an area of the prain brain the fusive form face areats part of our brain that is really specialized for for making sense of faces important as a social species to to pay attention to other people pay attention tar faces with a trantic communicatesthrough their face our brain has developed a really specialized a central area for doing that then and peopso these narrow scientist will present a face to somebody but superimposed over that ais a house or something else that is less special to us as a social human species and both of those things because it sort of both images are sort of transparent overlaid over one another a iit our eyes are getting both of those images in and our brain is getting both of those images in but we can will ourselves to focus on the house just really pay attention of the features of the house even though everything about that face is still there to or pay atention to the face and just tell me what is it that you are deciding that you want to hold on to that you want o look at right now and you can see that the brain is responding to that when people are saing i'm really i really seen that face the details of the face some paying attention to the face even though we know their eyes are also looking at nengaged with the contents of the house that is right there smacked on top the fuse o form face area lights up and when there saying notreally focus on the house now we see activation tif yous for ma face area decline and and other ares of or the the brains neurological resreal estatesart to engage a ye i thinkyou now there something to it that weeken at a high level our brains are responding to our psychology as well and we have that great power to really with intention with practice decide how do i whe to engage with the world and cannot it produce real change in are in our bodies and in the way that we experience the world the answeris yes atastic well you given us atut of mechanistic and a conceptial and practical information speaking for a lot of people on u thank you

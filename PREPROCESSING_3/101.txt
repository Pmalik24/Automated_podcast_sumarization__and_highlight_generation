donald trump calls on the republican national committee to cancil all future go pe debates whele rona sants as finally comes out swinging against trump and called red pilled influencers our telling young men not to get married we examined whether they are right i ventfear o this is teventferro show the bmenshpir shows ponser by expressive vepini tug about them every single show why haen' you gottin a vepaniet at express we pian right out expressupiansicom slesh men already folk presiden trump is basically now to claring the primaries over and look if you look at the national pulling dato right now he is up by a long shot on the rest of the field if you compare this to sate twenty sixteen at this point in the twenty sixten races trump plas oup may be ten to twelve points on te rest of the field at this point trump is up by virtually all o the pulling about forty points over the rest of the field the latest e com mis you go pull for example has trumpet fifty three per cent to sent taid fourteen and everybody else well below ten the mon with poll before that has trump it fifty five to sants at seventeen everybody else well below ten however this is not a national primary when you look at iowa for example trumps lead it serchs to srink a little bit not that he is not in the lead but it is closer to thirty points then to forty points when you move on to new hampshire his lead again is closer to thirty points than it is to forty points at least fifth at least forty five or fifty per cent of the republican bates in these primaries does not want onal trump or at the very leass is time my voting already about people ware not donal trump and there is a asolin nmber people who donal trump but would be open to others this is what the pulling is showing right now whall trump would two cancil oll future debates because he says thet we ean to train our fire on bidon now that is ken man ironic clame coming from presiden trump whose train most of his fire at this point on various prosecutors going after him or on rod to santus he is not trained an enormous amounts fire on president bidin to this point however trying to end the primaries early is obviously in trumps best interest whethr the arons he goes along with anything that is another question according to media yesterday the trump campaign his now ask the aransee to put an end to any further primary debates following a secon debate the former president donal trump skift a note trump senior advise oure crisla seveta was sent trum the trump press office said to night's cho pedbate was is boring an inconsequentual is the first tobate nothing tat was sed will change the dinamics of the primary contes being dominated by presien end trump president trump has e forty or fifty point leadin the primary election and a ten point lead over trobiding the general electromel that is going to one pull we talke ou that pull a couple of days go theyre two supper polls have come out since then one with biding up one one with biding up five this to suggest that in the real clapotics palling average for example trump is up ten is not right in the average basically he and and biding or running within margin of erer the aron see shoud immediately put an end to any further primary debates we can train our fire on ctrooked jobiding and quit wasting time and money that could be going to a victing bidin frum the white house now again one of the probence here is that the arguments that tum trump is going spent all that money on ivicting bidnd from the white house ignores the fact that extraordinary mounts of the money that is port into trumps campaign has been spent on his legal bills and we will going forward we spent on his legal bills particularly if all of his assets are locked up in new york because of this fraud case meanwhile presiden trump is is doing the trump thing he did this u a w speech of the other day that was not to the u a s abouta w and dom a stage craft e who called stage crafty girls call it fibbing president trump stacked the room apparently withthe bunch of his own supporters many of whom ere not union members in fact there is one person carrying a scin thets at union members for str for trump who then admide to the ress tht he was not in fact a union member and had basically ben handed the son according to the uchigardian wens onal trump gave a speech in michingan on wednesday seeking to capitalized on the u a w strike at lease two crowd members holding science and union members for trump and auto workers for trump turned out to be neither according to the troy news one individual in the crowd who held the scignthnts at union members for trumpic knowledge she was not a union member when a proached by reporter after the event another person with the sign the red auto workers for trump said he was not an auto worker when asked for an interview both people did not provide their names the paper said that between for and five hundred people attended the event it was it a none unionized automotive parts supplier and clinn't oeu ven go to a unionized job he wents a none union shop to do speech about how the u a w workers deserved more and hw they are being screwed by president by nagain the general message the trump gave with regard to bidin and electric vehicl mandatesin allthe rest a lot of that is true however again the manipulation of the stage craft is pretty wild is pretty wild well donal trumps lawyers meanwhiles we say they are looking down the barrel of a real problem for donal trump with regard to his assets o people i think are not spendig enough time ano energy on the fraud ruling in new york the reacon being again all these cruminal indihtements the'regn to go whichever way the're going to go and everybody knows hat theyre politically motiveit of the fraud ruling is also politiclly motivated but the real world impacts that fraud ruling is devastating to president trump on a personal and a familial level presiden trumps lawyers apparently do not rearly know what to do be cause the judge in this case is obviously parson and obviously over the top the judge ucshe fined trumps lawyers for making arguments he did not in that last ruling according to the neror times trump could loose his grip on buildings including trump tower on fifth avenue the trumpenternational hotel looking overlooking central park and all the rest the judge cided with new york atring general latitia james and as a punishment the judge effectively revoked trumpslacences to operate all of those properties and it left much of his new york operation hanging in the balance trump is expected to appeal he is already sued just justice angeron himself who is ben a thorein in the side of the trump lwawyers for more than year in wednesday hearing trumps layers pled for clarity asking justice an gron to explain exactly what the effect of his ruling would be and the judge refuse to say it is it is totally on clear what happens now it could spell the end of the trump organization it could the fort force to sell off of several properties it couldn' basely destroyd trumps organization in new york more likely siplegal experts is sa perior in which trump would be unable to operate hus propeties which would be handed quort appoint to chief executive such an arrangemen would preserve trumps ownership while preventing him an his twoodo not sons from running the machinery of their umpie without permission frum the cort which could be a problem depending on how much leverage he is taking out against buildings for example in order to fun his his legal enterprises an all these are obstacles to to trumps reelect again it is not the trump camp be biton he is certainly cn is that a probability i thian's not a probability i think that it is eht i would say a forty to forty five per cent shot that trump would beat jobidon in i general election given his performance in the last teleshin given the fact that right now he is not the actural momine yat unti many democrats our focussing in on the failures of jobidon rather than how much they hate donal trump obviously jobidon is focussing in in tremendous fashion on trump and trump alone a he the only reason basidly that he state in the race is because trump is denominate he believes that he is the only candidate that he can beat it is more

sentually shutting down the debate is not going to work obviously but he has been far ebll to sort of skate over the top he 's dong what he wants to do an everybody else can in the scrum fighting each other well finally rondo santis is ectra trainting his fire on trump and this has been the sort of pattern when it comes to primaries with trump going all way back to twenty sixteen hoeu go back to twenty sixteen what you will see is that ted cruws an marko rubio or under the weird assumption that donald trump support base would simply collapse at a certain point and then they would just walk into the nomination that obviously did not happen instead they init up fightin each other to the end and then con casic state in to make sure the donald trump was the nominate by stucking up ten fifteen per cent of te vote in competitive primaries and donal trump waltz to the nomination despite the fact that the early states he is only whening thirty thirty five percent o ot and well to day trump is a lot stronger thane was not twenty sixteen and he isben a sitting president before a huge per senter of bas is absolutely addicted to presiden trump the love the guy and whoever is running against trump at a certain point here is going to have to stop wit this notion that trump is going to just fall off the road somewhere he is not somemons gon to have to take him on directly when the only person right now his position to do that is tht who is number two in the race ron to santis and desantis for all the slingson arrows that he is taken is basically in the poles where he is been for the last six months he is his stuck in the fifteen to twenty five per cent rage he is in in a second place holding cattern and something has to change and finally desansis who has now done two separate debates with the rest of the with the rest of the second her republicans he is beginning to fight back because he is man an argument the argument basiclly isle i i i on the last to debates and the only other soly candidate and he only i who is running double digets even against trump in these primaries threin a consolidate to field do not consolitate feeld round one candidate who has not even had to go through debate and who has a lot of blemishis on his record and said why not consolidate the field around two candidates and then let us battle it out and ten a trump lwins trump winds by the way that that is what the the poles are showing the tha the pos are showing that people believe that the dsansis one last toate for examble se an an focus scrup came out yesterday and at sn an focus group suggested that de sansus was big winer o thebate to es no te yot o but lord who you think ti best dering this debate all of you purger well christy case his tois ton te feelder wut it to tosens one two three for five six seventeight nine he one two three four five six pence from a swammin well sescot as he can sy te sans is cleared the fields when it came to t when when he came to this debate and and the poling did it support that same sort of notion five thirty eight did apole on the debate what they found is that thirty three percent of likely republican voters t o watch the debate said te sansis performed the best only five per cent said that he performed the worst nicky hailey came in second chin eighteen per cent rating as the strong estimator seven per cent rated her as the worst varon aswamme fifteen per cents at he did the best bat ten per cent allco cit hes of the worst alon people love the vaglopuple hae dbate everybody ated chris cristy tims got basely did nout register people hated my pensil performance nobody understands my dug burgam as on the state de sansis is now making the case that he should hve made a long time ago which is when it comes to winning the the general election i'm your guy i've have the roven track record in florida i have not lost to presen bine before while donal trump has and downs trum has to stop tocking to bates i's bout time for donald trump to actually tebate me ans he is now calling for one on one's bate with trump directlye here was de sanci yastery gaing a lot more aggressive with trump he is had a lok to say about me on show mety o really sence twnty twenty two right before the mid term election he started out he started attacking me when i was wa we all republicans wors best to be united for red wat now he tried to attack me at has been doing at a lot yet's one thing to do behind ta key board step up on stage an do it to my fae o day for it ye use to say i was a grat govener now bu sin your sayin the opposite let us have that tho scochit and i'll do it we can do one on on i was woth eit shon last night let us do that and let us loot's get the american people wit choice that thedeser now is trumpet actually going to do that of course not trump is not wheng that and that that should raise some questions if trump is unable to debate ron to santis who is in excellent republican governor from florida and who is the second place finisher in in all of these poles right now and by the way who actually is a threat to him and iwa i know that everybody is wrighting off to santis over all right now but the reality is that te sansis has done an enormous amount of groundwork and i whale right now to sansis is running by the latys he guess news polt in the twenty and i what trump has a major lead but tht's non the way the io caucasis run the're caucasis and those caucasis rely a lot on ground game there rl lie a lot on endorsemens i what is still very much in open question there is a world were to sances wins iwa and if if trump just keeps ignoring it di sansis men it a certain woin some he is gettiog hafe to take it to trump and sansis s gin to have to be the got who does it because no one else in the field really is capable of doing it that big problem here is that when you are looking at consolidation the field trump once the field to consoliate to just him i thare nots pre mature to do that considering again all of his vulnerabilities that we have dis cussed ranging from the fact that he is wildly unpopular with suburban women to the fact that he already lost to jobidan the first time to the fact that he does not have the self control to actually meticulously attack jobidon's recor and all the things we all know about donal trump those should be fair game for debate but consoliting the field to two is necessary at the pont if you actul want there to be any sort of race instead with munch of also rans wor staying in the field and this is ridiculous if the're were too serious candidates on the stage in that last debate ronosantis nicky haly everyone else on the stage is is isjo in terms of why they why they there they should not be there the vagu romasuwammy is not runng for present he is running for senate from ohio or he is running for a cabinet position under president trump or he is running for aa new business in the media chris christy is running a pure revenge play he is he is a homicide bomer of politics he he committed the world's most famous political murder suicide new hampshire against marcorugo basically an shuring the nomination of donald trump and apparently he wants to do the same thing again christy says i'm not going to drop out why should i drop out the answer lige shdrop out of h ous gov no shot of winning the presidential nomination why are you doing this stop ite if it ale thet to come down a new hamp sirand ther's better than any one have in a run we rit a gright camppagn in twenty sixteen how are you ginting the fif the field tit going to be wint out and if you are down e fore new hamp shir wih you drop out of the race nive ever youv fetchut of winting you hapsure thot would not drop out a before that that 'l the go got a sity aveis that whit could celld me to do but what i would also say t you is least what i see up tae new hampshure is thote trump it almost every poll well below forty persen the unbelievable arrigants of people cris cristi staying inthe race even if chris christyware woin new hampshire do you think christ christy goes on to even compete in south carolina whor any of the other primaries the answer of course is no the answer is no this field needs to winnow and in neds to anoug fast if there is can be any one to chalege men there is no one is gitnto challege trump maybe the poles are exactly right nationally speaking and trumps blowsway the rest o the field maybe fine but if there is ten be any alternative the field has to wino again i'm looking at that real cerpolitic pulling average and what your seeing that real corpolitic pulling average is that even in the national pulling trumps fifty three betmens forty seven per cent of the republican base is not in love with trump but you have eighty three candidates including cristy at two and scot at three and pens et four and romasuamy at five and haly at seven that field is going to have to winow and winow pretty quickly if anyone is going to challenge trump and again dis sansican have to get a lot more agressive on the campaign trail against trump against trump among other people and just second

jobidn's entire candidate he is relyante ontonal trumping the republican ominyt yeu went toairis on yesterday he gave a speech the entire speech was bahodonal trump is the scourge of the world and of course he has to run this campaign because if he is force to run on his record he loses she is going to run purely on the idea the donal trump is a threat ton aemocra nall thus now back in twenty twenty two some of us hanscoff to this strata tou be said while yobbut he is a bad president and his bizar speech in fontof independent all flanked by you est marines in the background with a blood red background was absurd and uglin quasy terrifying and and yet and yet because trump was seen as such a as a threat by many sort o moderate voters the the result was that the democrat's over

this garbage but the case that he is make ang is going to be and it always comes down this when is by nversas trump who is less off putting and whois the person who is going to project solidity now when it comes to record trumps record is way more solid than bidons without a doubt when it comes to personality bidn in pretically solid the good news is that 's not alive any more you'r enough to worry about whether he solid or not because corpses generally arnt all that volitile in just the secon we will get to the other flaws in gobidon's candidae cee first when it comes to the air that you breathe it is a lot more polluted than you thing an nuch stogmalic outdoors if you live in lawsangelis and your lungs are turning black i'm talking about the fact that you and your family health may

one his big probis is the fact that he is as corrupt as the day is long the house yesterday commenced their impeachment nquiry si suggested beforehand that i do not only see the strateacic need for an impeachment inquiry given the fact we are already on the re publican side looking into all if his corruption a'm not sur hol putting a stamp impeachmentor inquiry helps things other than if sor boxes you in because you do not come to in impeachment af the an of the impeachmen inquiry you exonerate the gui and the question is goin to be whathyeu have enough votes even on the republicanside of the out for an actual impeachment that means holding together your caucas in really strong fashion whic is kind of a problem since again the im peachment nquiry was launched without a vote in the house meaning thet the the majority in the house the republican hwor who is not even there and that the fact is that that mc carthy could not get enough publicans to vote on the dotted line with ar ard toin m peachmen incry to launch at that way which raise the question ast whether he isging toget enough fre publicans to bot for an actual in peachmen whic yould be a gian fail if you launch an inquiry without coming to an actuoal i peachmen you get nothing out of it the republicans did it anyway they launch the impeachmen nquiry wod people think that that was an attempt by maccarthy to stave off the right flank sangless i'm giving you guis what you want got the im peachmen inquiry what you want for me a whatever whatever this is that yesterday they had a six hour hearing on impeachmen it is not amazing for the republican party it they wouldin presents any first tand witnesses instead they heard some testimony from of a r idy of of sort of different scholars including jonathan turaley forenstic account in brusetobinski frorm a justess to parments hax turney i leano coner the they knew going in the jonathan turly was was going to say that they have not the evidence to impeach bidon yet the promim es tha that is the headline coming out of the impeachment inquiry day on is that the republicans on witness said heu cannot i pach im bason what you are right now here is jonathan turly yesterday this is the question of an impeachment inquiry it is not avote on articles of impeachment in fact i do not believe that the current evidence which support articles of impeachment that is something that an inquiry has to establish but also do believe than the house has passed the threshold for an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of president bide gaso it is that first part that everybody is foksing in on his truly saying wh do not have the evidence yats to impeach but it is okae tthet their noring sac by resays in peachment inquiry would be appropriate you see jame e raskan who sitting next to comer was leading the inquiry gens comer you see raskin his democrat and shifting in his seat gleeful that turly said that thern' havent of evidence to impeach right now well the eminence continues to emerge yesterday according to brightpart hunter bidon apparently reference selling access too president jobdn as the keys to my families only asset according to messages from hunter bdn to i cla back up released by the house ways means committey on wednesday the comittee released in formation confirming deven archer's testimony the hunter bidan travel the world selling aess to the biden brand meaning jobidon hunter referred to access to jo as quoled the keys to quote my familys only asset which is pretty strong language documents obtained by the committee confirm associates of the bidin business had direct accessto the white house and then v pchobidn's advisers according othe ommitte by n associates were told not to mention jo being involved white house logs jomany bidin business associates visited the white house mosble times in addition after the iris launched its investigation into the bian family hunter ban apparently poult expected all of the stuff to go away when his dan becomes president according to an emal between hunter bidn and he see an en producer that the committee actually obtained again the producer has an emal from hunter saying he expected all the stuff to go away when his dan becam president that is not good an that there will be more evidence to emerge forshore comer for his part he said we now have evidence that the chinese government is sending direct payments to jobins media family wile of course thastra we we knew that have you been able to iget a fie what pyctifically kill bidin did to get pay w all these people who were paying the bidons fors bout jobidon met with every singa one upupour tolk toao the fo even though he is li to the meter we wld titting theer tat with any of e me met with all they were all in trouble they were all leading helpthing that thits a if the you talk about the remanin money the eucanin money they were being investigated for corruption ing their home countryes they may be help from jobid in china this was the chines government this was the chilese government the sending direct payments to jo bidons u immediate thaen and what they neeted with hell tavigating the geurocracy thing eliminating barriers to intry in our market then all that is true and more evidence he is going to drop here an it is not going to be good for jobina sdemocrats for their part therre junking on republicans yesterday that were suggesting thet theye got nothing there is no evidence all the rest of this ken ostop but it does not matter because in the general american perception of jobi the idea that he is clean and pure and honorable no one thinks that the pul's show people think that jobi nis crop mainly cause he is corrupt but here a democrates yesterday slaying slet gogga had slag kings and queens go for it i to let us get it straight were sixty two hours away from shutting down the government of the nited states of america and republicans are launching them peachment drive based on a long de bunks indiscredited li what a day we are having here is not it right i may less t ot as a former director of emerdency management i know at disaster one i see one ni won to fant think you to mister dnald trump for calling in this hering to day we fee the long on but little hand and mister donal trum here is peter prande are all over this herin in this sham in peachment donal trunk in peachment oh how many peachments we got to there omman invintments we got for ow many probidin your owno europe donald trump is ray i'm hes sick awinning he is just wennin running away with it and that is why werk here they cannot same donal trump they cannot take away the two in peachments and the forea nigment but they can try to put some numbers on the board for jo bi but the prob is when you sling mog you got to have mon and they jus do not have anything mister chairman hinestly thay we can tinoi wen man ar shanter and we were plan a drinking am i will be jrunk by now if the romings that is smoking gun we are even a dripping water pistol they would be presenting it to day but they have got nothing on jo bidon come on if you all think there is much evidence wore here call de vot on in peachment in peach em right now first moptents that is nots how an inquiry is can for's alls on inquiry is but also guys go off you do not go off really continue to talk about this because it is

do not wait make the switch to day get yours a germy's razors atdod com meanwhile on the right a fascinating debate has broken out about the value of marriage it is whit is really interesting s that they are bunch people on the sho called red pilled riged who have now suggested that marriage is bad for men that men should not get married now the case that they are making is not the liberal feminist case that basely men are useless and terrible on womaneas man a fishneans by school or anything that the case that they are making is that the stakes of marriage have been changed by things no fault divorce custody arrangements the is child support payments and al the rest fousil support the basely the legal regimen has made it not a bargain for men to get married now i agree with with the cretique of all those possyan in no fault divorce is a disastr area i think that the child custody arrangements that that basely always go to mom no matter what that is it that is a serious prob when you shift the insensive structure there is reason why the majority of divorce of the vast masurys ivorces are now initiated by women that that is not because in the past women wortword wildly abused and today they are wildly liberated but that really is when you shifthe insensive structuon and turns out that all the risk is now taken by men women are goun be the ones who actually activ ate and push that divorce button however the red killed have taken it one step further and now theyre telling young men you should not get marred it is too dangerous to get married do not get married that foolish that is what sou let us let us go through some of these arguments beause they become very popular on the right but start with pearl dves sor pearl davis is an anti feminist who has a become petty populars as lod people label her sort of a female and retate t without the ad checkered past and tha here is pearl davis talking about marriage ther trad condaily wire conservative wher ar saying that pearls just the deman gloomer who lies about tat just bok is as on the negative never the positives and all the men complaining ar just crime and one day he comes hom and he fin tho that hd why hav called the police on him and told them that the first time they hok o ten years ago he om he had caught an corater and the truth of the matter is when a man has told her they are not his kit a man has no way to have tilldre and thosh canto be actually hite they are always hert becaus the court give f the women costidy ninety per cent of the time and rec matter really the only ont that of the money to fight it and the time i i aft the daily wire termy bowing bot wals om are if that is just cri baby they just are they just ther cry they be we man who do not man op an want to ri tho to et o the then ething becas tan that m temanding that the lawt tan an deman an women they three precossan for doing the to you go teman that mad nee to tap o an take part in te thi tem that te scriminate thegn them you the find to gol that price you will not do it but an i have the thought too i tell i found a musling girl teyded the tame thing found a cristin girl that ti the thin ty ae o to cha te g they tappen an all over whether you wanta bewevet ot it happening i do not care about your rewi then i do not care about yo turt the happen everywhere o case the argument that yhu's mang against it all these marital policies those that those are correct to arguments and nobody is disregarding the pain of men who have been wrong fully victimize under the circumstances where the insensif structure is completely stact against them that is true however the benefits of marriage are still unbelievable it does matter for you marri to pretend that there is no difference between the person the amari that is happening with christians and muslims and and to all the same that statistically untrue theres things that you can do to mitigate against the risk of divorce and the person th you marry is the chief mitigation tthe truth is that n the jewish community we always have a back up lan in the sense that every mrital contract is a preene up every marital contract s prn up radid y a jewrish ca to bu is a preine up it guarantees at certain levels of spousil support for example if you if you give at get then it it it makes prior arrangements and all the rest but oneof that the throwing out to big with bath water is not the solution how about both hw about we revise the system of law but also in the meantime you dou need to find as pous and get married to her and if what are requires for you to to feel comfortable doing that is to shift away from the state mans ateed law and toward a contract arrangement then then do that as well are we can have churches that is ponce or that sort of thing because the truth is that those are unforcible contracts and court very often the custom precustofthe arrangements an all the rat s of that sort of thing i will not go through some ofthe staffs with regard to the benefits of marigicts i think that it is also possible to exaggerate how bad things are for men as the mean there are't really bad for men who end up divorced or that women are not divorcy men and incredibly high rate over all or the women are initiating the vast majority of again i agree with many of the cretiues of curent mary law agree the lot of that stuff the problem is that when you take it far that you say that the solution for men is to not get married now what you have done is you have created a second order of fact we are unmarried men become actual menaces av the reality is that men channel there aggressive drives toward building wor they channelet toware destroying and a system in which women are unmarried and men are ununmarried that something that the left wants and if you acquiess in that then you actually end up destroying t the very fundamental bases of society that allows for the growing and building of society beyond the left est principles mot men may it my answer to pearl is both an but yes g t married and also we should work to change those laws but by the way the way that we date has it hasnan a fact on how we get married who we get married to an when i dated my wife we went in knowing as we began to date that we were not we were not going to sleep together until we were married we knew for a fact then we were going to have long conversations about things the mattered and and this is by the way the the best available dte a suggest that this is how you ended with a tangible durable marriage the last of very long time is it everybody has to be committed going in that value when you put values of the centere of dating that obguses does not mean that you are going to be impervious the possibility of divorce but it does mean ther chance of divorce are really a lot lower a lot lower now do onr ri bumpro there i dont thing i am rebing onbrole frankly but that there their bunch of other people who are making similar clans for example a bryin atless was on whatever pod cast in and here he was talking bout marriage weg you confeter a prena preen ups are regularly thrown out all the time ther typically non inforcible especially the longerar marriage goes on the less likely they are to be enforced men can absolutely destroyed in marriage and in divorce finantially when it comes to the kids women with a cus toby and then also you to get the divorce the financial costop just geing the turn getting all that in o if ther if it is conteste divorce and mid five figure six figures on on a turneys and yo other pay for her turnin to fifty per cent of marriges and in divorce eity percent of tivorces are in ash by women nin to per cent of shous college eticated niney percent of chanciport payments go for men to wa nine to seven persent of amoni payments c men o wyou know you have no fault t o defors woman can sheat on you dshe can sok it h sha oget again alot of what he saying is trute this stats on marriage are not completely drungled though those in just one second an the rip on on the divorce law is a good rip it is a fine rip and the answer is not for men to af woid marriage the answeris for men to find a good woman to get married to whois committed to value yes of course marriageis ar risk of course it is and that risk is dust proportionately born by men at this point that is true also but is the reward work the risk the answer in a huge majority of circumstances where both people are committed lekes a hav share christian vallues for example the ris the risk is is worth it is is the basif principle and the these arguments are made not just by people i visit andretate has made the same sorts of of arguments here is andrew tate talking about men do not benefit for marriage y whin it is a fantastic invirement and i think an idealists tic world thus way would be i think the reason is no happing to day as i do not think many men actually benefit from marriages or relationships any more and people are always going to hap to to require some degree of an sentive i think that we set up the world now an a way where men are seen as worker droits there expected to go work all they come home clean off as well share the cleaning with the woman not have any not no meal praer pared for not hav any authority over the househole and just and just be a worker droit and be a sad a i do not think that many people unders an that men are intrincs ically wire to desire respects amongst our peers and in our environments this is why seos works hard because they get respect in their comp i gate again i do not disagreed with much what you say but the solution very often with the red pill can a movement the diagnosis is correct and the solution is wrong than that that happens very very often in this sort of movement that the reason by the way that pearl and the rest of the redpill movement think theway they use because of argments one that did ha personin destiny makes with pearl in this particular clim men out earning man have a hard tim respecting them man there way that is not true that is noan ive hadn' to that daytn he explained why at at a time the women repoted that they were expected to be in charge of the houseof duties that is the wecachop and the atak of a roprs that a modern woman actually curd that i's all oudimated nowadays i ment you have e wasy recuted ti wy gou a ta ti i aa ias much as is hav dont do it a g t o doo that that is the issues that at the one o o e oferte for wat a an asolutely is i wa o gao get older and you menage a household an your own pearl you willsee how oking an oyators when you'r working an that you come home a a av o borble and nobody coliclyat aand ye the a i ave hotally valaries of er divorce of courseis t ators to break up ahome oa i can live that a fill o o lik to it e lie long friends from gratschool high school will dorman college and that bhate each other for ever over bad dorm roommate en no ligt en a relationship that you of course ti te telogus is perfectly velop ti think i think tit hitthink i a no av as been up duties in the households lik on of the most important parts of a relationship ecause it is where you are spending most of ta o this way i say ey wil get tri mo say i'm tan goue even dating itill you live together cause it do you live together you will really know wit the other persons and wance is tor liv it ogethen you see what the household duties are than you get a feel for wat the relationship it destiny is saying here is toltally grazy o gay the idea that you get divorced but see of case get divorce because you cannot split up who handles the dish washer is nuts and comparing marriage to roomates houserments yes becaus you on't expect to be roommates with your roomate for the rest of your life and have children with them generally speaking a marriage is not supposed to be a contractual arrangement that is purely about who shares household duties is pose you about building a housel it is that attitudes wer divorce that is making the red pill crue they sexancun al that is your version marriage than i'm not in i agreeve that were my version marriage i would not be in the point that i'm making is that that should not be anybody's version of marriage just the crorn version dvorsion be anybody's version of divorce nd win giv you some stafts the demonstrate tid not all marriages are created equal not all predicates for marriage are the same brad welcocks who is a social science scholar on all this he has a book called get marriage and it is all about marriage and divorce than here are some of the facts in thabo therre well substantiated by by the data the number one factor in predicting a high quolity marriages perceive partner commandment if you believe that your partner is deeply committed to the marriage you will be deeply committed to the marriage which is one o the reasons why it really matters higyo date ot really really matters hiyodate i agree that n a contet for you picing up a girl in a bar and thn you live together an thn get married to her that is a very risky situation you put yourself in a situation that is very risky but that is not how i've ever recommendeddating tht is not aver how of recommended getting married itis all part of wholistic you of how male female relationships work if you just take marriage is an institution and you just throw it out there and however you date is supposed to be equivalent that of cource is not troup women who had ten church are fifty per cent less likely to divorce for examples when you heard pearl earlier talk about for exa i've seen christian women diveseen muslen yes but the questions likelihood you can always find many any group who does acts wires eat the question is how often does that happen how you mitigate your risk as far as these staff that fifty per cent to mariage s and a divorce just aabout forty per cents right now of first marriage is hn divorce which s waigh weighed to high tell down significantly since the nineteen eghties but again is not equivalent between groups college educated parents ristkc of divorce has fallen by about twenty five per cents since the ineteen seventies and here is a good stat almost ninety per cent of their children for college educated marrants are being raised in married largely intack families to day turns out that there is actually a formula to his successful marriage it tends to be conservative religious highly educated tho those would be the biggest the biggest things that are going to a fact whether you and up staying married or reth you mend af divorce by theway another factor that ends up determining whetheryou stay married or and of divorce is again about the nature ofth marriage do you have kids marriages with kids divorce far less often than marriages without kids in fact the divorce rate for couples with kids s about forty per cent lower then tedivorce rate for couples withoutkat which make cense beu ave less than vessment once yo have kids then actually a damages at another party for you to get divorced over the dish washer and then then then somebody else pays for your crimes at that point seventy seven per cents of college educated con servative parents are still in ther first marriage sor seventy per cents of moderats and sixty ight per cent of liberals and again then the number of newly divorce people for one thousand married maricans is to cline pretty maricetly since the eighties whos twenty two point six in nineteen eighty it is thirteen point six to day in two thousand and twenty one as far as the notion that it is damaging finantially fror men yo get married nottes it is damaging for many at divorce it is not damaging for mento get maried married men in their thirtisern about ninety five thousand dollars if thei're co habiting there about six thy eight thousand dollars of theire single thane about forty two thousand dollars the average marrage premium in household dossets is more than two hundred ninety thousand dollars for a stably married man again i think what peopleare actually argung about over here to be fair to the red pill group i think whit thei'r actully arguing about is divorce andso the question is are you more likely to stay married or are you more likely to end up in a divorce situation and that is a a fair question depending on the process that you use for dating n the cultural milu in which you live in in the commeriyor island d orthodoxtirsh community not a lot divorce ik very very load of orse rates why wel becaus i've ron is religiously committed hes eveready goes into marriage believing it is a sacred bond that actually matters cause people do not date for sax people actually date looking for to the day when thy will hae kids together becuse every family in my neighborhood has four pluss kids may go those are the preconditions but if the if the idea here is than you are you'r your basic bynary is arguen married or divorce divorce is is typically worse than never married and married is way better than both divorced and never married and yet to risk but is it a coinflip ionlis quinflip i think it is eight it is e decision that you have to make as to what kind of person you wishdate how you wish to date that person what kind of relationship you wish to builden how seriously you take that commantment in the first place do the laws need change absolutely ned need to change thei'r garbage i totally agree wit that it is easy for men to be victimized under the circumstances it is easy that yo should not enser the risk let us look at frome the upsides in he downsides here is a chart from brad about opiod overdose defts by gender educational attainment and marrital status and what you see is that among men if you are single never married what you see is that the opod overdoss per one hundred dowsin age twenty five pluss s twenty five for single never married men it is even hirer for ivorce men and it is extremely low for married men really really low for married men and again that is that that is ore you cin o be one o the people who has tivorsternot one of things you can know going in is you will never get divorced and then you have to makesure th you marry a woman wwill not neverge and we cannot pretend that that divorceword falls hon you rin from the heavens that is notright the person who is this i give daniyg advice all the time my number one dating advice date for values date for values in the end that is the only thing that is going to remain o kate time for some things i things

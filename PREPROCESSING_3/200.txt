from w easy chicago it is this american life i'm shohn coal sitting in for ir glass back when aran was in high school she had this frend josh they known each other practically since they were born their parents were friends this was in a small small city an wisconsen fun was going down to this park with buffalo in it and throwing them hunks of bread anyway aron was fifteen josh was a year older and one particular day he gave me a mix tape out a mixed sedy rom just to say this was long enough ago that the word rom naturally followed the word se d or talking may be two thousand seven two thousand a i can see i can see the seedy ra you can see it in your minds ae you mean you are not looking at it i no certainly now i can see sharp bee scribbled all over it and in sort of scrawled handwriting in squiggles is is what i what i can recall josh was into theatr he and arand did place together actually musicals at this little community theatere in town he was if there was a joch of feeder kids that would be hin carrismatic the star of every play i really grabbing everything he could out of life an you coul tay wit a little bit dramatic shel remembers a couple of the songs thet were on a mix tor she does remember the exact number of songs for reasons that will become carin aminigh there were twelve of te twelve songs i an dutifully upleded it into my itunes and listen to it and thidn think much of it i do not know e did read in to it as i should have i mean literally literally because of what happened next mind you this next part was months after he gave her the s d solidly months ah i was i do not know pugging ran and itun's livary reorganizing something and i looking at it and it dawns on me that the song titles spell out an acrosstick i love you eran i at a second yet down down the left hand side of the of the trackless thing in i tuns the the first letter of every song as you read downward spelled out i love you aran yei did aron and misset it at first because loading it into itunes somehow the tracklisting had been reversed instead of spelling out i love you eran it said mera oi evil eye not quite as romantic ho sunc the still remembers one was yellow by cold clay was the why you the e at the end of love er maybe the be ginning of eran was elephant love medley from the movy moulon ruge which itself works a little a mixtate these two characters christian and setine just curl lines from famous love songs back and forth at each other i consts s n saringottle crenchy about that one and you might think elephant love medley alone would be a dead give away but to her that was just josh being josh she said dramatic a thing about mixed tapes there the mogis of yester year you could not always be sure what the intended meaning was or if the recipient would comprehend said meaning does he love me or does he just love these songs in that way josh literally spelling it out leaving nothing to the imagination was a decent strategy except even that was lost on erand due to som dum hick up in the machine it was you kdon' it was a lat it was a lot of emotiit which i felt terrible for missing even if you are not get a reciprocate at least you fee you should be getting the gesture ri but i i just had not seen it he was strictly a friend you was a friend we had kind of a thing a kind of a thing yet nursering i crash we never didit but look friends for a long time may i ask an indelicate question an you may did you ever kiss her anything a ikely proudly made oi turned out to be gay whe them mi have a fea raan revelations for theers to come just was not the time or gender who do right yo knew yet importantly arron has no memory of ever telling jo she saw his secret message he was just left in the dark wondering i stayed friends moved on iach other a few more times after high school but eventually lost touce have not spoken in years at this point it is funny that is something that deeply felt was communicated and received and yet remained unspoken i always thought of her her miny granger she was my her migny granger this of course is josh i did not bring up the mixed tape right away when i talked to him first i just asked him what he remembered about arran she was just smart and well respected by everybody and could just talk circles around anybody and i'm yet her intelligence was very intimidating to me intimidating really but in in a friendly way she would never show off about it i i had a crush on her to be honest any time i would happen to drive by her place i would i would think the one that got away i was always the feeling but i'm yet we were friends josh unfortunately does not have a copy of the mex tape any more either did not remember any of the songs that were on it but he did remember spelling out his devotion with the titles hewas bashful about it as a lot of people would be when talking about stuff they did as a tea nager i guess i was reading im dan brown and all these kind of spy things and just throwing hidden messages and to things and yi was i guess i was tryin to do it in my own way and you could practically hear him blushing when i told him that he had put elephant love medly on there yet that is guss i thought i was christian from e lonruge ye i just loved the kind of level of seriousness he put on romantic love i always had a thing about that and clearly much much to my detriment at times honestly and here is a millian ways we could psychomanalis that but ye did i did i tell her that it spelled that i no u no ihope she found it o ol cas here is for herim brought the seety i took josh through everything arrand toldme after all these years he was only just now learning what happened with his little letevenshe love coat that she had seen it the message got through she just had not felt the same well o ca well i guess i could not have asked for to go any better than that wat how how is that it going well well becaus hids an a happy accident it is kind of cool that it happened in its own time i do not know i picture a love a lovelorn jo sitting sitting ing his bedroom weting undering when is she gone a ye i only then that is true as i said i was kind of intimidated by her and i think particularly at that time for errand to be the person that i would dat was beyond something that seemed realistic i was you thought she was out of your league totally a i se i wanted her to know somehow on some level but i also did not ona push the matter or make her feel un comfortable or i do not know i always thought she would probably turned me down i guess i just wonder i mean other than it being a sort of very opacan and one could argue in effective way of of conveying one's love to put it in a crustic on a mixed tave i do not think it was ineffective ah i challenge that i think it is it is not even about if it got through and terms of a really really clear communicationits if it was there even if it was out of order when she first popped it in it was somehow there i think in my mind energetically and i still see the transmission even if it was can quiet in wont sent tou grand but i think that right there is the power of mixed tapes when you put them together a certain way the power of music even or at least the power that we believe it have that it can confess devotion on our behalf even in the form of an exploded puzzle oven the most casual mixtape that you make playless these dit that you make for friend you are sang this is what i or lovetimes this is what i'm feeling right now in a way your sang this is who i am songs gathered together that or kind of parlents a language the words are some one else's but they are also our own that is what is coming up on to days up a sod kind of a mixtape of its own because we have a crush on you and because the particular songs in the show tell you wa surprising amount about the people listening to them can we to pla for you stay with us track one just be good to me you use mutic to connect with other people were send a message alla mixd tape but the're all of these other times of course when you sort of communicate with yourself through music putting on a song to revelin some feeling or feeling this er that band or singer is speaking directly to you this next collection of songs works that they are all of a peece in a way that writer necol perkins really related to here is nicholl there have always been songs about cheating spouses and their lovers when women sing them they tend to be from the point of view of the disappointed and hurt wife in dolley parton's unforgettable jolene she begs a woman not to take her man in shirley brown's blusy confrontational woman to woman shirley lets the other woman know she is not letting her ruin her happy home but how happy can your home be if you have to call another woman and tell her it is happy songs these mete the other woman a villain with a capital ve those songs were not for me i was more interested and aunty songs the songs from the point of view of the other woman they were what woman in the wrong corner of love triangle sang about finding good love in the middle of bad decisions they were old school soul and armby hits that our mothers auntis and older play cousins used to listen to with shining eyes and far away expressions holding swetting glasses of drinks that were off limits to us kids we were too young to be singing those songs but we felt their power anyway we heard the longing in the singers focal acrobatics and it moved us even if we were not sure why we would hear them on the radio played during every quiet storm sometimes with dedications from denise to that special some one she says who you are and then the ultimate sie chic and them as we lay by shirley merdac wull begin to play us song about everything that happens in the moments befor your man has to go home to his wife in wethe tenaunty songs are where we got to hear from the other woman and realize maybe she is actually a human being with emotions too were hearing the perspectives of women who know their love is futile but they will take what they can get for as long as they can get it lone of the most famous aunty songs isnat under cover one that most people do not realize is from the perspective of the other woman in saving all my love for you witney huston calls out her lover's lies even as she con tinues to wait for him you used to tell me we would run away together love gives you the right to be free you said be patient just wait a little longer but that is just an old fantasy when witney hits that beautiful extended high note on fantasy it feels we are all falling back into an ocean of her lovers lies with her and her we let ourselves be carried away anyway h when i was twenty five years old and living in new orleans i met a man with a voice made for might he was a lovely nurty saying with a shaved head and freckles a sprinkle of joy across his nose and cheeks and a few dots on his lips that were clearly targets for my affection he was not yet thirty but he already had the look of a hippop professor in line at whole foods i'll call him bayard at dinner with him and a friend i laughed too often and too hard at something bayard said he slid me a questioning glance after one giggle too many and i tried to pull myself together but it was too late at a club later we ended up sitting next to each other trying to talk over the music at midnight we sat in my car talking and then the sun reminded us our deoderance have been working for twenty four hours i decided to shoot my shot is there any one back home waiting for your morning call i asked him he took a long time to answer which was answer enough yeh there is he finally said he looked down at his hands and i looked at them too of course he was involved with some one he was smart cute and funny and i'd met him at the wrong time we exchanged emela dresses because that felt safe there was nothing wong with having a penpole was there soon we were exchanging pages of text almost daily he would call me at work and have me crying from laughter and sometimes he would call me at night when that some one back home was out with her girls and he talk to me with that voice saying whath his words would not after about three months of constant communication he came back to new orleans for another visit i do not know what he told that some one back home but he told me he loved me i said it back to him we kissed my membery tells me i had candleslit and that is probably true i do love candles i remember his face as he looked at me and told me i was beautiful i believed him he was engage to be married and for the most part i did not care i definitely had some woman to woman guilt since i'd had my own heart breaking experiences with cheating exes but bayard and i startet seeing each other when i was firmly in what we would now call my hot girl summer fase i also knew i was not the first woman he cheated on her wis i decided i could not care more about his woman than he did i refused to take responsibility for his decisions but i had no problem benefitting from them those aunty songs i had swayed along with because i appreciated i talented voice and good music a pealed differently to me during this time now they were peptocs in secret lovers by atlantic star a pair of lovers are both devoted to other people yet unable to stop their attraction i did not have any one i was committed to ut there was a particular verse i kept going back to while i fancied myself in love with bayard sitting at home i do nothing all dan but think about you and hope that you areo cam hoping you call before any one gets home i wait anxious lea alone by the phone this is the stuff of schoolgarl crushes of clumsy ram calm heroines of swooning damsels everywhere and that is how i felt about bayard i just happened he was committed to some one else a few weeks after that candelat visit i was unexpectedly hospital ive and byard was there for me he called my mother cleaned up my apartment and made sure my cat had a fresh litter box he stayed with me the entire week event after my family arrive the care he showed me was a fantasy i'd never allowed myself to indulge he was married a few months later he e melled me from the honeymoon and several months after that we made plans to spend a weakened at a hotel together he left the hotel wepside up on his laptop and his wife found a book i'd inscribed with something sneakin she eventually reached out to me via emal and aim instant messaging of old the exact messages have been lost to time and anger but the jist remains what did he tell you about me he did not talk much about you why you you would have to ask him why did you do it i wanted to do you love him i think yes do you want him no i'm not trying to take him from me i saw your pictures oke him does he love you ask him why did he do it ask him i ping ponged between a strange loyalty to him the need to defend myself the desired to protect her and the need to be caddy i wanted to tell her to leave that he cheated before that if it had not been me it would have been some one else bayard's wife reminded me of the petty girls in school who could not understand why guies would be interested in me i did not have the things i was supposed to in order to be attractive i got in a few stingers but i let har have her shots whut ever she needed to fell better and giving myself what i wanted i'd heart another woman i felt guilty even as i would not allow myself to fill ashamed when i wanted to brush away any concerns about hou he was treating his wife or when i'd start to fell bad about not having a man of my own i'd put on the esoes bands just be good to me to gasp myself up and keep me focussed on myself i do not care about your other girls just be good to me his wife did not understand how i could be with him and claim to love him but not ont to take him from her i was no fool i firmly believe in the added how you got him is how you get got i think eye stopp loving him first he was the only man i was saying i love you to in a romantic sense but he could not say the same i stopped answering his emals and calls he wrote me a letter and i burned it unopened after i made the decision to let my relationship with bayard go i found myself holding a sweating glass and staring at a blank wall the aunti songs once gave me strength and now they gave me permission to cry i missed some one who was never mine even though i had made a good decision in moving on from the affair a decision that had been mine in most aunti songs we hear the other woman passively waiting for the man to make time for her but in everything i misse at home the singer cherall tells the story of a woman who initiates her infidelity and lets us know she is the one dissatisfied in her main relationship she cheats without regrets and is grateful to have found some on who gives her everything she is not getting at home she was not the object of desire she was in control of it the song is a gruely slow jam made for a two step and i contact perfect for a woman who refuses to feel remorseful about receiving love from unexpected places r i let these songs guide me through an affair but they did not tell me what happened after i moved on i started reading romance novels when i was very young and became a dicted to the promise of happily ever after for ever was found in fiction and feiry tales but in aunti songs for ever was a stolen nine does the other woman get her happy ending maybe it is enough to stay in a loop of borrowed time i still have not figure that out yet but i know i can beloved anyway i want necolbergans is a writer from natural tennessy for memoir from which this is ay is adapted is called sometimes i trip on how happy we could be an it is out now coming up they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing but it can also make you a beloved roccritic at least in one case that is in a minute from chicago public ridio when a programme continues it is this american life i'm shon col since i was way this week we mad you a mixhape it is called this is just some songs mis is some songston ga exaidd whe're a treck too music is easy it struck me that a lot of the song most of the songs in the show today or from a long time ago and i wanted to play yu a minute of this one tune s little newerfrom early last year and for me is is one of those eure worms th at i'm delighted to heaven my year all the time the ordist calls themself josephine network a self described shapeshifting yenta in dreg it is song about unburdening yourself ugetting whatever it is off your chest through music w s we a n have something i'lse wanted to play that for you because where they say say what you mean this next truck on our mix tape is about saying explicitly indisputably what you mean with music although the people in the story might argue that it is not always easy a part of their job is hunting for exactly the right song for the occasion this is track three the end of the road and i think the only other thing you need to know is that my colly conojophy wolt is a big fan of those slide chos that schools put together wat thend of the year for graduations in thae kind of thing wretch rospective slde shows loves them here hon u i got a bonus and of the year slide show last spring i was in expecting it because was for my second grater and he was not graduating anything still i was pleased when his teacher wrode the class to say she wanted to mark the end of the year we should all join their morning meeting by zume and there was going to be a slide show shohn said i do love sldeshows and not in a normal way i do not thing i always cry every time and i'm really not a crier but these stupid slidejhos always work on me i will cry when it is not my own child graeuating i will cry even if i do not know a single kid in the slideshow for instance here i was at an elementary school that my kids do not go to i was theire reporting would not be a graduation without a slide shell an july and it takes hen a second the pictures of the kids at work at their tables iut on their field cheps an match and teashirts i wove hon they do the photos from the beginning of the year and then the end and you see the kids get teeth and long legs in the front row there is a grandfa wiping his eyes i was done one more an i promise i'll get to the point here in a secong this one was the most embarrassing one for me i went to this graduation at a different school i was reporting on you ol my god now well hov the ros cermony do you gas know about this diabolical thing they now do at some high school graduations where they give each kid a rose iach graduate will preset te ross to one person well theall this tru and then they ask them to bring it to some one in the audience who got them to this moment then you see all these kids stumbling over their robes trying to find their mom in the audience and you see mothers just absorb their daughters and hogs both of them sobbing i watch this one awkward seventeen aro boy walk up to his grandma shove the ros toward her and mumble thank you and she wrapped him by the neck and pulled him in brutall the woman from the main office in the school she saw me and came over to pat my arm to tell me it would be o kay remember i was not related to a single person graduating in the ceremony anyway this year i join my child's class by zume and i knew what to expect we all watched a very sweet slde choe the teacher put together and i felt nothing nothing we saw pictures of the kids reading and bean bag chairs learning mat nothing making volcinos no i just what sort of num my tention drifted i loked at my phon i looked at everyone in the boxes on zume and a bunch of slides in i kid onzume unmuted himself to say something random my dog smouds and just hearing the sound i realized e there is no music that is was weard about this there is no song they would no muthi at i fi e and now that fat at fecti o iven't ever e heard of that best massy is a school social worker the maker of many slide chos and the most enthusiastic fan of them co when she is in the audience best cheers were every person in the slide cho every activity she cheers for the days of the week that bactly waggeting fa i e at using tha's whid and cry ye i think it is lid and cad atethily i did talk to the teacher in my son's class she says she just forgot to put musigain i called best and i called my friend rachel lissy rachel and best combined have probably put together dozens of slide chos over decades of working at summer camps running after school programms and graduations i asked them both what does it mean that i did not feel anything without the music there is rachel ye i do not i khd a the mean the i without music itbolt i i a ook even the at this point we would not be having flio er actually musing lide in in at old rord i feel fee if you doing it without you sic you cannot help lit you a quicking fold ti foud of emptydit no that wil exactly what this slidecho felt yes felt time was moving slowly and the pictures did not have any of there meaning orye id not tee meaning that i wanted yes it think you think it theri way with the lige with her celebrating the got the path o find word year older but with music that feel wondrit it ful o potability emou i if yel i ti te te looking ut it all gord ating yes oh ye xactly i ead in the lijo in i latdy i ill an in my old rattl wer telity lik you lit jo the riht song it can tell your mind what to think about when you look at a bunch of pictures of all the possible things you could be thinking about and feeling the music tells you neer no this is the one to pect best said imagine the ros ceremony without music tid just be awkward wi watching a bunch of people stumble over chairs trying to find their seats i thought i'd try play the same slide cho but just put a song under it see if i felt the right things i was sckeptical though because this lidjo had a lot of other things gettng in the way for one we were not altogether watching it in a crowded auditoriam and honestly mostly what i saw was not the pictures of the kid's being cue i just notice their masks and the fact that their desks had plastic partitions and in some pictures there wearin winter cots indoors because they have tohave a windows open for ventilation it just felt distopion and i could not really imagin a slideshoon zume over coming all that ne ni i i think et of work bes ever faithful in the medium believed this was absolutely fixable she and rachel both give me lots of suggestions of songs they thought could work that i could play during the slijo to feel the rat things it is not complicated te sas basically any song everyone knows can do the job pop songs hi energy songs those are the best rachel things it is all about the learics i hope you had the time of your life as we go on we remember all the times we had together but then there augt o the the tong and the road a hard ti coud byd yesterday or that that derma glock would thought i will remember you whatever i for the out afbout end of the road end of the road oh yet is is a road yeh words just it ma no eniotiplat lete that the big feeling about o something ending th ye on the knows thi is the particathet of ar for yes end it that ta tit does not call for li foty there is one song tes in rachel foth mentioned it that was be perfect slidejo song in all the ways it was popy everyone knew it had the reat energy and the lyrics tell you exactly what to feel the arkelly tong the world greated which were nober bed i can no longer really do but it ee perfect lite o o that was in heavy rotation for many year writ ti thi thein who it tid the ferabl things and should not be the hero of aty tial habit to have written two of the greatest plide sho fol tip and i do notawi but ti it i hit the everytime that that i dee i am a marching beand i am ameltin something about that being the faces of kid i believe i could fly y thi could cut the gy a the tinth of the plik ec of the having the foot of beta bigne to a obviously i'm not in a play archelly under my second greater slid but all the other songs best and rachel recommended they all just feel too sentimental and i do not feel sentimental about the last year an do not think i want to feel sentimental about the last year of school end of the road i wish it was the end of the road but it did give it a try i sat with the slidejo and tried to put music under it test had suggested a beadle song and there is a beadle song that i sing to my kid at bhat time it appy hase all the rate learics but it did not work it is too much about him and mean not his class or his school it did not believe this slijo was savagable othere was one other kind of slichel song that best talked about one she would seein work recently at her mother in law's ninetieth birthday party and it did not work because it was a song everyone knew or because the lyrics tell you how to feel she said it works because it makes you think of a particular place he co to mike the little pown ah on i li it woeto tha li tat the the con de canel m all ponal bowld that wul foun about the cown that he was come i started to think about that and what song i associate with this specific group of people and this specific place there is really only one every year since my oldest was in preit seven years at the end of the year assembly the kid sing a sng called this pretty planit i ave never loved te song and i did not miss it when a new music teacher came in recently and retired it but it did seem it might work for thess and it did this prety the spiing an frue fas your gard you are a harbor you are hole as i knowdid you hand motions and everything he' actually felt watching a flagjo i had never seen before the mat and the haviness of the year were still there but my brain did not focus on tham instead i thought picture i had totally miss of my kid leading a group of friends and some sort of stomping game in the yard i thought girl who could not read bast the ar standing at the board with the pointer stick reading to everyone mostly i just thought the incredible razilients of all the people in that classron and marvelled at the teachers smiling and meading and skilfully masing all the fear and chaos of the entire seer they could create something that looks schooll it not easy being with kids all the time it is tedious and boring and hard even when there is not a global pandamic but there are these flashes of big ness the flajo takes all those flashes and bottles them up that you come u back over the past the ar for a few minutes ideaily no more than six with the right song plan and actually see all the thingn you miess on a juffy waltn as one of the producers of ourshou track for what is the frequency kenneth much musical discovery happens when were kids you really find the songs that former tastes when you are young for the most part o realy set would happen with me this last story is about some one discovering music who was much older the guy named ken eglan he was actually living in a nursing home in boston the duplex nursing home it was called this was decades a go by the way there were forty five residents in the facility all men my friend david green burger was the activities director there an the late seventies in early eighties i started the job the beginning a sevety on nd i'd met ken probably immediately because he oh he walked with a walker and he would sit himself right byat there was a desk for the activity's director who was a cabin would stuffin it it was in the corner of a room where they all sort ofe lunch wan stuf ken was always seeted right by it cause he slike he you what are you doing youn sir whoever was an outsideer sec i gan no whichs goin on out there he never saw himself as a guy in he nursing al was iv a work for y my leg and only spells that i get o he epointing to his head he got some sort of spill oh he would have seizures he ad had some kind of wbrain the surgery you could see the scars had from that that affected tho he could walk along and he was just started talkativly ken was a talker you would not know it looking at him but he had been a tappd anser in night clubs back in the thirties on of the jasine an boston he said he had met jasi kondly billy holiday sorly pargerin lester young who he called prez during has sacx upon solo he woud be the guy in the audience healing go go go go go can also drank alon bacg in the dan according to his in take papers the surgery he had as for a sub dural hema tomen lecing blood vessing in his brain probably from falling don the stairs one time when he was drowng he also had duiametes semming paralysis on his left side and he had no family to spegun siblings and parents at all time and eeden given all of that he was still this up beed smily charmen said that if david did not go ahead and marrying his grill frien he was going to meat up with her on the corner which two ew bottles of john jamoson david was a dennizen of his own very different kind of music scene he played in a band in the hayday of boston roun a skinny already twhenty five your old white gy with a moustache compared to kan who was black a world wore too vet in his mid sixtes and for whom going to shows was well in the past still music was something they easily bonded over ken wanted to hear music on and specifically one to know what i was i lisic there was an element in him where he was i what is going on out there and he would point out the window i gen' know what is going on out there and first i just played him some steff on i thi the first thing i pladhim was i mashag ser to thi outsider art trio of siser is from a hampshire they sounded that ken had a lot to say about the shags iactually know exactly what his reaction was because david rot it down this whole rapid fire soliloquy david read it to ma i could not dance to that not regular dancand with a woman i could softshoe with that any o this music youre playing for me i could soft shoe with or buckan wing with it wore off time with it personally myself i could do it i do not kno everybody else gould i know for a fact that jen kelly and fred astair could dance to that and if they could i dampshire could do it myself i pray to god some day you can see me dance that that i'm well enough to do it i me tell you something dave anytime anybod i just need to posure for second and talk about the reason david wrote down what kenn had to say about the shags early on in his job at the nursing home david started a small magazine the zeene called the duplex planet it was mainly quotes from the residence and snipits of their conversations that he thought were surprisang or funny or poinan it was self published hundreds of subscribers not thousands but it had this devoted following lasted decades after david left tha nursing home he interviewed old folks all over the country there was a comic book virsan life performances seed eas everything and kenneglin was one of the early stand out regulars that readers look forward to hearing from every month david crated a special section for him actually a music review call him called ken's corner he play ken songs on a cassette walk man ken would say what he thought of them and david would sit and take notes in the first official ken's corner callumn as shou twenty nine he re viewed money will not buy you happiness by the incredible casuals he says it is crazy it is really gruvy or as you say to day it is really nice i what is crags me up as you say to day nice as if freeds gottn rid of the word crazy it is i he is used to beat nic tock you gis do not do that e woright but i say its slag it is gruvy that a beat an e beat i beautiful i it i what i hear give him a chance they will be up there these kids can go up they can go there is no stop on him now if they stop i'll tell him there fools there is that old sayin now you probably never heard it eg they bates he said do not stop right there ke go a lot of the repeaser that in a good way here is this poetic repetition to his gusshiness and he encouraging ie'll be those kits are going places whether you's talking about eincredible casuals or a much more famous band the clash quote should i go ham no no do not go stay there baby these boys are all right they are gin a swing sometimes david would play an artist kennad heard before franksen onterer ills pressly but mostly it was steff that was all new to hem and those first time listening reaction f itdios that are on you tu ben ticktuck now it helped if you already knew the song he was talking about because it allowed you to hear i through new ears ken's ears there was a complete lack of knowledge of context he does not know anything out the history of the person which can be free he is just woh the things just rollin over me it is really about how you would talk with a friend while you are listeng to music he was my friend hewas never in aa i ronic way i do not even that whol thing that gets one sometimes i let' see what grandpa says about kiss ir the slit sir what a we etit just some thing that you normally would not be playing for grandpa li read out of the mouths of babes except for it is not babes it is old people he had the it reverse babe i but but a lot of times he would relate himself to it i mean basically all these things while they are husic reviews the whole thing together is a portrait of ken described in these funny little ways piecing tegother a puzzle or the little bits of it are all coming together that is what it really is here not just a portrait of his personality which is palpable but practically ken's whole life is depicted in the revews reecting to the lord's prayer by the beech boys he said i was a methodist and then when they sent me to school they switched me around and made me a catholic that was the maintren he did not me because i was too popular and too good a dancer but i did not care can was a rebel crashing parties no matter what floor they were on he talks about climbing the sides of houses to get in the words rasing hell appear at least a couple of times but there were more placid memories to he is down of the charles river in a couple of the reviews sleeping on a blanket or he is at magazine beach where he used to be a life guard usic his dry this is from when he listened to captain beef heart's tropical hot dog night i'm sittiner la an on mie mank an and i got the beat my body in my blood i look over to one side of me and there is a fon girl along here le down her back and she is got those tight kenes on shakin up she is tearin up the world and you got to get up and get the same beat that she is got and there you are you apparently there were lot of women in kenslide he never married seems he rejected all of that but he had girl friends and not always happily it was an accident by and ar b cu got him talking about the time on woman told him she was pregnan with his baby in his skip town turned out it was not his ha and sometimes all of the carousing and carrying on intersect with america's troubled history this is what he said in response to bunkey and jakes if i had a dream if we played music that back in the thirties the police e irish cops would raise hell with us now what i'm trying to tell you segregation was a bitch they could not stand me dancing with the white girls we be doing the lindy hop on boston comment going wild smoking reefers we called him brief respect then ow they call it mariwana we would be dancing and long comes a pounder which is a cob and he says all right now break it up sometimes you run in to a cop saying hey that is my cousin your dancing with boy to a he i ad and e to be clear can did not everything david pakim some of the reviews begin with it was weird or i do not buy that cat food by king crimson was a hard now and then this one review wis such an intricate multy layered yet subtily murderous pan oh here david had to read it to me this time hen ring by garulis ne playboys that i would not buy but it sounds all right some more horns in there were a helped over it e change the temple werr too bet er singer too he could have come more clear with it lollos words i couldn he get he could change a long the lerics in ther too he was corn at a temple in there what ad just couldn'he get i they got a switchet around i doft mean all the way around just half way he basin ease he is now asked about adding horns changing the wars the tempo and getting a different singer ah what it is not totally that i be you face al he tried to be heardav what he is fery i should elt to say every one it the nursing hom knew about the sene the owner told david he as really crowd of what he was doing and david showed kenn the kenn's corner colum in the duplex planet but kenn was completely uninterested he as why do i need a suvenier of myself talking did ye know how many people were reading these i don lovid really registered i iud tell him stop what i thit is such an abstract thing all t ha that matter to him was he liked whal we did meanwhile kenn's following swelled well beyond the readership of the duplex planet other publications started picking up the column rock sheet and boston called the noise two alternative papers out of the north west rounder records said david sebmit some of kenn's reviews for their mail order katalogue granted david had a lot of music world connections from playing in his band but he was not pushing for any of this exposure and when kenn got to meet some of the musicians he reviewed wearedly it was kenn who was the celebrity in thos interactions the delf wagofs got in touch asking of kenn could produce them local boston ban called pasteesh dedicated a song to him which he later reviewed he and david appeared on a local teve show and rote island together david even wread a couple of kenn's reviews on late night with

of kenn at the party on it he is wearing a gray su jackett and a white shirt with e wide callar no tie you kan't hear what kenns saying over the crowd noise but he is joking around gesticulating people lean in and laugh he is a hid and he knows it i had a ball that night he said in his review of the ease beats friday on my mind then i had to come back here and who is waiting for me at the front door but the guerilla and that wine het me when i got out of the car yanother result of kenn's widening popularity other people wanted in on the action started sending their own maxtapes for kenn to lissen to gasette's david still hask them all the songs are listed on the ja card or tiped on to these little sheets of paper and folded up and shoved into the jewel case one of the lists has

the boston sunday globe had lined kenneth eglan rock music critic began as tappd answer in thirties it did not mention his seizures were stibedes were that he used to walker toward the end of his life it did quote from one of his reviews no matter what instrument your playing said one of the quotes you cannot lose that first beed ore your throug david at the time was twenty nine he't only been to one or two funerals of that point other guides from the nursing home heit certainly never had to organize one before but it was david who called the funeral home to work ov er details of the way fans of ken cycled in and out paying their respects some who had met him in the past in others who had and david arranged for some of ken's favorede music to be played sunraw the beech boys jonathan

deteriorating i would go and see him buy was not yonon trind i get hedvons on him in a listnes stuff i i then gave it to the funeral director and i hadm put it in the pocket of his jacket he was buried with he is buried with the tape si rememberknow what was on it ah it was i ever any of the suns nah that was meant to be a thing that i would hav done with him it was for him to her and that wasnt possible they it belongs to him in that way what mist most to do with this there is this thing that happens when two friends sit and listen a music to ether alot it happened with my friend paul in me when we ere kids and he turned me on to some of the music i still listen to and it happened with kennan david even when you go your separate ways in whatever way that happens ait is you take that person with you you are for ever informed by that friendship scertain songs will always remind you of that person even when they become associated with other people in your life and when you hear those songs you think about other aspects of that friendship of that person that you really loved stuff that maybe did not occur to you as much pect when you were hanging out with them i asked david

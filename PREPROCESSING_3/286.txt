wluke was eleven when his found me move from the normal boring suburbs to what amounted to basically the coolest place on earth his tad got thes jab is the manager this torist park called te butterfly farm that had dom filled with rainforest and a exotic birds and butterflies and a miniature train track and pony rides and minny bike rides and a launching ramp for the waterskees who came in spider houseory vicnicaria a snake house and a banding vica tid a show with his collection of deadly snakes it is a smarecan by the way from o u bsy chicago and the only bad thing about being eleven and living out in the country side on the grounds of such an incredible place was the school that luke attended this was an australia outside what was then a little town called wilber for us and the other students with thes tuff kids it did not accept lucould ar which is why it was such a great day for luke when his whole class took a field trip to the buterfly farm it was it was my place my kingdom my tuf and i felt extremely i excited and filled with anticipation that i could kind of relax and show off at the same time off especially because his dad had asked the snake candler vic to come in into a show for luke's cass normally vic did not work during the week there were not big enough crowds to justify it bu lukesdad knowing this would be god for luk hasked him to come in special and that mant that i was going to help vic we would been living there for about six months and now my brothers and i we were allowed into the snake room the snake house and he would deal with the poisonou snakes and we would deal with the nonpoisono snakes and the pithans that was fun and ai was exciting as you could imagine for an eleven ure a boy being watched behind the glass by he is eighty class snakes and teachers i right you gns ee might go this brave kid dealing with the snake can get ing to do something at cool ye totally cool and and i would be totally at home with it because i was by that stage ye and love to doing it every week and i would watch victo his shows i knew them offfy hat and i just used to love standing there amongst the crowd every week and and feeling everybody is amazement as he would milk the death ad er and show the venom dripping down e the glass and vic was feerless that was his world he was very very comfortable handling snakes and they came up and all the kids piled out of the busses and i got to thonter thounter up to the bussis in stakhide of my teaches an and the day began and at a certain point around the middle of the day it was time to see the snake show then everybody's in the snake house i mean there with vic putting the snakes in the bags everybody's watching us through the window this was is prap for the shel ey wl put the snakes in the bags n then they would carry them to the stage for vict's presentation and all of a sudden this incredible thing happens beside me vic picks ofp a tigers snake the second deadly a snake in australia and it bites him three times ttt that and i made this little sort of thump thump thump sound on his on his hand as it bit him had you ever seen that befor no no at never nothing had ever gone on i had never seen the snake bite a human being before and now i saw it from one of the deadly a snakes in the world and it was it was massively powerful the moment of the bit and it was a triple by it bang bang bang and vic drops the snake and he says dan and stopp sucking the web of his hand where the snake bit him and i'm completely astonished a'md just on my knees looking at him thinking what happens next is how bad is this well i knew it was bad i heard him give the toke every week and about how bad the tiger snake bite is we we and vic says thisen run down to the kiosk can get me a pind of milk i say or kay and i run out the door and i've got a task now and as his little general stole kind of kiosk thing at the place and rait i run down to get the pine of milk i say this is for vic i do not have to pay this is the beginning of all the rules of the day being broken is one of my clearest memories of this day is how everything went the way it should not have gone n and and all bets were off but get the pine of milk i run back up he he opens it and he drinks this pint down drinks the whole thing down in one long mouthful nd i say your cave vic and i's i ge everything's fine mate everything's find that is do the show and and this not because milk is some sort of thing you do if you get bidden by dedly snake i think the milk thing was just one of those weed old wive's tails or one of those australian bush recipes that this helps if you get bitten by a snake a we are ready to go now we have all the snakes in the bags and we leave the snake house and it is this weed pie piper kind of thing it is me and vic weiged down with these little blue canvas bags filled with writhing snakes and we all woll down to the snake platform where he gave the shows followed by all of my plassmates and our teachers and the only other people there that day at the butterplatform was a a couple of bussloas or a kids in wheel chairs there were kind of the spina biffetter kids or that o kid who a disabled in various ways and they were there with their minders his middle aged women mostly pushing these very disabled kids in wheel chairs they too are following us all down for the big snake show and e snake platform was about the size of a buxing ring it was a raized platform and people would circle the platform on all for sides and vick begins the show and he gets about ten minutes into the show and he is holding a green tree snake which is a thin little whipp it snake and suddenly he says ah that is not gentlemen i'm going to have to stop the show now because and he just he is standing straight up and his eyes glazes over and he is instantly unconscious that is clear and he starts to fall backwards and at the instant that he falls backwards the snake in his hands he releases it and it falls over the edge of the platform and into the lap of one of these kids in a wheel chair and starts writhing around in the kid's lap look ay crazy and nobody knows what to do the snake is on this child's lap and because thik has turned a stiff as a board he he does not break his fall at all he is completely unconscious from the standing position and he hits the wooden platform with this whack this enormous fump horrible cracking sound of his head hitting the wood at the same instant this kid in the wheel chair this kid had sort of claw hands and on and he is looking down at this snake in his lap and he starts to discove and everybody around the kid in the wheel chair starts just runs away screaming including the lady who is looking afteri at the same instant vick has hit the ground and he is arms have spread out and arms and legs spread in a kind of star shape and i'm staring at him and the kid and my tit and then i catch the eye of one of my teachers who is looking at me as if te say what what is going on i have to act suddenly there is this moment now where i suddenly realized that i'm the one with the greatest knowledge and my teachers in a sense are standing there powerless and beginning to be freekd dout and not having a clue what to do and it is it was an amazing moment and in amazes hi moment for a kid to have it eleven when you are eleven you do not get many situations where you are the wine and adults need to look to you to take control of a situation yet i run over to the kid and there is this momen t where i look in his eye and i say something it is orka i mi take the snake out of his lap in the way that i was taught to do which is gently and without any jorky movements and am and yo run up the stairs on to the platform and that is the moment where i see how incredibly bad things are in terms of vix state of health and what is a look i well it looks t first of all its terrendously embarrassing because hi's pisty's pants this gy who i looked up to much and it just it is everywhere the whole bottom half of his body is soked and it is all around him spreading on the on these floorboards it was very much no longer a matter of this is good for me because this might change my place in the pecking order amongst thes athese difficult schoolkids in this difficult situation ner but just a matter of oh my god i think vic's dying or vix's dead his face is almost black by now it is this kind of bruised purple black color i put the snake back into the blue canvas bag and tied the knot the way vic had taught me and then i said to my teachers i'll get my dad and then i proceeded to sprint up the hill to the house screaming at the top of my lungs dad dad dad it is a pree fery whey to go when he gets is dad and lukesdad came back with them and hen they got back none of the adults had taken any action at all one of luke's teachers was kneelin next to vic but he was an administering sipiar doing mouthed mouth or anything at all he was just kneeling there not sur what to do looke's dad lifted vick's limp body into the car tore off to the hospital now was it lok gathered up the snakes and put the back where they belonged vic survived but the incredibly sad thing was that was the last snake show he ever gave in his life he was on a kidney machine for three months ah his skin took three months to gradually gradually returne back to it is color am and and and that was it yet that was that was kind of end of career when i tell the story even now it is absolutely vivid and it is always vividin my got all of the the main moments of what happened that day as stelling my go it is to this day one of the most vivid and intense memories in my life because in some weid way it was te turning point it was one of those series of events heading towards adolescense and heading towards developing a concept of yourself as an autonomous human being as an adult and and how and how often in your life do you have a murmur where it suddenly become utterly queer what you have to do and only you can do it i think it is really rare i mean it for me that that was it that was that moment i mean i love every moment of my life and without sounding pretentious i hoar does not sound pattentios but at some absolutely crimal level it ws this deeply satisfying sense of actually doing something heroic wet a day an i rad our shol stories of people saving the day and what takes them over when they do it an he stories the people who jump in i just seized by this sense that they have to act they do not have a choice they will not be able to live with themselves if they do not jump into action tis tin incredibly pure about it i sho in two ats one in the wilds of mexico one in the halls of acadenia stay with us that in midlife cowboy we have this story from james spring who as in a city that is not far from the mexican border sandy ego at thirty nine i took a little inventory of my wife and found myself to be unremarkable and almost every way for more than a decate i'd held a job writing ad copy and radio commercials in sandiego i had a wife two kids two margages tivo prescription reading glasses and about twenty extra pounds that i no longer had the energy or ambition to lose my fortieth birthday was only a couple of months away in april my wife telly had a brighter attitude about it all we' throw you big party she said it will be fun i do not think i said i did not want a party it is your big for o she said think about what you want to do for it i did think about it for a long time in the end what i thought was i'm man to do something big to help somebody else in a big way it is going to be a great big thing when it is done i'manto feel really really good and helpful what d you mean help somebody my wife said i do not know i said it was still pretty shapeless inside my head it used to be a boat captain i knew parks of mexico better than pretty much anybody maybe that was a start iwoll you been to help my wife said help them what i do not know i said somethin's gin to come up maybe an earthquaker head and i'll help dig people aut maybe helcopp tor go down an bah i could help find it this was all met with the most epic of i rolling and sighing i bu bonat least twice a week this conversation continued to divide us she talk about party planting and i'd have to remind her that i might not even be around i'm i might be out rescuing people april arrived and still no earthquakes or helicoptors on friday about five ofclock right after work i thought maybe i should be a litte more proactive i did a gougl search on two words that seemed to make the most sense for my plan baha and missing it migh be time to explain the baha part in the late eighties i worked in the area that the drug inforcement agency calls the western mexico baha corridor but i was not one of the good guys it was over twenty years ago i just dropped out a college and i was a little aimless i re connected with a friend that i'll call alecs back in sandiego alecs had put together and enterprise moving metham pedamine along the west coast right about the time i arrived a new law had been passed in the us that made it tough to get the main ingredient efedran but i was pretty sure we could still get it in mexico the border was less than a half hour away the effederan pipe line was easy to establish and soon it got filled with other stuff too co marijanta personally the drugs held no attraction for me which made it easy to justify my actions i mean if these dirtbags wanted to ruin their lives with meth lettam it turned out i was really good at the job i got to know my way around mexico around the marinas and hidden ranchos and dirt air strips around the cops and soldiers i came to love the ba peninsola but during this time the business was falling apart back on the uest side alecs in his paws had developed bad drug habits and i got really sloppy it been away and mexico during two police rates on the house in sandiego ut i was there for the third one i was arrested and taken to jail with the others it the cops dadn't have a warrants thy had to drop the charges i moved out o the house the couple of weeks later some badguis came in the middle of the night blacksweat shirts black scheme asks they beet alecs into a coma raped his girl friend it toll everything they couy get their hands on after that i packed up my red cheap and i drove south to bah i did not come back for four years by the time i moved back to sandiego an nineteen nin ty three ad fashiond myself in to an upstanding citizen an ambitious and enthusiastic member of the work forse and life rolled along pretty much a supposed does for most people an a chimo aforrwon kay family i kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but life was really steady it was good far better than i deserved and on the eve of my fortieth birthday i brouht up gougle and typed the words baha and missing the top result on gougl was a day old newspaper article about a fugitive couple wanted for kidnapping and murder this story essentially was that this couple richard correlli and mishell pinkerton were a pair of chronic methheads who killed their landlord in san francisco then they drove to sana crus a kidnappe their own six year old dotghter from the grand parents who would been given legal custody an oh yah also on the run with them theire two month old baby girl with down sindrom clearly these were not great parents a year earlier there werl hold up in a motell when police rated the room when found them with the pile of stolen property in metham fetamines their daughter viana then four years old was found hiding under the motell bed the newspaper picture of viana showed a smiling little girl with blond hair and blue eyes an address with pink pocadats she lookd just my daughter addie police had been searching for viana and her parents for more than three months this article said that a month earlier a twors might a spotted the family and he town called sankantein on baha california's pecific coast meth had kidnapper murders on the run i was a former meth supplier i absolutely do not believe in destiny jesus christ there was a link to a missing flier with pictures in a fone number to call i diled an a switchboard operator answered for th san francisco police department i realized i had no idea what to say i i said i'm calling about a flier for a missing girl viana correlli a flier sir the operator said ore i guess a poster i said a missing poster cerd the whereabouts of a missing person no i said i'd swa i just need to talk to somebody in charge of the viana corelli case can you spell that sir i spelled the name she put me on holed three times obviously i had not called the right percon i looked up other contact info for the san francisco police department i made a couple more calls and quickly realized i needed to fake a little more competonts here is what i was can to say look i'm certainthat there is a team of officers and volunteers conducting canvasing an search parties i would to volunteer to join the effort but the conversation never got that far instead each time nobody knew what i was talking about i finally convined somebody to trancs for me to the detective's division i got an answering machine saying that the office was closed until monday morning the lack of information e lack of interest by the police department was surprising unbelievable relly this whole story had become front pageh news because of the way the san francisco police had already bungled it the newspaper said that after correlli and pinkerton's landlord was re ported missing the plice did not respon for a month and when they did finally arrive at his building to look for him they found his tenants correlli and pinkerton unwilling to let them search theproperty a police dog keyed on correlli's van in the driveway there were blood stayins visible on the open gorage buthe officers had no warrant they allowed the couple to drive away in their beat up white mercury sedan the cops eventually towed correlli's van but then incredibly they did not search it on the inpoun lot somebody finally looked inside found the body of the landlord he would been dead for six weeks by this time correlli and pinkerton were already hundreds to miles away selphon record showed that they made it as far as vagus nd then for three months nothing maybe the san francisco police for not the best resource here i looked online for volunteer groups flier passerrouders candelihte vigils again nothing all that was left at this point was the little girl's family the grandparents and an uncle that the newspaper had called the family spoxsman probably every d net job in the world was calling them the smarmy in vestigatoris in the psychics griftor is conmen i found the uncle's phone number and then just sort of diled it went exactly you would think it would which is to say badly if your mant objective in a conversation as to convince some one the yournoct crazy you have aready lost essentially what the uncle said was thank you for your concern the police are doing everything they can we appreciate the support and then the call was over i was on my own to be honest it felt sort of good sort of familiar but better as i knew without a dout that this was the right thing to do i was going to baha now i just had to go one and tell my wife she was not happy you said you are gongto help people in an earthquake she said this is not our problem this is not your fight she was crying and yelling they are drug atics they are murderers she spent a long time listing reasons why i should not go i understood why she was worried bahas rough every couple of weeks there 's another string of beheadings ore a government official hung from a bridge usually thanks to the drug cartills last year a guy nick named ell posaleto the stuemaker tconfessed to dissolving the bodies of more than three hundred of his victims and ascid these stories help keep bahop prostin free of turis free a development free of laws it is the old wild west the old west there is no selphone service sokelling knew she could not even call me down there ti kept repeating the one thing she could not argue with nobody's looking for those little girls i said if i do not go who will a theythe next day saturday i packed the gas cans topo maps che p s watered jugs fix o flat hi sent anymale to my bass saying that something sudden had come up and that i'd be taking a vacation week ore maybe too i took the lousy missing flire that i had found on line and redesigned it i hdded a picture of the infant and a photof a car from the auto trater that match richard crely's white mercury i translated the flierd to spanish and changed the headline to read sick with strata which means kidnapped i went to kincos and prented twenty five hundred copies ba californiet self was the dusty peninsula that begins near the sandiego tu want a border ends th thousand miles later in the resort town of copus on lucas there is only one road that runs from top to bottom and at various points along the way at passes tiny villages and military check points and about two dozen of the state run pemax gastations without much to go on this is what i chose to believe we yourd crrelly knew nothing of baha he spoke no spanish and had no friends he had no weapons at this point and no money the family was still traveling in the mercury sedan they would not willingly double back from military check points a crossin to areas where they would be required to show idee in register e tween the beat up sedan and the newborn they had to be somewhere close to the highway i spent the first day passing out fliers the gastations at police stations at military check points where i also passed out old played by magazines i put my truck to grease the skids with soldiers the trick i resurrected from the old days i made countless stops and starts at every market and rancho near a dusty crossroads i told the story not a single person had hard it before but they were all titilated now by the drama of the murderous couple in their poor children just before dark i arrived in sankantein the town where the couple might hav been spotted a month earlier tacostands bars hotels camp grounds nobody had seen or heard of the family i went to bed some time around midnight but i could not fall asleep i lay on the lumpy mattress and tried to invision every possibility crelli and pinkerton living in a village ad they squatted it an abandoned ranch they found a benefactor they aready dead i wondered if maybe i was in saing to be here sometime before i fell asleep i hit me that they might not even have come to mexico at all the next morning i wroke to the sounds of roosters day two i got my truck and headed south i had my doubts but i figured i had to keep going an hour later i came to a tiny farming community called santamaria i went into a market and left to stack o fliers small group of men was melling around to potic coffee when i went back outside to the gas pumps the guy who ran the market came out with one of the fliers in his hand these people he said they were here really i said somehow i doubted it he looked at the flier again they bought water milk and potato ships they asked if we sold dipers but we dont his grocery list was specific they were here they had to be what vehicle were they driving i asked this one he pointed at the flir how long ago three weeks the timing was exactly right did you see the children i asked no he said i thanked him and left with a new plan i would raced straight down to the baho sor state line the half way point o the peninsula where the family would be forced to register i would drive the emigration officials for a pick at the book and confirmed that correlliand pinkerton did not sneak past then i double back and mad scoop him up a net i was driving fast now that the tirs squealed on the turns tbefore a half hour past i reached the village vill rosario pa mak station there cod be the last gas for two hundred milhs probly told my tankanell rosario three hundred times it was too importan to place to not stop for a men ute nhanksome fliers i jammed on the brakes and skitted across the lane into the gas station i was posting a flier near a gas pump in one of the attendants approached olavi he said i saw her the blond where i asked it pump number one he said she asked me about a cheep place to eat when i said three days ago three days i said you mean three weeks days he said three days ago next door to the gas station was a small mo tell i showed the flier to the two ladies working behind the reception desk when they saw it they both shrieked covered their mouths yes the family was here n ell rosario they were living in a small house just two doors away from the home of one of the receptionists yes they were still driving the white car but they would been trying to sell it in the village and yes the little girls were still with him but the infant whose name was faith was very sick the blondwoman they told me was earning money by teaching dance lescense to children in the village for ten pasoes an hour a buck an hour the house was a hundred meters away less what time or the classes i asked three ofclock one of them said i looked at my watch it was two forty five correlli and pinkerton were here now a block away things were moving fast through my head that it fell earth time had stopped i could suddenly see everything that i needed to do next clearly i told the women at the motel not to telling one about our conversation i ran back to the gas station and rip down the fliers and took back the stack i had left i needed to get my truck in its american license plate off the road fast it was a tiny town i had to assume that word would soon get back to correlliand pinkerton i drove a half block to the town small paphone office and hid my car behind the building an operator connected me to the uncle and santicrous i found them i said i told him the stories quickly as i could he gave me a phone num ber for a u

chair i'm the comingdon the what you want he was clearly irritated by the interruption but he led me to a tiny room with the metal desk and closed the door when i'd finished telling him the story he radioed his off duty copse and tolld them to report to the station immediately they calld for back up from sankanteen the dance class was half over in the police station bullet proof vests were pulled

the grandparents and then he said the paper workill be ready by the time it is needed go do it mexican federal cops arrived from sancanteine a few moments later for unmarked truck loads full of guyes with big mustaches and leathered jackets most of him carried assault rifles one of the trops was sent out to observe the house they radio back to the station that the children were out front with to mother ie few seconds later came the report that the father was now outside too the leader of the federal squads said bominals then he put a hand on my chest and ordered me to stay put ten minutes later they returned michel pinkerton in the children were in the back of one truck crrelly was handcuffed in another they jerked him out of his seat and stood him in front of me when he saw me the fight trained out of him and he fanacy he might have held about the arrest being just a mexican shake down was dead he asked me why he was being arrested i did not respond viana stared out the door of the other truck wide eyed and nervous michel pinkerton was working hard to convince her daughter that everything was oque she held the baby tightly in one arm and hugged vianna with the other rocking them both gently against her we caravan back to the federal headquarters where a big group of copse whooped as richard crelly was pulled from the truck and let up to the station michel and the girls

different than i had expected well he said viana loved her grandparents too i drove home the next day i did not know it yet but the metia was already in a full frenzy seeanend and see bes and fox were calling my office all the news reports were pr black and riotand after a whole mont polese that nole lo finding the girls but one gi did in just two days jame sprang whothey were calling me a hero but i did not feel one nthe lotteways i felt the homerecker it did a couple of interviews but they went poorly well thit is off you went to mexico and what did you do a basely a i a i created a flier and spanish and the thing about the losso i stopped the one bright spot in all the coverge the one moment that made me feel maybe i had done the right thing was semvidio shot at the air port when vianna got off the plane in the ous in at vianna seize her grandmother at the arrival gate she yells grandma runs under arms and they are both ryin the grandma tells her it is oqu you are home now i mustnt watch that bidyo a hundred times all week the phone calls did not stop producers are trying to by the movirihts long lost relatives tried to re connect everybody was calling except vianna's grandparents i'd been thinking of them a lot i just wanted to know that the girls were happy it not happy but that they were ofqu that they werein to be ofqu tut the grand parents did not call i could't call them i mean they had to be overwhelmed i fell maybe i'd intruded into the girls lives enough already but i needed to do something i saidt a huge box of presents to the kids dand notebook for viana sor she coul write letters to her parents on the inside cover i wrote her a note i tried to make her understand why i'd done this it was kind of an explanation kind of an apology even thughi knew she was way to young to comprehend any of it i got no response and then i started learning some odd things on one newspapers webside i found a comment from a guy who said he was meshell pinkerton's brother ie called her white trash said that he hoped she was brought to justice for her crimes a reporter told me that he would interviewed the grandfather and that the guide made some pretty hateful remarks about richard correlli bot hoping that correllie would become some big black eye's girl friend in prison d then there was a photographer who would been sent to take pictures of the family who gave an equally depressing report he said he could not shoot any photoes in the house cause it did not look children even live there no toys no kids stuff on the walls course that does not mean anything it is just cosmatic it did not mean they were not taking good care of them or did not love them i did not know what to believe i was worried about thos little girls and nothing i'ad heard since baha was making me feel any better eight months passed the trial date was set and then one day in the middle of the week i got a call from viana's grandfather it was not a thank you but it was a mayn that thing you did not mexico was really something and i said yer and then he reiterated his hopes that vianna's father be raped in prison every day for the rest of his life he told me that the trial was about to begin that i might get some phone calls from prosecutors and then the call was over correllie was charged with first togree murder he had mitted the landlord had died during a fight they had but said it was on intentional e trial the details came out the landlord's lip was busted open his nose was broken he was badly bruised and had been stabbed with the small knife his body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag bound with ducktape buried under a pile of trash in the back of the van the official cause of death wath suffocation the defence argued that meth had given correllia condition called hypofrontality meaning could not think straight he made whacky decisions storing a corpse in his van and kid napping his daughter and fleeing to baha in other words the meth made him do it which as a former meth's smuggler did not make me feel great the trial ended with a hung jury richard correlli was not convicted o first togree murder he would have to be retried on he lesser charge the some point i got a phone call from a private investigator mi shell pinkerton's public defender had hired the guyde to track me down mis pinkerton says that you spend a couple of days with her in the kids in mexico he said i told him that seemed a strange way to describe it did you see her he asked interacting with the children i told him that i did wall she was thinking you might have some good things to say about what you saw there it took me a moment to understand that i'd just been asked to be the character witness for a m athatic an accused murderer who had taken her kids on the run and in a way i was really tempted because she didn' seem a good mother on that day mother who loved for kids anyoye w whose kids loved her but i could not do it none of this had really turned out it was supposed to inot i imagined it would i was afraid tod noge the outcome again one way or the other i did not want to put my tulm on the scale i could think of too many ways my testimony might just make things worse this was none of my business when i went to bah and it was not my business now only now i knew it h jame sprain in saniego richard correlly eventually played

impulse to step in wethers turned the backs and do good rescue the needy we have arrived at at two of our programmac too i'd to spank the academy every year since nineteen ninety eight the university of montavalo the smallerbroart's college outside of bermingam alabama as held an event called the life raft debate got a simple premise ther's ben gobocatastrophe nowwe war something as wiped out the world except miraculously the hundred of students who are in the audience of the life draft debate students are on a life raft it is only got one spot left and six professors another university staffers sit up on the stage i make the case one by one that their department there academic discipline is the one that deserves that one empty seat that deserves to be saved that there academic discipline will help the student survive will make the students lives much more meaningful dven professors take part in this every year there different winners every year nancy updike heard about the event from a listener a student back when we first broadcast today show name carry matthews holocary matthews and nancy looked into this the man who started the life raft debate a philosophy professor at the university of montevala named michael paten warned me when he sent a bunch of d v ds of the event that there would been a sort of convergence of silliness at the two thousand seven debate and i was looking forward to the silliness as a corrective to what i figured would be a pretty intense over all intellectualism and dryness because what else is there to thank when some one says he i've got a d v d of university professor's arguing about how there area of study is better than any one elseis area of study i poppe the two thousand seven td v d in and instead of a debate i watche gimics pile up one after another e dean 'f te business scol rolled into the cam when he van was an how on a harley to the tune of the song thats nat namest tenae wast land but that we all know is to his was lan he hart tuck off his letther jacket and stolled up to next to the other cocin stage he was the first to make this five menute pits to the audience i gevery much i gevery much indeed i har o ni too i talk to you about stratag yopa strategist you will understand what that meeds i was tra to take thestras an weekness as at you may possess and to put them together with opportunity now wont the life ra you cont need tis because thit will be women are gonl be some men and we eed to put together you'r strengths at your weaknesses i know i sound my elvess but i'm sorry it just comes out that way dean of the business golhe went on to say that strategy would not be enough on the life raft he also promised leadership he did a demonstration asking the audience to stand o tak eyes this is your part go with me now here ago ey we got to leadership y ladies you get it you do the other part we w we w raco oen weow an we we keep in mind that the stageis set up with electur and microphones tables with professors seated at them facing the audience just some earnest think tanksponsered political discussion or a college debate a professor of education showed up on stage in a formal academic robe and then took it off to reveal a superhero costume to audience cheers who has captain education de his right was an art history professor who argued that the post opoculyptic world would be bleak without images nd the survivors we need in our historianc to get the most out of any images they created or conclusion out of the blue we can build a new world a batter world a world in wich wimin have the powor remember it is the man wholok t us into this mast the chair of the english department tried breefly to argue for the importance of story telling in human cultur and then used up most of his time reciting a three minute and fifteen second poem he made up about a mythical women's football team at the university and its champion kicker mighty mitzy mighty mitse mi get to kick once more shes put it through for three good points for foot wes sure to score watching e debate i found myself getting strangely mad iad gone to a wrestling match and all the wrestlers worried that the audience would find wrestling too violent the just walked around doing the preening and smack talking and as i remember it pretty much every student getting a liberal arts degree worries at some point that their education might actually be useless that is what makes the liferaft debate a funny idea and a serious one it is a foreum for the students to say to their professors make us believe in the value of what we are doing here that cause seemed lost in this debate and then the devil's advocate got up to rescue us all every liferaft debate has a devil's advocate he makes the same argument every year vote for no one and he never went in this debate te devil's advocate was an untenured english professor named john smith who when he heard how the debate was going threw out most of his prepaired notes and spoke off the cuff making the most impassion speech of the entire event and one of the most satisfying speeches have herd in a long time i'm going to let play through the end i required mi freshment to com to this because i thught tus recovering argument that they would be exposed argument gas i am sorry what i to do is to give you a little history of the life raft debate and try to explain how we got to the present pass a by way i guess of apology it used to be that the life r aft debate was a it is esponser by the philosopy club and it was a fairly sam i philosophical discussion about which disciplines truly contributed the most to a liberal education that is what was being contested i have not been here the whole ten years thave been doin it but i've been here five and i can dimly remember when michael paten one he was funny but he also made a case he made a serious argument see if parker the next year one he made a good argumentwhich is a double achievement because sociology is not a real discipline but something whent terribly awry in about two thousand and fore and i cannot remember this cause i was on the stage wilson faulin stood on a chair and declared that god is a his storyan and the audience ate it up and voted for him a he was they did not were not really voting for wilson faulin the scholar or the his storian i'm sure he is both those things but tey wre voting for wilson found the baptist preacher the next year you voted for a cook and i thought i could not get any worse in the year after that you voted for at administrator you have brought yourself to this because seriously these are smart people up here they have stooped to some of the stupidest crap to make you laugh and all of us who are a serious teachers sometimes can fall into that trap we want to be funny we want to be entertaining and we get this sense that if thei'r laughing we must be teaching it is not always true i think there is a general argumentative fallacy that is gone on with every single one of these poor people up here and i dontknow ow they got sucked into it tis probably your fal ih it is what i call the sherry ford fallacy sherre you here to night o you may remember this from the two thousand and for debateits it is always stuck in my mind sherry argued that because you need to communicate to have sex you need a communications professor to have sec i'm pretty sure you do not i mean it is quite possible images are great but we have not yet heard the case made how much you needet our historian to have images you probably gant have images anyway education is wonderful but people were doing education for a couple of thousand years before some one got the idea of having education professors ah people been telling stories for a long time before there ware departments of english and foreign language is not forth and i hate to do that because that is my own disciplines i have to shoot down but good lord the i read a recided a poem at's not an argument look folks it is gone too far a it is you were not you you may have been entertained for the last half hour or fortifi mense whatever but i do not think you were intellectually challenged i do not think a strong case was made for anybody's discipline and i honestly think the life raft debate has got in kind of far away from what initially used to be and what it should be you have a chance to night to change that you it devote for no one is not to say oh i do not any of them or the're not all funnyer tey're not charming or whatever is just to say come on treat us a dulse argue for your discipline you can do that an be funny but please you can send that message and i hope to night you will ere's what i real ife when i felt thrill that the students for the first time ever in the life rafterbate voted for the devil's advocate at some point for me the whole thing became a metaphor for politics in the uass right now the non debates the pandering the flimsiness the endless stage craft and all of it swallowing up the serious people along with the vacuous ones part of the time i was seated in the bleachers watching it and then part of the time i was off to the side pacing madly john smith the devil's advocate himself also saw politics in the debate when i got in touch with him after watching there is a degree to which we sort of expect public discourse is is going to be just horrifically debased that you are going to have these got alful arguments and there is there is nothing else i axcept crappy emotional appeals that mayor may not actually impact on real issues iso one thing that did feel really good is that the students responded they said no we do care about substance carrying about substance does not men we have to surround ourselves with massive bores but it does not mean we have to stiffen our spines and rays our standards which john says he is done with help from roll models people simon cowl actually have done wonders for us as teachers simon cowavav amercanite of of amercanita right as of the nointies everybody was frickand concerned with everybody's self esteem tha it was very hard to just actually come out and say something a that everybody knew is true but it would have been perceived as being in polite it became very hard or unusual if you actually said this is a bad argument ought to a student on a paper am a you and and you would think that students who have been brought up and being told their special all the time this is everybody talks about them loneals as the the generation that were brought up being told their special all the time would be these fragile narsissists who would collapse at the instant that they got some real criticism but what i found a is that they are quite robust in the years since john spoke and two thousand seven the life raft debate has been more substantive while still being funny one yeare a history professor told the audience that history shows that in the chaos following a global catastrophe one person on the life raft one of you in the audience he said would definitely become a dictator and he as a historian would be the ideal adviser to this dictator to tell them how to be benevolent a mathematics professor all in camaphlige dear calmly argued that without mathematics the life raft survivers would have trouble navigating anywhere and building anything durable once they got there he also promised that no one on the life raft would have to do map ever again we want ll be ono nanciapdagnojuces if i shell in the earcentor

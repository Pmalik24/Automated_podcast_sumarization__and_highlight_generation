boston university investigates the ibrum exkend anti racis centerp a turning general mericarlandheads to the hill where the giopi grillsam and a ronz president goes to the uente chide america i' ventuoner o this is t venchbaro show the shows ponser backxpress be pianis time to stand up against big tact protect our datat express vepianticon flesh men already fok you remember iberam x kendi this ky is a genius how do i know that he is a genius he is such a genius the he actually on a'm a carthor genius grand in two thousand and twenty one thos a six hundred and twenty five thousand no strings attached fellowship honoring his exceptional crativity scholarly achievements givt for communicating his anti racis work and ideas with diverse audiences and promise for further benefiting society and is boston university that dome that gave him this anti racis to grant t that that is super inspiring stuff now for those who have not followed the prodigious career of ibermax kendi the founder of the b centorf franti rasis research he is the author of a bunch of really not very good books and he speaks nonsense for livmin the nonsense that he speaks all about ho america is deeply and irrevocably rasis he wrote most famously a book aled stamp from e beginning the definint of history of racist ideas in america abyt how america was literally racis in all of its iterations from the varibianning that is up to and including all of the constitutional protections of the bill of rihtes he also wrote a book led how to be in antirasist and he now has a podcas called b in anti rasis what exactly does this genius say about racism well he cannot really define the term he just knows that rases him exist wherever there is a disparity the diret quote from him as an anti racis when i see racial disparities icy racism which is unbelievably stupid and you might think that its genius it is really really stupid let me giveng example how stupid that is the vast majority of the enba is black that is a massiv racial disprity only thirteen per cent of the american population is black the vast majority of the enbi players are black does this mean that there has been some sort of deep and abiding racism in the n b a to make all of that happen conversely in hakey virtually all the players are white does that mean there is a deep and abiding races in that exist at the root of haki and that is why there snothemany black hockey players playing at the an acha level of course not it is incredibly silly if you see for example that ninety nine percent of men in of people intprison for violent crimer men less then two per cent are women is that because of some deeply sexis root in society theif we are a nonsext society fifty percent of people going to prison for a violent crime would be women presumably the truth is disparities exists across virtually every industry across virtually every metric in society for all of time ther are tie to everything from geography two invironmen the idea that if two groups by rase do not stack up identically in any particular area this is because of systemic and abiding racism is nonsense it is absolut nonsense in fact is unfalsifiable nonsense because legana literally ever y a reno of life is going to include group disparities age disparities height disparities waight disparities tthese desparities exist literally everywhere but iteramask kendy's intire proposal which was built up on the back of the beella movement in twenty twenty is that he does not need to prove that racism is actually at the rot of anything all he has to show is o disparity which again is incredibly stupid it makes his jobreally easy tbecause i too can point to disparities in every arena of life but unless i actually prove that that the reason behind the disparity is some sort of evil i've not proved anything but kendy because in two thousand twenty we decided as society hat you no longer had to prove that raceism was at the route of for example crimestatistics instead you could just simply claim that it was and than everyone who said that it wasnant was deemed to be racis this is the magic of ennedy kan he waved his magic one and suddenly everybody who is not racis before was racis he says that color blindness is racis if you think that race should not matter that is because your racis race does matter an theway we no race matters is because o disparities and those desparities are evidence of racism and if you say wil last vi ration matter that is because your racis do not you see well famously itrmax kendy mac carther genius grant award winner famously iermax kendy was it asked just couple of years ago about how to define racism here was this geniusis definition race throug them are we refinent u es e collection o oh race tis policansa re fo racial methedy that is thes thin you a rither wait the way that he justifind racism is race that racis policies that lead to racial inequity you cannot define a term by using the term that is not a possibility you cannot do that am meayou con try but it does not work again just to read you the quotes you understand hodon thisis quote i would define it as a collection of racis polities that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas the audience by the way watchingis actually laughed out loud and then he reiterated his definition and he adequet and anti raceis beenis pretty simply using the same terms anti racism is a collection of anti raceis policies leading to racial equity that are substantiated by anti racist ideas now again as i say just texpooc logic you cannot define an term by using the term if soone asks you to defind an elephant and yhe quickly explaine that an elephant is an animal mone is an elephant thow we not add any nw information to the discourse if you said an elephant is an animal that looks exactly an elephant an acts exactly an elephant peo will laugh at you because it is ridiculous that is exactly what irmx kendy is sayings that he does matually have to to fined the term now remember he was richlly rewarded for all of this crap in the middle of the bealeniscam that was happening in two thousand twenty again it was a scam the li that american society rests in unidentifiable but ever present racism is a lie the nocian that desparities and crimes to six are caused by racis to policing at's a lie but that ideal is very prominent was prertectly prom among liberal white folks who felt thatif they signe ibmax kendy a chack the same way tat they would have back in the nineteeneghtyes to al sharpton then they could give basily alsharpedon with ae potina of intellectual legitimacy some sort heu would give a dispensation to them you sign teermax kendy a check and now you are an antiracis is magicontiracis morks how do you show your an anti racis you become an anti racis it is not enough to not be racis is what kendy says if you say i'm not a racis i do not think the people shuld be judged on the base of their race he says that is not enough you mean to be actively anti racis and the onlway to be antiracis is to fight racis policies namely any policies that end in some sort of disparity in somesor vrsalis verity and the best way to fight those policies is to give two ibrmax kendy how magicgal which presumably is why jackdorsy into thoes and twenty geve kendyes new censer for anti racis research at boston university ten million dollars the vertacs foundation of vertect farmatuticals gave the sentr one point five million dollars over three years tbank of america brought in kendy to deliver his message and the boston globe teemd with kendy censer to creet a new media platform the sender frantiracis research has generated precisely zero ra research at this point far as any one it is where why reiscussing ibrma kendy today because hilariously after be ou set up in entire center in owed to this idiot thet after be you set up with the boston globe imedia enterprise with irmax kendy after all of this happen it turns out that boston university is now announcing an inquiry in the ibermax kendy's anti racis center turns out the whole thing is a scam oh no you do not say all that is a shock you mean a person cannot find the word racism those being paid note to find the word racism and then the way that you actualy become not racis is osadt you mean that was a scam you mean just any other cult if the calt leader cannot tofind the terms but the terms involve you having sec with the calld leader it is calt yet that is this that is this thou get to more of this in just once if ibelotic leedful about this is because idiocy that is clearly obvious to the human eye ignored and matastisized we will eventually take root and then come back to kill the host and that is precisely what has happen with regard to ibermax kendy's version of the anti racism evero could see this a scam that was idiocy ther's emperor's new closes garbage everone new this at the time anti rasishom is a collection of entiracis policies the target racis disperities back by racis ideas but everyone could tell this is gobbled t gook nonsense but well toe pretend not because black lives matter now how protect tor black las beyond anybody no prove it does but in fact pprecisely the opposite it turns out the best way to alleviate dosparities is to actually folcs in on human behavior and focusint onthe behavior thet leads to those disparities but ivmax kendegot owout the lot of money for a long ti will get into the details in just one second first you knowl company is looking out

laid off som twenty per cent of their entire staff following the fact that they had millions n millions in millions of dollars and i it just randomally went for o in just gone now philip copelan is a former imploye of the boston university iber max kendy center for grift anda and here is what he posted recently on his social media quote bostong university neds to explain how one of it is from mor centers andsed up in this situation and how mass lay off's ar antiracis this act of employment violence and troma it is not just about individual leaders it is about the cultur and systems that allowit to accur i lov pa man it is anoroberus t to snake eating its own tail here you see imrex kendy preaches the grift and then when he actually uses the grift to firis on people creating a disperity an outcome this means he is now violiting his own anti racis recept it turned that firebunch black people at the boston university center for amex kendy's grift andthen you fire bunch black people and you now of created i sperity then who is the anti rasis and who is the racist iberam ex kendy anti rasism is not a branding exercise pare campaign or pat to self promotion it is a life andoth matter says phlip coplan too much of higher education responden to the called racial reckoning with theater theropean marketing mascurating his institutional ommitment wheever this a curred it needs to be exposed for iexposed for the obsenity it is there is too much at stake those thos who believe in real ansi rases need to demand more from our colleges and universities aure students are watching tto those who laboring an institutions to commitment to anti racism its cosmetic and hippocritical i see yu i hur i am with you sis philip coplan he says he has a story to tell during my time at the center i proposed on developed a new fellowship program aled designing antiracis t curriculum this was a collaboration wit the center for teaching an learning in the office of diversity and inclusion all professional useless people we successfully launched this new program i decidethad i could no longer work at the center due to the mis management i witness iw subsequently told i could no longer be part of the leadership of the fellowship by created the excuse for this was that i was leaving the center nd would be replace by some one else this was in spite o the fact t i said i was willing to continue serving without a course by out or compensation the excuse made no cense there is already a fact that to member serving on t e leadershiptim we no filiation with the center taking a program from theblack faculty member that created it it is apparently what be u considers anti rac sysms they fire t a black eye this means that they are the tru racis to now beu has launched a full skill inquiry ins te iberamacts kendy centr for anti racis research and grift the censiment comes the week after kendy to laid off more than half of the centr staff not twenty per cent fifty per cent i'm sarry the complains a buw spokes person said focust on the centers culture and grant management practices the inquiry announced whensthey represens a broadenin of a previous examination of the center's grant management practicse according to the spokes person rachel lapal covalgerio kendy takes strong exceptions the allegations made in recen complaints and medea reports she said since it is announched launch in june of twenty twenty just days after the murder of jorge floidto maneapolists the center has raised tens of millions of dollars from tecontripnors bostonarya corporactions and thousands of small doners according to the bossin globe which is one of the institution that sponsor kend the money whos ment to finance range of ambitious projects a day debates to track racial disparities nation wide a graduar to gree programm ammedia enteroprisin research teams studying the effects of tostemic racesmon health and society some of those projects have come to fruiction including the emancipator a diginal publication launched with the bostin glob's opinion staff in twenty twhen once another words the bostin globe ot its part but nothing else happened with the money there is no racial data tracter that was supposed lea the centerpiece of their research there is in fact no research what exactly is the list of the centrs achievements funding for numerous research projects collaboration in a projec launch by journalis at the atlantic magazine they paid the atlantic to do what the atlantic does an organizing two policy convenings who policy can benings where is the money om it is just kind of gone apparently kendy has complete a umber of personal projects since twenty twenty button recent monts he is been on leave from the center the returned last week and in a series of zu meetings told the proximately twenty of the centers staffers they would be laid off according to spenser pissin a b professor and leader in the centr's policy conference the layolse were initiated by doctor kendy and there is represented a strategic pivit according to b u the censer will now pursuav fellowship model rather than its research of based approach there was no research hard have a research based aproach win got no research again y all got sammed y all got scammed and that is the messager if you cant articulate why it is that somebody should give you money to do a thing all you can do is threaten them tha you will call them a racist were a bigot if they do not do the thing this means tha youare a colt leader in a scamartist and that is what happened right here with the center for anti racis bigotry and this is indeed the greatest scam in modern america the d i scam the woke scam it is a scam woganis by theway has an actual definision wogans springis from the writings of critical legal theory it springs from the writings of canbrely cranshaw the basic idea is kenndy's idea than america is rife with institutional racism that that institutional racesm serves the purposes of whitesu premisy and that any disparity is evidence of that racism that is kend and an nosho and it is a scam because the only way tha you can escape this bind the day hofe creeted this unfalseifiable e theoric racism the yoar a part of is to give them money and then they waste the money they spend it on themselves there is it any one how many scams have to be uncovered before people realize it to scam how many b alem leaders have to buy themselves houses patrice colors with the cash before you realize that it is a scam truly it is an amazing amazing thing sak every other day one of these scams is exposed for the scam that it is and then people tust keep on paroting the scam d i is a scam in his been a scam for as long as it has been a major part of american life and i continues to be a scam to day ogay in a second oregn toget to the latest on russell bran agand there is really no new informationthat is emerged about rssell brand and the alligations against him yas that is not stopping people from ittempting to remove any livelihood he ight have ill gets that momentarily first everybody knows i love my huelix mattres andhave you checked out their most

free pillows from alisers howd over to helik sleepe out comslashmen yeus cot helics partner twenty it is the best offer yet si can last long with heliks better sleep starts right now can meanwhile on the russell bran an front i got a say that you we will see what happens of the alligations against rossell bran the matropolitan police are soliciting i counts in evidence of the alligations tat are made against rusellbran for the possibility of prosecution of him if the turns out that these can be substantiated i rgn to find out but that is not stopping people in the british government from immediately going after any out revenue that bran could be receiving from any outlets we talk yesterday about the fact that you to has now demonotize t all of russell bran's vidios on you to alligations are tan tomount to conviction in the world of yiew to which is wered could hardly be literally has admitted to drugging and robbing men but i see that her vidios are earning tons and tons of cash a lager shaffer pointed out went out by the way it is a good point and it happens to be in obvious touble scaderd well now the british government is literally sending letters to rumbles to rumble is a is a vidio sigt that hosts russells show and the you cape parlament they' a committee that sent a letter to the s eo of rumble that letter from dame carolint did not in nage the chair of the culture media and sport committee wrote it this letter to rumbles and quote i am writing concerning the serious allegations regarding russell bran and the context of his being contempt ro bide r unrumble with more than one point for million followers the culture media and sport committee is raising questi ons with the broadcasteres in production companies who previously employed brand to examine both the culture of the industry the past and weather that culture still prevails today however we are also looking t his use of social meda including on rumble where he issued his pre emptive response to accusations made against him by the sunday times and channel fors at dispatches hell we recognize that rumble is not the creator of the contents we are concerned he may be able to profit from the contents on the platform we ill be grateful if you could confirm weather brand is able to monitizes content including his vidios related to serious accusations against him if weave leke to kno whether rumble intends to join you to bin suspending bransability to earn money on the platform we are also to know what rumble is doing to insure creators are not able to use the platform to undermine the welfare of victims of interpropriate and potentially illegal behavior sto got the british government basically tacitly threatening rumble with some sort of unspecified consequences for not demonotising russelbranof government working to push social media platforms to demonitized people on the base of alligations and the brish government has far not yet prosecuted that is a mazing while cris pavlovsky whos the c o of rumble issuled response quotoday we receives an extremely disturbing letter from a committee chair in the eucae parliament wele rumble obviously to plore sexual assault rape in all serious crimes and believe that both lege victims an the accuse ore entitle to a full and serious investigation its vennle to not recent alliegations against brand have nothing to do with content on rumble's platform we are gard is deeply in appropriate and dangerous that the ou cae parliament would attempt to control who is allowed to speak on our platform or to earn a living from doing singling out an individual demanding his ban is uen more disturbing given the absence of any connection between the allegations and his contents on rumble we are agreed the behavior of many of rumble's creators we refused to penalize them for actions thet've nothing to do with our platform i mean that should be pattently obvious to anybody but the fact that the ou cae parliament is now on lecion committees to try to pressure social media companies to remove monitary compensation from russell brands vidos is totally crazy mean that it that is in fact a violation of every freespeech principl if the government im understand was happening here the government has not charged russell brand with a crime and yet they are now pressuring social media to remove monitary compentation from all of his videos the witing open letters two places rumble about all this that is wild that is wild stuff m yuaren talk about by true turannical kind of frets that is ate that is a turrannical thrigt let us assume that you got accused of something not in cort not by the police you are accuse publicly of a thing and the government then went to youre employer and tried to get you fired on the basi of an alligation that has not yet been substantiated by the police that is scary stuff n that isto obviously ending around you process but ow this is the world in which we live and that is ate that is a scary scaryworl ta can one second oreng to get to meric garlands being of lawlessness mericarland the atturny general of the united states appeared on the hill yesterday first as you might know we

committee and did not go amazing for mari garlan according to th wastry journal he stresse the independence of the d oja's criminal case against huncher bidon as republicans accused him during ae combat of congressional hearing of shong leniency toward the son of the president who appointed him whoas a six our hearing republicans are ramping up their impeachmen inquiry into president biton but it is not just targaning hunter and and joe that inquiry obviously targets garland as well because garland was presiding over a deoje that attempted to cut an obvious sweetheartdeo with jobidons son while jobidon's president of the united states an amerigarland is denying having anything do it this he is lall it was in me i i'm completely independent from joe and then david wise the prosecuterin this case was completely independent from me but here is the magic of being a member of the deoge it is very much wik henry the third will no one rid me of this troublesome priest with regard to thomas backet you do not have to say anything the president of the united states can basically say i'm very sar that my son is being dargee and meri garlans ak all you n' you have to tell me what to do i know what to do ob quash that case and you noght on you have to act in order quash that case i'll have to do is not give david wise special council abilities is will not give it to him now he claims will david wiseneverasser di wise as have to ask for it youre sppose to give it obviously its up to you to give him that youd all meri garland had to do in order to effectuate this the sweethartdeo which had to have sign off at the deoje for shore is nothing that is all he had to do just do nothing do not intervene do not give m special council status to daved wise do not do anything and then magically a sweethart deal would be cut that is the probs americonsliy i did naturally yel we know we know you natually have to do any that is the beauty of being the head of the justice to partment he got grolles yesterday on the hill by a bunch of republicans here our bunch of house republicans pepperind garland with questions about hunder bidon mister wise has been belet prosecutor on the hunder byn case this twenty eighteen i here is the question he will leave a prosecutors since heue was a appointed by presedent trom oca why o me askin why has the justic doparman drag this investigation out for long as it really ta years to determan if hunder bidon whi on a federal form related o perching affire stoo wise long time queer prosecuor presiden trump appointed him as you'r not answer ing the question is that standard preceedur should it take that long to make such a simple determination i'm answering the question et me an opportunity do he was charged with that investigation under the previous administration he is continued he knows how to conduct investigations and i have not intruded or attempted to a valu wa that because t was the promise i made to the senate he is been truly independent is will of fer bit again here is the point he asn't have to do anything i'll as to duis coming office and not giv david wi's additional special council bilities now youn say divid wises appointed by trunp that is true it is also true that if you are looking for independencefrom me just as partman run by the suspect father then may be when you come in you say o ca well yet i understand that the other party was in charge of t justice parminell now i'm in charge of the justice partmen and that is gon awkward since my bois is the dad of the guy that were looking to prosecute to maybe i should give some semblance of independence to the special prosecutor that'v bee the way to go about this representig jum drorn one after mericarland as well here he was yesterday quo mister wyses has full authority to bring cases an other jurisdictions if he feels it s necessary that was your response a turny general to senator grassley's question on march first twenty twenty three just referensen when mister bishop was questing you only problem is he would alrity bedn turned down by the yous aturnty the district of columbia mister graves he did ot pull authority did he i had an extended conversation with as oto grassly at the time we briefly tuch time the section five if teing question and how that process went i miv an oter mill a gas a quitstral simple mister garland u sity at complete authority but y tarity bidn turned down cannotbe ring inaction in the district of columbia and the yous aturny their sad no you cannot and then you goto the united sate send it under oath that he has complete authority i mo say again that that no one had the authority to turn him down they could refuse i to partner with him that cou not ears whenever u youd language refused to partner is turning down mean that clearly is true if you refuse to ut in prosecuting a gase that obviously is saying no to them clearly yet again when merigarlan is saying is i intervien i no have say wal yabit if the message goes out that all these other district attorneys all over the country they are better off not partnering with david wis's in prosecuting these cases than what do you think is going to happen precisely represented tomas massi of kentucky he saying it the same thing when i said how many agents er assets of the government were present on januar fif tan january six and agitating in the crowd to go into the capital on how many went into the capital can you answer that now i do not know the answer f that question o last time you do not know how manyithere were or there were none i know the asswer to either of those questions if there were an y i do not know how many you tdan't know whether there are any i think you may have just pertured yourself that you dn't know that there were any you want to say that again dit you do not know that there were any o personal knowledge of this matter i think what i said thi last time you have had two years to hid out and at day by way that was in reference to rays and yesterday you indided him ya son't again that is about january six thewhole point is the mericarland as always the the accuser is often the person who is doing the thing and that is particulary tornt comes to the geojank for years all we heard is that bill bar was somehow a a tool of donald trump doing all the biting of don trouble is weary beis bilbar was a direct odso donald trump over for example january six an all the election stuff that trump was doing between the election and january sect to the point that trumpasering to fire him bara threaten to walk and all the rest of the sort of stuff meanwhile yoad ericholder who is the atterniy general under baroccamama openly saying his baroccumon his wingman you had the rede lynch on the tarmap with with the clintons and and meanwhile you have now merigarland doing the exact bidding of jobidon i war supposed to believe that its completely a political garland did testify that he i he wouldn' even say if he had discussed the hunter bytin probe with david wise here he was this very wearn answer is represent mak johnson losiana grilling him can you tell us about any brief inter discussions that you personally have had with mister rock wise regarding any an all federal investigations of hnterbud i mens say again i promise the senate that i would not interfere with mister wyser you have not o iobjus underoat to dhat your testimony is you have not had any discussions with mister wise about this matter under oath my testimony to day is that i promise t thon the senate i would not im intruded in hims investigation i do not intend to discuss the liber internal justice department a liberations whether or not i had them oh ok case for you your testimonytoday is you arenot gon to tell us whether youe had discussions with mister wise i testimony to day is i told the committee that i would not interfere i made clere that mister wys would have theforty to bring cases that he thought were appropriate likit o get but you will not asked in sir any specific question is about the exact hontent of conversations with david wise which is which is weird and the garland was was asked well did did you talk to anybody that t hunter probeis a got ton rember i i do not think this te true do you think that is true that he dos't remember if he had any conversations with anybody about the hunterbrob have you had personal contact with any one tat pa headquarters about the hunder by investigation ah not rea i do not i do not recollect the answer o that question but the f b i works for the justice department if som sory amser an you do not recollect you do not recollect whethe you talked with anybody at pia headquarters about an investigation of the president's son i i do not believe that i did o cas sre sure again mericarlan one of the most obvious ly corrupt buricrats in washington d c and ha thanksmistmicanal for not puting that gy on the supreme court of the united states also mericarland was rigged t over the coals about the do jas bizare decisions over the course of his tenor including multiple afbi field offices coordinating to prepare in anti catholic mammo that happened yor calld back in august when house judichary comitte chairman jim jordin an some committee on the constution limited government chant a chairman mi johnson sents a letter tafbad rect or cris ray revieling of the af yanrichman field off's cordinate with multiblaffby offices across the country to produce a memo targning traditional catholics as potential terrace well mericarlan as asked about this and he denied that there is any religious discrimination at the d o ja which om sure through the chair i ask you do you agree that traditional catholics or vile extremists it have no idea what your what the traditional a means here gi ge leno to tan oi yurge may i aswer quat gaiohea that some one with my family backrob wit de scriminate against to any religion is outrageous tis absurs tour aturning tenral in wi im er f wy i that did thiss it was your f be i that was sending and we have the memos we have the emals wes sending under cover agents into catholic churches may now whan mericarlands referring to there is the fac that ies of jewish backgrounds the idea that that you would never ever engaged in religiouscrimination is crazy well that really is not the question is his religious background tit is question of perception if you believe his why he he is why he hesitated when he said wonder traditional catholicswhere we talking abaut here because the reality is that it is very easy to believe that you are the good guy and that you are not engaged in a form of discrimination even if your afbiifield offices are

villany the united states aloud president he brahem rici who as the leader of that terror states to actually travel across the world land in new york and then yell about how terrible america is according to the ucagardian and a lengthy set piece the uan general assembly he accused america of fanning the flames of violence in u crame prompting protest from israel's representative to the un he claimed any aranian made trontidinan crani anctities had been sold thefore the wor started and said he was in favor of piee in neu crane as on the same day the taharan hosted a russian defence selegation led by defence minister sergashoygu he said t at the world is transitioning into an novel international order and the project to americanized the world has failed he said the wes was facing a crisis identity and functionality and seize the world as a forest and itself is a beautiful garden he elso accused america of stoking of the war in u crane in orer to weeken europe wall this caused thes rally ambassador to the ungulat er don wi no personally to walk out he accused the owne of rolling out the red carpet for the butcher of tateron which of course is exactly right and a he held up a picture of masa ameni was a purtish woman who died ind police custody in eron for not wearing hejab correctly he was then ejected was the israili ambassadors the rule is that you are allowed to be a terrorsdictator but if you hold up a picture of a person that the terristictator has helped to murder then apparently tyou get kicked out of the uen apparently according too the independent in the uca there is a need not meedian incident when the permanent representive israel walk down the islan and frlld the photo during the speech by the presidens veran in the general assembly uin security spoke to him and no time was te ambassador dettained anywasha perform as far as we are concerned the incident is closed apparently the caption on the photos haid eranian women deserve freedom at now and a hebrote did erdon on ax when president aesiother on the butcher of taweron began a speech are waved to picture of masa ameni the inisens aranin woman whose brutally murdered by the resume mon uricol for not wearing hejaba properly meanwhile outside the an hundreds ofranians wer protesting begging for help from the international community i'llnever stope fighting for the truth all always exposed the unto moral distortions by the way i wast point out herd that the media coverage of the number of protestors wo are protesting the aranian dictator being in being in the united states and an jstspeaking nonsense and and garbach that was dwarf the media coverige of that by the coverage of a few dosiden protestors in the united states o our very antigt benjraminiton now who is also visiting the united states and is having a sibar with jobidon at this point just again the uan continues to be not only a useless but a counter productive organization o ca meanwhile speaking of useless and counter rector organizations youwould imagine th the un this international organs itions these would be the places where negotiations would happen over for example nugorno carbach this is a very little notice and little watch region of the world except by people or sort of in the no it is a hot spot there certain hotspot in the world cashmersa hot spot say the gossil strip is a hot spot ar e is of jane sameri or hotspot anegora carbach is i is a hot spot the reasn is a hotspot is because it is largely ethnically armenian b ah it is controlld by azer bajoan and for years and years and years there has been in armenian separatist attempt to take negorna carbach from the rule of azer bajon whele now aozerbshani forces have assaulted the area the apparently reports suggest that there re lot of civilian deaths the ozbrchani forcers suggesting their telling people to get out in advance of their advance but apparently according to the walztr journal armenian separate is inigornal carbac agreed on wenesday to disarm and discuss re integration with azar bajan following a swipp but dedlyassault by ozerbacni forces at capitulation signaling the end of decades of ethnic armenian rule in the onclave and the rapid decline of russian influence in the former soviet union territories it is very complicated situation because both ron and russiha are supporters of the separatis in negorna karbach meanwhile turky an israel are supporters of the ozerbajhany forces the terms of the sease fire lay groundwork that could bring to a closed the autonomous rule by the population of negorna karbach which was one o from baku in a bloody years long war after the fall of the soviet empire fighting appeared to continuan pass of the onclay ours after te signing of the sease fire the speed of which the armenian separatus agree to abandoned ther arm struggle underscors moscows waning power over events in the region as its forces are stretched inucran has been a frozen conflict and of the krumlan has used this as e lever to maintain over both armenia and ozer bajcan according tothe wazter journal over the years moscow sent both weapons and peacekeepers to the region while using deplomacyes retain its position is the ultimate arbater over gio politics there is obviously is another piece of evidence that that russia is weakening internationally which is generally a good thing rusies bit of very powerfull and aggressive fors in the world obviously particularly along its old soviet borders according to thomas towall expert on i gorna carbac and tenor fella carnegy europe russals loverage as much weakened by whats happening in crane we see the armenins moving away from russian azar bajon having relationship ith russia that is more on its own terms agorna karbac set t whist twenty four civilians and soldiers in the day lon conflict that began on tuesday with artillery assaults on what ozer bacan sad warmenian military targets in the breakway region locals posing on social medea reported strikes on recidential neghbourhoods in the territories maincity of stepanikart russias defense ministries had piecekeepers had come under fire and died during the violenc that in specify how many were killed ozerbachans has a plans to take back the onclave it is inside the borzvozer brusshon its populated almost entirely by ethnic armenians who have ruled since the nineteen ninebes under the terms of a piecial roker by russia skirmishes a rupted into conflict in twenting twenty when ozerbacan re claimd areas around the territory that battle ended guaranteeing armenian separateos control over that particular area bapiece has remain shaki armenians leaders complained russia was not able to enforce the deo s again a complicated conflict in which the uen has been entirely absen the osrussia and u allsaid they had made lastag efforts to to suwaded ozerbchani president iham an alia from attacking the territory angono karbac hasrelight almost solely on armenia for links to the outside world sectaricstad ansme blinkin called the leaders of ozerbachan armenia to express is concern over the ascalation again what one ofthe things that is amazing about these s orts of conflicts that nobody notices them until they breake into violance in after that five minutes later nobody notices otherwise this why when comes to american form policy the ountifocus that actually is placed on american form policy around the world is actually fairly low by americans iaccount of burst into the national consciousness for a hot second and then it is just gone and meanwhile the feds continued to debate the intrest rates because our economy continues to stagnate according it to the walster journal federas orofficials are set to hold intrestrate steady at their meeting on wednesday while debating what wu take for them to lift o borrowing closs again this year there anticipated desisian ren mark the second time in six policy meetings this year the fet has not raised rates the r the fedi signal that will hold rate saidingan make no substancive changes to its postmeeting policy statement that does not mean that inflation has actualy been solved im because again inflation in the united states remains almost double what we are supposed to be looking for right now ret projections suggest that manufedofficial seea rising neutral rate which keeps in flation and unemployment stable in the long run it just means that as hardy baked into the cake according to the walstr journal federal reserv official surprise markis by signalling that intrestrates will not fall as much as previously pland that tweek might be more important than it looks in their projections an common taries some officials hint that reakes might be higher not just for for longer but for ever it is a for a very long time in the united state you get a mortgage three four per cent that is not going to be the case for a long time to come and that is because of the inflation t has ben baked into the cake by the loose monitarian fhysical policy of the united states over the course of years one of the provenshere and one thngs that creates in flation is lack of labor at productivity one ofthings that brings down prices additional labor ate productivity as greg iprightes for the walster journal for the united auto workers akes perfect sens n man mare pay and better work balane from detroites three automakers after all workers troughout this historically tight labor arket are getting exactly that but what make sens the striking factory workers makes no sens for manufacturing as a whole tpays ultimately tie o productivity the quantity and puality of products a company's work force turns out and here american manufacturing companies in workers are in trouble thes shu is not with labor an tensive products clothing in furniture which off shrort a long time ago it is in the most advance products electric cars and batteries powrgeneration equipment ommercial air craft semin conductors american companies still lead the world in design in novation but the resulting produts and creasinagly are made abroad especially in asia jobiden lihetonal trom ploncst reverse that through tar of substities nowther government intrventions but the problem is is really not about that it is that asion manufacturers have basically decrease cost increase quolity and american counter parts have slipped whenyou look at manufacturing productivity growth from two thousand nineted twyo doesan't twenty to ti wan is had a productivity growth anual average four per cent the ucate one point seven pers and germany one point for per cent the us zero point two per cent in motor vehical manufacturing t the pictiures e specialy bad from twenty twelve through last year productivity plummeted thirty two per cent thas not the fault of american workers as greggot points out prodctivity to pends on bunch of factors including management decisions supply chan public in for structure regulation for dampl american manufactures use far fou ur robots then thei'r competitors but it does not matter if you are not bringing up the prodoctivity that means that you are not going to be competitive on the world markets and th you a double you is striking for temporary gains in the face of what are going to be significant future losses right now the attempt to transition to electric vehicles by the big three that is af very risky move considering that ford is set to apparently lose fourpoint fivet billion dollars on electric vehicles this year tht is not a good number boting boting ill for the future of this you a u strike whell get to more on all that in just one tacan first in a time where different opinions are prety much everywher it is vital to be able to find facts that you can rely upon this where you s a facts steps in it is a not for profit non partisons tof th connition ive committed to breakin down complex government data making it easily accessible and digustible for all americans you us a facts is more than just a source of information it is a tool that can hlp provide answers to pressing questions about the corrin stated the nation it offers a space whe you can explore stats on key areas education crime and migration healthcar empowering you to form your own opinions on whether tha nation is thriving or struggling in these particular sectors offering deep dives since you s of spendin an out comes you us a facts can help providieg solid ground we needs bases are public dbates on facts not fiction i very often an assely where d you get the facts that ou rely upon on the show you us a facts as one place i go hits kiund of transparency allows for clear confident discussions about issues than matter most before you jump into that next tobate visit you us a facts dot or equipp yourself but the robus data and facts that can help guide your way to more productive and factual discussions make your voice heard and back by truth with you us a facts dot or thats you s a facts dot or to day well despite the fact that the american car industries about facing very hard times to do specifically to all these regulations an restrictions put on them by the by deministration their push of for electric vehicles for example the you a ble u continues ford with its strike and democracts are signaling their support wy begus again the most corrupt bargan an american politics is union support for democrats the way thie this works not by the way not all unions are bad thei're unions that do good an go back to the coal miners unos the're plenty of unions that do good the point is the are notas to nee cap workers as long as a union is just a voluntary association of men negotiating for pay men women obviously negotiating for pay no problem it is when yous our nee caping people or relying on the federal government to crammd down solutions the youare now engaged in corporotism which is a a form of financial fastiism economic fasshism o the democratic party knows this eit is no wonder whenever people tung by money an politics theyalleas neglect union moneyan politics because that might implicatd democrats what is amazing is how the unions are now holding the democrats to the wall back in september early september jobidon said heu thought that you a bu strike was unlikely now of course were in the middle of the end of week one of this thing when at by fan an bat thi wi whether in awan a ri good happen an et what then killing time when the comcract on beent ated otto work earh efire thin in that e do not think thou is ther 'me not word about a strike until it happens i do not thing it is going to happen at's always gobine is incredible at this of cours thunions are holding hin to the wall why not they know that they they own him meanwhile the governor of pennsylvania joshipero he is saying also that he stands with the ou a dble you because why not if you are democrat what cost does it have to you to stand with the union even if it ensa bankrupting the karndistry couple yurs in the future tus blame capitalism after you regulate those car companies in to the ground then cran down crappy union deals on them when the companies go under well that is when you blame capitalism obviously here is joshipero areny thanders though that is the now i the bosses are going to benefit from this better technoligat tho worker shu cur they shoul haven' war time with their families war time at home what do you think wel i stand with the striking u a w workers a ten deserve the share in these record profits that the exacutive sir taking home i think what we have seen eis just a a a greater gap between what the exacutives are making in companies and what the workers who are putting the the product in the services a on the field are earning we ein't a shrink that gap then i stand with the u a w striking workers of course the democrats are all in hock meanwhile they are hoping to cram down all the regulations that ae to make these car companies go bankrupt it is it is one of the things that' irritating by watching politics is very often it is government interventionism that skuws the insentive structure for all these major companies crams down bad contract on them then when the companies go bankrupt they blame capitalism for the failure and then they bail out the companies blaming capitalism all the balancing but what really need here is more government regulation thits the story the two seven that the two thousand seventy thousand eight economic crash the government created in sensiv structures in which it was very obvious to everybody that all o these companies wrenging gat bailed out ans they took all sorts of crazy risks the risks went south the goerment beld them out them blame capitalism for that at's not capitalism that is corporatism pretty obviously but again the same time that they are now pressuring the car companies to capitualate to the u a lu carbon is schlosure rules or comming for u s a companies according to the walstr jernal many biguous companies avebeen fighting in washington to block rules requiring them to disclose af greenhouse gacimissions they picked the wrong fight with california and the u our poys to approve rules that require companies that do business to disclose their missions the rules would appli to private as well as public companies and require busieses to calculate and disclose hemissions from their suppliers an teir customers which goes beyond what was expected out of washington this means that pretty much every major company in america is now going to be expected to disclose their carbon amissions which is going tohve some predictable down streime economic af fact things are going incredibly incredibly wall cat time for some things i and then some things that i hate things at that i today pennsylvania students have decided that they are not going to go along with new transbathrom policies suggesting that boys can simply go into girls batherums and they stage walk out the other day to protest these batherum policies heres what a look according to the ner cost hundreds of students from pennsylvanians procomians valleys school district walked out a class on friday after the local schoolboard faild to enact apolise e requiring transgender students to use the restrom corresponding with their biological sec abofe the description there i mean you mean that that they they did not pass a police protecting girls kids were up sat girls who wanted to protect him they were uset thay knwant men in ther bathrom said john out who organized the walk out his mother stefphany accused the district of only protecting trans a students not looking at the whole picture proposed polsy seven twenty came after local father t on jaggor postsenohn social media tat his daughter was left to two upset and emotionally disturbed to walk in th chool bathrooms after a legurally having encounter with a trans a students in one of the facilities the outless report however said neither the father northerdaughter r one hundred per sents sure that the student jaggor saugter encountered in the restaurum was a biological mail why mean here is the thing if you have rules than he can insure that that does not happen that is not really a problem but it is som it is incredible me that this is even a controversy good for the tudents fort walking out ca time fry quicting that i hate a john fedderman hates pans on why i'm confused why he hates pans but apparently he really really hates pan much that the senate of the united states in order to apparently concede to this brain damaged person and i say that with again that is on the insult tis sto reality this person had a massive stroke this apparently means that dome john fedderman must be alowed to preside over the senate my seven year old son going to going to camp or something wi dow that is of the senate of the united states its all the staffer till hae to ursuits john fedderman however he literally presided over the senate wearing jim shorts and a short sleeve button down shirt looking as though he just emerged from a homeless shelter according to the daily wire the senator from pennsylvania took his turn sitting as the presiding officer while some of his jio pe colleges including sentr of john thoon and ran pollen john corn's liver remarks on the sentate floor he said the worlds in spen off s ax as he know just it it i think we will still go on this is what we deserve what we deserve is a is a country of of absolute fools wearing garbage clothing on to the floor of he united state senate mean honestly why not i at is one why not our standers for politicians are unbelievably low that we will elect the brain damage to high office why should not they be able to dress as though they wre tending a pree school as supposed to the senate of the united states strucsumer send nt statement to actio senators are able to choose what they weare on the sentefloor i will continued to wear a suit i am declaring that all republicans and honer of john federman should clar hawian shirt day at the a senate a sounds were a the ugliest ine shirt the could possibly fine along with cargo shorts as well as sox with sandals that is what everyone should wear in the why not howsrom flip flops that youwar flip flops son glass is susan columns by the way is threatening to wear bakeni that is his joke by her by the way shash is not going to do that but why not i mean after all if john federman can wear whatever he wants because we have to make sure that we concede to the to the not qualified senator from from pennsylvania why why not at this point i suppose that it make some sense the goodnewses i guess that the mask is off if the united states senate is going to be a joke i suppose tha we can get rid of all the rules pretending that it is not a joke ardigises the rest of the shoe continues right now you are not in a wan

the iwall coxes are over we now moved forward to new hampshire as i said yesterday on the show it seems as though all of this is to prolonged introduction to donald trump as the actual geope nominate he won iwa by thirty points he is presumably the front runner in new hampshire is by far the front frunner in south carolina according to the latest o pulling det a butnew hampshire is a litl bat tiht accordting to the american research group o pole that is connofa dicy polts gat a see plusrating from five to thirty but according to that pole the latest presidential pole has donald trump and nicky haley tide at forty per cent with nine per cent on decided rondisancs clocking in at four per cent of vacrum swum who dropped out at four per cent presumably those four per cent from romasuomy well mou move over two donald trump in fact the vake last night went on stage with donald trump he of course dropped out right after the iwal cox's and indorse trump which of course was going to happen from pretty much the very beginning of the race again the vake race was about things other than being precident of the united states he accomplished many of those goalls but this was sort of what was expected here was a vake last night on stage with donal trump last night i was onir to rece thindusment of a man who is become a true leader and earn the admiration of many pai i i've been a friend of is even though we were competing against each other but i was afend if isan we get along and he was say he is a great presenen i kept sa why isy runnin it keeps calling me grat resiner but e's a fentesi givesli gis gets om tremendous ideas and his young it s gets hime young ideas to an that is a good thing he has a big beautiful right future ahead vevake ramisuamy o not nother about friends again after trump shipton raten gust last week le's through this guise i do love that dom i do love that a side there avn even no ais renning since he lest me yathat that really was the question was it not the vake ten came out and then he talked about how donald trum stood for the true principles of the republican party which i am serious he said revolved round not cutting any entitlement program but cutting ade to u crane which again you can make arguments about cutting eiht oucrane not cutting eiht u crane but the idea that the republican party whole sale is behind non reform an non touching of the entitlement it is one of the reasons why donald trump was more popular with the general electrit than some other republicans but it is not a par ticularly conservative principle also the idea that any amount of money spend onu crane would have keeled the problems with social security medicare medicade is absurd the entire amount of us eght o cranes o far which is seventy five billion dollars lot of military aid and civilianade two crane not pay fr about eleven days worth of social security meticar and meticatt put all of that aside the botomlines that the dynamics of the race aoure obviously very much in donald trump's favor there will be apparently no debates next wee nickee haley suggested that she would not debate wrontosance to finished ahead of her in the iwoll cocis the reason she is doing that i she is now plang trumps car trumps card was i am not going to ebate any one besim far ahead nickee haley is basically suggesting that going into new hampshire she sol far ahead of de santis that there is no reason to make herself vulnerable to that a b sy news then duly called off the republican primary debate the announced that there would be no debate at all they sat oure intent was to hosto debate coming out of the iwel coucasis wet we always knew that be contingens on the candidates and the oultcome of the race while while our robust election covers will continue a b s nesan amuar teve will not be moving forward with thursdays republican at presidential primary debate in new hampshire now agen do i think the new hampshrs quite as close to that pole is making out i do not i think the donald trump does in facts have the upper hand in new hampshire even should nicge hley pull out some sort of upset win in new hampshire they would then hand down to south carolina where donald trump does have a fairly substantial lead in that particular race remember that new hampshire as a place where cris cristy was pulling in te double digets until he droped out presumably a lot of that support is in a flow over to nickey haley but let us be real about this all eyes are already turning to the general election and because all eyes are turning to the general election that means we have to look at the strategy that democrats are using to defeat donald trump to understand that strategy u really have to speculate on weather this is all as admiral acpar might say a trap whether in fact democrat's plan wis to basically gat republicans to nominate donald trumps that they could run against him of course they tried this trap in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen hillery clinton suggested the donal trump want run she wanted donald trump to be the re publican nominy and the of course she lost to him our democrats repeating history an maccarthia national us suggests that that is the case because he says that basically by promoting all of these legal cases against donald trump this year that opened up the primary in favor of donald trump he reverst all of the momentum in the race in favor of donald trump because the republicans reacted to the un just persecution of trump bi supporting him i the race and then the entire next year is goingto be all about his legal cases and in fact thereisome dated a support this if you look at the republican presidential primary pulling what you see is that right after the twenty twenty to election donal trump and ronis antis running basely neck and nack and then they continued run necannec through january through february and then something happene in march what happened march the announcemen of prosecutions against donald trump once that happen the poles open up wide the dam burst and republicans move behind donald trump because they perceived that donald trump was being un duly persecuted and donald trumps line which twas effectively that they are coming after me because they will also come after you was an effective line that is particularly effective when the democratic party is making clear that the centr of all of its policies ies equity equityequity and when many americans here equity woutd they mean is the preferred democratic voting constituencies are going to get special benefits and everybody else is going t get jact swen donald trum b says they'r coming after me because they are also coming after you that does have some credibility to it that said the next year obviously is going to be a very stack year for donal trump in terms of the various calendars weare to more on this in just one second first as you have already seen twenty twenty

that is ardy happen on january tenth the trumpb organization civil fraud charges closing arguments were made to day there was a second trial that began in new york in which egin carol a woman who allege the donnal trump rapetur in a departmen store in york city again allegations that i think are really dicy on their face but she did when a defimation suit against him and naw sh's found a second defimation tuit against him next week january twenty third of cours have the new hampshire primary on february eighth you have a supreme court case with oral arguments hearing about wether donals from shuld be bard from the ballat on february twelfth wher down an maralago and there is securing in fort perce florda on which classfime naterials the special council can with fold from the trum defence or not with hold from the trump defence three days later there is a huring in manhattan on the stormy danuels hush money gates that beu the alvan brag again specious manhattan dhe a case move ford just a little bit in time and you end up with the march fourth scheduald opening in washington of trumps trial on the four fellony charges being brought by jack smith with regard to january sixth move ford just a little more in time march twenty fifth youve state criminal cases stormy danuels again on the docket that is the schedual start of the trump trial over the hush money that was paid two stormy danuels to cover up their affair in may youve the maralago classified documents trial which is schedual to start now again all of these dates may be delayd august fifth you have the georgia reco case that is supposed to start he isn to me all year long is going be all you are long now that obviously means that there is in me a lot of this in thehatlines and that could theoretically hurt donald trump or or it is also possible that donal trump ranting bout legal cases acturally means that it get's kennaboring see the thing is with donal trump you when donald trump talks about a topic too much it basely turns into tonightus if those drn't no about to night as to nigt as when yeu have ringing in your ears and it really is irritating are you wikeom e mil the night you hear the ringing your ears and what your bringing dos it a certain point is just kennitunes it out in the same way that you have now tuned out the insane over estimation of the media of donald trumps supposed fashions meu've turned it out now ege to cin part ofthe background noise in the same exact way donald trump rancing on truth social about his judicial cases i think that is not part ofthe background noise for most americans i do not think most american's care particularly much about all this i thing most americans ar to ooke yoeu went after him on a thousand different things none of them seemd to be particularly not worthy ar crazy well remember january sex o that already was baked intothe cag donald trumpin women e lat's been a thing sons the nineteen eighties donald trump ransing on truth social really does not make that pic of differencs and here is where as i said yesterday the fact that donal trump is on truth social is ironically actually a great help to him if donal trump rons witter ranting about things that every tweet that he sent would get hundreds of millions of views that is not an exaggeration meanit that the donald trump on twitter currently has i cin you not eighty seven point four million followers eighthy seven point for million on truth social he is posting things and he is getting thirteen thousand likes on things cam meaning no one seeing the stuff that he is ransing which is atton quite good for him he is a means that we can just filter all of it out for example he is rantin out egin carol on truth social yesterday said after historic win and ia i'm going to the biding en courage which tunt and lor man hantend to fight agains a feigt case from one i have never met seen or ttouch celebrity lines do not count naturally it starts right after ioans uring the very importan new hampture primary word despite their sinister attempts i will be to night is a tring telection interference cam pushon finance by political operatives i had no idea who this woman was pure fiction now that may very well be true i mead it a certainly true that egen carrols gcase was fund d in fact by a democrat billionar named read hoffman who is attectbrow that is certainly true but the bonaline is this domacrats are gambling that trumps legal foibles are going to somehow sink his campaign i do not know that tht's a particularly amazing at gambol none theless the media are veryinswho it maggie haber man a jonathan carl they say that trumps campaign is gettng at stuck in the courtroom but maggie oneto things he wants to do is to drag it out is cause he is got this very complix legal and campaign scatul of it coming monts that he likes to a perin court as it is good for fun rasing a shockingly but it is a ha what is the thinking here inside ta tat's that is use this says it continual trumps in the news is it a good thing to be in the news for he is decided that he is going to try to turn this into a positive as much as possible for the reasons you said it has a strong fon rising effect with his base it has a galvanizing a feu know victim hood effect with his base i also think car in have been hinking about the lot for last couple of days i think he prefers this to the act ife campaigning it blocks hat a tencion that his rivals can get i think that he has decided he is going to turn what are objectively undesirable circumstances into has much of a positive as he count in thisers a campaign up the disen diit is indistinguishable from his or from his legal cases and andn it is very monon byt thmin that the they are olded involimin his his his political advisers ar i as a wearer and involved in in what is happening on the legal front is anything else it is an any spends more time with his lawyers with his legal team than he does with his political teamut but but even when he is with the political tameis magge it is out it is it is it is about th the lawyers ye well i mean all of that again may very well be true but are you that interested in the stuff i do not fort myself particularly stimulated b e donals froms legal cases again all that happen befor ans now as houg the trials themselves are to be wildly fascinating are not washing a murder trial here you may watching much people testify about the handling of classified documents down in florida or people rehashing for the one millionth time what happened on january six up in washington d c or more allegations about stormy danuels in campaignpaignments from full on eight years ago is that something that is really unherd tonals from which means the democrats are now having to rely on some back up strategies one of those back of strategies of course the attempts to barr donald frum from the bllot yesterday jobidin campaign at coachar jeffrey cassenburg suggested he did not know if is on democratic to bandonals from from the ballot i mean i do it is on democratic you cannot just panior political opponents from the ballot i do not know how i the sprincourts can to decide that i that is not something tocate e i democrat carty position i't's just that in very states people individuals i've taken this i issue up and and we are't hear from spring courtsure win iof ca dowt in the fact that the are lend incredibility to this nonsense is really nock on a benefit them and it does lend credens the donal froms plains that they are out to get him which of course is the reason he hot the nomination in the first place presuming that he raps it op is iys sume that he will there is more on this in just one second first i've been

sleep dot tom sleshmen with helics better sleep starts right now meanwhile another tak the democrats are trying to take peremptively is the same tact they took in twenty twenty and we talk about the rigging of the twenty twenty election a difference between rigging and just outright fraud is that rigging is about changing the circumstances surrounding the election in not illegal ways bot ways that obviousley are men to change the direction of the outcoming immoral ways for example changing the ballading process might not be a legal and pensylvan nything probly was e legal but yo fulfilled certain legal cried teria but was obviously meant to skew the result in a particular way allowing people to vote early by mail three months in advance of elections leading to sixty per cent of all democrave votes in twenty twenty being cast by mail that obviously is an act of rigging tht is why it was done the attempt by the f bea which this again may have ben illegal to interfere in the election by effectively telling all of these big tact companis that they ought not report or allow reporting on hunder bions laptop inthe month before the election that obviously had a major impact on th election now the reason i distinguished that sor of rigging from outright fraud is outright fraud is we are going to bus in tuns of fake ballats and we are going to shove them through the machines three four or five times orian ticures big vat of trum votes and throve them in the river and the're never seen again tht sort of stuff does happen in american politic be not to the extent of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of votes lost or or spoiled but does that mean that the twenty twenty election was not qone quote rig in a sort of informal cents of course not it was rigged in the informal sense in which the media obviously were on board all the american institutions we are on board with jour bi ns victory or starting to see it right now in to the most perverse ways a couple of those most perverse ways are members of the intelligence community who were awful during the twenty twenty election you recall houghen the hunderbine laptop story came down there re dozins and dozins of intelligence officials who claim that hunder bidon's laptop was in fact a piece of russian disinformation that was the lection rigging was the be legal for them to clam thet no was at them using there credibility that the american people took seriously in order to petty much openly lie about hunter bidon's laptop absolutely while now you' having the same thing you are going to have intelligence officials foreign and domestic claming the donal trump is actually a threat to the god working order of the west this presumably is why youhave the former am mi six head sir richard deer lav talking about trumps at re election being in actual national security risk to the uka pa ha tiggistent bort wet ive note of poli you e a the political threat whi im warried abot which is a trumps i thought bat i reelection what i think for the u case tatless security is problimatic becaus if trump as it were axisty in damagis the atlantic alancs athat is a big del for the uca we puit aa egs in defens thims in thelantic baske will get at the reality is that evenen dowintrump was president he was just to asking forrnato partners to increase their spending the reason i point this out is because if the intelligence community is in fact mobilized againstonal trump they can do some pretty corrupt and terrible things meanwhile members of the big tat community are also mobilizing over the beginning of the week we have had thebeginning of the world economic forum over in davos for folks yo do not know the world the conomic forum os found that originally by gon im claus strob in the nineteen seventies it is essentially a meeding of big business leaders big corporate leaders big government leaders they all get together and they plan they plan for what the world should look they all cordinate with one another in fact wo have a brand new facts episode out on you top or explain everything you need to know about the w f and tavos in detail and basically there are genda is cooperation in corporatist wuasy ficistic fashion between big business big government big tack in order to sort of rig the rules of the road and already over at the ou have twent twenty four participants are talking about the necessity for quotinqual policing misinformation now nobody's interested in falsehood being provaricated but lathing everybody is interested in is who gets to set the standards and to say that i do not trust the people the ou have to determine what is misinformation what is not is to put it absolutely mildly here for example our harvard professor niomia oresk us and censer for democracies reeve givens talking about the necessity of policing misinformation over at davos again tese are when people talk about globilists this what they really mean they do not su meat that they really do not mean people ware in favor of free trade most republicans are in favor of free trade including for mose partonal trump despite his retoric when you'se ectully presidt is pree free trading president when people say globalist what they mean is a cadre of people who wish to restructure the entire global system they are in control of the leavers of power and that is what it looks over at the w f including with regard to quonquot misinformation wl get omon this in just one secon first according to forbes january is the hottest month for hiring this

necessity for cracking down on miss inp formation by which they mean information that i want you to hear and the rest of private sector is just sitting on the sat lines and theyre just not fan anything in their biting their tongue because well may be they present tom fothe reasons because he cut corporate tackses and i think the private sector has lages ty stood by and allowed a lot of really damaging things to happen things thin the long on will not be good for i na liberal demo cratic capitalists om and i really hope that the worldly comic form will take this isto on board and think harder about the roll that the private sector conplain standing oup against disinformation in this big election eer what kinds of safe gods and measures a you thinking that company isn'nt country should be trying to implement as they get ready for elections e willoo pick up on a thene that i think you are just getting to ir just one of the most crucial intervention points is how we surface authentic trusted sources of information and youre absolutely write that the media has a cridical role in this some of the tack companies to if you are a serchengion are sercial media platform i think it is your duty to help surfacethe trusctess sources of information we again who ise didnt pick tho strusted sources of in formation presume we thay will be in your time the washington post all the left wing outlets at the left partictulae globallis left absolutely los we sho about rigging the election this is what we are talking about and it is jobidentim whos working handing glove with these people john carryi co sort of the official onvoy to the w e f every single year he obviously is is very much in favor of a globalized regime in which he gets to ferry back and forth and make friends with the chinese and talk for example about the wonders o restructuring the entire global economy as to avoid climate change of course takes private justs doing all this here he was at dabos talking about the needto transition away from fossil fuels in indo by a we were able to change that parmn som wit one critical parga that parma is that we must transition way from consil fuels remember we could not gan a resolution between fas ou cas down in gransgo and there as no mention of this n pars but indo by a hundred ninety five countries including oll producing or gasperdicing countries came to consenses that we must say o the world that we must transition away from ossel fields he this guy is now moving from the jobin white house to the jobidon campaign and we talk about lobalest rigging of elections we are talking about people this here is john carrying up announcing tht he joining the campagn i know striking theori ins the hegrts of republicans everywhere giving the fact that he lost ser george ally bushon two thousand for i am hatched inotherwas man o more in the hasina in our country because i'm efemple an anland engage in in in the campaign that is nankanam i i want to be able to speak out a man an other acies mobily and im ana steanters and and there is many different ways to continue to be able to be engaged in this and i think the american public this is going to be one t reasons im my voicemack to be able to goon get o is this issue is a vonin issue and and people want to going those because they want to continue down this road and see this new economy emerge and not here that kills them it gives them diseases and since there kids to the hospital in the summer from environmently detanouce setire some mintint it is the doublwu a tavofs crowd that does not want donal trump that is tho the says and again theare entire stek is working together at's collusion tin government be business an betack that is the entire stick of the u v it is thit this is the jobidin campaign ie natural at on a petinao of intersectionality and aquity talk and that is the jobiden campaign here for exampleis the yuf present agand im wors brenda talking about collaboration ws yon business in government the worldi coomic farms tan onlything i think it is the proof of that the weeka had and the yeara had the deliver important outcomes off colebration between business and cam evhen when it hadn explained how this requires a new world order yen i it is amazing how tht you stumble headlong into saying the words but here we go that order seems to know no anot be athe order and the wore we are on the way to a new order we are between the orders a do you agree with that or arther ways of a what are able to keep on the postitives thoht from the old order to bring into a new wild order and who can we avoid that that new world order a becomes a jungle growing back and we rougder have i order based on thy national lawnda principles that have broughtus prosperity and te freedom a fordecets i do not think the inter'tatural order built after nineteen forty five is getting replaced whole sale with som you order a it will obviously evolve isitor as it has avolved multiple times over the decate since nineteen forty five but i do think in a in a more sharp and distinctive way reore movin in to a newara that is what ive talked about it by remarks an that of course is the anasa j sulvan we talk about jobidin being in the poket of sort of these types of people and in fact this can a bord all acting out of that is correct this is what stands in the way of donal trump attaining the white house again folks last year because of you preborns nowwork of clinnics sawl over fifty eight fous in babyes lives saved thank you to all you who made that

that is preborn ot com slash man in the the thing in favor of donal trumpets of course the fact that the bite administration and thse globlets are truly incompetent ad all of this in fact the title of the fts this year is restoring trust well i mean they that the trust has not been lost because people are talking about them the trust has been lost because they are garbage at this it turns out that all hepeople who suggest you ought to give them control over your lifeand over the system those people boched it six ways from sunday and that is donald from sopening and speaking of that opening in the bochery what is going on on the border continues to be a complete disaster area in amazing story between taxas and the federal government according to bright bart do com its strongly worded letter from the departmentof homeland security to the state of texas is demanding axas the us mexical border on land seezs by the state and eagle passigal pass of course is one of the great source of elegal imigration the country right now hundreds of fausens of people everymonth arriving at eagle passe d chus officials ordered the state to cease and de sist its efforts to block border patrolds aas in and around shall be park and remove all barriers to axes by the end of the day on january seventeenth the d chest general council tron ith and mier wrote in a letter to texas turn general ken paxton texas actions are clearly on constitutional and are actively destrupting the federal governments operations why what is texasdoing while they set up actual barriers to prevent people from crossing the border d hus wants to dismantal those barriers s they can continue to essentiually treat border patrol as a ferry service for a legal emmigrans as i have mentioned is just down at the borgran of a bunch of material coming out about that and it is truly amazing gobidon has assentially turned our border patrol units into a bussing service fr a legal emigrans they literally arrive at the border hold up their hands say their cleming asylum border patrol then picks them up prosts them lets them into the country within seventy two hours the state of texas is saying no and they are building barriers and this means the bid ndministration is now probably going to take them to quort the ta quote the recent actions by the state of texas have impeded operations of the border patrol now as brigpt by points out the use of the word impeded by the d chest general council cold imply a threat of criminal action against officers an agents of the state of texas ar carrying out the orders of governor abbot to secure shall be park and prevent borer patrals entry to the arria now again the reson they doft want the bore patrol in ther as cas th bord patrols simply facilitating the entry of all the illegal emigrans all this is coming amidst a false story reborded widely by the left toing media suggesting that the state of texas is responsible fror migrant drownings according to a time line provided by the texas military parmoun sunday the boarder patrals request to enter the park came after migran drowning had aready occurred and the bodies of the families were being pulled from the water by mexican authorities but that in stop the media from runing with the story which was supposedly that bunco migran for trying to cross the border they started to drownd border patrol wanted to get in ao help them in texa ad stope them this repord by c bus news whose false was not true it turns out that the migrans had already drowned by the time border patrols even a wear of it and arrived on the border d hes continues to pretend that this contributed to migran drownings miers had quote on ganuary twelve after learning a from group all bata a group of filiated with the national institute migration mexico that a rup of migrans was attempting to cross the river border patral contact to texs officials and requsted axas to the border and texas reviews later a rescutine fror mexical as able toe rescue to individuals from the group both with signs of pypathermia three individuals drownd texas is demonstrated that even the most exigens circumstance it will not allow border patral aces to the border to conduct low inforcement and emergency respontectivities and that of course is false that is not true it turns out that these people un fortiunately had drowned long before boarder patrols even a war of the situation at all but trobidan is receiving pressure from his left flang for the global regime of emigration to continue open migration three flo of people across borders including the american border there is a peace to day in the nartimes from a personame t andrefloris whase an emigration policy adviceor for both abama and biden calling on jobi not to compromise iththe re publicans n at border policy she says quote wmister bidon could lose ke powers the presidents have used for deckates to regulate id migration an times of crisis worse if mister trump is reelected he will have new tools at his disposal he could use to terrorized emigrants and make the cass at the boare even more acute she says for example quote take the reported exposion authoritye send a negotiators are considering that pollsy wuld alow bor officials to expel migrans without asylum scrinnings that may be appear to be an affected te turnts messure but similar asylum restrictions have proved otherwise that of course is false title forty two which is what wil we were using in order just get people off the border its highly successful in preventing more people from

rolling in the mddle east is of jobidon's making a couple stories that are just insane in the last twenty four hours first did that we have two missing yos naviseals were you aware of thus you ware not whi was not that top of the news typically when we lose american soldiers that is pretty big news when you have two u us nav sealsto just co missing that is also usually prett big news wise a not big newswill because jobidon is the president of the united states its not that it is not been covered is that it jus not big news abysy new says the two u uss navy seals missing in the gulf of t e et an off sommalia where on ae mission to board a daw that led to the seizure of aroniand made bulistic and cruse missil components headed to the hoothies the risky niht time mission last thursday to board the dawin rough waters continued even after one of the avy seals fell on the water and the second navy seal following protocal jumped into the water rescueis teammate search and resk e operations for the two missing seals are con tinuing in the gulfobatan with you uss navy air craft an ships participating in the search for years thou s navy has intercepted these dows that sas small fishing or cp ggle vessel from the region believe to be carrying aronia made weapons to th who thes typically bording teams pullaside these ships to undertake a flag verification mission if the daw was on flag to has replace its flag to mask their smuggling mission the latee seizure was the first since the who these began to carry out the more than thirty drone in missil attacks on commercial shipping in the red sea apparently these navy seals are un fortunately missing it is hard to emagion that given the fact they be missing now for days on end the dat probably are dad according too the pentagon tin the winter time the sea state is typically eight to twelve feet the horizon is flat to eight twelve het is eight feetabove the lat horizeing tan eight foot is sixteen foot wave meanwhile aron continues to faciliteat terror around the region nochust with regard to israel not even just with regard to the red sea i meanthey are doing that in the red sea by the way right now the latest is that the yeminy who these continue to attack apparently shipping in the red se tuesdays strike on the aranian ling two the movement in yemin was another attack you has had to launch against the who thes in yaman etargeted forsides were rebels were preparing the launch missiles against commercial shipping vessels and the bide administration which has been signaling that is going to do it i must do in order to in shure shipping in this region now they are relegated saying well you now wewe fa we doing these low level attacks we figure the who these are oing to continue i've a question what is it exactly precisely that you think you are doing herer's jake sulivan explaining well we figued tha who these would not stop heis saying thie adavos we mobelize to collition of countries to take strihes to degrade the wothies tap abilities to their ability to mount i sustain in complex attack i becomes more difficult over tim abut we did not say when we wanched our tack there can end once in for all the who these will be fully detered we anticipated t who thies would continue to try to hold this critical rito rearisk and we continue to reserve the rights to take further action but this needs to be in all hands on tacif a gat dit diddim i miss the pow where he laid out a plan to his idea was we ombom a few ampt ecides hafter week of warning and then they will continue to come after the shipping and then what and then what i mean right now eveready's routing around the red sea is a critical shipping artery watchigan to do about it if your solution is we will fire a few rockets tot you and you fire a fyew rock its at us and i and that is petty much sdatis quo how exactly is that a solution the answer as it is not if you higher price of the grocery store prepare for some of those john carby spoketomen with thewhite house national security council set on tuesday hat when the united states launch dozens of strikes in yemon last week senior yosofficials fully anticipated th who these would probably conduct somewat retaliatory strikes he isthet wre not looking to expand this they still have time to make the right choice which is sotop these rectless attacks but you have not made clear what exactly the consequences will be if they do not do that and again if you are that who these all you have to do is survive this to here is john curby trying to explain what the hell were doing git hat we o ida no matter what e mi day nothin do iti ga a te do endini ting in the re an no matter what i day a e not goin af i te i daisrael an no it i othe day i an ren o canamedian way nothing to do with it why i do not thi we needi ot by copiga that one a we do hav an i i not thing cone wy retly gat that why we o ograte on widay i grat ipability othit it at it cannot wid thaty i'm i'm confused see no want to widen an asscallades who u'e doing just enough that they continue to rasshipping in the middleast thus prolonging the possibility of this thing widening and ask laty meanwhile jobidon quietly itstempting to walk back his idiotic policy from twenty twenty one in which he deelisted th who these is a terro group according to jacky heinrick wish reporting four fox news shus sources telfox the viht administration is expected to re designate to who these is a terrorist organization officials hafe not yets at if the groupwill be placed under the same designation but sources tellfox there a number of sanctions options that can be used in lieu of a formal eftio finding which can take a long time to complete again they are now having to walk back their dumb ask policy with regard to aran and same way they earlier in the administration nd o walk back their dum as policy with regard to the souties meanwhile the aronians by the way are now attacking targets and pakastans sof you think that this breshime is not attempting the stablize anything within racket range youare totally wrong accoring to wroiters pakastans had neighboring ron has now violated it is erospase resulting in the death of two children a hours after ronean state me dyus ad missiles targeted two bases of militan group yash all adel on tuesday is long about warn the inciden ould have serious consequences was completely unacceptable in a statemen released by pacastans foreign office poks person in the early hours on wednesday on monday the i r g c ther be the aronian revolutionary garcor attacked targets ed both at roch and syria right now aronian proxies are hitting they are they are now effecting the following countries and areas arach seria lebonon northern israel southern israel the gasastreb the red sa and packastan that is allic right now i'm not talking bout of the course last three years i'm talking about in te last three days at whall does that seem a successful containment policy to you war might it be that the united states should say to israel do you have to do it t against comas and that the united states they have aft twenty twos and af thirty fives guis me won actually devastate the ability of the whothies to do what they are doing in the red sea we might want to make clear to hesballa the west that if you guys get to a little bit two mach on the northern border of israel that we will allow israel to do what it needs to do on the northern border as well again that the threat of force is what keeps people in line the midleas the fact that this administration continues to try to play this middle game is stupid it is idio otic nd it is predicated ond again false notions of these centrality of these raly palcinian conflict you may have noticed that in that whole disquisition that i jus gape with regard to aron vhery bunch of countryes that have literally nothing to dowiththe palcinians here is om out the redsy youre talking about rock an syria and your tongu out packastan do any of those places have to do particularly with israel and palcinians the answer of course is no but for a long time in foregn policy circles there has beenthis idiotic notion that central to all conflict in the iddleastes these raily palsinian issue as though if israel and the palcinians came to some sort of agreement aron would calm down and everything would be all better that of course is a lie it is not trbut that is what jakesullivan is now preaching mean here hre we go jakes i meang gis here is haw dum jaksullivan is and batted his job jake sullivan literally had a piece in foreign affairs magazine it was written before october seventh and it came out the week after and in the printe eddition it' suggested that gasa had never ben more peaceful that is how badjec sullivan is at his job and this is the god who is now tos ining middlelese policies you wonder why donald trump has a shot even against the rigors to be the answer is because if you are bad enough for your job it turns hout the american people do not it very much iseliger saing is that the fellow of o tha a rama cors was to bring in i we were to bring in ther rain that i with have bein also a the basis wer that would have to be a polihtical solution a also were this we a would have tob all netistate solution yes in fact when present bydan prie minister nenya who spoke in the weeks of months leading up to october seventh this was a a kytopic of discussion how where did the paltiniins fit in to a broader vision for israels inegration into the retion in norbalisation with eir obstact the basic recipe which is piese between israel and its eir of neighbors ah a tu state solution with israel security guaranto these pieces are not am no in a way operating ind completely separate spers theyare linkton connected they were before october seventh they remain link to day and there something ther weare going to have to continu again the very fact the jakesullivan is suggesting that if israel had somehow made more concessions to the palicinians that for example octobers seavent never would of happen an pece would broken own middeleastis totally insane its totalling'st imin first phals totalians hand the reven having a conversation the aftermath of the largest murder mass murder of jews since the holicost about making concessions to the governments that support the mass murderers that is totally insane but again the entireforn policy of this ad ministration is totally insane and meanwhile again in the middle of all of this talk about concessions that the west can somehow make or how much cared the assistitake with the who thes in the middle of all this we now have more and more ports there emerging from israel from the people who are held hostaget by hamas and they are just as awful as you thought they would be there is a piece over at berry whise's free press by a young woman named agomac goldstein almag she is seventeen years old wash comas murder her father and her sister in front of her eyes and she explains what exactly happen she said i was with my mother my pro tector who did everything she could to keep me

some point during our captivity we removed a lot during our time an confinement transferred through a series of homes departments tunnels even a masque and gaza remember though guis it is it is super easa to tell the terrors from the savillians ind gaza especial win teir holding the actual hostages monks villians our captors were cruel during our captivity they told us t they would be back to our kiboots the feares paralyzing it overtook me i remember saying to my mom when we entered the city theire goig to torture me they'r going to rape me hose in the tunnels i met other young women most of them ere just ayears or older than my seventeen years some still had bloody gun shot wounds thathad been left un treated an makeshiff manages one heade dismembered limb i heard from them accounts of terrifying and grotesque sextual abuse oftin an gun point they told me when they were sathic and cryed their captors took advantage of their helplessness even more stroking and carressing them and then shoving and grabbing intimate parts of their bodies my mother hran hug them they told us they had not heard the word ema in long they ache for teir own mothers my mom later told me she fell liat there were all her daurters having just lost one of her daughters herself these young women were scared and they feared for their lives they beged us to me with their families if we were release to tell them yeu saw us they said but do not tell them everything save their souls from the ghastly details they pled with us to continue to fight for them to make sure they come home they told me that

abused are they stole alive shis seventeen years old this young woman and the by deministration is already putting pressure on the esrailies to stop their operation wall these hostages are still being held all in the name of supposedly what getting aran to calm down getting aran is not going to calm down signs of weakness are taken as signs of weakness at telt works meanwhile jo bidan is now

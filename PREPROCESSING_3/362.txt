welcome to the huberman lapponkes o science science pacs to frlife i m enjer hubermen and om a professor of nerbilogy and opthymology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor robin carhart harris doctor carhar harris is a distinguished professor of neurology and psychietry at the university of california psan francisco he is one of the leading researchers in the field of psychodelics and how they change neural circuitry in the brain his laboratory is responsible for understanding for instance how syliciben also sometimes referred to as magic mushrooms change neural circuitry in the brain such that new ideas and new forms of learning occur is laboratory is also responsible for carrying out various clinical trials some of which have demonstrated that appropriate dosages of syliciben can alleviate major depression in more than sixty seven per cent of people that take the drug now this is not to say that everybody should take syliciben and today's discussion describes both the clinical trials and why treatments with psychodelics in some cases work and in some cases do not work in order to treat major depression as well as discussions around syliciben lisergagaci diethlemide sometimes also referred to as els d as well as d m t and how these change the brain and how those brain changes can relate to changes in mental health as it relates to depression and other psycheatric challenges as well as how psychodelics are being applied in order to change neral circuitry for sake of expanding different aspects of the human mind including creativity intelligence and much more during to day's discussion doctor carhart harris teaches us about the history of the study of psychodelics as well as how the legislature that is the laws surrounding psychodelics are evolving in te united states and elsewhere for the use of psychodelics to treat psychiatric challenges by the end of to day's discussion you wil have a thorough understanding of how psychodelic's work both in the short term during the actual journey or trip in fact much of my discussion today with doctor carhart harris talks about the different aspects of the psychodelic journey and how those relate to therapeutic outcomes and of course by the end oftodas discussion you will also understand the long term effects of psychodelics that is how they can actually rewire the brain before we begin i'd t emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolite concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performants element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams thats one grahm of sodium two hunder miligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element docom slash huberman and now for my discussion with doctor robin carhart harris doctor carhart harris welcome i've been wanting to talk you for a long time i certainly known who you are for quite a while because i place you in this very small a very special an important category of researchers who has been pioneering the use of psychodelics for the treatment of specific clinical conditions and really on carying the torch for essentially the entire field what a storit with the a voice of gratitude and sa thank you for doing this incredibly important work could you tell us a little bit about what psychodelics are ifact im curious as to how the name psychodelic ever came to be and what you think they potentially reveal about the workings of the brain and then we will talk about the clinical applications well even that one is a is a cunnor hot one because a opinions differ on how to define psychedelic but perhaps a good starting place is to start with the atymology where did the word come from and it was a brit excommunicated and living in in canada humphry osment he at was due to present o a paper at a national academy of psciences meeting on psychotomematics drugs that mimic aspects of psychosis in their action and certain drugs mesculine an see nineteen fifty six and elestin at well on on the bill and ha he felt dissatisfied with them being under this catocree of psychotomematics and felt that the signature psychological effects of these compounds went beyond just mimicing psychotic symptoms and he wanted to find em or apt turm to speak to in a sense the principal component of their action and at he jotted down a few different a possibilities about us in orso i think and one of them was psychodelicatually has started t as an ended up being psychedelic and hat he had a correspondence going on with another br it also living in the es order psycly a where they were playing with some tems to refer to these compounds and and te in the end ther osmond one wit psyche delic and he had this little ditty afim to fathom hell or saw angelic just take a pinch of psychedelic a that is we for the discla an and and what does that mean it is to ancient greek word psyche means the human mind or if wee being a as she true to the ancient greek it means soul an and then the other component a means to make cclear or to make visible or to make manifest or to reveal to all of those work and and it is it isn't neologism it is a made up word but it does have that ancient greek origin and it is speaking to this principle that these compounds reveal aspects of the psyche of the human mind the soul thate ordinarily not entirely visible an and that is yet ymology and it is wonderfully poetic but i happen to think it is also very accurate it is a a useful term becouse its sort of you might say vailance non specific it does not say o can have a great time or tha you gong to go mad ait is more that it reveals psyche and it could be hellish but it could be heavenly an and a that is the atomology and also bit of the psychology an ane in i pointing to the phenomenology the psubject of experience but there is also a pharmachology here and quite recently there was put out ay consenso statement about psyche delics the really referring to what we call the classic psychodelics to say that these aral compounds that work on a particular receptor in the brain the cereturn into a recept a and that is in not the way that we cul define these compounds i said this one's a little hot because i'm of the view that while the phamacology is really useful how the drugs were chamically you cannot avoid the phenomenology and if we truts the atimology where the tum came from than we must recognize ad we cannot neglect the psubjects of experience thank you for that a beautiful description of what brought us to to day in terms of using the word psychodelics and now its thrown around all the time yet too much yete too much and and i'm guessing on no guessing i'm certain that it is i also used to describe many compounds that do not touch the five agh to if ih've each tea to a the ceretone into a receptor am there is a broader categrization by most people and am we interesting to see where all the noming clature naming goes for the time being id love for you to tell us a bit more about this idea that psychodelics however one definds them can reveal something about the mind that cannot be revealed otherwise are you talking about the psubconscious i mean the you kno psychologists and mast famously froid but also young and all also noural pscientists i think i'm think about subconscious processing i think perhaps the most sailint example for me that is outside the realm of of anything psychodelic would be blind sight this phenomena tha you take people that are blind but still have some connectivity in their brain and you present them and abord with i computer screene with different number of dots on each side yeu say how many dots are on each side of the screen they say what you mean i cannot see the screan an blind esit would just gass and their gasrate is accurate far more than chance would would prodection they have called blind sight and people of said well this is the subconscious revealing itself an there is no second ell wa drug involved but what youare describing is a formical object indu state that reveal something that normally ow should we assume is masked or that we are oblivious to a even though it is expressing itself but what what does it mean for the drugs to be re the ou revealing something about the workings of the mind that would ould not be obvious to us otherwise ye sinceo the a example of blind sight is interesting but it is differend blind sight would be a referring to nunconscious processing may be implicit processings a stuff going on in the mind imperception in a sense that is below the threshold of conscious weress but yet its influencing e s its sort of kind of related but it is different sa in in dept psychologypsychonalysis psychodanomic psychology an a sigmanfroid calo and on an we tak about the unconscious a and that it is more about the kind of blood an got o the human contition wit human nature bi the personal unconscious ay things that you might not want to necessarily be conscious of cause it is painful sa that that is the repression aspect pushing it out of conscious wheras repressed memories and particular ye dramatic memories a difficul a relationships o could be complex troman notnassary just the specific in a index tromabut a series of troman an and you have the collective unconscious which is really cal youngs contribution to say that am in a theres a transpersonal quality to the unconscious this aspects about human not just this individual human a thees aspects to our mon our minds are psyches that a am not fully available to conscious awarenes spoken come up in sertain states in a psychonalysis whent crazy for dreaming as as ther royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious that was froid am but a we now know with psychodhelics and this was what dreamy into the area was discovering literature am that wer speaking to this particular action the psyche delicaction and wit saying that when these drugs lycelesty psalesyben ifaundimagimushians am when theye used in inpsychotherapy am material comes up the may be may have been repressed am the the ta is of in a therapetic valy an awareness an insight of this material seems to catalize the terapeutic process with n a strong emotional release these cathatic experiences and a an insihts whether ther in psyts e the personal am or whether the transpersonal am but a for me this is really where the meet of it is with psychodelics and classic psychodelics in particular the likes of compound psycas alestean an psalesybon i would say that if it was an for this action by classic psychedelics we would not be interested in psychodelics i i think we only had compounds catamian emdimay canabist odoes the could be said broadly speaking to be psychodelic i do not think it necessary would have captured the well etention is psychodelics are right now i adyothing is a major gaps of phil is this principal action of the cossic psychodelics what does what does this mean that i'm referring to psyche revealing what is that and ispose where i'm going with this is what is that in terms of the bioagy as well what is going on in the brain and the body when people become aware of things the previously they were not fully awareo i'de to talk about some of the clinical trials that you have been involved with i'm in particular looking at sylisibon the as you mention the principal halluse hallucinatory psychodelic agent in magic mushrooms i'm id to start with a kind of nuts and bolts question i'm just sai that everyone is on the same page i've read the papers that you have published in the others ave published in this area and typically on the dosages he used in these trials are twenty five miligrams of sylisibon and we talk about one recent trial in particular that compared twenty five to ten miligrams to more frequent use of very small amounts one miligram over three weeks for instance however when people talk about magic mushrooms they often talk about grahm doses of the mushroom because i'm assuming that they contain miligram dosages of sylicibon here we are not am encouraging a use of any kind thes are clinical trials but for the'm clarity of understanding what is the conversion typically one grahm of magic mushrooms will contain how many miligrams of sylisiban on average because of what i want what i'm trying to do here is is calebrate people to this idea of microdosing verses macrodosing and that is fairly straightforward to do with respect to the clinical trials but then in the the lot of the lay discussion around this you hear about heroicodoses verses microdoses and highthing there is a lot of confusion if you would am educate us on this a idea of what is a microdose and perhaps also how many miligrams of sylicibon are contained in a graham of coin quot magic mushrooms wat a microdise is sneither of these o that simple tethe fa it is a fun challenge a microdie one definition is that it is a dise oof typically a classic pcychodelic elesty or salecibon an that is athat has some perceptable psychodelic effects syche it does not put you into a noticeable to state of consciousness that feels your tripping an and if that was elisty it looks as i the threshold is around abow that se iten eleven twelve microgram microgr mic cro on ra very clearlaroga sobe tand ten micrograms of elisty are you saying will not induce visual hallucinations in most people it is it is that is threshold level tan's about the level that that some people who are sensitive could feel it but if you were to talk to the a microdisingcyris they might say that that is kind of the bll part for anelestydise that you would consider a microdise and then you would take the semi regularly it is typically something one day on one day off for one day on two days off this kind of thing thee's different pritycl s and and yes in at some lik jim fadaman an a one of the popular isers of microdising i think would say the a true microdise should be subperceptible you should not feel it yet the assumption is it is going to change you in some way one a kind of trait level more than a state level and an maybe behavorly and and the typical story goes it wor improve well being an maybe maybe it could improve certain aspects of cognition say related to creative thinking and i emphasize the maybe there because that is another angle with microdising with kind of waiting force and compelling evidence as thinks standright now i say we lack an that compelling evidence ti some suggestive stuff but often the study designs on that strong it is really hard to do a study with microdising because you need to have permission to give people a microdise to in it a practical reasons they would go home with and an otherwise you your requiring them to be in the lab say three times a week for ex number of weeks to meet the criteria of a course of microdising which my be two or three times a week to say a month and that is a hard thing to do in a lad study its expensive you need to do that against tay suitable control to a pleceed by control and there is a study that is been done in new zealand and that has some interesting preliminary data the did i think can it did the design right and but i has not be published yet and i've seen some positive findings presented around improvements in inmoved but it is a bit early to get too excited about that and tes te gitry perofuan or that an but as things stand the evidence is pretty thin and and an we have to be honest about that we did quite a creative study o with my colleagues at imperial the guy leading that balashe as shegety hungarian chap and did really creativ desin very much his brain chilty and instructed people to do their own blinding there on't plece by controlled blinding of their own microdising this was a classic citizen science study do it yourself science where they would get their elestesi thaves in chope them up put them into ja captals i paque and have other captals that the plece bos that they just close empty captal and then thows a whole barcode scan technique car that you you cannot shuffle them up but they have got the barcode in the cuarcode you can break the cod late to ran but once he have shuffle them up you no longer now which one had have the the microdisyan on which one are empty was a zealousty is wa selosty also tried it with mushrooms but the issues with the mushrooms whas people would burt sometime te belch and then theyd have tis mushroom taste then instructed people to get some i non psychoactive mushroom material to perinsis really ot an easy study not an easy study and and tha it was i love that kind of science in a real creativ first move a kind of science and the results o fascinating because sim the short story is that the microdosing did not and compellingly beat the plece bylonat it did not and he controlled because he asked i he controlled for expectancy said people was positive expectancy which is in a sense the vehicle that carries the placy by response it is why you have a placy by is the positive expectancy contrive the repeatic effect to a large extent he measured that pre trial and then used it to kind of correct for the response and hadit it wore those who got a plece by but thought they got a microdise did as well as those who thought they got microdise and did get a microdise say it was the bigger efect that the majority of the effect was in thinking that you got a microdise in ta sense it was a victory for the power of the plac by response and it is created all sorts of controversy people do not want to believe it that kind of thing that is the beauty of sciense is not that that science is not about what you want to believe that right there is the beauty of science ready i love that experiment a cudos to them i'm not going to attempt to say his last name i i i e wen you mad amusnot i i think you you got it am you were involved in a a clenical trial that was a published last year comparing twenty five meligrams of i'm sylicibin to ten meligrams of syliciban is a very im to a at a drug called a ci taloprim yer yer lexipro yesipro im and this one meligram over three week am dosage i in am wanting to discuss the results of that study a bit i'm and some of the other trials that you have done involving syliciban for depression for the treatment of depression i'm a coul we calbrate ourselves twenty five meligrams of sylicibon is i is that what would not what its can be a perceptible dose presumably hollusi n is an all that and is that of what one would find in a i'm guessing here if i'm accurate this does not mean that i have experience here but a two two grahms of of my ol is tat a we think ye siria miss tha te oo mistavan wen of fonitangen pert yet twenty five milograms as solicei been would be we do not know and and it is important that i say that because i would not want people to hear my aunts ar here and then use it to calibrate the araindising mushrooms and get it way off si its guess work and i love to see some on to proper study on it and yei am i lookat the olicibon content in a given massi sylocopy mushrooms magic mushrooms but to my knowledge that has not really been done am some one pose stamits rida wuld give a better answer here but i think the percentage within the mushroom mass is some of solisibon in the mushroom mass and solicin which is metabolite of solisivon and is something in in the one per cent little beie may be a range ocase one one graham one thousand miligrams of magic mushroom would contain about ten miligrams of sylisivon i broadly speaking e great that helps calibrate an and i think again just allows the lay person to understand a bit more of were we are headed with these a sylicidin our trials and and the results we do not have to restrict our discussion to just that one clenical trial but iif we include that one and in compared to some of the other trals that you have done i me you re laboratories seeing phenomenal in my opinion phenomenal results in the treatment of a otherwise intractable depression major depression which many people suffer from from to a i i suppose they are a two sessions of using sylisibing in these ranges of ten to twenty five melegrams to have that correct yes o c e could we talk a little bit about what people typically experience during those sessions that allows the phenomenal transformation of mood and state and trait as well and i'm especially interested in whether or not it is the experience during those sessions that is the trigger that is necessary for the the transformation from a depressed to a non depressed state because wi the the impulses to think it is that what one thinks and sees and hallucinatess am an hearers is vital but of course these drugs can create noral plasticity changes in our noral wiring presumably for long periods of time what are your thoughts on the the experience itself and maybe for those who have not done these compounds before you culd explain a little bit about what is typical for people and what you think is leading to that incredible positive and pervasive change in mood state and trit ibut iutd say that its more than impulse that is an leading us to think that the experiences importand it is really data and and convarging evidence now am independenteens independent studies ar convaging on the magnitude of certain kinds of experience rateit yes with subjects i riting scales is predicting therape to outcomes pretty pretty strongly and very relively am and that is guiding us now could you say whatl maybe ther's experiences of some kind of epy phenomenon i say a sentral brain action wet absolutely but then all experience is an appy phenomenon by that principle and yet we care about it en a and it matters a to us and in our human relations with each other i think it does matter to a human being when therein a say a psalicide an therapesession and as the drug effects begin to come on in e body starts to feel a little strange and tinkly and ther thes em some initial anxiety and then in their minxie they start to notice paterns may be colors and then may be those paternts deeper an the dynamic may have this fascinating organic quality or the unpatience in our studies to begusing e and i mask yer aso they arein the imisiyes clolie that is what you said mind's eye i supposed to looking out into yes anothercal ota te maje a differences to psychodelictherapeves is taking a psychotelicis you shut your hiyes and it is a it is a world away from taking psychodelic ye at a rave or something in a sense good luckthe an but in psychodelic therapy yeit is it is and settled conditions and thi's music playing in one of describing here is very much the default a thi is ati in a very little variability between the different psytes that have done this work on these conditions a tymically it is true people ideally mental health profession was at at least one whos a psycharterist of clinical psychologist of some other kind of psychoterapist for psychatic nurse an but ideally too who meet those criterio with a individual whos ingested the drug and a music playing throughout a kind of runway into taking the drug and enthroughout o this continuity the music with eurics or or withoutouslyrics to begin with and the music typically is spacious to begin with an and then builds and becomes atmospheric ah there might be ad a nicom tribl drums in the distance or or something as as it develops or the sound of a bird in the distance and i a birds call an and then as it gets into more stronger drug effects a the music and starts to coax a emotion and very intentionally eni strings for example would come in and a and it is it would be an interesting experiment of one that we love to do atually a to see whether if you were to pull that out whether the the psychodelic experience would be as emotionally intense as as it is in psychodelictherapy when you have music there is a default and across the board people should find this remarkable because a kind of is all of the publish studies that an out en i having such an impact a on psycholotry an beyond have music there is a staple component and we just take it as assumption that it needs to be i tend to share that assumption but it is remarkable that it has not been tested properly but it is that you n if you were to run with that and and if you were you kn i had a kind of critical agender you would say well this is music therapy and why u making all this fuss about psychodelics a it is music that is there in all these trials with all these fantastic findings i there is something to that and this will teak me up probably to talk about psychodelic therapy being a combination treatment a we have the hitin between the two bicous i ashan the hypothesis athe asumption that should be tested meta t there is a positive insurraction between the two ecessinity between the two a that is why its psychodelic therapy yeivan just cart hart her i'd to take a quick brak and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there isn' i starty taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health our god is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turm health and those probiatics enathletic grens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptigens vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste crip if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you 're on the road and the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d thre k too again that is athletic green stoccalm slashhubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitemend three k to this is extremely useful to hear because i think most people think ok psychodelic whether not tey have experience with psychodelics or not its a visual hallucination in some oditory hallucinations and cynesisia some visual auditory blending am some at a sensation rubbing a surface and and being able to elicit the a sounds in one's mind am of course it cetera but seldom do we actually hear about the the specifics of these clinical trials in a way that for instance points to music ats one of the perhaps key variables now you mention that as people enter these psychodelic states that there is a litle bit of initial anxiety m out a year and a half ago i had a discussion with doctor matthew johnson who is running some solicipe an trials at john's hopkins as and he mention that the critical importance at least in his mind to this idea of the patient qotinc letting go or allowing the experience to take them someplace mentally as opposed to trying to constrain their censory and cognitive experience aiobcures what your reflections are on that on that idea and why it might be valuable clinically and this ties back to this earlier tidiscussion we were having about the unconscious or about psychodelics revealing something that is there all the time but that we do not have access to it is and again i'm i'm struggling to find the right language for this because we do not really have a nural mechanism you do not top down in habition or something that to explain how this unconscious might be uncorked in the psychodolic experience but to make it quite simple and direct how important do you think it really is for the patient to feel they are quotin letting go and what in the world is letting go in biological terms ye e i think we will get there in times of having been your carnetes of the mind revealing itself to itself yan the i muscience of unconsciouthe unconscious into consciousness or unconscious material into conscious of leness it is a it is a wonderful challenge it is huge h challenge but it is the challenge to embrace and and letting go very muchis again a staple component of hav the different teams do this work in terms of encouraging a willingness to let go and when we started out doing our depression work and and did that first trial is the first trial of a vepsychadelic in a formerly dagnos depression in a wer that was the targit population and depressed population's the first modern study to do that and and we visited hopkins our friends there and and were and mentor on how to do the guiding bill riched mery cossimana they were just and brilliant and and in a wisin in there and in their guidance to us as to how to do the guiding in our trial and this phrase of trus to let go be open you are here a lot i do not know who fairly should be attributed to but i would attributed to bill a bill richards may your everything's borrowe you probly got it from somewhat one else but its such a kee principle it is it is almost a mantrer that youre trying to instill in people trust let go be open and those different components where the trust is about the the reputed report that again this goes beyond just in tuition now we formerly measured the reputed report we but do it even wete just a single iter me a visual analogues sco iton the subjectov ratingscale iten on the morning of dosing and we find that it sir it is a significant predictor of the quality of the experience that you have under the trung in in the psychadelictherape and then the theraputed outcomes ex weeks or months later an very powerful kind of chain of a sor predictive components there the trust essentially important and again not just th intuition but the dates appointing to that let go at there is a readiness a readiness to surrender to let go to not resist an we do measure that to and see that it is predictive o response an and then the being open is about a an a willingness to go there to confront to be inquisitive ah something that is easier psed than done can be terrifying and i when you are dealing with a very vunerable population ah it is probably more the rule than the exception a their carrying some significant adversity life adversity or frank trormer that they have suffered and that message of be open be willing to confront and to go there is really an i it is really powerful an and that that is how it plays out an and often there is struggle there is something going on that is i do not want to be feeling this make it stop that can be night merish at times with it is very very strong and with these bigdoses that we give it is sa it is very strong and a atually a a student an that i've worked with an i think now doing a pgt arry brower i's working on a fantastic project characterizing the different phases of the psychodelic experience with the early face is dominated by n negative emotions and a negative ae negative the veilance feelings of anxiety and struggle and than it is a different story and the later a could ask about that for i think that is fascinating and important to analyze the diverent phases and again i'm delighted here because people typically here about a psychodelic journey but we never really hear about the the kind of steratypic components of the beginning middle and end of that journey we know that there is a peakue and that there is a kind of a pari shooting down and an et catera but a when you say that typically there is an anxiety may be some negative eilance in the early stage do you mean about the sensations people are experiencing or about some prior event that is being called to mind that theyre remembering m likewise for the positive phase of the psychodelic a journey or trip are people they still called a trip ye are for the a ike a will you'se trip for the psychodeli trip are people feeling positive about the experience ah there is been some sort of break through or there in a in a calmer state or is it that they tend to be focussing on prior events that were positive in other words is there a threading through of some a concept that comes to mind for people maybe about an earlier tramaor may be about a sense of sell for a sense of other forgiveness a you do not coul be any these things but whatd' we know about the confiner details of all thatan o say the initial am struggle is more against a general drug effects than pinning it on on something specific it is more that in a nomal wakin consciousness we have a sense geerally speaking if wer well or well enough a sense of assuredness about what is wat an as ti werand and and i and an we have that ssuredness in to an extent about ourselves as well it might be llusory but e have it and what the drug's doing is it is breaking downall of that and it is scarious hel and i and if it is a big dice it is just human nature to bi to ret in i race against that of ben and a bet dying i do not want this it feels i could be dying yam i might lose my mind yet that i ever come on a to i the classics is but i might i might know that i've taken a psychodelic and i might even know a bit about psychodelics but i still fear that i'm going to go mad an al that i know thay generally speaking these drugs tha have a hi an an i for fatility an aa risk ah i still think i gang to die and i an and it is just it is very palpable in that and that comes p say yeh that is that i mean tose of the courf is tatta dis too and very relavy that comes up and it is really a basic drug action it is dice dependent that it is a basic dru action that is forcing something about the nature f the mind and the way it is made up that makes it feel that way o but it feels i'm losing my mind or it feels a could lose my mind or tha i could go in saying or that maybe im i'm dying here and this is bd ye a you have talked many times before and have done really wonderful work looking at the changes in communication between different brain areas while under while people are under the influence of psychodelics i think the gistalt of those dat are correct me if i'm wrong is that i'm compared to the non psychodelic state that under psychodelic influence am there is far more us just call it interconactivity or a communication im between a brain areas the typically are not communicating which probaly i s not surprising to people given the the unsubjective effects of these of these drugs what is the evidence that after the psychodelic journey is over that some or perhaps all of that inhinced communication across brain areas is maintained and if what role do you feel that could play in these incredible positive therapeutic out comes yer we we have had a some recent findings in in that direction where yes it is true and yet it the a picture the says a thousand words of some people might be familiar with these two circles an the project that we did in claberation with some researches were ordinarily the communication is going on and within systems other regions of the visual system will be speaking mostly within the visual system tat be a cindiccleqist cleakishness or a modularity to the quality of the communication in the brain and then the cool finding with solicibin was the first of paper is that the communication yes he sort of transcends these modules and becomes much more into modular an crossing different a midalities and that fair correlated with th magnity that the subjective effects and that we replicated it with elestesin different methods and a new paperl come out soon with deente showing a similar effect the bit of debate about what regions of most implicated but the general effect of an increasing globle functional connectivity is what we call it wil globle communication in the brain and this is well under the influence is thes unrevies of prepeople into a brain scanrer while they are under the influence of the drug yea yet at itself must be a quite an experience given that these scanners are smal r tubes you are in a bite bar yef u gt ap bite barr in your mouth that is a a ll get quite a at u stady you do not always have a bite father at leas with the psychodelics but yer you go to keep you had still and and yafte loud i am a scaninois going but because it is regular am there are not tou many surprises si it is aty surprisingly tolerable inere in a hospital setting you not worried about what would happen if you had a carty ac of en ein a profession has around and youn't most people generally tolerate that setting quite well surprisinge well but yeare we do all that and and yes we do see that am opening up of the communication across systems in the brain and it does speak to kind of intuition about the subject of experience the in i different midalities might be blending with each other is it sorry for interrupting but i have to ask is it thought that the activation of the suretone into a receptor is what is responsible for the increased communication between brain air is that under normal circumstances would not be communicate yes the is a few reasons why modelling work the computation modeling work the first identifies where the two a receptor is and then looks at and models its basic effects on yourl activity am well recapitulate the the or am recreate the effect that we see actually in the data with the scanning i doing the computational modelling you can see the same effect by knowing a whether to it whether the kee receptors are and then making them do a certain thing that we now psychidolicsty i can imagine two possibilities and i think it is important to distinguish between these two one possibility is that the activation of this seraton in to a receptorateleast increase conactivity end hereby auditory invisual hallucinations emerge changed patterns of thinking emerge et cetera that sort of the obvious interpretation but am the scientist in me has to ask is it possible that all of that increased conactivity is occurring and yet that is a distinct phenomenon layered on top of some other effect of the psychodelic drugs impacting access to the to the unconscious hallucinations in other words is it the increased connectivity that is leading to the subject of experience or of those two things happening and parallel will they happen in parallel and the map to each other the question of causality what causes wat a is the tricky thing where i i would suggested the se the the causality is circular that i influence each other and that this gets a bit philosophical but a kind of matters because otherwise in a tha's a trap the it is easy to fall into a were you are thinking that it is all about the brain action causing the subjects of experience and thats typically what we doing colclative mere asscience am it is kind of the tot of first port of col kind of materialist te approach who will not combe a materialist essentially but still appreciate that circular causality the mind also interracts with brain am and it a to pick the to apart and there is a kind of essentiual dualism where subjects of experience is the thing in anof itself but that is not to divorseive from what is going on on the by much oclevel the the reason i ask is because am as i understand it nowadays thereis a bit of a movement within the scientific community that study psychodelics to develop drugs that can essentially cure or alleviate many of the symptoms of depression or trama that are built off our understanding of how psychodelics sylicibe in and here i'll throw empdy ama in there although classically notapsychodelicates connigets lumped in wend get back to that later but that do not produce hallucinations or massive changes an subjective experience i shoald think this is what initially got us into conversation on twitters i s had learned about this paper published out of a group at you see davis that essentially modifying psychodelics that they have potential therpeutic application for the treatment of depression but zero hallucinate genic properties and i thought while this is going to be a very controversial thing in the world right because the the history of psychodelicsas you pointed out has been one of people accessing different modes of thinking feeling seeing things these inletting go trust et cetera a therapeutic relationship and here we have i do not want to say farm ecause it is not really farma but we have laboratories wo are trying to te's apart the activation of receptors independent of all that subjective experience in order to essentially treat the same conditions an le you to comment on this where you think it might be going and you knont whether or not you think that is the writ or the wrong approach if it has any validity at all it is farmers to smon ofama ot is tots u fama be pokis because farma would to have drugs that can cure deppression but do not make people hallucinate is that a they would and patience mine and the system would not because the system is used to itit is medicine right and it does not give this this a mental imagery of a the summer of love in san francisco or of v you don' callidoscopeiyes right once more e you can imagine the more to be careful with my wording here those who would not be incline toward that would might might embrace at ther p u i cathat that is strictly effective at treating depression with no hallucinations yat it does not look it in a an individual lying on a sypher crying there our eyes out a am about in a the life that they have lived am and that deep cathasis being life transforming the very different from that model an i'm sceptical of it and mi for a few reasons and and one is that i i cannot see the logic am i cannot see the pieces fit in a way that is compelling and i'm also sceptical cas i think it could easily be wishfor thinking because of that point that patience would it and the system would it and i just the cannot you got it there that in mind as well am would not it be convenient in a if it were true and you could get the therepetic action without the psychodelic effect on a way that is a ttle bit of what microdoe seems seems to be design ye you you sait take dosages there below that that a perceptible orsu awareness of some effect threshold over a longer period of time in an attempt to ping the circuits or twi youd at you alter the circits but nat pollucinate yet not have a cathersus if if mycrodising coul do that and it is sub perceptible the mychrodising is not psychodelic action because wheres the psychodelic action when psychodelic when defined mean psyche revealing you are not getting that effect you might be getting the farmacology might be getting some direct psaratine into a receptir agonism that could be driving a therepetic response but you can get that with access rise as well an i and my point is what is what is new oca may be it sumit knew in people are now developing direct to ay agonists rather an indirect through a ceretona releaser the selective seretone reotacin ibitors the escessorise serpriian are there any essessorise that selectively agonize an which folks by the way means activat in a good way gagony sands terrible to those men an forn might thing that mean tha disrupt but they can activat the ceretoninto a receptor are ther any drugs that will do that that are not psychodeic i'm not aware of anybut then again iam non o therre ah there are me that there any thata a licenseton used as medicinse in psycholetry as he had this debay an recently on social mediar and i could not see i could not see a compelling example i saw two aagonist that we use for other things yeve a compaund liseride used in entreating parkinson's but atciits more of a dopenin agonists i and there always haing other thing theyre iht yer yes it tapping other ine let be o tras rotef things is there is here a selective ceretony to a receptor stimulator an agonist and that it is not psychodelic that is thereputo enpsychaltry in the answer firmly as not i have not seen it yet will they develop one well for patient's sake i hope because it would be great an let us wait and see if they do i doubt it will be psychodelic and i doubt it would have much to do with psychodelic therapy an and it would be much more the system reluased to of chronic farmo chotherapy take your drug every day let us let us hope they find it an it works for patient's sake but as things sdanright now iam a little sceptical let some of the findingstead of being seen that a really exciting f antastic work being done showing things increases n the communication compinencs of nurons dendritic grce a spine grice a synaptic pine grice yet by the way folks yuste all interrupt for a natanessarily spina the bone inner tha not the cerebral a a caum but am spines are these little little tiny twigs with bulbs on the end of of nurons that are allow for communication points between nurons sonero plastosy is often associate with growth of dendrites and spines and worth which is what whatrobins referring to that that reminds me an i just one o make sure that i we close the hatch on the earlier answer because i intterrupted you is the increased conactivity between or communication between brain areas that is observed while people are under the influence of the psychadelic also observed later after the effects of the drug weareoff and then i'll just throwing another question there because we are on to this topic now to what extent do we think that nurow plasticity structural changes in nurons functional changes in nurans are responsible for that and how long does that last let say i take les i come into your clenic am ama amin subject in your experement i take do come in in the morning i do my psychodelic journey five or six hours later an par shooting back to reality as we call it and then i go home increase conactivity lasts for how long and how long are the structural brain changes an ruring wall youre askin fantastic questions and a partly because we do not have the answer yet but we do have some we do have some date and we have looked to fus wil the in a sense the function plasticity or what we assume it to be or at least the function changes the increasing communication across systems am that increasing groiable conactivity function conactivity do we see it after the tric we know we seeit during the trip pretty well replicated correlatesing with intense strung effects do we see it after the trip the answer is we have seen it in to different depression cohort solicide interipy for depression in on't study where we look the next day we saw it kind of resitule am a affect similar to what you see acutely being seen the next day and then in a subsequent study we saw it also three weeks later we have seen it to independent ay to sets this decrease immordularity is how we measure it the same thing essentially broadly speaking its the same thi an increasing globe connectivity functual connetivity and i she unpublished we have seen it in healthy volunteers on a correlation revel not on an absolute change level but if you look at it is relationship to a mental health outcome and this is an important thing to stress with he depression work we saw a relationship between the magnitude of that change the decreasin modularity or increasin global connectivity and the improvement in symptom severity interesting ye oy what i and just a state a a different way am what robins referring to his wecs i ro modularity is nur scientists we think of the the different modular networks of the brain that eu of the eye talks to a region of the foulness in volved in vision which ocks to the vicual courttacs which you eventually converges with auditory information of course am but there is a separation or modularity of function this increased connectivity is cross morduler induring the trip but afterwards as well an you are saying that that correlates very strongly with the strength of the ther apudic outcome tof depression aman the the lodical extension of that is that extreme modularity of brain function is undepressive in some way n ow we do not want to go too far but what does that mean that increasing cross talk am between different modules of the brain is strongly correlated with a positive therapeutic outcome we do not know other than as a relationship i mean this is this is the thing we needs be little careful not to run with it too far i mean thats some things that it suggests i think it suggests a more flexible a mode of brain functioning if you are not getting stockin modules or the modules on am excessively cut off from each other but you see different things with with different presentations if you ar to look at cugnition shop a culgnition is that she associated with more mogularity t it is a rule it is a little slippery and we need to be careful with it ijust a agein o a forgive me for internbut i think i've friends who are am i would say are on the spectrum who are am very linear in their thinking in extremely intelligent in a in the conclassic sense of being able to ratch it through hard problems to arrive at a solution and then iave friends who are us just callmat they are from the creative communities outside of science that am are very expansive am they see cut connections between many different things but you sometimes you have not all of them we have to catch their ideas with a butterflying at and oftentimes what they are saying does not sometimes just as it make any sense now they also produce incredible creative works but to have a conversation with them is anything but a lineor experience they are not random thought generators am but there is a non linearity or random ass to their processing that is distinct from these other folks that i'm describing as on the spectramen of course it is a spectrum there is a whole rangeing between am sounds to me there is some therapeutic value ou to being able to move along this continuum from the more linear to the non linear is that is that i think ate i ye your it is resinating what you are saying it speaking to my intuition the you ni a you could be very passy passing things ar choping things u an analytical science is ly li kind es better as we say in pside your either a lumber ir a splutter ye but the way in being very particular about what wat when to caul something psychadelic you ni that that kind of parcy analytical way thinking you with you might associate with a mor modulassystem you nig am where as the system at's mor glably into connected and open ye might be more flexible and creative and divergent in the associations and on say yes that is speaking to my intuition to how ye you'r describing it and i imagine if you take severe psycha pythology severe mental illness a depression i've always thought thathere is something intuitive about the time itself a depression in a landscape wic is that homsical depression physical depression that it is easy to fall into and if you do its hart to get out of itso almost am if i understand what youre saying correctly almost getting a'm stock at one location on this continuul because most people do not reside at one or extreme one extremer the other at full time tin cin o migrate back and forth between expensive sate said mor linear stats you do i low mood if you are healty and inverticomesy can fillyou me to disappointment but you can spring back but someone willing know you can spring meyeiht ras the suicide or depressive person or too ecidedly depressed person am somehow at least t my understanding there there is something about the deextreme depressive states and extreme anxiety states something my laboratories a bit more familiar with anxiety which alters the perception of time such that people feel that negative that state is going to go on forever or that if it goes away that it is going to return at random ye kind of a vulnerability to the time domin yer yets and it sy tragic but that tha cogri i bius in depression that everything's hopeless and and there is no light at the end of the tunnel yes i yeu know if you are to get stock in that rot and have that bius then your cut off from other things are the censry a mydalities or mocul san i cuts off from the world cutof from other people stocking in a rot and a yes i think wer sharing this intuition that e a ecrease in much larity are an opening up of the the system the brain an could relate to an opening up of the mind that is kind of enduring after the after the psycdelic a dicing session and yet and and the third replication was to see and healthies an improvement in wealth being because that healthy we do not look at depression these are people that are healthy walking into the trail ye take sillicide and twice a well as yy they do and but the first ice is ore milogram which they they do not feel it is supplicy by daronoscope micro yh we are sticky ge on the heads an to measure that brain wavs and during each dice and one milogram you see no change an we i think that you mycrodosers on just cang tat i a again a acrodise as i've always just been ol bit sceptical based on my conversations with the the ascientist acthlly doing the work with with am with a psycodeics it seems the the banswer keeps coming back do to to one or two maybe three mackrodos is in a controlled safe setting well hat's compelling the evidence for that is compelling and a that is what is making all the difference right now and my crodes sees just appealing but again you kno sante is not about what we want to believe a it is about what is sutly coming through and what seems to hold up han i detesting would you say that is right the one or two or three sessions and how how far apart of those typically spaced in time ytobely one to three weeks across the sits is the way people are doing the the psycelictheropydicing sessions two sessions a in a hopkins imperio and why y am i that is a being a kind of default to we yet she is three in a caren anerectiatrals son a suden therpy franerects he a two patients left to to see after am nineteen ha've gone through the trial very exciting results tha ising a alleviation of the the obsessive thought about food in a willingness to consuming even healthier amounts of ye even in improved a wait at the long followa i critical a wen we didnt episode on eating disorders and i learned that a interecion nerosa which by the way folks the rates of are not increasing it is been pretty stable through time despite what said about social media and a et cetera but am inerecion rosa being the most deadly of all psycheatric illnesses which is a big statement because you do not a melic depression call by poler depression as a twenty to thirty times the the typical suicyderate a busily many anerects it your people withanerecty i think is how it is now as the is what one says not a inerects expet people withinerects her a'm often die many of them dne yet tragic often young people as well and similarly with suicide in times of premature death the tragedy with psycholitry is sistrong and and ta a it is it is rewarding to be doing that trilin to be saing it results i have to check myself a little bit that an i'm an reporting on it in this very permissery way and tat the trial is not yet publicly released and and publish say an it is still on goving as well but that is three tthree setion ins three sessions and i cannot say what the diceage is because we still have an there is a blinding compinin an but there are three dising sessions and ther tat see now i think te two weeks of par and and we do the follow a and yes i'd to yor close out this a description of the of the journey and the trip by extending past the day when o people have shly take the drug into this o what i've her described as the integration face you have to reintegrate right i all this lat all this increased conactivity during the session hallucinations insights anxiety letting go maybe revelation may be a piphany oka great at what point is that consolidated meaning am are these patients subjects an studies having daily conversation with their therapist are the journaling every day aand i want to keep in mind that most people are not going to be part of a clenical trial and of course here we are not suggesting what people do or not do but was just put it this way am were people to i ou psycodelics what is the way that people can maximise on the nauro plasticity and the brain changes in a positive way in the days and weeks afterwards in other words how long ies this called integratio n last and but how far can we take the eming i could imagine that am how often one chooses to think about the insights could also have an in pact ye ra because clearly people went to raves clearly people did psychodelics in the sixties and we do not know if it clearly people do psychodelics now but we do not have dat o n those people you have access to the understanding of how they are spending their time and the therapeutic out comes would you we have not got into the numbers yet but again ar ar incredibly impressive you knowing upwards if as i understand at sixty per cent or more o people getting a realy from depression ye seventy e seventy per cent incredible specially when compared to te typical a inti te pressent treatment a and on what is this business of integration how is it done properly ye ye gush well how long does it last as well an a lifetime ayn i life is a journey a trip is a a journey an and as always work to do an as chackcome feel pays after the ecstasy the laundry ye att's atdore be other one i forget them an tit is e yes in the works on going and and and ther the ye an but this gives you a footar it enables people to an to work more easily and and that is true the cassic psychdelics wo say true very true of em do may theruy a a pytramatsic strest tis order it is really giving you leke up making it easier to do very very difficult work going back to a troma trying to digest it process ir into grat it an it is a such an epsential combinent of the treatment modo an but one has to be realistic as well y en i by saying our insegration last a lifetime well people delivering a service cannot be there for a life time and what is the answer there an and a people a wrestling with that issue right now an and i i think one of the solutions might be that it is in a sense on you a to a point at the therapetic team cand treat you to a point and then it becomes what you might call practice in a similar way that meditation as a practice it is something that you have to keep up and if it slips than things could slip and and that is the way it is and or you have a a another psychadelic treatment in i people have even used this term of practice in relation to psychodelics whether's a psychadelic practice tise in a a meditation practice but i amusing meditation an intentionally here because i actually think that and meditative practice an spiritual practice elements of spiritual practice could be a very important compliment to psychadelic therapy and i think it is probably doing something similar in terms of promoting an ability to sit with a forma colleague of mind syd it quite well in relation to psyhodelicterape verses chronic farmer cotherapelre accessorise being on them all the time psychadelyctherape allows you to sit with rather an sit on i thought that is quited and yes i en i the meditation of mindfulness an the ability to yes be present sente but also present senset and accepting things come up you and watch and pricess and and let go a that holy grail of of mindfulness a awareness without reactivity respond i yo i egr up in the baria and you would hear this language ri and i'm not being disparaging thi si friends that are on the board a essel and and worked on thet and i've gone there and it is and yet you hear these terms right be responsive not reactive which to a nurow scientists is grats on me which prouably dist means i have this sues but ome and surely i do but elizic what does that mean wright is or saying o to be the observer but not be drawn into the exprense and and again i do not be overly reductionist but when i find compelling about the emerging data as it really is data on psychodelics as treatments for depression and trama namely sulicibe an and m d m a is that it really seems to allow people this space that that is commonly thrown around giving space between stimulus ine reaction and vic or frankill talked about this but you knows i've been reading a wonderful book called the prince of medicine good dates back to the origins of medicine very dense book ye've been talking about thi stuff and thing about the stuff for thousands of years psychodelic seem to give people access to that better version of self which is remarkable what is also remarkable it is perhaps worth pointing out is that five years ago i never would have been comfortable having this conversation i would have een afraid to lose my job stamford magazine this week just published an entire issue about psychodelics with howcademine works m d m a sylicib with the appropriate cautionary notes and there but clearly times or changing speaking of which i know you are doing a trial on first time use of psychodelics what inspired that and what are you observing and as ou tell us that please give us am a few of the the ky contours a what is the dose am howld ar these subjects i mis somin ito men women are they suffering from depression or not wet can a what it what is the landscape of that study and i a i realize us a still early days of the study or maybe it is cose to completions not yet published however cransinal it is not published it is not submitted it is completed si this was one o another one of our covits studies in a sense meaning covit it and we had to finish the study and it was hard to finish the study because the cive da as true of our salisditepyves is es a telepram alexorpri trial am a which is published new englandg of medicin that the this was twenty that paper by the way folks will providea link to in the shownote captions as well as some of robin's other a papers i think that twenty twenty to new england journal papers really fabulous a given it the different dosages and the comparison to a sentury what is mycrodosing and the comparison to citalopra yeathes sintrusting that you link the way we gave small dices of salicipeanto mycrodising we did not think of it that way we thought it was just the anecessary plesee by or the big big dice the twenty five milograms it ti yes and say that we could say to every one wet giving e salisivean and not be lying yefor those you got as telebram lext surprive ot six weeks they they got very very lightdise of solisidim but allowed us to standadize all the psychitherapeand on but the the other study that youre referring to i was in healthies healthy volunteers a middle aged a average age i thing was forty si not yet typical student study that as often the case in psychology research ya or only under crads and a volunteering for your study as this is sam amore more of an age range and also i think it was an equal proportion of malam female all the staff atu weth female which the syfle very proud of them athough it produces its onpetential confounder it to have ar one one sex of af af staff possibly ye they did a good job in the psense that an we saw significant improvements in well being at the end of the trials let me describe the design it was say repeated measures design meaning people comm in you collect your baseligne data and do as brain scan and you give people an a pleceby we gave people of placebone as she let me remind a little bit every one's healthy volunteers middle age never takn a psychodelic in their life none of them entirely in i fresh firgon people coming in and aand the plan is to give them their first eve psychdelic experience o that is what we did in the study but to do it we have this repeated measures design with or first get a place bo and we have the procee by that we can do all the procedures or the therupy or the music listening but not give a wopping dose of psalesiban we again we gave them a plece bot os of psylesibe in one milogram we stick e g a had sets on during the experience to record the brain activity and from the scalp a the oscillating electrical activity and we do the emori scanning and before and after to see deeper into the brain and we can look at the functional connectivity that we were referring to earlier and also properties of brain and atomy which we did in the study the the short story is the all of the changes that we sore both psychologically and euroe biologically were seen with the twenty five milograms it all happened with that big wopping dose and what did we see while we did see significant improvements in psychological well being we saw what i call the intropic brain effect which is at he formerly quite aaccurate we see an increase in the informational complexity of on going brain activity recorded with the e g on the dose of saliciben the activity becomes more complex it is harder to predict across time it is more informationly rich and that effect correlates as it does very reliably with the magnitude of the subjective effects are the bigger the trip the biggeres in tropic brain effect and nou pretty well replicated finding and but then the m ar the emari and seeing deep into the brin was probably amost exciting result where we did not just see some functional brain changes but we have seen some anatomical brain changes as well and we used to techniqcalled diffusion tensor imaging that looks at the cabling of the brain the white matter tracts we saw a change in major tract we we sor of limited our searchplace te really thick tracts and really thick fibers and he fibers that came through as changing the ones that travelled between the prefront of quartec and and the thulomess and astriat and and there were two tracts to prefrontal tracts the changed and they changed in the direction of the decrease in actial defucivity which an could be interpreted as tract integrity where a decrease would be an increase intract integrity it is something that you see in the developing brain the atial de fucivity decreases as the brain goes from being a baby to being a adult actal dhe fucivity goes down and an enaging and thologies of aging actal de fucivity goes up wis is in the opposite direction if of the results you talked about earlier in terms of brain conactivity of a sort of increased communication across ereas if i unersin correctly and am perfectly happen to be wrong bryther way that this decrease in axiol diffusivity is translates to a higher fidelity of communication between the prefrontal quartax and the thalymusanstrad am as opposed to lass and your description of this is somewhat the the untransition from babyhood and childhood to adulthood a speaks to the same where we know that there is a massive calling of connections i supposed a growth of connections in otherwords as we get older we get better at doing certain things and less good at doing potentially most everything else is that right ish because the change was anatomical an and not functional the other stuff was is really measuring an communication in in the brain by looking at how the activity fluctuates across time and whether ther's fluctuations in activity a sincriness between regions and if they are we say that functionally connected and we infer that that talking to each other cause they go up and down in sincrany but when it comes the anatomy with talking about the justatic ou no material staff and a a wit seeing the fibers in approperty of the fibers change an at least that is what we think and recently we had an independent person come in and reanalyze the day tacusand i one of these things incredible finding requies and i credible evidence really strong evidence and ani would say the evidence of mymis mont studies i we need to be cautious on that but we did rean analyze it and used this an correct ion proceege o free water correction to be more sure that it was a change in in the actual microus structure rather in something to do with the exextracaluleus space that the water surrounding the fibres and it came through in fact the the change was strengthened by doing this corrections sthap sesarn ar this is neura plastersity as the consequence of one first time session with twenty five milograms of sore iren ye ye we are excited and and the n hel wus it be different ye know the second analiss coming in i was not sure she believed it and then she yen i thought this correction technique might connikill the result and and it came through and and shes it ocaden now i am excited to say we will say we do not know what it means what what does it mean functionally we do not know how did the people change while psychologically as i said ter well being improved we did look at thait cognition and we is the accognitive flexibility paradine that looks at people's ability to notice a rule change and then flexibly adapt their behaviour based on noticing this rule change and people improved after the twenty five milograms and did not significantly improve after the place by tose there were not correlations with the the detii change that the cabling change and these psychological outcomes but with these studies in smaller sample sizes you do not always see those correlations come through am it is something we do not know what it means but it is it is a change in brain anatomy that is in the opposite direction to what you see in an aging brain or with pathology of aging and it is what you see in a healthy brain as it goes room yen a normal neuro development into adothood very very exciting and intriguing and i appreciate that you have lighted that is just one study although from everything youv said it somesli been done with immense rigor we will eagerly await the publication of that study and us we can peruse all the day done and the subsequent studies i want to hear a bit about the study that you have been carrying out on the use of cylicibon for the treatment of fibra my algia i'm entrete by fibre my algia i could because i have a good friend who also i will not reveal who it is and know it is not mean this is not that i have a friend thing who also is a scientist whos a a sits it a fairly high position in the national institutes of health who am quietly has express to me that they are incredibly frustrated with the fact that am the standard medical community has am largely ignored fibre my algia a and that for many years it was a kind of lumped with things chronic fatigue cyndrum and other am called again calle i'm not saying this but people offerin for t these is oh it is psychosematic that is all in your head which is a narrow scientist is a ridiculous statement to hear because it is all in your head your brain as in your head after all your physiology and your psychology our influencing each other of course and in the the world is starting to appreciate that more but first of all am maybe could tell people what fibra ma algia is what inspired you to do a study on fibr my algia using sylliciran of all things am eause that' surprising to me and am if you are allowed to or if you have access to the data and am in mind a share with us alowe bit about what you'r discovering in that in that study surely happy tay say again it is soht a sobintarpy an population is fibry malgust in drime say this is people presenting where the generalized chronic pain unlike some other pain disorders where the pain is focus you can say it is my lowa back which is very common a chronicloa bac pin this is ore generalized and it and for that reason it is hard to know what it is and and that is why it is bein a controversial space in medicine and it is bein yet it is had that charge thrown at it that may be psychipsomatic an just to your point an is anything ever independent of of the mind anyway but this is atually af fascinating space for how in a subjective experience th lived experience and the mind can influence the body because there is some really interesting literature around the etiology the how the pain has come about innosence what cause the pain what is the story there and a head of the trial i would say to my colleagues let us just be careful because there is some fascinating literature around things am a background of tramer and am how am itthat can relate to issues related to inflammation and how that can express into things fivera mile jesindrome i just ad be very careful that because if you go in with an assumption that hare's some very tramer for example than ae's that hole i'll deside of psychonalysis the massively triped it up around false memory and on and please do not hold prir repsumptions that you gon are uncover am very tromer in every case now the teamer treated i think eight peoplr am and it is going it is going very well agan i just wona be careful with how i describe it to ma in a to manage expectations and not get to be carried away but i i check him with the team every week and am there' still based in london doing the work am and a it is remarkable what i hear abou the profound experiences thet people have under the drug in this study we only give one dice it is a very mechanistic study we ar have the e g cap on in the sessions amlikein the healthy voluntis thady bu this time now taking into clinical population and that they are in the ime they are they are wearing an imask under the influence of twenty five melegrams of sosivon most of them probably have not done sosivon before to litl bit the first time study in some sense they have an fibro my alga that is debilitating in some way that they do not they want they do not want it obviously and during the session are they thinking about their pain are they being told to think about their pain they are not being told to think about the pain in fact an as i understand it while there is a the repeatic model around ecceptance of the pain it is an ununlike someof the petiesty work you on encouraging them to focus on the index troma and then en i work through it in trying digest it we we do not do that with the pain to the pains there an but there is not an invitation to focus on it and that is probably one of the differences with classic psychodelic therape ves is empty a may therape argubly m di matherapies more bit closer to traditional talk therape whet there is more dialogue people are able to talk on empdy may am in the empdiamatrials to you a know whether or not they used imasks or because it seems to be an important distinction between as you describe the therapeutic trip verses the trip that one does of going into the woods and taking silk then take aslsaen in the woods or at a party or a while staring at a poster or wor it wore a leaf am again on not try to trivialize those experiences of an obviously they can be profound but am i am told am but a the md ma trials am seem to involve as you said more more directed a dialogue am in sometimes even kind of empathic connection between people by their actually looking at one another tthe eyes and i contact ing such a keep part of a the human a social cognative connective net works a do if they put imasks on people during the tim be pretty sure that they have the e musk ther caus a lot of the emdia may a work and i was part of an emdia ma trial am a it was am as i understand gere toward developing because it is an impathageand empathy toward the self iam pretty sure they have the i musks ther but they probably and it is a great question because you cu formerly test this it probably do not use them as much e things with the classic psychodelics if youare looking at your guides your facilitates s in their faces a melting o what ae yon india ma just mi really start to feel we are connected e min is ga especially beautiful and niter aand and yet aes that a fascinating effect of loving iu kno the people that you with am and sa i imagine they talk more and use the eyeshades less and it is more interpersonal rather my interapusmor going inside they do use a fascinating tim anology that some people ov critigue but it is a very interesting a phenomenon and it is this notion of the inna hela they use that at language a lot s been crety cause it sounds very suggest ive onn that is probably one of the vehicles here driving the tereputic pricess is suggestion i think out to be honest about that an ah but a when they go inside that is another term that we use very much in the classic sicadelic therape work you go inside you knay put the eye shades on and people are encourage to go inside an but when they do that in the end may work especially they might be told explicitly and listen to the inner heular an that kind of language he could see howa a cynic or a sceptic cal come in and and see that some kind of suggestive priming or buyasing i thin they they have point a sceptics often do but i i do not think it it is at all of the story and briefly cause it is an interesting point an speaking to that point a bit in our salisibin thera bevasis as telepram trial we measured pretrial expectancy and we did it for boith's conditions what kind of improvement do you expect with the lexirpri the esto telepram at the end of the trial and what kind of improvement if you go into the salisibin arm and get a big too big dices of salisiben what kind of improvement do you think you seen tat in in that am and n o course it was a poinflip as to what arm people went into and there was no cross over and and what we found was it was true that we had a an a sample byus sa most people had higher expectations on average of a higher expectations for salisiben and it is efficacy or effectiveness thus is the assessaride elexorpray and however when we looked at the correlation or the predictive relationship between pretrile expectancy and response we saw the pretril expectancy for the asetelepra predicted response to asce telepram a crosspotually every single measure all these different measures of depression and anxiety and well being and and i think none of the scales i'm pretty sure it is none of about twelve or mantal health arating scales was there a relationship between pretril expectancy even though it was high it did not predict pretrile expectancy did not predict response to the salicide interaphe say that was a bit of a you knows smash on a hed for the idea that that classic psycodelictarapees some kind of placy by response i think it is important to address that question and becas san if it does not come through as it did not is it did not come trute then it it opens up even more intrigue about well what is it that if it is not just te place by response or rasuperplicy by response an amplification of the placy by response then it must be something else and how intriguing it has a direct the repeated action it must be something and we do not yet know what it is i talked about the the residual in a increasin globle conactivity thats one possibility but the truth is with were just scratching the surface and yet the therapeutic out comes ir again just marvils marvellously impressive am i'm curious as to wi as well there are that many labs sbut the the laboratories thetare o focaston classics ecadelics for the treatment of depression and and now as you mentiond promising results for interacion fapromyalge as well although preliminary print very promising oh why the a lack of attention to it a ewesty an is it that elisty trips are just too long is it that they are qualitatively different am are there any data on am non microdoses of elestin here i wont to be very careful because i learned through by interactions on social media that this ter microdoses am very misleading and in some cases can be dangerously mis leading because as you mentioned earlier the effective pcychodelicdose or the effecta meaning that can induce a a a real trip with hallucinations et cetera a of eleste is actually in the micro graham range some people here microdose and they think microgram of eleste is a micrograhms is a microdose when in fact a macrodose of eleste can be measured in micrograms rights o this is where a in the absence of scientific training people can really go go astray a or even in jus in lac of understanding of the metric system and since now yero ya youre recent a rivals yes fortunate for us sorry england's loss as is the usas gained by af a robin's lap a move from from england to a the united states recently square one for us am but why is not there more use of eleste in these trials i think i it probably is the duration of the trip it used to be sticma a and it was easier to get ye sonasibin study three because othes were they were getting that true ao is stelike o francs volen viderin zuric n switzerland and than rodin griffis coming along intoin a sonasibin lak hopkins say you could appeal to that precedent since say what i doing it ivda an i come we not do in an little england am that is how it work for us we did at you go on ando in alesty study once wed kind of laid te foundations an for doing this kind of work and it was a brain imaging study was really extensive one atually wher we yous both amari and another mitality cod emg am sot of super eg in a sense an but e you knot why did not we an why did not that turn our heads to think o should we not be doing our trauls with alast it is i does have something to do with e pragmatics a study day with solicideniss long enough it is a ford tor six hour tre in the eftie o ask us to hav the people in the laban until eight hours piced dice with persony i think could be quite excessive especially if it is a lodice ou know if you have that the precei by condition as well it becomes along in practical ye scientists are not paid nearly enough to warrant the a there is no such thing as over time in forthe graduate studens in bostoit is often at thes uni morgenia members tat a doing that ready hot wer it was describvary well to me by a a student when i was a graduate student said to me they really cannot afford to pay us by the hour ecauseesy work i he was a electrophysiologist or he would run experiments no joke folks three to five day experiments sleeping in bouts of two hours here or there in a dark room with a bunch of equipment in a recording these are long long acuter physial physiological eelectra physiological reqorringe an yet no no scientist does it for the money i promise you a that there is money in farmer there is not money in a personal income a it is not lucrative if for the basic scientist a yes i elesty is what a anywhere from eight to fifteen hours sometiahin would be a little long ye be worried if ye was still tripping at that time maybe with a ri big tis i as k ut yet eight hours flus and dice dependent yet it is a bigodise its i a longer expense but you naf gin a dice at say and i ten i m in the morning which is mor less havit often guise than that six p m still feeling the effects and then how longt you wait now to kindo close tings ow before they can go hime even with salicibin ya people still at work into the evening and the staff were aways ther lahts or f coursk as they go to pack up and yes said these salong days and it and it is just it it it is too much and i that makes ense o your practical constrains i learn from a a recent guest on the spotcast and i that we recorded with a doctor satchan piendo is a colgu mind when i was down at the sall institute is a pinier ta lot of the studies on called intermittent fastand that the reason the intermittent fat a that that the eating period an these studies in animals and now on humans is eight hours the sor feeding window in these tases because a'm the graduate student was' going to otherwise lose their relationship because their significant others says listen you can be in the lab for twelve hours that meant some hours before the experiment than eight hours and then some hours afterwards but you cannot stay in there longer and and many people use the eight hour feeding window as a consequence the sienceit has to exist in an be carried out in real world frame aa o i as empty a maz a little bit am a little bit shorter write its about a fortus it is also about fortis yes sir and assimilar to saliciban yet is an natchy in the maps work they read dis after a sertain point to the boust the bu hvpe the optional bista yes say there is that am and now people ar thinking well even these salicibin sessions a long an expensive and if you have to have to staff members ther all the time that six spensivne n us wher my to the expensis is in the starcing can we abridge the experience make it sure to and get away with is and get get similar kind of therapiece outcoms it is a lot of interest in that direction may ask about i'm sorry to interrupt bat i want o mayturi do not forget to ask about combination sylicive an m d may therapiece the reason i ask but this is i'm and here truly not me but i know people who i'm do self administered a i'm combination sylicivan and m d a may i' i think i've this right i think it is called a hippy flip im there is another one that of all zealousty to again i'm not suggesting peopil do these kind of drug combinations but i'm the way it was described to me was that the sylicibin because it is seraton urgic i'm sometimes can be not a downer but can have a bit of a kind of a kind of a murky feel to it some real deep intruspection sometimes in the the darker realms of ones psyche depressive thoughts et cetera not that it nesserly stays that way throughout the trip but that the md ama because it has a very strongly serch and urgic but also dopemanurgic i man sort this has an emphedeming component a cocane in fact i'm if you ever seens o one in emdy a ma their pupils are about the size of a a quarters ah for reason there i i 'm extremely extreme autonomic arousal compared to a sedative im which by the way would constrict the pupils im they describe the use of emdy a made a kind of balance out the kind of affect component of it i'm what are your thoughts on combination sylicive an m d a may i does this hold anytherepeutic potential this is obviously a back yard chemistry i'm in the sense that people are or venam can cowboing the stuff on their own which again i do not really recommend i to see the science go first but i understand this is how t works in the real world am there woud i wuld your thought on in combining compount yet i guess the cowboying it in re creational context but also underground therapists to work with this compa that is what i'm refraind ye i am not tiing my people parroning with the stuff i'm dng out there are thousands now of a therapists that offer a second arctherapes illegally reallycause it is not legallynothnly you has to possess yourself am but that are doing this yesthat is really why imast ye and i think thars something to be said for one has to be careful with his as a scientist but in no if theyre doing it are they using some kind of trial an era the same is true of course with the ou no longer history of psychodelic plant medicine usif by plants we include the fangi as well say exin the extended sense plants yen no there will have been trial an error there it might not be as systematic as the scince we do to day but maybe there is been a learning process and maybe what they do an they have come to because they found it works say by that principle i'm interested in that combination and whether it does am offer some advantages maybe in certain patience if we one of the bust terms in medicine these daysis precision medicine a precision medicine an personalised medicine say maybe there are certain cases where you no introducing am say solicibin after the emdy may or the other way round culd offersome advantages and the differences are interesting you kno soliciben can get you to deep places maybe the colonel of your suffering and and a major life experiences and complexes the da causily link to whatever the pathology that you are presenting with am but it can do it sometimes quite aggressively an i and if it say pyshar mat's extresse disorder it can be overwhelming and you confit it and really it is that it is the the resistance is really challenged and they fight back and the therepetes it breaks through and the progress is not happening because you have agitated the defense mechanisms where is wa emdy may offers is something argubly more directionally reliable in terms of in tomes of the vailance it is more directionally positive generally and emdi may experienceor daver bad time on a ye you leme quite blond and by one of the concerns i had with emdiamy i've never done it recreation i have had not and have not ever done it recreationally but when it was done in this the apeutic saiding i realized because there was music on at the beginning i asked you actually asked them to turn it off because i realize that the an the music was becoming such an attractor to my attention that i suddenly was searing ything about music and my love of music which was not the focuss of the session that i a sou was there t for am and i'm glad that they did turn the music offic is the moment they did i was able to drop in within the im asked to this to the sort of go inward and address some certain issues that at least to me felt key and productive am that seems to be the kind of a hazard with em doa ma is that i it is such an impathageand that a one could i start to you could go down any number of different an rabbit holes ye yet but but it is also it is a strength because you well the classics solicipin can take you that very reliably but maybe aggressively and i may makes it easier to go there and and that is its strength and that is why that marriage of them tit maytherapefapetosy and particular s it is it good com by it works because you are gin a go there innocence you have to to really make the theropeatic progress you cannot have to go back there am but we we can a senit up si that you can go back there and feel as safe arem am more trusting and be able to go back there where is you have never otherwise being able to go back there without an i dessociating or having in a horable flash backs and on si am that is the strength that it offers i guess the limitation would be the maybe it does not take you as te as the a classic psycadelicson i tend to think i'm bastilniss wona as a kind of honesty to the classics in that it is it is hell as well as heaven ou ni and that is the psyche it is in all ros is i i really appreciate that you bring that up because i think that there is such a fear of a i called bad trips there is such a fear a in nonpsycada states to am to avoid that the painful and everything everything we know from trama an the a treatment of traman we have had several guests on here my close colly close close coly gat sanphrd doctor a david speak aur associature of psychietry is clyncolypnotis amazing amazing human being in scientist inclination sit as really just it inbedded this in my mind that the only way to deal with trama is to get right up next to that trama to the point where some relief as experienced there is no other real way am as i really appreciate that you are saying that the classic psycadelics may offer the the am with a very strong nudge perhaps the opportunity to get into tha the uncomfortable in a way that i'm empty a mayor some nonclassical psychodelics a perhaps to nat reton mut time frames ir or duration of trips and these different c ompounds and how they deffer n how the're similar a and lefedo educate me on d m t and some of the work that you are doing with d m t a my understanding is that it is a very brief trip a minutes a people i know who have done this again to theraputically a hy a i'll just point to one very exciting i think am group and initiative which is the veteran solutions initiative which is a group a this is carried out in mexico but in conjunction with laboratories at stamford and elsewhere who are valuating the nurl changes im in this involves i begain which is you bogo which is a very long durations adelic twenty two hours or more followed by a i think one or two doses of d m t this is for veterans with o to deal with any number of issues a appears to be working with great success and ouve spoken to several of people have gone through this and the way that they described d m t almost at across the board was quote here i'm just pulling quotes rigt anic data a the most profound experience of my entire life even greater than the birth of my children quote being attached to the shock wave of an adam balm quote there is no way im would do another dose because the first one was unbelievable interesting by the way i think most of us including me woud think why wouln't you want to do it again then but this idea that that was just b one anything these are significant mscuse me these are significant statements coming from individuals who have existed at the extremes of human experience to begin with write these are i cle teer one operators with special operations o exit and may or may not have trama but d m t sounds a big deal a short duration really big deal what do we know about its chemistry what do we know about how it is impacting brain net works and what in the world is going on that people are describing it as ah the ways i just mention ay moments agor yet it it is a rocketship it fah if the salasibon is likes ship leaving port than ya this is this is a rocketship in to craziness is and by the is it cereton into a it is yes it is a classic psychodelicates o direct agonists o direct stimulator of the ceretone in to a receptor itsi an order of magnitude less poetenthan salasibin but potencies of funny thing becaus dose dependent that does not mean that the experience with the empty is less than that of salacibenis just that you give more of the drug an ah but a it has that is matched by its its stickiness for the cereton into a receptor which is this kind of golden rulin in psychadelic science is that it was discovered in midnineteen eighty is this type relationship between the affinity of the stickines or the binding potential of the psychodelic for the two a receptor in particular ceretonin to and its potency and ha sticky of the drug than more potents alasteereay sticking very very potent you only need those tiny microgram doses the empty by its affinity is is an a little less potent but by its effects when you give a standed dose its just in init is just wild and t empty because there is another compound cal five methoxy de empty which is a bit different pharmoclogically and subjectively ts it similar in terms of its canatics it is another rocketship an both compounds an in the wild soto speak ah an smoked oftenty empty and five emio people of vaping both actually now an there are v ta pence en o being that developed a te people to administer administer tis bet more tradition its being a smoking thing this is clinically not recreationally we are both both now young ing en a underground practition as a using the vat pens they them because people tig trate the disage they get a feel for what it is to be going into this states that they feel i can let go and go into it but sam and it you i think some of the veteran's work might be giving five emii after the i began an a phenomenologically a if there is a difference between ty anty and five emii people might put it on fithen e i've been more of a reliable eger dissolution experience less visual and more kind of all round immahian in the greata whole loss of self identity and just in massion an everything igye mewe just talk about ego dissolution for second ions such a sticky a a interesting idea i can take a step back as a nur scientist and iand say i gan ego dissolution this idea that the that 't from a very early age we have the concept of self and that in i wake up every morning and i know i me and not somebody else and somly you do the same and most most people do the same i would hope but that and that therare objects in the world and people in the world beyond us but every time we heare about ego dissolution it sounds it is a a kind of a temporary a elimination of the of the idea that things stop and am start and stop between us and everything else almost you knowing that cand of a yere ar not tryg to sound philosophical or a metaphysical but the other sort of the molecular continuity of of life right for all all yest little little bits ofisry i i'm not a functional way to go through the day right becaue you want to make a cup of coffee you do not really want to get lost in that if youre goal is to make a cup of coffee but am but you dont what is the the what is the power of ego dissolution is it the idea that we bolt that we belong is it a sense of meaning is it the sense that we we are not as important as we think which of course could be wonderfully useful a way to go through life to to think of we are not as an as 't we we are vitally important but we are not the only thing right because i do believe connection is vital as most people do what is ego dissolution and why would this seretonein to a activation cosat that is remarkable yer great questions aving w what is it a you alluded to it with a start stop i think you ni because you could define it bay boundarys in a sense what it what is not me it is as valid here is is the a developing sense of what is me that a child develops at whatever age am and a a major characteristic of the ego dissolution experience rather just a negative a thing going away my sense of self going away is is the positive o now i feel into connected with other people in the whe world at large and i realize you knowther there is that molecular continuity an actually that is a grand truth and oh maybe the eage thing is somewhat itlusary or at least a construction of my mind and indeed it is rite well it inous ye min is no trtranscendentalism about that it is just logic i think about about it a little bit family m an we all know what immediate family is but f om forgive me for interrupting myself i do it all the time anyway when i teach neanatomy some clever student always figures out ocable that is connected to that and that is connect but ultimately everything in the brain is connected to everything else ye there is just no way around that that is a true statement ye and you really just have to decide where you draw the boundary between wen you drally a i where wet where are the moduals what are the moder you coan say the brain is just one big mackrom argu e and then you also ont include the body and now fortunately people are trying to embrace this idea that it is not mind body it is both becaue your nervous ystem extends through both of course as at the same con be said of family we are related right not just by virtue he fact the were human beings if we did are genialogical charts we would find a a convergene at is on point e and of course this becomes a bit of a game but then one realizes that where you draw the boundaries and if you draw them at brothers sister parents byological parents at cetera that is a game to and it is just a construct y min it is a phongam you ni wer you dra the line when to pass i wen to collapse it is a suta classic consideration in sincse when to pass howo long perverses letter ely ye it is the justis question i well why to psychodelics do it and da ther we think psychodelics do it because the togic receptis at least een a classic psychodelics do it and that is important distress empte may does not really do it in the same way my sultonly ga it bu yei abates ab my experience with am empdy amay is that it is such a strong in pathagen ye u and and that it can die cause empathy for others ye certainly you could imagine situations where one at in empyamajourney a nd afterwards says o these these my oppressors you are the people that harm me they ah and here i'm not referring to my experience but they did the best with what they have i should have empathy for them forgiveness but also for oneself that there is an in a empathy for self i know i said this earlier that is very hard for most people to access perhapis not the nursesis out there listening they will be of course empathy for self but every one else i think am a all the other healthy people am or the healthy people other than nurses and not picking on nurses i have to imagine they suffer to in fact i think that is the rout of their nursisism am that empathy for self is not something that comes reflecively for most people and the here i'm noti out self love or self respect but this notion of being able to see the self as am not just deserving of love and care but actually holding that in place while in confrontation with something challenging in a way that allows more not less access to adapt ive response as to that challenge i think that is the way i i canot conceptionalize it ye ye buti me drugs offer of a grat they offer great ah great scientitic tools for atacting this question what is ege dislation and why do drugs much inates it a whant does that tell you about the brain you ni because other drugs cocane realy sing more of e a different euri transmit si a dypemaine more than seretin and the opposite is the case with emdy may it is more pinicoin flateer io absoluly pe will become hyperlinear hyper am linked to their own desires and wishes and future outcomes become an obsession it is the stuff of a kind of american pcycho and the a kind of a clechas and stereotypes of the the the adies a a cogan culture ye ye we did ta study one sat looking at didependent relationship with ego inflation on one axis and ego dissolution on the other and sardet it just massively passed or differenciated between cokane and and the psycodelics ass cuanat study cokane makes people's egos superinflader yeand sot anit ush dissolution and the opposite is the case with a wit psycodelic i isn'e no imaging to to explain our cokine does that that would be a great study yer grat i wiso aa as abaut a coming ot a gat well elsos about iccal coming ar you on g a shop in your lab yhas a ready got on if it is right to finish th thread on on why psychodelics and ego dissolution we do not some things or we have some hypotheseas an it is the the targit receptors a ceretorn into a receptor the clasic psycodelics hit i heavily expressed in what these days i to call recent brain because evolutionarily it is recent brain it is cartex that humans have more than any other species if you look at a mapping of cortical expansion from same macac or chim to human it is the very same map that you will find the two a receptors in an that is the target it is and and yet it is just easy to think that owell that could be the egoic brain and there and the classic psycdelics come in te kind of they scramble up the activity that is the intropic brain action and in terms of the start stop the boundaries an that in tropic action av spreads out the system and it does not shut it off it av spreads it out an dissolution yr and that you wuld talking about headspace as well that fits if it is if it is more capacious sir its sort of fits an the big qualifier with psyco the lectarapy that the people rightly bring up is it does not last a's the paradox of it the paradox of ego dissolution to that ego might go away during the trip and you have these profound insights about the molecular continuity and how we are all worn and interconnected and then you come down and however long later the ego comes back but maybe with a vengeance and sadly yound i things can go arig when people have not done the work pehaps have not done the intecration work and may be ego defences come back and and i and it is not it is not a pretty picture i how often do you see that in the trial said youdo what percentage youa er the out of people coming through wdo you think it end up with all worse than they they were before ate the trial it is very rare in the trials that we have done and ye but you see defences come back say you you do see people relapse that is more un a few few pushing out tolike three months plass in something treatment resistant doppression that is more the rule than the exception sadly people relapse if their histories i historyis of chronic depression then while you might give them a a window of wellness it is sadly t does not last as not to say that it does not everlast it does and and we have people who were in our first treatment resistant deppression try who are well to my knowledge to day back at work in fantastically well and but sadly the majority have have relapsed to my knowledge and need to do morse sicond o journes well they cannot because it is illegal that is being the really difficult situation that we have been up against is that we do a trial where all of a sudden is sketch of one drug becomes a medicine in the trial or at least an expr r mental medicine we give the treatment it works fantastically well gives people a remission that they have never ready had a the however long and and then detrolens in that denyed that treatment and worse still if they would t have that treatment they would be commitcing a crime it is sort of a sick jok in away but that is hat's the situation that we have been and that is a perfect segway for what i want to talk about am now which is what is the current state of legality in terps hat were the progression towards legality i'd also to touch on the rule of inless just a incoming big farmer the're lot of start up companies now trying to capitalize on these discoveries that you and others have made am you the landscape out there is very unclear to me am maybe i'll just a call out some silos as i see them and maybe we can draw some am bridges between them if they exist at the ground level not the grass rutes but at the ground level i look to laboratories yours matthew johnsons rolling griffiths i'm some laboratories at stamford a noin williams a laboratories doing studying the effects of psychodelics inhuman beings o not animal models in terms of their clinical application for the treatment of depression in erexia i now kno fivoro my all ja trama let us lump empdy a ma an thereas well i'm assuming that it al works in equivalent way at the level of kind of ware the legislatures taking things o case o labs using government money philanthropy et cetera then therere the am they sort of the therapists out there that are accessing what we believe ore clean sources of emdiamay sylicibe and elist to do this ther are duing it illegally this is in the uess or a other a western european countries cause obviously s gen a differ by country im who are administering these things sort of on the basis of what they are reading in these studies that you all are publishing but also expanding on an experimenting hippy flips and commination drugs and catamene and et cetera be let us ley' cen amen out from it ran ow because it is legal but there is that then there is the i'm i do not n't say its or recreational slash open market black market and here i want a a raise a flag to the fact that a a doctor peter ta did a terrific podcast on this recently in his own podcast the drive the fact that o fentinel lacing with ventinels now showing up in m d may and psychodelec ceter purchased on the streets of serious caution to those getting it from uncertain sources and and then you have got farma and then as an umbrella for all of this you have got the fty a and lawn forceman agencies which currently say this stuff is illegal unless it is beeng used in a clinical trial selling in or possessing it can get you charged with a crime ranging from i do not want to say cause i do not know but i'm up to felanies right years in prison oso cannot take it through our porits cannot do not get caught with it do not buy it do not sell it kind of thing where are we going from that picture of the silos i know things are in clinical trials now most people including myself a're not familiar without the ifferent phases relate to the proximity to legality culd you just cone give us the landscape and touch on how long you think it will be before the people that come through your trials could then go get a prescription for cilisivon or potentially buy it without the risk afrom a reliable source one would hope but without the risk of getting thrown in jail i'm i used to live in oaklan california my understanding and please cret me if i'm wrong folks do not trust this and tr rmation in gettin trouble man ishinding is that sillicidean is it decriminalised in ogland but that is not the same as being legal wet is going on out there we was march juas thas fifty five qad by the am but feel free to beinseust o subsideof on if well oklans of funny one ii live close to okland therar headshops in oklan am ou kno am the might be selling cannabis an and you now cannobis related paraphenelia the de selling mushrooms as well sillicide in mushroom o e fair open ye that is a fact i don i can verify tat ihont procious them but i've gone in and cannot chected out with what what is goine on here ye yer yes a you kna a the police are not going to prioratiyes am that activity the purchasing of of those mushrooms as a crime now in oklan because of the decriminalization say those headshops should not strictly be selling while they should not be selling am they will not have a license to be selling licenses do not exist a yet for that here am but a let us see whether they get shut down they probably well i do not know but there is a tes a church in i oklan that a said am say that that the selling in its part of religious rights tha they using that church model is si lupoll am a the way the native americans can use pe ote and they have more genuine am a case because there is a history there am with a tronic in tic e back on that anyway that is that is of close to where we are right now but am federally which is really the major infllection point is the eftie am an the licent seeing of psychadelics as medicines to be legally prescribed across the country cross the uassen beyond and that is close because the key ad phas sar there are different phases of clinical trials in the key one to know about his face three a pase three trials a licensing trials if that successful and typically ave to do at least two successful ones show the results to the regulators who are the eft a the medicine regulators and say is this good enough now for you to give me a license that i can sell nd and provide this medicine that we have demonstrated as a medicine an that work has been done with emdya matherapee for poshomats it stress ti sord of maps have led that work and done to face three trials i think they have already publicly announced that the second trial had results consistent with the first we know the results of the first because theyre published and they were remarkably good something sixty seven per cent remissionrates in a long term inishamme as some of those remissionrates for trama were yeurs yat is different then what you are describing for sociven were people might need on going rsing that is true ye ye but of course just phratrama in those trials my understanding is those and m you may trials we are not focused on depression yes yes pocestone on thetroma and that is something because that datser is being falled now to my knowledge as we speak and and there anticipating a decision maybe this year and with roll out happening as early as next year men that sort of best case i think could ask you when you say roll out whose ran its the appropriate a term for mdiama ha at called rolling an about twenty percent of my audience maybe fifty ont will understand that and not funny joke that i m made am who is going to roll it out is this where would one get the empdy it that the clean source of ende ama meaning not lace with ventan all not lace with matam fetamean am not undergone any chemical conversion to some other drug which can happen which extended shelfur life et cetera there are people going to go to their psychiatrice to get emdy amay and who is going to be providing it is at go be some big major farmer a this seems a serious set of issues it is and i do not have all the answers i do neither maps would be providing the costave done the work and they have set themselves up in a sense to potensially become the provide a am whether is a farmar company which is the big question at wrestling with the moymen it is very expensive to become the famer company and that they probably deserve to make the choice because they put in many years of hard work when all of thi stuff was considered raver culture party drug they were the ones that spotted the therapeutic potential they we knew there was ther repeute a potential bay on work going back men he decades but am points to them and i think that i think in my opinion they should have the agency to make those decisions yer iit is a remark such a remarkable thing that is being achieved and i i think they have done it all on fo philanthropic dinations am i think i am yes i am there there is the ai question mark in the aftie a ros o asking questions about am to to your questionn i he who can provide this because in the face three work and op until this point has been a map's training a mapster of his training and you have to do this formal a training am in order to to be a practicion within the trials but now there is a question from the fd a whether that map's training can be the training that a clinition has to have to now be a provider and when i say roll out is and offering this is a service essentially and were witd the refer or come from that is a good question that i'm not hundred per sent on the answer whether it would have to come from a psycholotrist or whether some ones an to the general physicion could do that referal but they will be going to a provider who is license and certified and will have done some training and there will be a consensi son in a what constitutes good enough training to provide there will also be some stipulations on the basic underlyine professionalism of the clinition who provides i imagine they will have to be a mental health professional i do not think they would have to necesary be a psychatrist ther could be a think a clinical psychologist for all the disings i think without question there would have to be a physician present or at least within ready access in case of an emergency yespecially with them te a ma because of the are propensity for carriac issuslya because of the enferiment privaties in what wearies unsoicide and in terms of the these trials is it in fase two fase three it is in fase three and there is soliciben teripy work being done for treatment resistant depression by a company call compass a those trials ad which are always multi siht there is always a bunch of teams or labs in a sense and geographically spread out thetare each contributing to date o tha then gets mass together and is then submitted as part of the face three tril results that is happening with compass right now is salisive interrepyfor treatment resistant depression those trils av just started and am i think the earliest estimate that i heard in er in a journalistic article was because i do not incompass would say or they would not say publicly something twenty twenty six anly six what while emdyama asas a head of soe yet's quite a few years at head and it is more of e not a certainty but it is very very strong position with emdr may where is the works only just begun with with salisiden in tums of the face three trials but then you have this other situation of however many psychodelic resechentas there are now across the globe am it was not nice to an i we had the first one in london in twenty nineteen first one in twenty nineteen is twenty twenty three now and i do not knohow many there re but i much as happened in such a small space of time am yes but sir all these different indications i've been able to tell you about an erexier and fibray mile just in terome trona do a the troal aw with a colleague of mine and you see a serf in matam phetamin usticeorder he is got a trol going on in parkinsons dosease sir and chroniclaw back pain and by pola disorder i mean a much going on i see d almost the full gammer tof psychiatric disorders am not scitophrenia to my knowledge am a being looked at there is much grand grand you a ground swell of activity am and i think these small investigate to led studies typically ther small because trials are expensive am i're going to be report in possitive results i know were wirsing and it will be yo know for a see now tleast four trials all with really positive resolves in very difficult to treat disorders and that is just us and i kneither psy much else where a diction disorders as well and i might johnsons werl coviously am michael bugan sheets all this compelling grouncs well it is really something and yet you nat the system to really make a big break through and simes a licensing is of course sli and its not confrustrate people but it it has te t ask me dont proply am how else we we revert back to what happened in the seventies where there was a lot of interest in psychodelics it is come interesting to me there was a a close juck supposition of meditation and a count of behavioral approaches to a self directed state change and psychodelics meditation can ave made it through the hatch mn theye were the some years where it was considered kind of countriculture wo magic carpet weird o stuff by western science but now imin their tens of the protens of thousands is not an overstatement of quality studies exploring how meditation can provide advantages for the mind and even for mental health am and psychodelics ar now catching up but they used to be close cousins in the in the a cultural framework but the problem was i think psychodelics were viewed as a making people crazy and a universiy professors lost their jobs for having discussions the one that you and i are having right now am and th some people went to jail but mostly mostly people either left academic institutions or lost their jobs were as now these are am some of the these studies of the sort that you are doing it that are taking place at stamford and hopkins and elsewhere are a some of the greatest magnetic pull for philanthropy for universities downers are very interested in supporting these sor ts of studies because they and their family members and people they know suffer from psychiatric illness for which am the corrent a big farmer approaches simply have not worked it is ser sort of interesting to me that what once was seen as am kind of poison is now being viewed as a apotential therapeutic a it is not just interesting i think it is it ahofly it speaks to the evolution of of the human species people seem to be coming more open minded about becoming more open minded that is yeh and yet sah ye it is sa thi much as happenings syphast and as another elements of it is it is complexifying space that is a there is critzigu there is been some bad practice in psychelictherapy boundary crossing isies that af course some scandals that is too bad is not it yt well i think to the gene therapy right it just takes one bad incident yagene therapy was on a fast track three decades ago and then a what sadly a child died in a gene therapy trial and it is shut downging therapy practically for half a decade and then it slowly started racheting up again breaging therabe broadly to find an hour in the age of yuno potential directed gene therapesin crisper an things o that sort which makes people some people crange an other people very excited if you v huntingtons in your family crisper is the most exciting technology ever because ye copotentially eliminate it from your family want going forward corse soi i just really height that we can be balance as this old plays out because it it could go similar way given the stagement given the history that people be very twitcy with with a summisolated incidents a and a and i i overgeneralize them perhaps am in a sense its shining alights on them i think is important that that has happened recently as important because it really drills home how important it is that this work be done right and and what the necessary safeguards and and at standards should be am a yo it will not be it will not be an easy rode forwards but am but let us hope we got a hope that it succeeds because corrent treatments you people talk about the matter have crisis and to your point earlier about an erecia rate it is not always actually the case when you look at the and eputimiology when you look at the datir that you see a big inflection and you kno dignosees or cases o psychiatric illness i would say it is more that the treatments have not moved they have' really progressd they have not got any better since the nineteen fifty more or less and and new drugs have been more of the same there have not been any paradine shifts and that is why i get a little impassioned when i talk about psychodelic theropean an that point that this is something different it is not a drug every day it that system 's not coing it do we really want to keep on with that system a sure you at not every one will want to trip and that will terrify some people much that they will just one to be on their lexor priwor or a non psychodelic psychodelical whatever and of course it should be allowed to have those options of course and the more options the better and but i think there is it is great value in tat really understanding what psychodelic therapy is and and and i think when you do you realize at it is ta maj o paradime challenge you many levels and and the fact that it is different my tay it is it is greatest to pal my tin well i am certainly grateful for your passion for the potential for psychodelics to be added to the array of potential treatments and i really also appreciate how much you i put it in their alongside the other treatments maybe even commination with other treatments i supposed to sayn this is the thing that is gon curate everything and yet the pation that you have for this potential paradime shift the one that really appears to be happening at the level of clenical daydon now im is important i want to extend it a voice of gratitude for that and for the work that you are doing i mean i've been outside of this field but as an earo scientists a've been paying careful attention to it really for the last five seven years or and it is abundantly clear that it is a small group of individuals who are really thinking in terms of how the system works now and what needs to be done in order to change the system for the better yourself that are really the driving force behind this a new movement or paradime shift that without question is going to lead to improvements in mental health and physical health outcome i just want to say thank you for that also thank you much for joining us to day to share this immense knowledge set about the history of psychodelics what they are what they are not i'm thei're clenical applications as seen in your laboratory an other laboratories a i'm sure people already notice as but you'r incredibly generous in terms of attribution and and also in your caution about explaining how some other results in particular on anterectsy a fibra myalga are perhaps preliminary but very exciting they are not published yet anyway i we one call them preliminary a and also for touching on mechanism that is not just about people feel better but pointiism potential underlying mechanisms and terms of connactivity changes and on and on thank you much for your time to day thank you for the work that you are doing and thank you for the work that is sure to continue we we will provide lynks to studies

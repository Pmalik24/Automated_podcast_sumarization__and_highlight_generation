meal exactly when you are hungry cou never find a bed exactly when o when to go to sleep and you proby notkon to find out what it is that you got on the road to find out in the first place and of that

hopes and no expectations fwit a fyouture and hasten the journey we bring you now this hour of radio to day d i' you be easy chicago and public rater international it is his american wife a mi were glass tit is program road trip i one busman's holiday tis washer peete loved riding the bus from city to city untill one last seven day trip thi took him off the whole deal to mel se ot how do youven say that mere se mel se can a road trip in europe save a marriage answers with one case study i three on the road natucsito at the age of ninety too commette an george burnes was still travelling all the time marga roccin brief we travelled with him what it is when being on the road has been your job for decades it for ill pall for jesus shir trick achieves what every one once when they hit the road she actually fines adventure and it is not pretty stimulus i on busman's holiday whall reagular listeners to a programey remembere dishwasher peed he travels from state to state washing dishes and publishing hizene dishwasher usuallyo only stays in one place for a few weigs and then he takes the greyhon bus to the next town litley he is ben loving in portland but he was only too happy to get back on the bus i rigt in greyhold over the last day years i fear i have retden at least a hundred thousand miles on gray hound and total about four solid munths of my life have been spent crooped up in their busses i would consider at my home away from home if only i had home what i most about greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on the bess aire ling passengers left complain about the five excruciating me long hours that takes to fly from coast coast but on the buss that same distance takes three full days to cover which is what i think is about the perfect amount of time for such a trip i unlike air plane flights no movies are shown on greyhound no had sets handed out no free magazines available no waitresses force bags of pinats on you every five minutes on the buss passengers are largely left alone with their thugts i have the theory about people who ride greyhound about how as we sit on the bust for hours and days waiting to reach our destination we travel in what i call a transitional state thinking about where were coming from and where were going to i know i do and for my talking to other people on the bss i know many others do as well ngfor example this one route i've riden lot go south through cressent city california home with tha polic an bay maxium security prison i wrote next to the sky who would been locked away for fourteen years and have just gotten out i cross the aisle from me was a teanature with the bus cut on hits way to boot camp we talked for a while but mostly we just sat and thought about the different places we were headed n then ten for a long time i'e been wanting to tapercord to stories i've heard on te buss the document this phenomenon that i've been trying to figure out t's pretty excited when this american life offered to send me on a greyhound trip with the fancy taper quarter in a seven day a mayror pass for a week i coul want to any greyhound route i chose and tast my theory about the buss i packed up a loof of pena better n jelly sandwiches and bunch of bananas and steppd on a greyhound i spent the first ten hours trolling down the coast of organ i eager to talk with the other passengers i stayed awake all night even though everyone else was sleeping it was not until we stopped for breakfast and cressent city as finally able to strike up a conversation steve was about fifty years old sported a bushy beard and wore an olive green army jacket a large woodin cruci fixtangle from his neck he said he was an itinerant preacher and that greyhound was his chapel wh i just preach in my own time not inspicitic times an usily try tovoid audiences when i do speak is that way i i reduce the possibilities of rejaction or mockery y you avoid you avoid audiences than who are you talking to well see i believe in transmission of voice or spirit can transmit three hundred sixty degrees into the world i times three hundred six d degrees and and greyhounds a conducive for for year a travelling ministre well in the fact that i do not have my own privacy i in a private vehicle y i there becomes a either intermashing or clashing of spirits on a crowded type greyhound i some times the things are more harmonious another times e the people pick and poke an a the solicit or reaction normy you preaching on the bss would con with you just talking to the person sitting next you most my preaching a is done by my solp jost speaking into the air o though without another he would bein be in there a you might be one the first yim to be inliss i s ever really listen to me or acknowledge that in in my presence steves ministery was not limited to the techings of price but also included healthy tos of praise for natural medicine canabus and opian i thought i was agreeing with him when i said that it did sa metiulus that farmasuitable companies si wes old nature back to us but steve took a fence and pulled out a ball of ambasall which he described a stixty per sent grane out call plaspensa cane which sis a cemicall a as a chemical similar to the the naturally curring cocang and a tthe person wit let it wor well it just a little topical anis thetic which is a local number and as they a they talk about two day and a things of that nature just something certaily not a sentral nervous sistem a relaxions the old biam popy which i consider more a valuable plant gis is pain reliefu sagalog just a little nep just a little net now sos that numbing your hole mouth now well it take si ik spock ten fifteen seconds it is not extually there is an immediate fack yes it is it is actually believed her not nomming and a very pless steve continued talking but it became increasingly difficult to understand what he was saying as his speech slurrd by the end of our fifteen minute talk he told me as the longest conversation he had in the last three and a half years then steve got on the north bound bus bound for portland and i continued on to san francisco a serans is co i wrot ten hours to loss angelus sitting next to an e levener old kit that did not wone o talk to me at the holly would bustation i saw a bus head o for sarantisco and figured what the hek maybe i' to get lucky on natbus si spent the next ten hours retracing my route back north sitting beside a guy who slept the wholeway i had to wonder where were all the talkers all those chatty passengers that usually te next to me and chare thei stories about where the coming from ere going to in reno i swich to a bustrut i've always been curious about the one that headed south through old mining towns down to losfagus my attempts to find out who wrote that particular bys let nowhere i approache the other half dozen passengers one by one but no one would talk to me on the bust from los fagus to flag staffarizona i asked the woman sitting next to me if i could recort our conversation for the radio she acted is nuts you want to talk to me about greyhound for the radio what wredy a station is that well explained it is jus show that is on different stations in different cities what station is it on in lass angels then she asked los angelus i'm not sure you want to recorpd me for the radio and you en even n wht station it is ye are right she scoff give me a break she alerted the other passengers around us that was trying to polse up a over on her soon ias verbally assaulted from all sides the but of everyone is jokes i put the taperquarter away and stared ot the window my enthusiasm for this trip was rapidly dwindling at a restop i slinked away from the pack of passengers who were smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing me stood off by myself maybe i'd been wrong maybe there was not anything significan on the minds of grayhoun passengers after all when the smoke break ended i reluctantly got pack on the bus on any bus there is outhly some sort of outcast the drunk ey who smelts urin were the woman babbling to herself then it downed on me wit these dorky head phones on my head the footlong microphoned in hand trying to get people to let me interview them about where they are going it was me i was the weirdoon this bus lue is since nubdia o demeins e e n mo in mor hours e s aes rin ee soe m myse meer somewheren e se eer e blusgy seo rma enonderai guess i did not have much more to say than anybody else on the buss all these years i bost et tof being some shout of harty greyhound passeger i turvia sawtos things that many people complain about but seemingly never ending rides the noying passengers the closter phobia i mean i sat next to a guy vomiting on himself in his nobig deal i saht across the ile from peo ple havinyg noisy sex in it in pother me but now on this trip greyhand was starting to get to me and bust of phoenixhes i thougt my self wedge between the window in a gua you took ap way too much on my seat i tried to sleep for the first time in days but found that it could not my whole body was sore i had shooting pains in the back o my thighes my backached i had a headache the babe in front of me cried the whole way the toddler behind me got smacked round fer not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy i's becoming increasingly closter phobic i's beginning to lose it normally i survive long bust rides by concetrating on my destination but now i did not have a destination i was not really going anywhere hog could i expect to find any one in the transitional state when i was neven in transition myself maybe this was the proble with the whole mission i had seased being a regular greyhound passenger i was an outsideer i stood in line for the bust to lust crusis new mexica trying to come down i thought i was in catrol i watched ta mother drag her kicking and crying toddler across the bustation by the kit is hair i snapped i could not take it i could not handle being constantly surrounded by many people any more i shure was in feeling at home i usually do i stat that a line for thei last crusus puss i had to get home sadly portland was still a thirty six hour ride away i the ar is on th california boarder a new pasture sat down a crost the isle from me not needing any more abuse from strangers i resisted my initial temptation a talk with her i couple miles down the road i watched her pullo polorid photo from her purse stare at it for a half minute and then tuck it back in her purse a minute later she had the photo out again and this time i snuck a peak in sw that of the photo fer sitting in the lap of a guy wearing prison carb since she had borded to bus in a prisontown i realize she had probyjus visit a jailed boy fend her husband now she had to sit on the bust for who knows how many hours and dwell upon the person she had just left at last i thought the one person iad been looking for on this whole trip somebone in transition some one who could help me prove my theory about the buss her name was lisa and she was just as suspicious with me as any othea pasture had been but she did consent to let our conversation be reported aisoan ata theconversation did not get very far she gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions ye ventually she end up asking me the majority of the questions after a couple of awkward minutes i put the microphon an tapequarter away she stared out her photograph some more while i watched the desert or fading sunlight half hour later after the buss had darken ae peuple dozed off we said tape me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandmother powers with which she could grant me any wish i desired for this service she would only charged me five dollars it my shop she said yousually i charged ten a twenty dollars for a wish she said it just that ten aa twenty dollars well five dollars for a wish seeme a bargain i started counting out the hundreds of nichols i had one in the lost paga's slot mishing but she sad it only work with a five dollar bill i did not have any fives bui did have a ten a tend will work she said i followed her instructions folding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her she squeezit in her fist and said now make a wish but she cannot tell any one what it is i made a wish then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes that these wishes were inportant too but not as important as the superimportant first wish well in my state i only had one wish i needed fulfilling i just me to stuff up for the merely important second and third wishes whis shing for better health and a new romance in the dark buss she whispered a cross the isle assuring me thati was now in better health and that i could expect a new love in my life then she asked me to tell her my superimportant wish my number one wish but she told me not to tell ame one i said you can tell me she said but do not tell any one else i told her i wished i was in writing the bust any more oh she said wer tired of writing the buss i can see it in your face that sher very tired you have a kind face she whispered about my face and described how tired i looked for five minutes then tioning three times that while i might be laughing on te outside i was really crying on ha inside but i was not laughing not even on the outside when she was done i watched her slip my ten in her pocket meanwhile i was still in the besse dhis ruter people we puting out a new issue of his zeene dishwash or in a

and you are thy ninety two your old george burns we have an i witness account that is a minute public ranny international when our progamme continues its is merican life from onour glass he took in a progrm of course we choose a theme ifitvariety of rieters and performance to tackle that thime to day's program as our nation heads out on the road for the mamornal day we can roketrip the pleasures and disappointments of life on the road we have arrived atact three of our program i three on the road in a tuxido there two ways you feel when you interview i celeverity there are those that make you feel a person then therrare the kind who make you fell a blip there is nothing wrong with a blip interview in fact it is liberating you can say whatever you want to them they will not remember you ten years ago reporter marga rochlin was sent to to a magazine's story about george burns for ninety two you road he was spending a lot of time on the road twenty five shows a year at conventions another one night gigs post we longstins an vagus in atlanic city this is the story of a road trip his business not pleasure george is on to roge ind it is entirety at that time included irving fine his then seventy seven year old mamager and morty jacobs his pianoplayer for at that time twenty three years from the started was queert markie there were kind men there were polite men they called e kid the way they called everybody kid therre muntet or lot of some of or older jewish relatives but this was a blip story nine ofclock friday night moscow idaho university in we sit around in the common living room that connects george and irving's bed rooms george an irving always get connected bedrooms with a living room and between if they can in the late afternoon when it is quiet this is where george and irving to sit they watch tellivision they read the trades right now morty's here the sun is set and its early evening in general they have three main topics of conversation the act je scetuel and where they want to eat here is some typical dialogue morty will say where shall we eat and irving will say the broiler room that is the hotell stake hous and then george will say john will know johns the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove his to the hotel and then irving will say i think we should do the broiler room and then george will say john will know ask john and then irving will say i'm making a reservation at the broiler room but not move towards the telephone and on and on and on it is dialogue that david mammot would write if tavid mammot road seeings where absolutely nothing was it stay we had done to the broiler room all through dinner there is this constant traffic of founds including at one point for cheerleaders theyre wearing george's skirts and tight swetters and their nervous energy fills the room goge george go they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do eir splits and rattled theire crape paper palmpoms then floorshow over they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine then incomes the shaft to ask for george's autograph but george burns likes these intruions he is nourish by them when it is finally quiety says to me are not people nice because i'm a reporter i'm a blip but the public gets his full attention he establishis ike contact with each approaching fan and he smiles at them and he ask how tey're doing and when he leaves te broiler room he will choose the most complicated root slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room touching people on the shoulder lightly and saying things do not pay the check while we are on the road i probably see him do his act five times each time it sounds toly spontineous he is making it up right there just riffing for the crowd even though giver take a gaggar to it is the exact same act his been doing for fifteen years re e a a e y rere what is amazing about all this is that on the surface the act does not seem to very from city to city but to george it is an eternal work in progress every night he makes microscopic changes maybe he will decide to sink young at heart before old bones when he does as he gets all works oup about it thinks about it all day long but this is how he is been able to be on the road for long this is how he keeps the acts feeling fresh for himself sometimes thi'll change upons lone he has a gagnes act about people having to retire when their seventy he says when i was seventy i have pemples but one day george tries out a new line on me he says when i was seventy i had cupid's egima i think that some sort of dirty but i'm not to be the one to tell him in fact i have tape of this of myself lying to the nicest man on earth oh you be o you is tat g atn agan a i yeas is o e o na ei ce is a no nots a po o i a e unde i you o o yo a you yi e i e lie you reg e its yl yo o yo yo yi you be having i you o o ra ye re yo o ry o o ge r o yey re trip sgeorge and urving can go on this for hours they go back and forth h and back in forest and that night george tries out the cupid's egs im a line it does not get laghs on the way home in the car were silen george in a driver in the front me in the back squeeze to hip to elbow between irving and morning suddenly george's rumbling voice cuts through the darkness i'll never do that again he says it is quiet for a while more marty he says to morrow night lets and then the conversation starts all over again aan normally when i think of going on the road i think of waking up at any hour of not having to be anywhere at a certain time hou're on a big adventure the rules no longer apply there is no account ability but that is a savigians road trip i am on a very different kind of road trip the road trip i'm on is not about adventure and unpredictability the road trip i'm on is about making ture tha everything is cessane this is the secret to george burns is longgevity of how he is been able to stay on the road for long without going crazy he wakes up at a certain time he goes to sleep at a certain time when he goes on the road he likes his driver to take him to the ariport in the late morning when he agrees to a booking its stipulated his contract that he will be provided with a back was still to sit ime a lightly rehear storicastri and astraight to flick his ashes in and a pree shows speedball made up of a couple of martinis chase by a cup of black coffee he will only smokeill productives in the afternoon he likes to tacke at to our nap he hates fresh hroot in vegetables by the end of our time to gether i could order for him an a restaurant of necessary he likes batrim cocktails he l acks rost chicken he likes his martines but does not care what brand of liquor they are made with he just wants him to come one after the other he is ninety too and no one can tell him what is goot or bath for him to put in his own mouth tsame goes for what comes out of it as the gin ofor mooth kicken his conversation tends to get naugdy one night he resides to me a particularly memorable limric that involves a mouse the phrase hickery dickery dolk and a reference to his own private parts morting irving laugh but i do not know what to do if i laugh too hard i'm scare the'reging to think i'm some sort of slet girl and if i do not then i'm a pill no fun at all i feel as if i'm in another country with different customs and morrigs and i simply try every possible reaction one after the other laughing groaning shaking my head waiting for something that works the pace is very slow i waike up in the morning drink coffee wait for irving's call mostly i have free time i lay on a variety of queenside's beds and a variety of shag carpot hotel rooms and stare up at the saling one day irving calls to invite me to talk to george as heds breakfast whats a te gen ho o o or gor i george is wearing a thick bage terry cloth bathrobe bage pjamas and slippers his stiff gray to pay is somewhere in the other room it is startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair the stacked he'ld shoes the chris tuxido he looks vulnerable bird i have this realization this will be a man who i will get to know in the moments between words even on a road trip design to avoids su prises i find myself surprised by these main my view them comes to change as we spend more time together eleven a m rino nevada balley's hotell i'm trying to keep my focus but i'm tire tired o the empty hours tired o waiting for irving to call whenever i call my boy friend his answering machine picks up finally i take the elevater to the hotel casino i play the slouht machines mindlessly pulling down the handle somehow irving shinesmen i'm playing the quarter slots i'm risking a grand total of ten dollars but he is positive that i will return home having handed over the title to my car he goes away then comes back and tells me it is time to quit he goes away then comes back fifteen minutes later and tells me again i'm annoyed it is nagging and touched to save me from financial ruin he asks me to take a walk with him irving takes my hand and loops su passed his bent elbow arm in arm we stroll past places with names the mape's hotel and the liberty bells saloon the way irving is almost bouancing down the street lets me know he is in joing that we come off a missmatched couple that i am his babe and he is my silver haired energetic sugar gettit most the time irving does the talking he tells me but his past it is a history of twentieth century show business big jobs at sebius radio in the movy studioes jack benny hired him to be the president of his production company 's a long story every once in a while though irving asked me personal questions about my family about my friends about my boy friend and then we had back to the hotel and when we get to my room he drops me out with this thought he says leave your boy friend he is no good find some one else and he alke he way and i stand there feeling conflicted i think i'm no longer a blipto irving but who does he think he is he does not know me he is never met my boy frien a couple of years later i follow his advive and every once in a while i think back trying to remember what it was that i said to him what a lowed him to distill this conclusion from my small talk how come he knew something that took long for me to figgure out all i could come up with was how transparent i must have seemed to these men transparent teen agers are to man i mean how many different human stories are there he is men had already been there finally run the road for long that george's treating me old news which is where you want to be with george when irvin lets me into george's sweet befor a show george emerge's from his room wearing shiny paten leather lowfers a crisp white shirt a bottie and he need length payely dressing gown he is pantless he does not one to put on his tuxe do slacks until the very last minute they do not lose their nice sharp crees and the pocket of these pants is a watch chain on the watch chain is grace's tiny gold wedding rin the way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one true talent when he met gracy allen and he stayed marri to her for thirty eight years he was the brains of the act the one who wrote almost every word she said but she was the one who the public loved he tells me that since her death and nineteen sixty four he visits her once a month at forestlon cemetery he can tell her what is been going on in his live but at first his

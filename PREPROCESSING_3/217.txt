a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped into days episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websiht this american life dot o work i cun before the president got coronifiris which is sending everything now and to some new and unforeseen reality tere wre certain things aby the election that is settled into predictable rhythems right the president would talk about rioters in the streets on order jo bidon would talk about domitrom's character in waist on his job when i came to the actual process of voting and the mal on ballacs ha oing to be used by record numbers of people this year the talking points lined up this the president said thet mal aballats were going to be a disaster jo bidon said they were a perfectly good way to vote the expert said the evidens backed a bidin then the president would again insist that the are disaster by would again say no the exsperts would again back him up he president again would call them a disaster around and round and around anda circle the never ended a very tedious circle but we can remove ourselves from that circle right frtal perspective good evening ot of comat for a few weeks now one of our producers ben calhoun has been caing around people who actually handle these ballats liberity is an yalling revalit if yople touch them with their hands they stack them in stacks then o yet the person you hearing this is a wendy smith she is the person who is responsible for running the election and dealing with mal in ballats in all that in a small town in my home state is a wis consit she is in nacomis which is way up norsh and i called wendy because i was wondering how this bizaare year was going for clerks her u i i had seen wendy in a newspaper story she had tattoos on both arms and thes teacher that said wh i should only one hour be happy in said that she wrote ontercycles and i just kind of thought i went a tuck to her when i originally reached out to her she was busy sending out absente ballats the peopl whohad requested them you all mind a bi work and pock at the bame time to ou no no i actually imagine that you have a lot to do right now i can an a finin in apen

got a palkin ou at a it a al my hapen pe alla re a be i hav hav nom open an gon an in the mal teday wendy told me in all her years as clerk this is definitely the most work shes ever had to do for elections an one of the reasons for that is that the legislature in the governor keep fighting over how everything should run there are also los suits in wisconsin there are all over the country about what the rules for the election should be and all the little changes to come out of that stuff can be a ton of extra work for wendy ind wisconsin at one point they changed the rule about how many days somebody has to be a resident in order to vote wendy serted scrambling to fix all that she is redoing all these envelopes and then they just change the rule back meaning that all of that scrambling in work was for nothing to thind you ent back o prop in your envelope all ta i e you lak i i a a o o a as no i'm just sorry i imagine you ii just said an image of you buying pepto bismall at cosco by the ki thye t and compared to a normal year wel how many more times work do you feel youre doing this your i'm watobt it the fult im job is this your only jo no my part pime nob wel what is your what do you do when you are not doing this i work for an insurant compan i'm to work cant pout putting over time man there buth working here oh my ga but to fine when do you whendo you sleep a case sase syous got ro changes ses got tonslects or bauage is got can drak of and they other big thing that is taking up a bunch more time is helping voters cause people will just fill things out wrong where they do not nowhere their ballat is i touch were the other day and she was telling me about this couple i got to try to locate their number their no berd am the baller went on to florta ther not there ya the ballak cat back and oing out to try to find away to reathom oh well right to i get to di through about three hundred at application to try to find there if if they have a full number when he was trying to find them which it seems something she cond id does a lot she digs up numbers for people h finds people in face book o no man i know where they live i can probably drive over there when i'me don with work and they hay what dar you want to do the clerks that iave been talking to they all ken a talk this ikthey have this down to earth sort of civic mindedness there is tis other clerk mariland pordready she is in this town call holland which is slightly bigger than necomas it is forty three hundred people and merelan pud ready spent five years in dou see where she works for congress men and than she work in the senate but she got sick of washing ton and she spent the last twenty years as the town clerk for holland i want vot the count i will not to an fran try combody and be lazy i will do everything i can' i try to find a fo number for if i cannot bin at fid ea ol if i do not have tat o fon tem a latter a fo re ot weat wor were doing everything we cand to mane sure the o com e one thing i b very fotrating om it thot tha confurita teary thatre out there and people believe on my coo in your town clerk i am not going to throw your ballan away and you can track it here is no way i can throw your ballat away how you evy tori about combuty pick com balth out of a farbig and they open the op if i om a lon whoar open e lot we putin ail ar you cannot open up the ballet teu open the ot you ot to wead a feeld an ho lection they o and we have eighteen hundred in powder cin wit con fat i not ca to lit you would geoud take eighteen hundred clerk to do the wrong bhank oe co fte ta mi me ta you back but when people cone very i tat the ho o red mi no no wit not all the clerks that i talk to and this is in republican air is and democratic air is they all seem this was sort of driving im a little nuts people getting the idea that what they do is very loosy goosee and that people are just gin ta cheat the system to them that is just outlandish because they say that there is too much security built into everything scotig what well they keep track of every request for a ballat unles you cannot leave the house you have to submit your idea to get an absenty ballat clerks put tracking in fo on the ballats and then they keep track of them when they are sent out and then coming back nd then when it comes back in it has to have a voter signature and a witness signature for verification u at the end of the whole election they will sefter report back to the state what ballots ended up ware which ones went out and came back in which one went out never came back say somebody moves a and they ask for a ballot in a new location that is also something the state tracts and i just when i say it wis consin is pretty typical for how all the stuff works i very all these details exist in this universe that does not oforgot in any way with the discussion that i see in the national media and the arguments that i heard during the presidential debate it canseemsgan a sad that that universe the national politics universe is lobbing grenades into these women's universe ye no i mean i've been at this for couple weeks and i have not found one clerk that is worried about fraud all of them are worried about the rule changes and the number of extra mail an ballats u i mean they think they can deal with that is jus lot more work but the running into these conspiracy theories alot wogoy ye no ye ye no that is what i 'm hearing maryland she s wendy she is a clerk part time aand she also gardens two acres and she sells vegetrables on the side of the highway o min i have a rot lie thin a i o e eope no i o a no co meopl o wit on u but t oman o er bin i otabo a o oe o car coi tat o e at people are gotin i o no it pretty mi a ob i wi o por t her

ben coin thins very much o siryou can to stand touch of these clerks as everything hits up in the next couple weeks i mean as long as the lanc or my calls there are many jobs this around the country some of them a part time these two women on the full time some ar pay jobs lots of volenteer or people the some timy stapen these are people who are throwing themselves into the details of some task that just needs to get done for ar country to function and doing it in the normal decent sivic minded way that you would imagine that you hope for and it is throwning to say a but we are a counctry blest with armies of people who are trying to contribute to the communities in all kinds of ways and to days programm is about to grew people that people who are as best tas we can tell trying to do coul job for all of us the trying to protect the public but in this cas too often their failing dbby be easy chicago the samerican life a mara glass stay with us o o a one clinical trial the people that a must atays pogrimmas about or doctors doctors whave agreed to sitt on pownels to judge other doctors to disciplin them or revoke their licenses when they behave badway every state has these medical boards the grand medical licenses and there the ones responsible for taking them away we heard about all this from a wale professor at vanderbelt rebecca allan's words and twhenty ateen she strartof going to medical board herings an tennessee where she lives it was reser for a book that chiplans to write about licensing boards and what she saw when she got there horrified her the mater is is cotic froper when it comes to the tennessey board of medical examiners rebecca is the one die hard fan in the stans at a townsoff ball game she knows all the board members by name she is interviewed most of them attended all their meetings in person or watch the live streame she even went to their offsight retreat last year before you went to any medichael board meetings how did you imagine they would be i thought they would be pretty boaring but eh am i think i also thought it was going to be in some sort of grand state government building i think i had the our state capital in mine or something but it is just an office park we yes te describe what it actua looklike it is a three or four story square office building ah probaly bilts in the seventes or eightis am this is nashvill there is copious parging andand some lik dunder mithlan to me all ma got look just undermiphlen it looked just nunder mlen the first meeting she went to and ob g wayan appeared before the board to request a new medical license the board had taken his old lice in the way six months before when they learned that he would had sac with eleven of his patience he dundrugs wit at leact one of them to he would also prescribed them and other people who were not his patience controld subsences codene and zannex this doctor was there to ask the medical board for a new licence all that stuff the sax the drogs had happened years before hed been to rehab wa sober now saw the error and his old ways and the board gave him a new license with some conditions attached but he could practice medicine again rebecca could not believe it thet just has to be some sins that are unfor ble in the eyes of the board the board as or regulatory body he'r not or not youre priest the not deciding weather not you have really youre realy sorry they are deciding wherethe not you are a safe provider officially the board's mission is to protect the health safety and welfare of people in the state of tenness e board members and staff rpeep that mission all the time a montra but since rebecca's been following the board shes seen a bunch of cases that ob g wi an weredoctors have done something really bad seemingly irredeemable and somehow they have managed to keep their medical licenses they are out there working his doctors in tennesse righte now this became the question of her research what was going wrong in the system why were these doctors alowed to keep work gae one case in particular became the focus of her attentien because it seemed a perfec storm of regulatory failur that is what i'm to tell you about to day it is about a doctor named michael lapaglia a'll start thistory back in twenty thirteen the paglio was working as an e ar doctor at the time and late one night police got a call about a domestic disturbance at his house when the police arrived they smelled weed and search the house they found a sha let me just read from the police officers affidavit quote a search of the residents pursuint to the search warrent revealed forty five cort size masin jars which contained mariwana hunger twenty seven glass pipes used to smoke marawana glock nineteen nine millimeter grow light with ballast timer digrel scale and leger detailing names slash amounts a'lso dis covered were approximately fifty two diaza pam twenty two emphedamene and twenty four oxy codon pills in addition thepolice found on a shelf in the paglea's office vils of sentinel morpeen and prop before which is used for general anesthesia the pagle's girl frend told police that he had threatened to use that stuff to kill her in the pedition she filled for a restraining order the next day she said quot michael told me that if i ever contacted the police for help or reported his drug us michael would use his powers as a physician to have me committed to psycheactric facility michael stated he would make tsure my body would not be found michael stated that he would take my life away i'm in fear for my life and my son's life lapaglea told police as grol friond was dilusional he was arrested and charged with two drug felonies intend to distribute a controlled substance and intend to distribute mariwana he pled no contest and went to impatient r hab he was addicted to valium at the time he lost is jop at the hospital the medical board put him on probation and he surrendered his d e a registration number which is the thing you have to have to prescribe controlled substances that is a big deal it is very hard to get a job once you have lost your d e a number no in wants a touch em nont pro no employers can take him very few employers anyway with a record that privet insurance forget it hospital forget it a'm a few years later he files for bankruptcy ah because there is there is no way to earn money back at the same clip as you are as yor physicion but he got a job i did not addiction clinic a friend of his own it was called e h c express health care lpagle would see patience a regular doctor work up a treatment plan in everything and then another doctor would write their prescriptions doctor lapaglea helped a friend of his doctor charles brooks get a job at express health care too doctor brooks was also on probation with the medical board he would had sex with a patient he says they were having an affair and at least once given her a controlled substanse he says to calm her nerves because they were aving an affair but unlike doctor lapaglia he did not lose his d e a number he could still prescribe doctor lapaglea left e eigh c and in early twenty eighteen he and doctor brooks started up a little side business he and doctor brooks kind of hatch this plan lpagle on brooks realize a c will wher's a do worgan a sort o clinic call ellen b healh care lapaglia an brooks lut lapagle does not have t a number will use brooks's lapagleas can do the work he is gon write the presriptions i's his foe number on the prescription pad that they make out but its brooks is d ea number and it is brooks is signature sometimes they were presines sometimes lapagle aforged the signatre on they sellom for three hundredollars cash oto lapagleas home at least once in undr dollars parkunat ellen b health care did not have an actual brick an morter office lapagle would see people wherever it was convenient write prescriptions for controlled substances clonipan vallium in suboxen lhen tepax game out about their operation it look they were selling prescriptions for cash drug dealers with stethis cos lapaglean brooks say that is not the case at all that they were legitimately treating people with a diction problems byke prescribing them controlled substances they something called medication as sis ted treatment bik the way methodone is used to treat heroine addictions that iswhat they said they were doing regardless it was still a legal the few months into the venture the feds bosted them charge them with drug trafficine for writing prescriptions for controlled substances without the authority to do and fraud for using books his d e a number in the scam brooks plad not kilty but doctor lapagle as signed plly deal with federal prosecutors he still waiting to be sentence but he could be facing prison time that is the federal criminal court lapaglea still had to face the tennessy medical board and when they found out about ellen b health cr they se margle suspended the doctor's medical licences andtill they could hold disciplinary herings for them the case unfolded over three hearings for march to july twenty nineteen the first one in march was the disciplinary hearing for lapagle as partner doctor brooks rebecco was there she been going to medical board meetings for year at that point and i see this guy who am is do it something that actually even i think the physicians on the board find really offensive which is giving up control of your your pad and to hand it over te somebody else is really seen as pre on aonethical am most doctors do not view their pad as as a moneymaker these medical board disciplinary hearings are technically administrative courts they run kind of the criminal and civil court systems but the question theire addressing is more pointed it is whether a doctor should be allowed to continue to practis medicen doctor lapaglia agreed to testify against doctor brookes in front of the medical boart de tin tur on that ydor i a trouber ra or that your henou the as memer as just ta set a staney the guy asking the questions is andrew coffmat he is the prosecuting attorney he works for the tennessee department of health doctor lapaglia is the one answering his questionce why you ere partner wer doctor brog do youare not was he a war that you were sidin his man wite yes what mi yu think that he was wore because some times in wt run on we tim ocritions and has to you we hastocu tak or ation and we discuss it when you went te work er weg doctor brug did you believ tah what you were doing was again the wall no doctor lepagley was yeh i think we ply cot some corners i think mistakes were made an we discuss it in we knew that what we were doing was in the ideal o because we had veri a resources he cul started bet we never imagined that we were breaking the lon his general attitude was yr air in dudgmen nadbegil has your opinen change about whether you were bringing more yes wha because tel prosecure hav con mis me eerwas i spoke with doctor lapaglia he did not want me to recort our conversation and we did not talk for long before he got off the phone but he reiterated to me that he and doctor brookes did not think they were doing anything wrong when they worked in the diction clinex the doctors there would hand prescriptions to receptionists and the receptionists would call them into a farmersy it happened all the tme he told me quot we did not see any difference between him giving me verbal authorization to call them in and verbal authorization to write the prescription they still do not see a difference and if someone had a problem with that the federal government had a problem with that they could have just told us to stop they did not have tor in ditus and charge us with two felonies i reached out to doctor lapaglia several times after that initial call but he declined my request to talk further they were three board members hearing doctor brooks's case that day and they were not suayed by this defence that they did not know they were doing anything wrong that they were just trying to help their drug sick patience in fact the board members suspect ted that elen be helfgare was not a legitimate business at all here is doctor charles hand dorf one of the board members questioning doctor lapaglia id de clenet er wer a ply

al this is in the business at all that was doctor lapaglia testifying at doctor brooks's disciplinary hearing in front of the medical board once brooks's case was adjudicated it was lapagle's turnd for discipline he and his attorney had worked out to deal with andrew coffmen the department of helsitany it is called t a consent order it is pasicaly the board's version of a plea deal it ad the next board meedan in may coffman presented this deal to the board memens the board had to decide wether to accepten the morin ater coffin with olf hi suf general cacol and here is with ta deal was hesically lapaglia could go back to practicing medicine in another mont but he would be on probation for five years and he would have to be moniter by a physiciance of diction grim and he would be band from prescribing contold ssubsancens for two years it' similar to what doctor brookscotton marce but slightly less thecause lapaglia headadmitted geals and had testified against prits it is what they call it down noa departure in t fromhinal sysem cooperating witnessis often get liter senencses it is supposed to give people in in sentive to tell the truths but the board was not having it with the steel they looked at lapagla and saw guy whose medical license was already on pribation when he used another doctor's prescription pad to write controled subsance descriptions here is doctor dohn

now doctor lapaglis case will go to trial wor the medical board version of a trial a contested case hearing were he has the possibility of getting a much heavier discipline they could suspend his licons for even longer for incens were even revoke it altogether i had tee following this case and y i wanted a full hearing i wanto the opportunity to see doctor lapagor tustify and t for a tal toon an i figured everything was lining out for them to finally throw the book at somebody rebecca had been to several of these disciplinary hearings by that she would seen many doctors get away with which he considered to be light punishments but it seem the board was finally gin to put its foot down with lapaglia n thin to cto us comming out what goes wrong when the boy gets a chance o fun y put its foot down that is a minute the jicaga publa gredea when our programm continues ts tis s mare can li from yr glass to days programm trust me ofm a doctor w storys about people tring to do sivic minded things for the r own communities and in the case of medical boards sometimes failing to a copish that job the way the lots of us wul want them to when know we are in the middle of the achivis's story and we pick up where we left off the medical board in tendesse has rejected daftor lapagle's que deal and too much after that at the next meeting the board holds a hearing for his case he said how the is hering's work there besically many trials each case gets assigned to a panel of three board members la pagle's panel was made up of two doctors and a consumer member the sit at the front of the room facing everyone else and thergan a decide if the prosecutor has prove in his case and if how to discipline doctor lapagliaer theys also an administrative lodgedge who acts as a refery more than anything else to than e ward will be con siter in the case a jus i pon a hell mirse is michael lapaglia they hold doctor lapagle is hearing in the iris rom a n which defies the interior decorator's vision age carpet age walls i farsont lights an doctor lapaglia is sitting at hi s table with his attorney facing the panel the prosecutor andrew coffman he sitting at a table to the ragi rebecca's there too in the front ro here was really weird it was weard from the first i he moment when they did opening statements the morning i may coman you for maynt tes myself earlier the prosecutor went first mister coffman and he said wer lot bat tat good batan agly this is a rare cas wo rebasically agree with tefence counsel on everythir and in an unusual tuer e not much des pou when the partis about what thers bat or whether theyr god byat wor at was just kind of a half harted prosecution i mean not pason ad minster a furious little more casural thana criminel charleson it was meant to be overserial now i tink tha we av os gin a sho the dactra palia believve that he was probiding god treatmen hepll bat acle hav me letr coffman is there to prosecute lapagla but it seems he is going pretty easy on him that twenty thirteen drug bust the one wete th cops found valian oxy codon and fedameans marawana a gan a scale o lager paralitic agents and other sentitives coffman does not say the charge was possession with intend to deliver he just says lapaglear pled to some charges that r wite that is own personal use o control fo hol an the ma o the waw an the ver next mong if i were prosecuting were i would probably us some stronger language lapagle is coming across as a guy who once struggle is the substance used disorder ut god help sobered outand then in the course of trying to help other people who suffer from dogadictions unwittingly bumbled his way into this next bit of trouble with doctor broks he tell lapagle is defence atterney also described him in his ervening statement he may be don but he is a good don he is ereas p he is respon he is done aline to help the comean i's every one in this trial was on doctor lapagli's side i asked andrew coffman why he handled the case the way he did he said basically this case was not contentious by its very nature his job was to prove the doctor lapaglia had written prescriptions for controlled substances using another doctor's prescription pat his star witness doctor paglia who had admitted repeatedly that yes he had used doctor brooks's pad to write prescriptions for controlled substances but also there is another reason why the prosecution was maybe a bit anemic in this case the department of health attorneys coffman and his colleagues were feeling frestrated when this whole thing started back in march and doctor broks's hearing doctor brooks lapagley's coconspirator coffman had asked the board to revoke doctor boks's license but the board rejected that a said it was too harsh the prosecutors went easier on lapaglia in his pleadia and then the board rejected that said it went too easy on hi there was no consistency to their lodgec coffman's paw said later at a board retreat where they discuss this case that they felt a little bit knocke down by the whole thing at lapagle is hearing coffman just presented the straight facts in the case and told the panel what their octions wore for disciplining him did not suggest a punishment they did not know what the helthaboard wanted they did not try to guess and this brings us to the single batis problem rebecca seas in the system the doctors who sit on these medical boards tit is a distinguished position to be on the tennessa board o medical examiners they have to be appointed by the governor there is a fulltime staff that supports the board attorneys administrators medical consultance and they sit in jedgment of doctors but as far as jedges go theire amateurs most of them were doctors they have lots of training a medicin and very little training in administrative law the deciders in doctor lapagley's case the three board members on his panel were julian coll she is a consumer member doctor phillis miller and ob g wyann and doctor stephen loyd doctor lloyd was the newest member of the board hed never done any of this befor in fact this was his second day on the job i did at wa a i he nat i watan no no bei aboard e not bat all e run when they were worganus put off into panels for the for the contesta case hearings now did you have any sense of what that meant or what it would look na ot what is you do

me he did have a brief orientation that morning but no special training no real prept for this basically he was just thrown in to it it doctor lapagle's hearing he kind of winged it what with his gut and he i dentified with doctor lapaglia doctor lloyd is an addiction doctor he spent two years as tennessees opioids are and also lapaglia he is in recovery from apilediction an iy yo youo er we gi a eoes e you e bider aat o ot a bat rail bo ut look ul ged bet e yone tin yo nede e ot aftec cant yat he reladed to doctor lapaglia he would also made bad decisions while in this rows of a drugadiction

ben eyou people would be yukno you bad e n i not better an an no i e gii o it for loyd le paglies tat all the rate things he said he was drawn to treating people with e dictions to bensas because that is what he was addicted to he said he took issue with the way adiction clennects were treating pations with benzo addictions that they were not giving them enough pells to taper effectively they were giving possibly two lthese words of tens addaipin an then taken off oter and what would happen after that would ak not wat agis plain a vensas it is never can happen what would at the going you

thats what us alf one aspect of these medical board hearings that is very different from a criminal trial e he cause of transparency laws and tenessee the panel members hafe to deliberate in the open

considering requiring doctor lapaglia to get board certified in addiction medicine le pagly at intorrotis lup istere's them away from it do we want to require him to a man or and if he gansin comply i rea actenly ask now because i may change my mind or something else may happen and i do not for fill that requirement i never gminds you gev occlamation the administerto jedge hastaberate gan and tell them to quit talking to each other soteser in the end here is with the panel decides fory they are going to restore doctor lapagle as medical licens which had been samarely suspended in january when the board first found out about the elenbiski as punishment they give him five years probation mak him report to the tenness e medical foundation it is a physicians substanse o bescroup and they tell him to take a few professional courses they do not prohibit him from prescribing controlled substances he still does not have a d a number technically he cannot anyuway but he could pe tition the d a to get it back they do not restrict bat either it is actually a lighter discipline than what he would have gotten from the pleaagree then the one the board through out for being too easy on him ya it was a slop on the rist doctor le pagleer was all smiles afterwards i had chatter with him at the brakes and am he was sort of saying im i'm just hopin again et my license back annot and iot the federal thing i got a deal with and for some reason they decided to insert this language of the end that says to give him a full a a pathback to full licensure and when they read that out loud doctor lepagly a winked to me oh which really surprised me it just realy surprised me ii'd i was to that just happen w has you interpret his wink i think thit he was sort of saing see i'm getting what i wanted i guess i think i went even better than he expected mt thing that might be why he wink to me i went oftorhim afterwards a talk to him and by the time i had shot with him a couple times and hhe says something i'm just glad to have my life ins off of suspension i can make some money it was a real kind of woneaty from the patient care just testimony that he had just promoted i reachd out to doctor lapagle about this but he did not get bock to me here you have got a doctor who lost his d a number when he was caught with a legal pres cription drugs and mariwana at his house and what looked very much a drug trafficing operatien he is medical license was put on probation whe then went out and broke the law again byt using another doctors d e a number to prescribe controlled substances and now here he is back on probation with the medical board still with the medical license which means he can still work as a doctor in the years that che is been going to medical board meetings rebector has watched a bunch of doctors with a gregious histories keep practicing medicin doctors who have committed health care fraud doctors who prescribed controlled substances for people who are not their patients doctors who have sec with patients one doctor prescribed large doses of o bioids and other drugs even though the patients had no medical reason for taking them prosecutors asked the board to permanently revoke his license but he was only put on probation as far as i can tell tennesss fairly typical as statistical study rank medical boards on a scale of how harsh to light their discipline was tennesse was smack in the middle of course an talking about the woarst cases the medical board ses and the board does revoke some doctor's licences since twenty seventeen they have tecan thirteen licensees away and the leven doctors have voluntarily surrendered them hat's a significant punishment as one board member explain to me a medical license is technidally a property way and it is a big deal that take some ons property from them but' something does seem to be happening where medical boards which are set up to protect the public to protect the majority of us who never think to ask whether our doctors are safe and operating in our best interests sometimes the medical boards are letting dangerous doctors continue to practise medicin on the one hand i i feel on some lavel i understand this problem cause i spent l ngstudying it i've seen all the angles i've seen how the personalityes play out in the insentives in the emotions in everything but there is also a way which i just do not get it i do not understand whe they will not just take the guises license what is the prart of vieu that understands it i think that there is a i dentification that is not as specific as oh that could be me that is still in play of just being a doctor this is ar calling we went to similar e houg similar sut's a trainings we started out walking down the same path think there is some i dntification at a kind of very high professional level lik at' starcling the wagons we are doctors and then i think there is also and d the sproy aspecialy bot for doctors but here just con of softies there just e ynofve that everybody ccan be healed and can be made better and ar sick and deserving of compassion i may not's what is let this realy ironic an max sad to me is it is in some ways this whole problemcs created by that better part of human nature o the part thats full of mercy rebec a solution to this whole thing well i think we nun to abolish licensing words to be perfecatlly onest instead of having doctors sit in judgment of other doctors and instead of having them do this as a favoured to society every few months rebecca says have full time em plolese whos job it is to regulate the industry who are trained to notice when the're being affected by the emotional sway of the defenda and but their feelings acide as much as possible a jedge wood tector loid agrees with rebecca in part he admits he did relied to lapaglia and it influenced how he thought about discipline ot tow the fact an the da me down on the te bit i tit n not dan ye has do e dot now the mot om an

it is not fair to say that is the whull reason the case won esgew the doctors look too kindly on a fellow doctor sitting before them because when considering what to do with laagly is medical license and whether he should be a practicing doctor the board members never got a full erring of his past misdeeds as soon as the hearing was over doctor lapaglia did something that made doctor loyds

charge and besides he said wile it cleargle demonstrates bag condat it is not bd conduct related to the practice of medicine lut that is not all he left dout in twhen he ten while working his n ew yard docter leaglia did something that a federal loopeal's court sed quote shocks the concience lhe police prot a young man neamed heelit is booker to the yard this sis spected booker was hid ing drogs on his body of his but to be glont toctor lapaglia asked booker to consent to erctal exami blooker was naked except for a blanket and idn handcuffs and leg chackles he said no lepaglia says booker consent to to the exami but nobody else who was in the room heard this and there is no medical record of it lepaglia tried to examine him luker clenced his muscles lapglea had him sudated bluger was still able to clen his muscles down lepagle had him medically paralyzed in dibated him and did the rectal exam he found a rock of crack lepagla testified ta booker's trial that he would done rectal examines and two other people the police had brought in to him the year aftor that there was a force time wastly gully polli aleged he got the same treat i lepgli asked him to consent to erectal exam he said no lepglia freatened to sedate him and paralze him he relented lepaglia did the rectal exam and found nothing le police charged cully with resisting arest the hospital charged in for the rectal exam but aparently nothing ever hoppened to doctor lepaglyam he was not criminally charge for the warrantless no consent rectal searches he did not even lose his job with the hospital the search is were reported to the department of health bu doctor lapagle was nottiscipline for them and in a cruel regula tory irony because he was not t isciplined there is no public record of why the board did not discipline him doctor loyd actally found out about the rectal searches from rebecca they had coffee a few weeks after doctor lepagli's hearing i may nit bringin up aboutin at na

board members on lapagli's panel all they knew s that lapaglia had been on probation with the board once before for charges related to his personal drug eus that he been treated for pilidiction and had stayed sober all these years and that he and doctor books got cat selling pres criptions using doctor brooks's d ya number bhich ause a way tidier story than the one i just told you but coffman did not talk about the rectal searches of doctor lpaglieas hearing because of the rules of evidence he told me it wouldn have been ad missible same for the details about the twenty fourteen drug charges which by the way aftor lapaglia plad no contest he was put into something called judicial diversion it is a kind of probation and eventually the case was dismissed but more importantly coffman said this was not a hearing about everything lapaglia had ever done just this one crime the frodulent prescriptions doctor loyd did not learn about the rest of it until it was too late whet no lookin

an e ot argme but dud coud not in the woard you a beticla you can har ot e baree artmen er doctor loyd says he asks a lot more questions now during these cases how to keep this from happening howto make sure the board gets a full picture of a doctor's career and passed misdeeds but fore they decide how to discipline them rebeca points to us simple an practical solution separate the disciplinary hearing into two parts have one hearing where the board hears evidence and decides of a doctoris guilty of the charges and another hearing where the doctor is disapin and at that point they can learn other information about a defendent's past both good and thathat is how criminal cutor once the jury his determined a person's guilt the judge is the one who does the senten saying and gets to hear more about the defendit this solution rebecca points out as the benefit of being readily available to the bort it is already equal under tennessey law last september the medical board members in staff had an offside retreat rebecco was there she recorded it for her notes for her book unlicensin boards and one of the things they discussed was doctor lapaglea's case what had gone wrong doctor loyd was still upset about it doctor lapaglia is a practicing doctor in tennessea rit now he does house calls for fifty dollars cash and loyd explain what he sees as the real problem with that kind of outcome with this half way descipline they gave lapaglia they have made it he cannot get a job at a hospital are a medical plenet but he canned still see pations doctor loyd said quote he can only work in a cash base practise and the most vulnerable pennesseans are the ones at risk and that is not alsome bhecause the very population that i work personally with on a daily basis i just put

welcome to the huberman lapocas science science tace to for ai'm andrew hubermen and i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens at letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your rain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probiocs to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock om slash hubermen and claim a special offer hey'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien invitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fi free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok com slash hubermen and you'l get a free element sampl pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element ella men te dot calm slash huberman to day we are going to continue our discussion about hormones and we are going to focus on how particular hormones influence are energy levels and are immune system now last episode i mention at the end that we were concluding our month on hormones but we decide to include this additional episodes this would be the fifth episode in the sequence of episodes about hormones because thereare two hormones which are vitally important for a huge number of biological functions that wewill talk about to day but that are particularly important for energy levels and your immune system this is something that i get asked about a lot rather than skip to the next general topic today we are going to talk about the hormons cortesal and epineferan also called adrenoin you do not have to have heard the previous episodes on hormones in order to understand an digest the material from to day's podcast if i mention anything related to previous episodes i promise to give a little bit of quick background to get everyone up to speed today we are going to talk about the biology of cortesal we are going to talk about the biology of epinefran as always will talk mechanism and they are going to be a lot of tools i you are somebody who struggles with stress and energy levels and balancing stress and energy levels to day's episode is going to be vital for you if you are somebody who has challenges with sleep or you are somebody who has challenges getting your energy level up throughout the day and getting your energy level down when you want to sleep to day's episode is also for you and we are going to talk about the immune system and how to enhance the function of your imune system we are lso e going to get into somefun topics relating to learning and memory and how you can leverage cortesal and epineferan in particular in order to learn faster we are going to talk about called neutropics smart drugs and how they work becaue theire several of them that tap in to the epineferan system that are not oftin discust and that you have access to we are ging to talk about how caffin can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse and we are going to talk about the biology of comfort foods and why they work well and what they are doing and in understanding that you will be able to better understand your food choices as they relate to short termin long term energy we hve a lot to cover everythng will be time stamped i wanted just remind people that we caption every episode in english end in spanish the captions take a day or two to pop up on you tobe i you are not seeing those within the first couple days please be patient with us in order to get captions that actually read a similarly to what i'm saying if we go thryour captioning service and we have them done by experts in that takes ha little if additional time meanwhile if youe have any questions as the episode evolves please write them down please put them in the comment section please subscribe to the channel if you have not already and let us get started talking about how to increase your energy and improve and increase your immunity bi levergyng the biology of cortesal and adrenoline before we dive into the biology of increasing energy and your imune system won a cover three topics that i promised i would mention from previous episodes the first one relates to intermittent fasting the second one relates to wyr stomach grumbles forgot to mention the biology of that last time the third is a powerful way to increase growth hormon which is powerful for increasing metabolism fatburning and tissue repair et cetera that does not involve a sana or rapping yourself in plastic bags and going for for a jog first intermittant fasting last episode i talked a lot about growth hormon and fhieroid harmon and i mention things sana and exercise and sleep and how they can increase levels of growth hormon within the healthy ranges and why increasing growth harmon can be very beneficial because it can burn off body fat it can improve muscle and general tissue health cartilage et cetera and we tend to lose or our levels of growth hoarmon are reduced as we age many people ast me will what about fasting everyone is been promist on the internet that intermitt in fasting leads to these big increases in growth hormon the reason i did not mention it is that i could not find a study that actually pointed to the underlying mechanism i saw lots of claims lots of podcasts lots of a degrees behind people's names sometimes biologist sometimes entirely different fields talking about this but very few studies and then i found what i would consider these study we will link to thi study turns out that fasting does increase growth hormon levels and the way that it does it is fastinating i mention in a previous podcast about hunger and timing of mules and timing of hunger that when your hungry you release a hormon in your body called grellen sometimes actually called greeland thanksfor all f yiou greelanis des or grellanisdoes that corrected my pronunciation it is both grellen or greelan either one works grellen makes you hungry when blood glue coast your blood suger is low grellen is secreted and makes you hungry and it turns out that grellen this hunger hormon actually binds to the recepter in the brain that normally binds what is called growth hormon releasing hormon believe are not the hunger hormon can act growth harmon releasing harmon and thereby stimulate growth hormon now the levels of growth hormon that fasting promotes through this grellen system are pretty substantial it is about a doubling of growth hormon levels in the waking state we know that you can release growth hormon an sleep intermitten fasting it turns out can increase growth harmon by binding grellen to the growth harmon releasing hormon recepter and it does it also during the daytime yes indeed fasting can increase growth hormon not to the supra levels that taking growth harmon would increase it or that a sana could increase it but it does seem to increase growth hormon later in to day's episode we are going to talk a lot about different patterns of fa sting and eating that can control at beneferen and we will return to specifics about how long a fast you need to fasts for two or three days or twenty three hours fortunately for people me who love to eat that is not the case we will talk specific fasting protocals later in the episode we also said wer can talk about tommy grumble when your stomach growls it is not because of fluid sifting around in their lot of people think oh it is fluid sifting round turns out that your stomach has smooth muscle that lines its sides and when you eat something or you do not every once in a while your stomach sinches off at the two ends a bag with a hose on either end caus that is essentially what your digestive system is and if there is nothing in there what happens is the muscles that line the sides of your stomach they kind of extend around the stomach in these cables those are always there and if you have food in your stomach what they do as they churn your stomach they literally turn the muscles of your stomach a tumbler to help break up the food that presumably you did not choo well enough caus you are eating too fast when you do not have any food in your stomach that churnin continues and that contraction of the muscle an the turning literally turning over of your muscles they do not flip over completely but the turning over the muscles that is what cause is the stomach growling if you do not want to be the person in the meating or sitting there at in a quiet theader whose stomach is growling cher your food better that is the simple solution and last episode i talk ta lot about housana controlled safe hyperothermia can cause huge increases in growth homeon release anywhere from three hundred to five hundred even one thousand six hundred per cent increases in growth hormone release really staggeringly high increases point out that many people do not have saunas in their yard or in their homes and they would go through some other measures to increase safely their body heat ah youn't creating a steam roum in their bath room or jogging with extra sweats on this kind of thing many of you asked about hot baths hot baths will increase growths growth hormones cuse me however the temperatures that you need in order to increase growth hormon are high enough that you run the risk of burn and really cannot make any recommendations about hot baths but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath you are going to get some growth homeone release however the sana has thits advantage of you being able to enter a hundred and seventy five degree or two hundred degree environment providedg you are not pregnant your not a young child et cetera you can do that safely and getting big increases in growth hormon the hot bath will lead to lesser increases in growth hormon we'e gongto talk a lot about temperature regulation in a future episode but as always if you are ever going to start playing with hyperothermia or hypothermia cold baths ice baths hot showers hot baths that are beyond the kind of norm of what is comfortable you have to be extremely careful ne please consult the doctor i think it is fair to say that most people would to have a lot of energy during the day if you work during the day and they their energy to taperoff at night and i think it is fair to say that most people do not enjoy being sick nobody wants to get sick in other words you wont to have energy and you want your immune system to function well to ward off infections of various kinds bacterial infections viral infections et cetera it turns out that the two hormones that dominate those processes of having enough energy and having a healthy imun system or cortisall and epinepron epinepfron is the same thing as a drenoine in the body we tend to call a drenolin adrenolin and in the brain we tend to call a drenolin epinepron and i'm sorry for that i did not create this naming system and the story behind it is uninteresting and not worth our time i will use the words a drenoline and epinepron interchangeably today cortisll is cortisall and i just one to cover a little bit about what cortial an epinefron are where they are released in the body and brain because if you can understand that you will understand better how to control them first of all cortisall is a steroid hormone much estrogen and testostron in that it is derived from collestral now that could be collestral that you eat it could be collestral that is produced by the liver as many of you probably know the relationship between dietary collestral the fats that you eat and blood collestral and liver collestral is a very controversial one it is a barbed wire topic there are people that claim that dietary collestral has zero impact on circulating collestral coming from the liver there are people who argue the exact opposite both with good data in hand i would say there are some problems for the idea that all your collestral levels are determined by dietaryantake namely that an erecics often have very high levels of collestral that their liver produces eventhough they are eating very littl and sometimes not eating at all understand that collestral is a precurser molecule meaning it is the substrate from which a lot of things testostron and estrogen are made please also understand that collestral can be made into estrogen or testostron or cortesall and that cortisall is sort of the competitive partner to estrogen and testostron what this means is no matter how much collestral your eating or you produce whether nots low er its high if you are stressed more of that collestral is going to be devoted toward creating cortisall which is indeed a streshormon however the word stressed should not stress you out because you need cortisall cortisal is vital you do not want your cortisal levels to be too low it is very important for imune system function for memory for not getting depressed you just do not want your cortizal levels to be too high and you do not want them to be elevated even to normal levels at the wrong time of day we are to talk about how to control the timing and level of your cortisall epinefron or a drenoline has also been demonized a bit we think of it as the stress hormone this thing that makes us anxious fight or flight ta we is to get chased by lines and tigers and bears and now we do not and it is thi ancient hang over that is all wrong the fact of the matter is the epinefran is your best friend when it comes to your immunity when it comes to protecting you from infection and we are going to talk about whigh and epinefran adrenolin is your best friend when it comes to remembering things and learning and activating noural plasticity we are going to talk about that as well once again it is a question of how much and how long and the specific timing of release of cortizal an epin efferon as opposed to cortis all and a drenalin being good or bad theyre terrific when they are regulated they are terrible when thei'r miss regulated and we ill give you lots of tools to regulate them better cortis all biology one o one in less than two minutes your brain makes what we call releasing hormones and in this case there is corticotropin releasing hormone c or h is made by nurons in your brain it causes the petuitary this gland that sits about an inch in front of the roof for your mouth in the baseiour brain to release c t h c t h then goes and causes your adrenols which sit above your kidneys in your lower back to release cortisal a called stress hormone but i would you to think about cortis all not as a stress hormone but as a hormon of energy it produces a situation in the brain and body whereby you want to move and whereby you do not want to rest and whereby you do not want to eat at least at first epineferon or a drenolin one o on in less than two minutes when you sense a stresser with your mind or your body senseas a stress stresser excuse me from a wound or something of that sort a signal is sent to nurons that are in the middle of your body they call the sympathetic chain ganglea the name does not necessarily matter they release nor epinefran very quickly it is almost a a sprinkler system that just hoses your body with epinefron ithat will increase heart rate will increase breathing rate in some cases will constrict your blood vessels it will also increase the size of vessels and arteries that are giving blood flow to your vital organs this is why your extremities get cold when your stressed and your heart is beating faster more that energy is being devoted toward itoward your corps you also re ease a drenaline from your adrenals in againd sit riting atop your kidnes those are a second system whereby your system gets flooded with adrenaline in pulses you get one pulse you get ten pulses will talk about ow to regulate the number of pulses end you release it from an air of your brain called locus serulius and that creates alertness in your brain if you want to learn more about the stress response and all the details of that including some protocals of how to regulate stress please see our episode about stress i go in to a lot of detail there i will touch on some of the same themes to day but i really want to cover energy and the imune system and if you are very much interested in stress purse and stress regulation please see the episode on stress ok we have cortesall and we have epineffrent and their net effect is to increase energy first of all i want to give you a tool that will help you regulate cortesall and can also help stave olf certain patterns of mental illness now of course it is notin a cure mental illness on its own but it can support healthy state of mind and can help reduce on healthy states of mind including depression the first tool is to make sure that your highest levels of cortisall are first thing in the morning when you wake up one way or another every twenty four hours you will get and increase in corisall that is non negotiable that is written into your geno that increasing cortesall is there to wake you up and to make you alert its to stimulate movement from being sleep presume ly horizontal to getting up and starting to move about your day and i've said it before but i will say it again the best way to stimulate that increasing caortisall at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking within thirty minutes or after waking get outside viewsome sunlight even if it is overcast get outside vieusom sunlight no sun glasses never look at any light bright that it coadamage your eyes but do that for two to ten minutes if it is very bright two minutes if it is not bright ten minutes do that because in the early part of the day you have the opportunity to time that cortiall release to the early part of the day which will improve this has been back by pureviewed studies it will improve your focus it will incrove improve your energy levels and it will improve your learning throughout the day it will also prevent a late shift in cortesall increase and late shifted cartesall meaning quartisall that increases around eight or nine p m is a signature feature of many depressive disorders including majour depression anxiety and that of course correlates with things insomnia et cetera that a key tool and i do not know how many of you are already doing that b ut it is vital to do now i mention sunlight even on cloudy days and thereare specific reasons for that i want ef just briefly cover the data because in the episodes on sleep i talked about brightness of light in regulating qarters all and sleep and i talked about hoat a measure lucks brightness but i was not specific enough i realize based on the questions that i've receive since that episode here' s hout works going outside and getting some sunlight requires that i also tell you how long and under what conditions i've said looking through a window is not as good it takes fifty times longer to get as much light et cetera et cetera many many questions have told me that i'm not being specific enough i'm in to give you the data and from the day to you will understand exactly how long you need to do this each day on a sunny day no cloud cover provided that the sun is not yet overhead it is somewhere low in the sky could have just cross the horizon r if you wake up a lilit later con be somewhat low in the sky basically the intensity of light the brightness is somewhere round a hundred thousand lucks lucks is just a measurement of brightness if you want to download the ap light meter that is a free ap that will allow you to do that you can hold your finger down on the loll button there and you can move it around and it will continuously give you a lucks read out it is not perfect it is not exact but it is pretty good and it is your oclossi have no relationship to light meter the company on a cloudy day it is about ten thousand lucks o c tenfold reduction but bright artificial light very bright artificial light it is somewhere around a thousand lucks and ordinary room light it is somewhere around a hundred to two hundred lucks and it has to do with how much light scatter there is even if you have a very bright bulb sitting right next you that is not going t do the job your phone will not do the job not early in the day to get the cartes all released at the appropriate time you need to get outside let us just set a couple general perameters if it is bright outside and no cloud cover that light can be indirect you doft have to be staring into the sun please do not damage your eyes we cannot regenerate those norans yet and restore vision that is lost but if you have to blank that means it is too bright it is fine to blink of course please do if you need to get outside for ten minutes or five minutes should suffice but ten minutes is sure to suffice if it is a cloudy day dense overcast you are probbling a need about thirty minutes if it is light cloud broken cloud cover its probably goin to be somewhere between ten and twenty minutes and if you cannot get outside or you are own an aerplane and it is bright overhead artificial lights or ordinary room lights it is going to take you about six hours of light and by time you reach the middle of your wakeful period it is too late you will not be able to shift your clock and your quarters all will start drifting later and later this is w iits vital to get this light on a regular basis to get that cartisal released early in the day that sets you up for optimal levels of energy it sets you up for great sleep but to days not really about sleep it is more about energy that cartis all pulse and the stress that you might feel early in the day from having a lobit extra energy that is the energy that you want in order to move about and learn and do and do various things that is a healthy level eof energy please try and get that sunlight if it is within your protocalls to do that and try and get sufficient sunlight first thing in the morning again within the first hour that is the best way to make sure that you time your cartisall appropriately now throughout the day you 're going to experience different things most of you are not spending your entire day try to optimize your health some of you might be but most of you have jobs and you have families and you have commitments life enters the picture and provides you stressers and those stressers whatever they may happen to be a difficult co worker some disappointment about something you din get the rays you expected or you din' get the vacation that you expected those will cause increases in cuartis all an epineferon this is important understand you do not have the the luxury of just having this morning cartisall mhen having it taper off you want that major cartisal early in the day but then you can expect you should expect increases in cartisal and a drenalin throughout the day based on events that are unpleasant to you for me the events that are most unpleasant to me are things traffic on emales that ask me to fill out a form for which i cannot find the link these kinds of thing stress me out ofm a human being i do not lose my cool over them but i can feel my level of alertness and con of frustration increase the normal kind of things that go astress tents up a little bit the key is these blips and cartisal an epineferan need to be brief you cannot have them often or lasting long that you are in a state of chronic cartisal elevation or chronic epin eferan elevation this system of stress was designed to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things get you frustrated and provide the opportunity to change behavior that is what they were designe to do if you find yourself getting stressed and staying stress there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode that relate to things the double in hal exhaile the called physiological si you can incorporate in anesty are a non sleep you press protocal et cetera but understand that the energy that you experience string stress that sudden increase in a lertness and attention that comes from seeing something difficult that is at healthy hormonal system in nerl system that is working and the reason it works is that cartisall when it is released into the blood stream it actually can bind to recepters in the brain it can bind receptors in the emigdola fieur centers and threatn detections centers but also areas of the brain that are involved in learning and memory and neral pl lasticity and this is what i say that noral plasticity the brains ability o change itself in response to experience is first stimulated by attension in focus and often a low level state of agitation understand that and you will not be quite troubled about the little stress increases that you experience throughout the day now there are ways to leverage stress epinefron and cortis all in ways that serve you and to do it in a deliberate way thereare also ways to do that that increase your level of stress threshold meaning they make it less likely that epinefrn and cortisall will be released i want to talk about the science of those practices cause i get asked about these practices a lot things whimhoff breathing which is also called tumo breathing things ice baths things hyh intensity interval training all of those things have utility the question is how you use them and how often you use them those tools just stress from a life event can either enhance your immunity or to plead it that is right those same practices of ice baths tumo breathing hygh intentsy interval training or training of any kind can deplete your imune system or it can improve them excuse me they can improve it meaning they can improve your mun system the key is how often you use them and when and i want ta review that now in light of the scientific literature because in doing that you can build practices into your daily or maybe every other day routine that can really help buffer you against unhealthy levels of cortis all nepineferan meaning cortis all increases that are much too great or that last much too lng epinferon increases that are much too great or that last much too long and of course we will talk about all the negatives that go along with having too much cortis all too much eponeferan for too long but you hear about those a lot you here about cushing cyndrum yu hear about obdominaphatic accumulation you hear about sleep disturbances i want to arm you with the tools first and then we can talk about the dark side and all the things that hope ful you will be able to avoid entirely or that you can get yourself out of once you have the tools in hand let us say somebody tells you something very troubling or you look at your phonand you see a tex message that is really upsetting to you that will cause an immediate increase in epinfron adrenalan in your brain and body and chances are it is going to increase your levels of cortis all as well let us say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower even if you love the cold or if you hate the cold that will cause and acquivalent increase in epinefron and cortisall we do not know the exact levels but it is probably about the same let us say you go out for high intensthe interval train you decide you'r going to run some sprints you do some repeats or you are going to do some weight lifting in the gim and you love lifting weights in the gim av yo the power lifting thing or you decide that you want to do some ot yoga or some thing that you really enjoy or you hate you are going to increase your epinefron and cartisal levels theres simply no way around this let us say you decide to sit down and you are going to do some deep breathing i'll heare about the benefits of deep breathing inhal exal in hel exail you are going to get big increases in epinefron and cuartisal the data from multibl studies support this all of those are stressers in aeroquotes now there is a way that you can cognitively reframe what those are you can tell yourself i love high intense the interval trainer i love waight training or now i personally love exercise i not crazy about the cold i do some cold exposeyur stuff now and again andwere can talk a lot about how to do that in the optimal way in an upcoming episode but getting into the cold does not feel good to me i tell myself it is good for me and i enjoy it at some point usually whone'm getting out all of those increase epinefron and guess what they increase your levels of energy and alertness if you are somebody who struggls with energy and alertness it can be beneficial provided you get clearence from your doctor to have some sort of protocol built into your day where you deliberately increase your levels of epinefron and you are levels of cartisal and i want to put the emphasis on deliberately how would you do that well it is quite easy to turn the shower cold and get into that that will wake you up and it literally wakes you up because of increases in epinefron you can do deep breathing of the sort where you inhal an exal repeatedly twenty five or thirty times maybe hold your breath for a few seconds on an exal and then repeat called wimhal for tom of typt breathing lots of a drennlin is released in your system when you do that you will have more energy afterwards it is really important understand that the body does not distinguish between a troubling text message ice tumo breathing or hig intensthe interval trainin your any other kind of exercise it is ollstress cognively reframing that and telling yourself i this i enjoy it is not going to change the way that that molecule impacts your body in brain i a chuckle because people would love to tell you that all you have to do as say oh this is good for me no what it does to tell yourself that it is good for you or that you enjoy it is it that it liberates other molecules dopom dopamin and seretonan that help buffer the epinefron responses now the way that does that i've talked about previous episodet all just mention thet dopamine is the precurse or to epinefron epinefron adrenalin is made from dopamie i cartisal is made from collesteral epinefron is made from dopamie and that is why if you tell yourself you are enjoying something and because dopamine is subjective that you can in some ways as long you are not completely lying to yourself you can get more epineferon you get more milage or more ability to push through something and you can sort of reframeent but it is not really cognivery framing the cognae part is the trigger but the it is a chemical substance that is actually occurring there it is dop amen giving you more apineferen a bigger amplitude eperonefran release and it gives you some sense of control here is a protocal that any one can use if you want to increase levels of energy if you suffer from low energy during the daytime or whenever it is that you would to be alert pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently maybe every day but maybe every third day or every fourthday maybe it is an ice bath or a cold bath maybe it is a cold shower maybe it is the siclic in inhal exhal breathing protocol i describe if that was not clear and pople is aske for a demoo not can do the whole thing right now but i'm willing to do a few rounds of this or a you cycles i should say it is inhal iw wou do that more deeply more you do that twenty five thirty times repeatedly you will start to feel warm people in the yo get commun they say your generating heat yofre not genering heat releasing a drenoline inhale ant exal inhal exale twenty five or thirty times you will feel agitated in stress that is because you are re leasing a drenolin in your body and nhat's because youre releasing nor epineferen in your brain and you will be more alert then you can follow that twenty five or thirty breath cycles with an exhal hold and hold your breath for fifteen to thirty seconds always always always do this on dry land never while driving operating heavy machinery all the standard safety protocals never near water please people have passed out and died doing this with breath holds in water there are several deaths associated with it on land it is probly safer clear with your doctor but twenty five thirty breath exhal hold twenty five thirty breaths again exhal hold twenty five thirty breaths again exhal hold and then if you you can do an inhale and hold if that is within your margins of safety if all these protocals all these activities are just equivalent they are just stress then how do weu make them good for us how do we actually benefit from them now of course the cold itself can have some health promoting effects it can increase brown fat thormagenesisam matabolism high intents the interval training or other forms of exercise of course has carty of ascular effects that can be good for us as does wait training et cetera but what we are talking about here are ways to increase energy and to teach our brain an body to teach ourselves how to regulate the stressrsponse in addition to the benefits of the actual practices what we are talking about is building a system that when you experience increases in epineferan and quartes all from life events you are able to better buff for those and we are also talking about ways hat you can increase energy over all cause that is what to day's episode is all about energy in the mun system and indeed we will talk about how you can actually leverge specific protocals to increase euremune system on demand thereis great scientific dated to support that one can do that thereis a biological mechanism that is very important if you want to do those things increase energy and yourmiun system on demand learn to buffer stress on demand in a real time and it means taking these protocals these practices whether or not it is cold water or ice bath or exercise or any of those and making one small but very powerful adjustment in how you perform them but in order to make that adjustment i cannot just tell you the adjustment i have to tell you the mechanism that if your doing it correctly or not this is really case where if you can understand a little bit of mechanism you will be far better off then just adopting protocals if you take away nothing else from this episode except what i'm about to tell you please take away the information i'm about to tell you cortisall as i mention is released from the adrinals and it can bind to recepters it can have action both in the body and in the brain in fact it can bind the cale threat detection center in the brain or one of them which is the emigdula also call the fear center it can do that because quartusall can cross the blood brain barrier can be released in the body and cross this biological barriers offence that keeps things out of the brain but cortisall has passing rights it can go through epineferon can not epineferon is polarize the shape of it is such that it cannot make it through the blood brain barrier that is one of the reasons why it is released both from the adrinals in your body en released from this brainstem area the locus serulious in your brain that is a powerful thing because what it means is that the body can en terstates of readiness and alertness while the mind remains calm that is biologically possible it is not just ha psychological trick and their ways that one can do that i'm presuming at this point that youre getting your morning light to time your cort is all increase i'm presuming that you want more energy or that you want to increase your imune system function and it is ability to combat infections of various kinds and what i'm suggesting is that you pick from the palate of exercisees that are out there or tools that are out there to increase epinefferent there lotaways to do that you can do that as i mention through cold water through exercise you can even do that by having confrontations with other people at a biological level it is identical if you to go on line and place the kind of comments that were read the kinds of things or look at the kinds of things that agitate you you can if you look at that as an opportunity i'm not suggesting you do that i'd to see people taking care of themselves and each other in much unless destructive ways frankly but the prerequisite here is getting an increase in a drenaline released from the body now the simplest way to describe how to do that would be in the contact of cold water or a breathing protocol because then i do not have to deal with the unknown life circumstances that get you triggered or i coun tellyou it gets me triggered but i'm not going to let us presume cold water let us say you decidyou can take a cold shower you get into the cold shower and if it is cold enough that will be stress will youll experience an increase in epinefferon it will increase your alertness now you using this as a practis as a tool to build you could call it resilience but the ability to stay calm in the mind while being stressed in the body epineference in the body and you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself now you can do that by teling yourself it is good for you by emphasiseing you'r exshals anything that you can do to try and stay calm despite the fact that you are in a heightened state of alertness you do this with exercise you cul do this with music prettyo much anything that will give you a really heightend state of alertness offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind what you are trying to do at a mechanistic level is to have a drenaline released from the adrenals but not have a drenaline epinefron released from the brainstemp to the same degree you are not just tryng to buff for this you are not transiy oh this is good for me that is good for me omin a grying this out you are not trying to grind it out you are trying to move through this calmly while maintaining alertness you are not trying to zown out necessarily although maybe that helps you are not trying to distract yourself what you are trying to dou is shift cognively your relationship to the somatic to the body stress response now i'm sure some of you out there are shout and yet that is exactly whatever whatever what i agree this is in many ways a self directed kind of stress and oculation but we are not talking about this as stress andoculation we are talking about this as a way to increase energy and focus and the reason is that eprineferon when released in the body has a profound effect on the immune system and when released in the brain has a profound effect on the ability to learn and remember information and to be alert and we are talking about splitting the location separating the location from which you have epineferan a drenalin released oche let us say you are doing this practice simply to wake up okey cold chower will do that exercise will do that the ability to stay calm in mind while having heighten levels of a drenalin and presumely cartes all as well in the body but the corzells can a circulate everywhere will talk lobit about corizle more in a moment you could do that through some self soothing calming way thats can be highly individual hou do iaby telling yourself you injoy it et cetera but what you needs understand is that in the immediate period following that practice your system your entire brain an body are different your body is actually primed to resist infection when you have high levels of epinperan in it for short periods of time the scientific study that explored how increasing a drenaline in the body can improve amune resistance is grounded in a well known phenomenon that increases in stress actually protect you against infection in the short term i want a look at the classic data first describe what was done and then i want to talk about the more recent study which is immediately actionable there are classic set of studies that a really based mainly on the work of somebody named bruce mccuwan who is at the rockefeller university in new york bruce passed away a few years ago but he had many decades of incredibly impactful work under his belt when he did the work that iman talk about next has been done in humans and has been done in animals and has really explored how inducing stress can enhance the function of the mune system in the short trm and when i mean short term i mean about one to four days i no ching go through all the details of the study but essentialy what they were doing was exposing subjects to some sort of infection either bacterial or viral infection and inducing stress some a double wammiright you think that may be getting a little electric for chalk or cold water exposure whor something to increase your levels of stress and adrenalane would just make the effects of the infection worse but no quite the opposite brief bouts of stress which now you should be thinking about in terms af cortis all an epineperan release were actually able to increase immune system function now that should not surprise you if you understand a little bit about how epineperan works in the body and in the brain it essentially is the signal by which the nervous system can in form ammunorgans things the spleen and other organs that make killer cells of various kinds becells in tecells to go in combat infections bacteria envirases how else would your emune system know that there was an infection your man system can recognize foreign invaders but the nervous system provides the signal the sort of alarm signal that liberates the killer cells that tells them there is a problem and to go seek out the problem to speak the duration here is really important because if stress stayed too high for too long then yes indeed stress kan hinder the imune response but for a period of about one to four days it actually can protect you by way of increasing the imune response now i can say with certainty that that effect is governed by epinefron a drenaline released from the adrenals and not from the brain because they actually explored whether r not the effect exists in the presence of what is called and a drenelectomy or removing the addrinals si shou to say without the addrenals you do not get the effect we know that that effect comes from a drenaline in the body what does that mean for you that means if you want to increase your imune system in the short term you want to increase your epineferan in the short term that is why short bouts of very intense exercise probably kno more than an hour per day provided your doing everythng else rihte sleeping in nutrition et cetera maybe even shorter bouts of intense exercise or exposure to cold water or the siclic breathing that i talked about before because they increase epineferon they will bolster the amune system and we all hear these reports every once in a while seems to be the thing that everance while they'l be an article about how coffee can improve your imune system or selina that indeed caffine can increase epineferan and dopamine to some extent but most people are drinking it chronically it is effects are probably due to increases an epineferan and probably whether or not something coffee or other forms of caffine can improve or degradyourimue system will probably depend on whether not you'r using it i in a way that it increases your drenaline as a spike that happens rarely you once every you on't two or three months you let say youhave an infection coming on yes indeed it probably what these data probably mean is that drinking som hot caffina to tea or some hot coffee even provide you do not get tehydraded from it cause you'r also drinking some water can probably improve yourmune system function by way of increasing a drenaline release but can the breathing can cold exposure can exercise the mechanism here is what is key and i keep saying that because what it means is that you do not actually have to know the specific protocol i'm not trying to say do this particular protocol you have to figure out and it should be easy to figure out what short term a drenaline increasing behav iour your willing to do on a regular basis every day or two or three times a week now you could say while i'm not sick should i be doing these things often i would say two or three times a week at a minimum if your goal is to keep your imune system tuned up and you are in the presence of a lot of children for instance which carry a lot of a bugs because theirmune sysctem is endeveloped or you work in a helfcare setting or you are simply somebody who is prone to get sick i can jou say anecdotally i guess some one now calls this anic data which i do not that hrase because it sort of a i do not want anecdotal datas it ever be a misunderstood as anything but anecdotal data anecdotally i can say that i've had instances where i've felt tat a throat tickl coming on or some sciness in infection i will do the syclic breathing that i describve before twenty five thirty breaths except whole twenty five thirty breaths except whole twenty five thirty breaths except hold than than big in hail hold and most times i did not get full blown sick but i also take other precautionary measures to get sleep et cetera whether not it was causal or whether not just correlated i do not know however there is a human study that i deflly want o point out to you because it it was published more recently than the macuan work it was published in the proceengs on the national academy of sciences for the u essay because their proceedings the national academy a science s for many other countries as well the title of the paper is voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system that the system that causes fidor flight and a c stress and causes release of a drennalin an attenuation of the anate me in response in humans this is cox ca o ex at all p n a s proceems the national cademya scincis two thousand fourteen and they corporate the ever famous wimhoff breathing wemoff breathing is much the breathing protocal that i'ave described several times now in this podcast ts also call tumo breathing other people from other cultures in communities have called it other things the naming really is not important although i do think women as a pioneer in trying to bring these practices to the general public more broadly and was involved in this study the sity was done in the netherlands it was communicated by a doctor thomas horvath that yale i mention all that a horvathas is a terrific a scientist an familiar with his work over many years here is what they did they injected people with ecolie and they had groups that either did the sorts of breathing i've been describing that increase te drenalin release although i should say i do not think you need that breathing to get a drenalin release you could do with cold exposure you could do it with other things high intens the interval training as well and what they found was that the response to the colie was quite different in the people that had a protocal in this case breathing to increase te drenalin this is a remarkable study because what they found was that the fever the vomiting t all the negative effects of ecolie many of them in some cases all of them were greatly attenuated by way of ingaging the adrenalin system this case using breathing they looked at in flammatory sideof kinds things ile six which i've mention mantimes on this podcast this or classic and flamatory seticand were reduced things ile ten which are antime flammatory were increased there were some inflammatory sat at kinds that were increased what is the point here the point is you can control your imune system by finding away that you can increase a drenaline and this runs counter to what we always here which is do not get too stressed or you will get sick learn to control a drenaline turn it on and turn it off learn to control cortisall turn it on with light in the morning try and turn it off and then when i spikes because of life events learn to turn it off learning to turn on and off a drenaline a k epineferon and learning to turn on and off cortesal afford to you the ability to turn on energy and focus and your man system that is the most important point from to day's podcast and understanding that it does not matter what protocal you use maybe it is a cup of coffee and running up a hill five or six times that will improve your mune system function if you get a drennaline in your system you can use a ice bath you can use a cold bath it really does not matter you can get into an argument but i'm not suggesting you do that it really does not matter what is important is that you are able to then shut off that response and there ways to do that we will talk about but i want to talk about some of the other benefits of epineferan and cortesall that occur because of their actions on the brain because these are many and they are powerful and they relate to energy but also the ability to learn if i havena't already convinced you that seeing light early in the day is good for time in your cortisall i should also mention that another hormone that i discuss last episode which is thieroid hormone and is critical for setting your level of metabolism is controlled in part by these circadian mechanisms and cortis all itself the short take away on this is that if you get your cortisall release early in the day it will increase your energy throughout the day it will also time your fhieroid release properly there is yet another reason why you would want to get that light exposure early in the day for me that is a non negotiable practice if i'm on a plain i'll try and get it anyway i can om i'm not shining flashlights in my eyes yet but i really try hard to get that light exposure from sunlight early in the day without fail and the firoid increase has to do with the fact that your circadean clock itself is regulated by cortisal and the circadeang clock times the release of fieroid harmon i do not wan to go too far off in that direction but the're a number of studies cawl's b at all k ll thas b e e k at all two thousand twelve if you want ta look at up on pubmed is it a great one that describes how cortes al secretion begins to rise juring sleep and peaks shortly after waking or immediately before and that times a set of nurons in the circating clock then trigger the release of the releasing and stimulating hormones for thiroid a really important mechanism and firoid will also ten to correlate with energy but mostly metabolism very important have thieroid in check now let us talk about epinepron and cort is all and learning and memory everyone has a story about being stress they can remember something you mu sit down to an exam i should have this happen once sat down to an exam and is blanked just blanked i'v it only happen ance i do not know what happened i do not thy knou a sleep deprovation but i just completely blanked and it was very hard for me to pull myself out of that ditch i did manage to do it but it was a scare experience i think most people think about istress and an inability to perform however most of the time increases in epinepron provided they are not through the roof lead to improved performance now this has been shown over and over again on memory tests on learning new information on physical performance that when blood levels of eponepron are low you do not perform very well when blood levels of eponepron are very high up to about fifteen hundred o seventeen hundred pekagrams for permill if you any one's out there os itry measuring the stuff but i doubt you are performance goes way up performance gets better when you are alert and when youare a little bdistresse absolutely shown again and again and again if you get too stresstd it is the mental side it is the eponepron in the brain that causes people to either focus on their somatic response too much they feel their sweating in their focused on their bodily responsive not focus on what it is thei're trying to do or say or perform et cetera or learn but epinefran is a neutropic it is a smart drug that we all make internally and cortis all is as well now here is the twist that does not mean that you want epinefron high juring the exam necessarily memory and learning and performance are actually favored they are enhanced by epinepran increases immediately after learning and not something that is rarely discussed the timing is vital if you learn some information you have a conversation you are trying to learn a new language and neu motor skill whatever it is that you are trying to learn the increase in epinepron that occurs just afterward is what is going to consolidate the information it is going to insure that the proper circuits and mechanisms in the brain for nero plasticity are engaged during sleep later that night or the next night which is when the real rewuiring occurs nyou might say tht's crazy why would that happen well we have to remember none of these mechanisms evolved for us to do what we want and learn what we want necessarily although they will allow us to do that we have experience this before we might have gotten up gone outside get in our car drive to work or to somebody is house you are not thinking about much at all and then all f a sudden you see an accident on the road you are alertness is primed if its appens be a particularly gory accident there is can be a lot of sensory information there allof a sudden adrenalin epinefron is released into your brain in body guess what not only will you not forget that event but you will remember everything that led up to that event which has an adaptive function because your brain and bodies primary concern is safety right this is the neurobiological explanation for maslow's hire give needs is safety first and you have heightened awareness and a lertness for everything that preceded that spikan a drenalin n end quartisall the way to think about this is if you need to learn something better if you are taking atarall or your taking a lot of coffee beforehand youre actually driving the process in the wrong direction youre increasing epineferan for learning sure but past a certain point you'r actually degrading learning in performance the time to do that is toward the end or immediately after the learning because this mechanism is not simply devoted to negative events a car crash or a trama it works to make sure that the hyppocampus that in codes memories as part of the memory incoding mechanisms is prime that it is told what you just experienced is important you are going to need that information later and i've talked many times before about yusing nonsleep dee breast and esstiar or insuring good night sleep after learning but what we are also talking about is as the learning event tapers off as your exidting that to make sure that your epinefron levels are not tapering off as well and this may be one of the reasons why the ninety minute cycle this call all tradein cycle for learning works because it takes a few minutes to get into rhythm of learning ou can maintain that alertness for about ninety minutes s no quincidence that these podcasts or typically about ninety minutes long and as you exit that ninety minutes your ston going to start to feel fatigued you are not going to be able to continue to secrete epinefrant at the same level i'm not telling you that at the end of this podcast you should give yourself a footshock or that you should jump into an ice bath although i will say if you were to increase your epineferan at the end of this episode by breathing or by way of colldshower i'm willing to bet based on numerous published studies that the memory for the information would be enhanced because of this wretch or active effect of epineferan in quartisal but simply you can remember things better if you increase your alertness ach your level of epineffrt an cortisal after immediately after something that you want to learn m reminded by people here at the huburman labpodcast that the optimal strategy therefor would be a ninety minute session of focus or learning thend immediately after cold shower or tumotiht breathing or ice bath or something of that sort may be a hard run or hit training if you cannot get access to the other things and then shower up and do it non sleep deep rest and then get a good night sleep those would be the optimal tools and the organization of tools for enhanced learning and of course you could use caffine to crime the whole process by drinking the caffine towards the tale of the learning episode which is counter intuitive at least to me i should mention since many of you use caffine and i use caffin i do drink coffee i mushroom coffee i lof a mate i drink caffine in various forms that there was a study that came out recently that is relevant to our discussion about energy and alertness and learning and the study came out just recently march twenty twenty one it is maghalas at all m a g a l h a e s and it was publish in molecular psychaetry which is a fine journal appure reujournal and the title prey much gives it away habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern of brain functional conactivity cronically drinking coffee changes brain conctivity and it does it in a number of ways but the k take aways from this study as it relates to sort of what the circuits do as it pusme just listening off a bunch of brain circuits which con a meaningless in this conversation is that people who drank coffei habitually every day had changes in their brain circuitry such that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety even when they do not injest caffi latimes we think o caffine increases your levels of anxiety and indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically but not just to caffine it does not just raise your base line of anxiety because of what circulating in your blood stream it actually increases conuctivity between the brain areas that relate to anxiety now that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it for people that have are prone to pa chronic panic attaks are anxiety tects thats not can be good some people might use caffine in healthy ways i believe i do in order to just increase over all levels of alertness although now not only am i going to start dolaying my caffine and take till two hours after i wake up for reasons i've talked about in previous episodes but i'm also going to start drinking t later in learning and focus session s as a way to enhance plasticity around those learning in focusessions not before interesting study f ofreeda on its free on line you can access the full paper on line we will put a link as well one a mention this this issue of neutropic called smart drugs which is not a topic that i particularly injoy because i do not the name out do not the idea of a neutropic because what is a smart drug well there is different kinds of smark there is creativity eithers tat switching their stragy building their stragium plimentation and most of the neutropics that are out there are just cocktails of a bunch of different things that are not tailor to the individual at all they all seem to have some cafine or some colonergic stimulation et cetera but thereis an important way to frame this in light of to day's conversation neutropics generally fall into two categories one category are neutropics that increase blood glucos these are compounds that people take that increase blood glucos an increasing blood glucos will inprove performance encan enhance learning in some situations i'm not suggesting people take these things but here is just a list of a few of thos some of them are legal some of them are gray market some of them are elegal paractams oxeracitams the eneracitams all the tams okhe elevate blood glucos that is how they work the neral effects that you hear are secondary or turciary to the fact that they just increase blood glucos we know that because if you block the blood lucos effect you block the neutropic effect oce others include and defling do not take these please amphetamine cocane those will ncrease learning in the trort carm in particular dosages but because they increase blood glucos and then of course things painful stimule or stress willing prove learning by way of increasing blood glucos now stress and epineferan that is associate with it not only improve performance juring the learning bout but as i mention before having up an effran come up afterward will increase the retension of that information in the long term and then of course is wholl category of neutropics that do not impact blood glucos that work by increasing the colonergics system activity and these are things coline lecathen fosistigmine as the prescription drug fosildital sterine ther re ways to increase energy that do not require increasing blood glucos and this is vitally important the reason we are talking about epinepran and cartes all for increasing energy an immune system function is because they are largely independent of blood glucos of course they interact with that system but we heard much growing up you need to eat for energy but the energy that we are talking about to day is ashia much more powerful one than the one that you derive from food it is we could call it neral energy it is ner transmitters that create alertness and focus and the willingness and the ability to move and the willingness and ability for immune system to move in response to intruders i think we all too often think about fo od as energy which is great because it is but there are other sources of energy that are nurl and they relate to these hormon systems cortisall an epineferon and that is what were focused on to day up until now we have been talking about increasing energy and increasing the immun system by way of cortisall an epineferan but i'd be totally remiss if i did not cover how cortisall an epineferan if chronically elevated or if elevated too high can have a lot of detrimental effects these are the things we normally hereabout i'm going to describe some of those things but i'm also going to talk about ways to ameliorate them ways that you can adjust the cortis all levels even if your stressed ways that you can adjust epineferan levels even if your stressed that they have less of a negative impact i do not have to list off all the ways that stress is terrible and hronic strss is terrible i think insomnia your imune system over time will get battered and you will not be able to fight infection offis well might you do not want to bee stressed for too long you can start laying down this or classic pattern of cortisall induced body fact in fact there is a whole literature related to comfort foods and why we want to consume comfort foods under conditions of chronic stress and it is quite interesting actuall because it reveals something about the biology of chronic stress that is in formitive for how to prevent it or to down regulate chronic stress once its occurred tet's talk for a singng about comfort foods and the work that iam going to refer to is work that was done by a very impressive scientists by the name of merry dalman her work goes back decades she was at universily california san francisco and she ask this question that on the face of it seems kind of obvious but for which there was no mechanism known until marry and her lab personal came along the questona as why do we seek high fat and or high sugar foods when we are stressed for a while why would that be and the reason is that the call gluccucorticoids of which cortis allis a gluccocordicoid it is causes we have mention before by releasing hormons from the brain an i c t h from the pretuitary et cetera but normally high levels of glucocorticoid shut off the releasing hormons in the brain and in the patuitery they shut down in a calle negative feed back loup just if testostron or estrogen get too high that is red out or that is seen to speak by nurons in the patuitarian brain and then we shut down are production of estergen and testostron if cortis all levels get too high there is too much cortisal floating round our blood stream there is a negative feedback loup and the brain in petuitary shut down se or h and a c t h which would otherwise stimulate mor cortisal crtisall levels go down it is a beautiful negative fee back loop chronic stress however stress that last more than fore to seven days and there is a way to think about what chronic tress really is in anactionable way causes changes in the feed back loop between the adrinals and the brain and the petuitary such that now the brain in the patuitary respond to high levels of glucocorticorts cortesal by releasing more of them it becomes a positive fee back loop and that is bad it actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation and transcription and translation and you really do not want chronic stress because it is a cascade of stress equals more stress equals more stress this whi its very important to learn to turn off the stress response you do not want it elevated for too long there is one study that dolminer collegues did where they stimulate chronic stress by increasing cortical steron but cortisall and they found that subjects wouldin increase their consumption of sugar and fat in fact they would even eat lard it would just its sounds disgusting but they were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar and that leds all sorts of things tytu diabetes led to disfunction in the adrenal output et cetera and the real key is to learn to shut off the stress response because the interesting thing is is that dalminan colleagues and some studies that followed up on their work found that if the system was kicked into motion for too long thend there was a tremendous shift over all towards anxiety because it turns out that body fat itself receives nurl enervation it receive nurons actually talk to body fatson now you have body fat releasing certain hormons you have got the adrenals releasing cort cortisall and all of that is feeding back to the brain to make you want more sugar and fatty foods that is how the call comfort foods work and you should a watch yourself next time you experience stress if it is a short term bout of tress typically it blocks hunger if it is a longer bowed of stress typically it triggers hunger in particular for these call comfort food sugary and fatty foods and it is kind of interesting how short term stress can actually block hunger it does that by active ating or interacting with a system called the bombeisin system bombisin is a peptied hormon a it was actually a i think was named after some sort of reptile somes it or are amphibianscuse me some sort of toad i think it wis initially a sequence from the toad before it was later discovered in humans and i think the toads latin name is a bombina bombina or something of that sort and they decide to call this thing bombeisin but it reduces eating and stress liberates bombeesin and makes you want to eat less but chronic stress causes all these positive feeback changes which are not positive their positive i'm calling the posit because they amplify the stress response over and over not because they are good for you short term stress great long term stress really really bad other bad effects of stress that we can talk about and i will not list off too many more of these because many of them you heareabout them you really want to know how to control them i 'm guessing is that yes indeed stress can make you go gray the rates at which people go gray meaning gray hair some cases great body hair is well depend on some genetic factors there is actually the their couple ways that we can go gray the there is actually a stemsell what they call niche in every pholical see of stemsells in the folical that can produce more and more of the given haircell and their actually paroxide groups yeu know we hereabout bleaching hair with proxite leas and the eighties ell as a thing but you can use hydrogen proxite to bleach things and you can produce your own proxide in the herpholical that will cause the hairs to go gray in addition pigmentation of hair just pigmentation of skin is controlled by malanacites our old friends the malanacites and i say old friends cause on previous episodes i talked about why sunlight in getting ample sunlight can increase levels of certain things malanacite stimulating hormone which reduce hunger it can improve testostrone an estrogen levels and all the reasons for that well turns out that activation of the called sympathetic nervous system which is really just another name for the system that liberates a drenaline from the adrenals and epineperan in the brain drives depletion of malanacites in hair stemsells indeed there is a rade of aging that we will undergo based on our genetics but stress will make us go gray and the paper that you should look to if you want to read more about this came out very recently this is zangat all z h a n g at all nature fabulous journal difflly one thet apex journals twenty twenty this paper show that the activation of stress in various forms will depleet these malanacite stemsells you do not have to worry about an ice bath or hard exercise or breathing increasing your levels of stress to the point where its can to make you go gray were talking again about chronic stress and if you want o offset the stress effects on graying of hair you can do that by either having a practice that helps you regulate stress on a consistent basis of something nonsleep de breast or meditation you can get access to macages or vacations those are great but having a practice to keep stress clamped that it is not chronically elevated that will be great as well this is another case where sunlight we know stimulates malanacites not just in skin but in hair and getting ample sunlight having a practice to regulate stress will offset the stressed induced grang of hairs by way of stress induced depletion of milana sihtes and if milanasit sounds lot melinan youre right that is because anything involved with pigmentation in the brain and body generally has meleno of in the front of the word an some way or another if chronic stress is bad because of its effects on epinapran and cortis all being elevated for too long then the question becomes of course well what is chronic stress how do i know the difference between chronic and acecute stress and how do i keep chronic stress at bay because of all these negative effects a i am even list out the number of other ones the effects on depression of which certainly has a corlet with elevated cortis all thiroid harmon sociate low thiroid harmonas associated with depression mistimed thiroid once again getting your light and your feeding and your exercise and your sleep on a consistent schedule or consistent ish is going to be the most powerful thing you can do in order to buff for yourself against negative effects on mental health and physical health for that matter there are things that one can take supplements prescription drugs et cetera some of you out there may have or may know people to have cushings which is chronically elevated cortisall their prescription drugs that we will talk about that can be used but most people are dealing with a situation where life get stressful than less tressful stressful than less tressful i would say based on the data from mccuan and others bopsapolskis lab over many years i would say any stress that last more than a day or two days or three days as starting to become chronic stress thres really no strict cut off because we are not measuring everybody's cortis all for moment a moment my lab has done experiments where we measure stressind people over time people very tremendously in their ability to have a really hard day and then fall deeply asleep that is cgon to be the ultimate reset is the ability to sleep well more or less undisturbed each night although one or two wake upsturing the night probably not can be too detrimental provided the're not too long and you are not viewing light in during those wake ups or your phone but the things that you can take if you feel your chronically stressed in your vering toward some of the negativeffects of stress are many there are some simple things that people can do in terms of supplementation all supplements of course have to be checked out for their safety margins for you because it cs an diffrent from person a person you are responsible for making sure their safe for you if you deci to use them one of the most common ones is ashugonda and it has a powerful anxiliotic ant anxiety effect youre welcome to go to exan mandot calm and for zero cost you can see their called human effect matrics asheaganda has many uses it is been used to enhance power output in athletes it has been shown to modestly increase testastron it has been shown to modestly adjust things low densy approaching colestrall the called bag collestrall in quotes it has a profound effect on anxiety that is been shown in nine studies nine pure reviewed independent studies mean funded by organizations that have no vested interest in the answer it has a very strong effect on cartisall itself howstrong the decreasing cortisall noed in humans is fourteen point five to twenty seven point nine per cent reduction in otherwise healthy but stressed humans that is griat six studies that is and it mentions this thi significantly larger than many other supplements now some people will say that taking ashuaganda chronically may not be good if you have heard about that or you can point to specific studies that indicate exactly why it is not good a please put in the comment section or let me know in the commen section on you too would be best the studies iam referring to did explorer both genders the number o subjects was reasonably high sixty four or more a one to six months studies to these were long term studies that is great you to see that not just in an acute study males and females lots of different ages aweight excuse me overweight and non over weight am they did blood draws of cuartesall which is going and as well as saliva testsaliva's actually the best way to measure free cartisall els a measure it from er wax turns out which sounds pre gross am and kind of is but none the less a that is where cortisall will accumulate in er wax and in saliva the free quartisall a but that is six very quality studies independently supported that all point to thes very significant iu o fourteen point five to twenty seven point nine percent reductions in otherwise healthy adult if you are somebody who is dealing with chronic tress is te stressful period in your life and you want a stave off the negative effects of stress well then ashewaganda may an one a highlight may be right for you it also does tend to lower total cartisall which is interesting a can lower depression to a somewhat minimal degree and can lower as i mention before things a lodensi lipe eroproting o that i think ashwaganda comes through is kind of the the heavy hitter in this department now what is interesting also is the other effects of ascheaganda that are downstream of reducing chronic stress and quartis all case cortisall has many effects tef receptors for quartisal all over the body and brain and saw just licites off quickly i'm not gonto listoff each study or talk about how many subjects in detail again you can go to examined ot calm if you wantin just put in aschuagonda see reactive proacing which is a marker of all sorts of negative health a effects cardvascular health even macular degeneration is notably redused heart palpitations notably reduced cyrum t three and t for our old friends thiroid hormons from a previous episode are increased symptoms of oc d decreased both the obsessions and the compulsions right obsessions ar o the mine compulsions are of behavior there are lot of things that are down stream of redusing cartesall lowered heart rate lowered rates of insomnia slightly improved memory why that would be i do not know because cortisall the short term can increase memory on guessing its from increase sleep decrease pain increase quality oo redecrease reaction times things of that sort the list goes on and on but all of those things stem down stream of decrease cortisall if one word to decide to take ashuaganda in order to reduse cartisall given that you want cortes all early in the day to have energy throughout the day the time to take it as probably later in the day or in the evening i've never heard of it preventing sleep or causing in somni of any kind that certainly was enlisted as one of the major effects on examined ot kalm i will take aschuaganda from time to time if i'm chronically strastr if i'm not sleeping as well as i ought to you might think that with all my knowledge about sleep and sleep protocals at i would sleep perfectly every night but unfortunately have a dog that has a of canine form of of sundowners of dimenshasof hes up much of the night these days a an there is no way im getting a solid night of sleep lately and i will supplement with aschuaganda antipically i'll take it before sleep and may be also with my last meal of the day which is at least two hours before i go to sleep again you have to decide if it is right for you the dosages can vary tremendously i w just go by whats off awhat is on the bottle from a reputable brand i would also check out a examined ot com because it mentions a range of dosteges that people have used an in various studies to different effects now there is something out there that some of you may actually be taking or ingesting that can increase cartesall and not incidentally can decrease esterogen and teststron because remember cortesall is made from the colastro molecule is estrogen and testostron ar estrogen and testostronescuse me and it is competitive you are either making more cortisall are youare making more of this exstoried harmons esterogen and testastrone believe it ore not licerish which i ways thought of as a candy but licerish contains a substance that i cannot pronounce g el wi se why r r h izeien glike cerhisn a which is a of the glabora species of plant actually because of its chemistry this eighteen bata hydroxy seritic acid you do not ly nean to know all that liquorish black liqurish contains a substance that increases qartisall and it is increases not huge but is it is significant this has been looked at in females age eighteen to twenty nine males and females age eighteen to twenty nine people age thirt these are separate studies where umlisting off the twren ages ages thirty to sixty four turns out that you can see pretty substantial increases in serum cartisall and decreases in testostron an estrogen that was complete news to me also increases in blood pressure that ire pretty substantial that is going to be downstream of quartis all increasing cors als increase blood pressure in order to ingage the stress response par this stress repone increased hormones of other kinds as better associated with stressa who knew i did not know maybe you knew a previously if you did forgive me but liquorish and some of the compounds in black liquorish can actually increase stress probably not the thing to be injesting during periods of chronic stress whether not any one has had posive effects of using it to increase cartisall in other contects let me know but very interesting that the temistry af liqurish increases stress hormones and therefore you would probably want to almost certainly we want to avoid it in conditions of chronic stress also if you tryn t optimize tostostrone and estrogen liquorings a bad ideail i suppose one instance where you might want to use liquorish would be if your traveling in your trying to wake up at a particular location because liquorish has these effects on qartisall and qartisal is associated with the waking phenomenon an alertness and energy you could use it in that regard however i would be careful the time it tha you are not getting two quartisall increases throughout the day two peaks you are going to want to make sure that you are doing all the other things correct for jet lag and adjusting to jet lag and if you want to know what those things are including timing your feeding using temperature using exercise using light to a just od jet lag more quickly please see the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work where i cover all those protecalls in detail the other compound that i thing deserves attention is apigenan a p i g e n i n apigenan which is what is found in cemomile apigenan i've talked about previously it has various effects one is it is a mild anti estrogen that is been shown in various studies and it does have a bit of an anxiliotic effect of reducing anxiety i take it before bedtime fifty miligrams again you have to decide or figure out if that safe for you ere not im not suggesting you take it the major source of action is to calm the nervous system and it does that primarily by adjusting things gaba and chlori channels but also has a mild effect an reducing quartusall a shoganda and apigenan together sort of a i would consider the most poten commercial compounds that are in supplement non prescription form that one could use if they were interested in reducing cronic stress especially late in the day by way of reducing quartisall late in the day se are probably getting the impression that cortisal an eponepran are bit of a double edge sord you want them elevated but not for too long or too much you do not want them up for days and ays and days but you do want to have a practice in order to increase them in the short term we should talk about protocals that can set a foundation of of cartisall an epineperan that is headed towards optimal optimization is always going to be a series of regular practices that you do every day sleeping at certain times light it specific times food at specific time certain foods et cetera and that is highly individual but there are some universals and we have covered a number of those in the discussion to day meal timing meal schedules has a profound effect on energy levels and as i mention before the energy referring to is not glucos energy it is not burning carbes while running or keytones what ofm time tat is nurl energy epinepraon and cuartisal fasting and timing one's eating are two sides of the same coin even if you are on a and of standard three meal a day with a couple snacks an between diet or nutrician regimen you are fasting whenever youare sleep er you are not ingesting any calories sunless you are hooked up to an ivie of glucos you are fasting while your sleeping there are several different kinds of fasting that can relate to epineferon and cartisal i will do an entire episode on optimizing food in take for performance in the sports contect that is coming up but in the meantime it lect you just talk about fasting as a source of epineferan any time when our blood glucos is low cortis al an epin epron are going to go up if we fast for too long that is stress there is no way round that now that does not mean it does not have other beneficial effects running a marithon is stress but it can also have pousive effects if that is your thing stress has been demonized as a term but we want to think about stress mecinistically as epinefron and cartisal and then if we do that we can think about how to regulate its timing any time we have nan eaten for for to six hours levels of epin epron an quartisall argon to go up pretty substantially there is an exception to that which is if you are used to eating on the clock every two hours are every hour being half hour late or bein even ten minutes late on that schadule will induce stress most oftat psychological stress but also the release of things grellen that are gon to make you hungry cause they are on that eating clock one thing that many people do to great benefit is they follow a called circatine eating schedul they eat only when the sun is up they stop when the sun is down more or less the other way thing about this is they stop eating a couple hours before sleep and they eat more or less upon waking assuming that their waking out more or less around the time the sunrises may be plus erminus two hours o cats a sare of typical scadul now let say you decide to do what i do which as i skip breakfast i drink water i delay my cafine for niney minutes to two hours and then i drink my cafine and then my first meal is typically around lunch time eleven thirty or twelve and yes occasionally i throw backs om almons or walnuts or something earlier in the day i that i do do that from time to time am if i get hungry enough or if i just happen to see them i'm kind of a drive by eater if i see blueberries or nots or something i just gont of pick him up and putting in my mouth i try not do that off other people's plates but i just have that habit of doing that from time to time but typically i do not eat until about noon i've got a cartis all increase i've got my sunlight in the mornings im getting a big pulse and energy early in the day and yes there is a lobit of agitation i am hungry sometimes early in the day sometimes know but my grillan system is used to kicking in right around noon at the point where i eat as long as i do not eat carbohydrate in my case i know that my epinefran levels are going to stay pretty high for me it is usually meat and salid or something of that sort or fishing salad i do not paricularly eating fish because of the taste but i'm a seshally low carbor keeto ish throughout the day i'm probably in a slightly elevated state of epinfrt an quartis all throughout the day some of you are fasting even longer you are pushing out till four p m or eight p m or may be yoar even fasting around the clock any time youare fasting youare increasing epinefrn and qartis all release you can do all the meditation in the world to keep your mind calm but you are closer to that edge of stress and you are closer to that edge of peaks stress that is something that just important understand the description about comfort foods and cartis all was one of kind of an extreme case where cartis all systems kick over to positive ye back loup but we all eat to suppress cartis all an epin eferon when we are hungry coris all nepinefran creat in agitation we go seek food when we injest food the typically if it includes carbohydrate there is a blunting of quartis all theres a blunting of apineffron in the blood stream if you have ever had too much coffee to drink and you go and have a couple pieces of bread you will feel the the we might describe it as the kcafin getting soaked up at o your system but what you are doing as youre elevating blood glucos which is more or less saturating the effect of cafin in your system not completely but it is going to have that effect if youre very stresting you sit down to eats one thng it will call you down yes because some of the blood that goes to your stomach but more because these effects in bluntind quartis all in epin efferon the important point here is that if you want to be alert you can do that by way of not eating of course please injest fluids i know some people water fast out there i am yet to see good science on water fasting and wy that can stimulate stem sells or people love the idea of after the noble prize was given for autophagy in the es idea that our sells clean up debris in centicen sells yes that is true but the itin that a water fasting is goin to promote that i find rather amusing please send me the data if of some great study in a decent journal but pretty much this is something i hereabout i do not think water fasting is a good idea norsh ou be drinking much water on that you kill yourself unactually drink enough water that you o that you die i think in jesting water in healthy amounts is a good thing stay hydrated but if you want to be alert stay hidrated caffin mayor may not be in your regiment but fasting will make sure that your levels of energy are up and you will be primed very well for doing a protocal of the sort that we talked about earlier in this episode of breathing or cold exposure or exercise to get that increase in the immune system function and if you do that after learning after trying to learn something it will increase learning for that particular set of information whether no its motor or language or whatever t happens to be mathematics programming fasting is a tool for many reasons can increase growth hormone et cetera but to day i'm talking about fasting is a tool to bias your system toward more epineferan a drenaline release and toward more cortis all release but still low enough that it is not chronic stress that it is not causing negative health effects but please no that if life is very very stressful if your experiencing lots of stressers and your chronically fasting you are positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood of being chronically stressed in the ways that are negative negative effects on the reproductive axis lower testostron an esteran negative effects on i you are ging to your heiralturn grey there is reasons for that you are sleep will suffer youre imune system will suffer i think while it is new aunts our discussion to day about epineferan and cortis all increasing energy and immunity are designed to help you understand when you should be doing certain things when you should throutle back when you might want to kick up your adrenal in a bit if your suffering from low energy because you are just kind of feeling down and a little bit a under activated will then the practices of ice baths and intende breathing et cetera could be very beneficial migh fasting but if your feeling exhausted and burnt out drainedan strest will then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure or doing a lot of intense exercise is driving you further and further into chronic tress because i do not have a saliva test or a blood test ar god forbidden your ax test to measure your cortis all as were engaging in this discussion together you hafe to gauge for yourself whether not you are in a state of underactivated and need more epinefforting cortis all or whether r not you are over activated in terms of cortis all an epanepran and you need ways to buffer those ashuagona a maybe it should be a warm mellobath not an ice bath one has to learn how to regulate these hormones with behavior with nutritcion perhaps wit supplementation and then of course there are prescription drugs and i i always leave these to the end because a i'm not a medical doctor i'm not prescribing anything i'm a professor on professing a number of things that you can decide for yourselves what to do with or not but of course there are prescription drugs that can increase cortis all or decrease cortisall in cases cushing cendrum which if you have that dignose you should talk to a physician you should talk ideally to a and a chronologist but to a physician of some sort board certified physicion there are drugs that can be used to treat injury cortica sterones that you can inject to reduce inflammation injury but they are cortis all they are gen abise you towards more stress in other domains remember courts all concruss the cross the blood brainberrers who can be more prone to psychological stress i also want o mention again that i think there is great benefit to having a practice that perhaps you do every other day but if you cannot may be every thorday or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind that you learn to separate the brain body experience we hear much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body that we are all out of touch with our brain and bodies i i i particularly dislike claims that or statements that because there is great power as we learn today in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus cold water or even psychological stress but learning to stay calm in your mind i shouldjust remind you that most of the negative effects on your life and on the lives of others are due to people perhaps you i hope not being unable to regulate their mind when they have high levels of drenaline in their body either because they read something un attext or a comment section course that never happens to me but it may happen to you of course it happens to me but the ideas to stay calm in your mind that then you can regulate your action right and i think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost right you could find any number of ways to increase youre adrenalin and stay calm and we tend to focus on things exercise as the way that we get our energy up but to day again i'm talking about deliberately increasing a drenaline whilst sting calm mentally because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events through things that we did not seek out the ebility to regulate a drenaling cortsall is about in ducsing them deliberately when you want to push back on infection potential infaction from back turior viruses it is about pullin ng back on a drennaline in cortisall maybe through the use of supplementation but certainly through proper use of light and sleep and mental tools tht we talked about as well when they are chronically elevated it is about training your system not just to be unified tot brain and body which sounds great until your stress and then that is terrible it is really about having a deliberate dissociation between the adrenalin response from the adrinals in the drenaline response from the braincetem once again we have covered a ton of material i hope right now your thinking oqe am i in a state of chronic stress and i underactivated ort could i afford to increase my levels of a drennaling cortisall to improve my relationship to my imune system and to energy nurl energy if you the information and that you heard today and you want to remember it well then at the and of this episode perhaps you go do something to increase your level of adrennaline and now what some of those things are because it will help you retain the information or you could apply that to anything else that you learn or experience of course and i hope that you will think about some of the ways in which court is all and adrennalane are not good or bad that stresses in good or bad but short term stress is healthy alertness and energy is healthy even if it puts you at the edge of agitation that is an opportunity to learn how to control these hormones better and i hope that if your in a state of chronic stress that you will do things to start tamping down some of that stress and that you realize that your nervous system in your hormone system are linked but there linked in ways that you con control that we do not have to be slaves to our hormones and certainly not the hormones that cause us stress we can learn to control those both to the benefit of our body

various protocals related to those supplements thank you for joining me for what i hope was an informative discussion and an actionable discussion about how to increase energy and the immune system by way of cordezal and a drennalin epinefferon i really appreciate your willingness to learn new topics as well as to embrace and think about new tools and whetherare not their right for you and as always thank you for your interesenc

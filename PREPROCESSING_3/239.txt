her there mony i rehere if you heard our show last week that i had just learned hours before we broud cast at episode that i needed to go into quarantine ibecause guy who i had chicken hands with five days before that developed sometimes and then tested positive for coroniirus it is now twelve days since i shook hands with that guyd and i've not developed symptoms seeto see god lind say that it can hapem fup to fourteen days i am nearly in the clear reminded at everybody that people who do not have semptoms can sto be carrying the virus and give it others anyway the world has changed a much right one of the striking things about this coronipirus is how differently it effects different people some people who get it have no symptoms or the get mild symptoms or they experience something a bad fle that is particularly young and healthy people though young healthy adults are not immu the c d see a put out a report this week may be saw this saying twenty per cent ha hospitalives covi nineteen patients or between twenty and forty four years old but it is older people as we do not know who are living in a completely different world these days if they leave their homes the walking round i a world that suddenly filled with this invisible thing that can kill them with no idea of who around them might have it or what dornabit myght beyon hate of our producers to be cast about talk to this woman tova rothman whos seventy one her husband seventy four and has compromised to mun system he is in special danger if he comes into contact with the pirus here istapd i talk to tover last week and which feels long ago i do not think i would do this now but we met in person to talk she lives in my town in this apartment across from the peate of place the little movy theatre the king's supermarket her daughter told me she was eager to talk to some one for her safety i checked my temperature before i left the house washed my hands twice and wipe down my microphone weven that is no guarantee again i would not do this now she came down from a repartment carring herself on and a canister of chlorax's wipes i mmy i'll do the interview on a park bench if she is little off mike sometimes it is becase i'm sitting as far away from her as possible holding my arms straight out with the microphne every move she makes sraight now requires some impossible calculatien sh hast to avoid anything that might get her or her husband's sick horry feeling in general ah overwhelmed but i i feel if that i can master this i went to king's across the street i just try to stay away from people they have them restolking and restocking and they actually have better fruit and fresher fruit now but you nots fus togen between six six feet of o people and melennials e're all marching in marching around fying things an you we do not come near me i i must look im crazy but that that is the way goes this town is a very young town andso they's a lot of young people and lot of kid scape boarding and they are in your face and you they away but they do not they do not underunderstand that theu said anything anybody now wearing my plestic gloves than carrying my my caniser clorac ah i think they understand wen't come i that is e funny her husband because if is a mune system is stuck in the apartment my husband it is not well he cannot go out and he is not happy about it there is tevee of course cannot but annoyingly no sports to watch as everything's been cantli the other night he had gunsmoke on which is really not to this thing w e were not having ah a great relation with with this i i told him that i was checking on him and he should not get out of his chair and any very nastily said o kay i will not get out does he say i want to go out side and you say we can yei he will say i want to do something and i you cannot i would take him downstairs and he could go out and get air in his face that is but this many surfaces between our apartment and an the lobby and it is only one floor but this thi much after worry about it is ta sereal thing you just yo think what every every morning you wake up in think i cannot believe this is it real it is real toves says her grandfather died from the spanish fu nineteen eighte he he went to the opera they use to get tickets where they could stand and pay a lot lessand he went to the opera and he was in a crowd and he got he was sick one day and mi died then the next is twenty six i keep thinking about how differently everyone might do this thing i different our country's response miht have been if the virus were as dangerous for young rewe would have reacted fester because oh thit soh it is only the old people that is that is i feel it was not quiet as tragici's it is the old people my friends keep calling and say and saying who knew we were the old people which is is true tova tood oup to go back to her husband and as she did the sky walked really close to her to throw a tissue in the trash cam as if it was two weeks ago or something tova was not happy i i was almost ready to throw my canister of wifes said should stay away maybe i do not look seventy one i'm sure that is id e pegare very n we mer thank you i called tova four days later to see how she was doing she still going out for walks no supermarkets anyore does actually the very last interview that anybody on our staff did with somebody

fom hom everybody's doing interviews of in the phond o were preparing stories for next weeks show about wht's happening in the country and in the world but in the mean time until then the thinking about what might be next to hear in the radio in a moment this one i think much of what is happening now as were being told to stay home and many of us toreither cooped up with our families or reaching out the family members more than usual and rechng out to the other people we love out to see how theyr doing and to worry together about what is can happend next we thought that i mind to day we would prepare a show of stories that we have made over the years about familis nd about people trying to find comfort or find answers by turning two their families i coulding out be of this one story from twenty five years ago of me an my mam back when she was still alive and ot i saw her quoted in a national magazine as a sexbert i had some questions for her and i called her we got to that enact three from b easy chicago it is this american life i mi re glask stay with us agan he dad dad just school is cut off in many places and git to home and we have this story of a parent trying to go about his day and is daughter coming to him over and over with some things on her mind sepeny foo tells what happen my friend matt's older daughter whent through one of those hard court phases wes she got really into asking her ton a lot of questions she was nine there is the why phase im and then the why fase concerning to the why not and explain and that endless string of questions and why cannot i have my own room how will get the school why cannot we have a yard can i have a cooky they are unrealenswing one night mat was working from home and rosiy was bugging him with her questions and ou now jus what sort of one after the other after the other and i's la rigt look n you got i oul just just give me a minute i'm working right now just go off and write them all down ight make me a list of the questions ayou want may to answer and i'll answer them for you i thoght i wasgoing to be three or four questions and then a a picture of a rabbit or something and ight get this list thand i look at it and now these i likete essensial unanswerable questions of life read a few of these questions fom me wead start at the very top ow can what is li why that is the first question tof first question first since she wants than a where do we go whin we die heaven explain another planet is haven another planet a whyser haven her hel time why explain do we make worlds do we become ly god why why do you do at you do how do what is true who do you miss why explain you mis any one more than that does that change in how if that changes was it worth missing them in the first place ah and younow my favorite is and this is pretty much is i y my jaw drop why any of this i mean my first reaction of them is an i'm an i'm i'm proud of her a and then i realize i actually has to answer these questions right they are about three pages single spaced of hand written questions about fifty questions total but a promise was a promise mi got to work he is a professor at west point teachis writing and he took a professorial approach to it and started we searching answers for her looking up quotes on each topic spending weeks sometimes months writing each answer what is the shortes and what long as you'v ever spent and what is the hardest one i think the longest one is one that i have not finished answering for her yet which is what is love what is been the easiest one the answer far is is having another planet no i got him to read me one of the answers tou her hardeston they answer to time why explain could you read it for me short am tell me why tell me why and the burden is on me to justify this you perhaps jus what time means in the end is justification are a lack of being justify an do notrally know a justification means there is no movig i saw whn was a kid in your grandmother's house the pear cots come one then brings in to malenniam cocken in saint augustine thenc our cagardns lok at dark rosy was nine wises all his answers are this you regard guests this point after either woring everything it says why did i not dies a baby i'm a grown up and i find it impossible to follow your answers i have i honestly i have not any idea what yi tame i i realy understand half what just saiy you i beoless what his answers do have going for them i sincerity the time wont ends this an one my favor stories by ganin yn fockner is that who gives his kid the watch in sas i give you this watch not that you might remember time bit h you might forget it for little one i can only tell you the time is me turning turning while the world is turning aroun star the turneran surner the turn urn the whole time among all the otheri things wal turning animals on all thele uring worlds there is me trying a turn to you oqet and you just told her this answer this ye and she i ma shou con't a passin n out av of being interested in it ie an one at the end of thit she is jus kind of hom ye o ke a'm e iwll i mean to see him saying about time ins it is measurement shang tostar betrae you man constrat but not but a feels te furin i is phenomel ye e oke es e eh this is it really exactly what i wanted thit is not what you wanted cause you ere o this this kind of borring yet rosiy has a pixsy cut and a cheeky grin she gave her dad the fifty questions three years ago she is twelve now he is been working on getting her answers but he is only gone through two thirds of them because it takes him long to cobble together i respose what i found out talking a rosy is she did not even really care about the answers to these questions questions that i thought theuld take him along time to answer cause of the time i really ju t wan to talk to him it all started when she first moved to new york city before that she would been living with her mamma an grandparents most in the week but then a grandpa which she was really close to th and she had to moving with her do during the week instead at the same time she started at a new school wherethe kids either ignored or bullied her and she felt lost one day she came home from school and decided she needed to do something about it ias lonly and i tha a little sa that no they had really sap da say oh hey it is can be ke i'll be your friend a as en i really really needs some body talk to you dodn't have anybody talk of a school a and then at home a sit really wat i felt o this is my dat hesy really im point person i love him very much i really won become closer with him i i wish there is something that i could do to make us closer did you feel your dad was not paying enough attention toou yello tat e noo that yet what was he doing insthat o he as he as writing paperso as peter and i knew the time ont portn it was that tri to be still wesh that i put down all the screens put down everything else and just talk i wrote all the questions town a ther big questions becas i know my da and if it is a little question hell alabrary on it and will make it a big deal if you times that thi a big complex question th'ld be she on talk is it truethat you ware not talking to her much at the time now i thing as somking her old time then iv tol as time to get up and going a school on a tie ah ti ereis times your homework i wan ti a she min jack an yame an a i tot you all time maybe you are noticing the purely legistical nature of everything he mentioned it certainly did not get past rosie at a taut you all time yet wat it to me it is not really same thing a conversation talking complete differete talking co be arranged from a hey wat's a and conversation is you keep in thought and your looking you making on cat tat and you really enjoying the presence of somebody else rosie's a smart kid yah but this is the thing i really admire about her nat was a single dat with two kids going to school and trying to make the reunt at the same time telling him to pay attention to her did not cut it she figured out something else i read the short story recently about a successful conman whose motter was make them want to give you the thing you want to take rosie made her dad want to give her attention by making an opportunity to do what he loved wander over life's big questions my dad of this kind of hardshilyus and it took a lot i had to keep asking thes questions and keep wondering for me was just i had to keep going and keep trying keep being this little bird that goes in your shoulders i'm now your friend do you feel it sort of taught him how to talkd to you better ya defiy ofor the past three years we have really bricked on having actual conversations and an just answering questions for me cause we practise it tat orosie never knew that her dad spent months and months writing down he chance her nat only told her when i started working on the story and she said she felt what are you kitting me had no idea that he was doing all this things an wch is big surprise for me if i could i defiy just say forget the questions i jus for a talk sa youare well you do not even have to go throughall that trouble yeh to saing out yet rosie said this ter a that when she found out and it realy threwhim for loop that is comple wastife a im whe complete was o time to come up with te big extensiv progecs that theres teting less im portanton them just just listening to am i in at was time why explain li to a do not wnt time to be it do not want time to be i something where im just figuring out i need a shut op nd make some time to listens to the tid i before toit rosie really started asking the questions because she wanted to know that she was not alone and that everything was going to be oquet now she enjoys hearing the answers because they remind her that that is true that is why one of her favorite answers is the ending of time why explain the part about all of the planets turning around themselves and in the middle of it mat turning towards rosie what in me of that is even though everything is happy round you he hejusponce to know about me a little moriy and a thing that i really about that is becaus he jucuses thes sentences that mak hecan happyou an i readen it is kind of funny when he read this to me he sort ae choked up a little bit yer he likes to be kind of om of one expression faceaid wany read self this he gets all an wushno in the ca wright here he as o i love you much heus tery up for looking out the window her you happy about that eshyet ay g o oooso people have been asking these big importint questions whyare we here what is life far for ever and do you think that they real big reason why we ask it is to have a reason to talk to each other om now i think that philosopher is ashley really do wonder about these things and they they do not use it that they could talk to they dats mot they usit because they really wonder about these things they want to know everything about it tut f my firsly is yes is exactly mat does still want to keep answering rosie's questions for her but as for the hardest question what is love i do not think rosiy needs her down to explain that to her anymore she gets it stephany f she is cramaly wreading a book about complex petiosity these days rosy is a freshman in high school an she goes by rory now we checked him with her says she is using a time cooped up at home with the family right now to draw and blisten a musac she says everybody's getting along to i sdmp ivry tyou jus ik methey oto be os toyou i to call me maybe many of us are concerned right now about our older relatives especially our parens and grandparents and this story in the most literal way is about reaching out over the phone shohn call put er together you son your mam wa con about four r five years ago i started saving all my mam's voice mails thinking she' noc king t be round for ever when'want to hear her voice when she is gone though somehow i did not extend that thought to i could hear her voice right now if i picked up the phone she had a talent for the form with some of them it almost feels i'm talking to her except she is playing both parts o what co a e yo y witin my o i cannot beleeve it wi out devided to go to the royal to er to night om o that agan wenerly we are bacarly m o now what yo do on o me im a i'm here oright you ain same what in its me in frencs sometimes heras not much more than that a a ri do not talkin i a this ones even shorter a ma but of course all the messages boiled down to her saying in one creative way or another please call me back sometimes she was a lot more direct about it y for er yo co you magergre i actually here is the one that i ways tell people about when i'm talking about her messages ex's she sort of sircles and then goes in for the kill i heard youre meryo on oder and i ner yer e i r a yo remember o c your prackering or repot r orin oro not ar o rerin why you think or pit i yevrger rargy back my mom her name was pat she died on september twenty eighth two thousand fifteen an fore twenty two in the morning it was relatively sudden and totally unexpected and as much as i thought i was preparing myself for that moment i was not prepare it is true i did not call ina but she was still the first person i thought to call when something huge happen good or bad i loved talking to her she was funny se can tell and smart she ro tecnical manuals in the early days of personal computing later in life she lugged a lot of prograt camera quitment around the world taking pictures and yet she had a hard time figuring out her smart phone the last recording i have from her saved on my phond it was a pocket dile this goes on for three minutes did you go for your walk this morning nol i did make it this morning i figure that i was pretty busy after mom died i started calling home a lot more to talk to my stepd at ed hacker he and i never really had a phone relationship when my mother was alive it was more the classic thing i you want to say hi to ad and then we would verbally clappeach other on the back and then back to mm these days it is not weird for us to spend almost two hours on the phone together tad i get twe seut set out you heard the most to active ock do generian on twitter that i know the well i try to set out bout six or seven wely did she send this morning ell i set about three or for i think of how annoyed my mom would be if she knew this but i'm now performing the exact telephone behaviour she wanted fror me when she was around except now with edd i call about once a week on averet and it is always me initiating the calls now at first of course it was mainly to make sure he was holding up oquet and to make sure i was holding oup oquet but even now when i miss a week it eats at me i'm thinking got a call ed got a colled it is an injustice that he is getting this treatment and not her and i keep trying to square it somehow but when i put this to edd he basically said it is really not that big a mystery tind o tavy is sad it what parent tats you are realie that the other one may not be that far off that he will go too or she the scarcity just an akean thaics bakes tor that you go up i never thought of this in economic terms before well it is true of many things i the population is very lo you ed's eighty seven he talught philosophy an logic at a university in boston for lot of years which is fitting because edd is very logical and philosophical itsalways quoting one or another great thinker for fun he does mask of you u hevan my mom got together when i was sex moved in when i was leven and i think he is right that i call because i'm more aware than ever that one day he will not be on the other end of the phone but it is more than that too even though we have all of these other people in our family whomwe love got to feeling edds the other one mom's death happened to he and i were the ones who mutually needed to talk about mo and to hear about her ie feel that yes i can talk to you about pad because you are willing to tout to her about it to you about you ad it makes a big difference to be it does of course i'm glad to hear tha because you wat the same person keepin in it' some wha similar if somebody else as los somebon else thot bes groups an whic everyone is moch o spouse and ther membories er tir perch you ot you' ever mat that other perch on that di an yourely do not care you care about your las o did be odest are you on the deck now i am haven a smoke i am for a long time my mam was a third invisible person in all these conversations but we have both noticed we are talking about mom lesson less people told me this would happen but i did not really believe them or i did not want to time slouch is on you wake up to different thoughts in the morning and when you call home the first thing you say is not how re you holding up i ge it used to be that

from family in the ones they love reaching out and worried for them we 'ave put together a show of family stories that we have made over the years both the stories in this next part if i show out people turning to their dads over the telephone with ha question thi treshoin act for it takes a villa come from your drumming in the summer of nineteen eighty two my dad did something unexpected something that seemed unbelievably indulgent he took me my mam my brother and the youngest of my three sisters on the most epic road trip any of us could have possibly imagined at the time we piled into my dad's bewic skylark and drowe from queen's new york to the world's fare in noxvill tennessee were a robat dance for us and then down into ourlando forit this was a big deal before this going away meant visiting relatives and south carolina and sitting uncomfortably among aunts and second cousins whose names i would forget before we even pulled out in their dusty driveways this trip was not country heat and sipping sugar order on some rickety porch while listening to the inscrutable conversation of groanful it was what going a thousand miles from home shad feeli we cruised own a brightly lit street called international dry we stayed at a holiday in taller and more grand than any id ever seen sonlight streamed in through a hole in the seiling a whole that was supposed to be there our parents took us to a building at a pile of poached eggs but was actually sanatu house of the fu ture and everywhere along every road side tiul boards promise that the most magical scene still awaited us his place disnywy all accounts in his paradise for kids but be tween the gas and the who towels on the eating out my dad quickly discovered how expensive taking even sixty percent of his brod on a disny vacation could be he was resigned to do it but he was not above working the angles he found out that you could get cheap tickets to the magic kingdom if he just signed out to sit through an hour or sh beal from some one pitching time shares he was in the hard cell went down at the disny village a branded many maul near the famous steam park my mam dad and a handful of other determined parents stowed their kids in a room full of toys that had ben conveniently provided by the salespeople the parents set about the business of listening ere not waiting patiently for the moment when the closers would stopp shilling and start handing out the disny discount but while we kids were in another room throwing legos at one another something surprising appin my dad bit he went into a closed room to get three day passes just that i could eventually lose my glasses on space mountain nd he came out with the dee the deed to something he and my mom were now calling our villa my father was a bold man but in retrospect this is the most impetuous action that i have ever seen him take it cost him about five thousand dollars which he paid in installmants in nineteen eghty two for a guy with five kids e never made more than thirty three thousand dollars a year at his dajob it was a con siderable in vestebut those un familiar with time shares and may be hard to rap your head around buying a vacation home that yhe never really ome you pay up front for it it is an annual maintenance but you only get to stay in it once a year or usually for week at a time it almost sounds some sort of scam and sometimes it is but it did not turn out that way for us instead it became a fixture in my family my father had chosen as our week the first week in july and every year during one of the hottest months of the year we would had down i nighty five is always but now when we pulled into south carolina to sea relatives that was only a pitt stop on the way of our true destinations we had transformed from people who went away to a family when on baking our billa was number three seventeen a two bedroom apartment with an enclosed back port at looked out on to a small man made late iwewith fish ducks and another summer word that i learn thezebo my brother chased ticadas and lizzards for my sister the only swimmer among my sivilings it was a pool it were ten is courts and bikes to rent the general store even offer the collection of the latest movies on lazerdis that first trip i was aghe as i got older i moved from the gazebo to the game room and then the gim trying to meet other kids my age my mam busied herself in the kitchen making lunches or sat by the lake and watchd the ducks my dad shepherded us through its the small world and ep cotsenour summers went on this pretty much exactly this probably ntil i finished high school i honestly loved it i looked forward to this trip every year and even though it was only a week it was almost always the high light of my entire summer but when i think about it now it occurs to me my dad pretty much orchestrated this thing that became important to our lives and i have no idea whether or not he ever enjoyed it himself in fact it did not seem he did i cannot recall actually seeing him happy neither is my brother he says dad was pretty much the same at the time share as he was at home sometimes heu'd go for walks alone but often he just sat on the couch and watch he be i asked my sister she said he must have been happy but she does not remember witness he had either it seems such a simple question but i just wanted to know did he enjoy himsel athe risk of inbidying the most tired trop an all of modern masculinity i will say my father and i never really got alone he was strict his house had a lot of rules and he believed in corporal punishment and the sting of that conflict stayd with me as an adult but since my mam passed away last year i been trying to connect with him more i gave him a call er hello yt heit is ne yet is it a bad time e abago say is it a bad time o hi o e ha nat ha er n er i did know wel was e ru goar no are you ready for a call from the druar hi er crol e e e me cot no man wena e my dad is eighty three years old now and living alone in florida talking to him can be awkward and not just because his hearing his going i asked him point blank if he liked goin g to the villa he told me that when he was growing up he barely ever left south carolina i did' know not about nothin outhi no you sho thin in magtinn su an te fir come out for time i knew about a a did it i was tan he ot wet i di oit wasa was a god i id it an i o i he some something other than ti aroun his wa wul agle bole ye my dad grew ap poor on a farm one of twelve children he says the only finished high school because by the time he was old enough he was the one driving the bus sometimes when theywere athlet ic events at other schools he get the dro the teems and learned what the near by towns were in nineteen fifty three he was draughted into the army which had only recently been integrated the sent him to colorado and indiana and it was not great he says the army was really nod into black people back then those words travel experiences when he was young i was turning a lout of this for the first tind as he turns out that is at least partially my own fault do y kno o we never talt about becaus yid id git wat of the count of thing tit tit you got in deg did it really he he just did not seem we were interested as kids ye a right ye i probably was not interesteback then back when the two of us were constantly challeging each other i was always either afraid of him or angry at him hiding from him or planting my feet to confront him it never crossd my mind to tryi to understand him but nowadays my dat feels to me some kind of living cold case a million page brief that is no longer redacted maybes because i'm now at the age he was when i was born but i wrettoactively find his every decision fascinating even the ones that are not surprising on the surface why florida a di we av at an you you yid in her something about florda an in an di thing did te worl avter we go to go on de go out yev c o tit you a a gang tem and te mava tatom alot ye an not many peopleblewo go on we will com to the most maktioning people oe an er ye i do not know any other famit that when all wakaavy yo we we did my dad was obviously proud that he got in the time share but pride strictly speaking does not constitute joy it did not answer the cquestion of whether or not he was actually happy spending those summer weeks with us at the villa instead he kept trying to make me understand why he brought us there in the first place and his explanation his reasoning reached back to memories and past experiences that not only had i never heard but the kind o ble my mind ban n i a comly wer i got to hurl o da when we wa go ge i come on you hav te o a ting o comething that you go rde about when you go back to go because you gon o hae to right something ye about what you did to come well we we never had anything yo ride about an when i gon a go an yidn' think crin o muo i in te you tor that that

answer was hard to take in to re concile with the distance i felt between us at the time tfact when he would retired to th couch to watch o bwon we went off to play on our own maybe he was watching replay in the bushes and getting a kicked out of it but i did not know t still i was happy at the billa an my deubts as he was too i'm glad i know that i i've been talking to you for an hour i should

ecsided to quit radio it jus did not pay enough the most he ever made at a radio job was ninety dollars a week which was not much money even that and that point he became the person that i knew him as

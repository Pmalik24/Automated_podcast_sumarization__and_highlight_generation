couple in does something horrible it is one i wish that he had said something wans to warn people robt by the ways black manas mexicn american officer anderson is white the post about it on face bok atd pos up people come forward they say they have had troubling runnings with this officer in the past officer anderson is suspended on the poice department investigates o ca sow a last time on our show a bencalhon one of our editors producers here told the story of the athisis and we heard the testimony that officer anderson gave to police investigators about the whole thing and we heard from anderson's wife about how and why they got that ccc applicasion basi heard from a former pastor amed dukes stalling we do not a story about what officer anderson could be as a cop or anderson showed up at his mother's fifty ninth birthday party and en ded a pepper sprang a bunch of his older relatives o people for lacking a ser bat i fegin in trat a run in y dey would not callin any hard to hav at all i nobody's crate enough oor hitopose wo hav we not crazy hogh is do not put the hands on a police officer an than that to day ben turns to the story of the city's investigation ant officer nderson which quite out in a strange and surprising way that had serious consequences for the mathisis ben starts with tact one chief louisides it up here is ben there was the official investigation into officer anderson by the miskigan police departments internal affairs team as you might have heard last week that investigation went kina soft on him the investigator literally invited anderson to quote explain away the situation u while that investigation was unfolding the police chief jeff lewis was taking his own look at anderson a harder wore critical look turn out louis had questions about anderson before any of this happen in fact a year before the mathis is post a vidy had popped up on line the made louis worried about andersn we watched us together it was a selforin vidio taken at night with the women being pushed into the back of a miskigan police harg anderson is standing behind the officer doing the pushin and then you see two women walk out one younger and then elderly woman writ next to herr both black every one in the vido but andersn anderson turns and he sees the women i'm sure he has hi sid e story whic you see he spends round an just without even trying to verbly de as lator doingting he dis shoves this elderly woman to the ground which is just interpropriate it is won is just ot about s why di me a ma mi a pla oma a me mi o a i just cannot justify that i just cannot any way i look at it i cannot even say he was tectically right cause i do not remember ever throwing down a grandmother and my career ai justdo not feel thrown a gramadown a complaint was filed about this inciden and louis took note he is concerned that andersen was kind of a cowboy and aggressive then the very same week themathisis posted he heard another story about anderson a black business owner he knew told him about a disturbing run an she would had with him that he would been bruded and aggrassive and told her to shut up then once all the started to blow up louis says some officers started to come to him discreetly and tell him they had concerns about anderson which prompted him to tally up everything he knew about anderson there is the julis johnson shooting i talked about last time where andersen killed an on arm black man that was before louis arrived in miskigin and andersen was officially cleared of any wrong doing but louis question andersens judgmen and the decisions that he made that led to the shooting he added on top of that two other shootings andersen was involved in an additon to julius johnson if took the national average a i've been a police officer for forty years involved in no shootings the vast majority of police officers go through their career an never shooting one oething the public knows that nobody keeps national statistics on the percentage of officers that shoot people a pew said he says only twenty seven percent of police officers have even fired their guns but that includes warning shots and shooting animals anything else whon expert told us the number of police who have accually shot and killed some one is almost certainly less than one persent i couldnt even find a statistic we are department this and you are involved in three shootings and the is an outlier in that way you ive be either you have the worst lock something is going on here and then when you looked at his history there was a progressive a i guess glaring a performance with him when it came to ou know dealing with afric americans especially another words he seem to have a lot of proms with africa mericas through his career louis said anderson would have these kind of problematic interactions with black people but over and over again he would be cleared found to be within the bounds of department policy his whole career things would happen and he would connacmot the other side and i'm not sure why i mean not gift cobecklok of every insitant i've had officers a goond correccens and les sa you havean officer theis in five correccens and none was his fault as a chief you go lo ke it appeers is nat your fault but why are you in five not a fault accents when the other that i persent the officers on heavens what are you doing that you keep getting an accidents in it ot of fault we would a much big policarga ract which never fault chuck is one ose kind f things were iits is pass tjis good things in her m i take thir way from i start to see an a pattern that he just was not effective with our afcan merican sisencs he just was not what he gan do louis says he knew pretty quickly what he was gin it din he wanted to fir andersn partly on principl tuplis to his fory told me andersen has a problem with black people there was no doubt in my mind but also on top of that lots of people were telling louis he had no choice he had to get rid of this officer the city's social justice committee the city's vice maore whos also the president of the local end of bolicy p every one was saying if anderson stayed there would be back lash protest hostility and not just towards anderson but towards every one on the force sould 'n danger him an other servant at officers and matter fact i'm not co be part of his igersy if that is howrgin o be its i can not and good conscious bring him back here and put him back on the streets of this town tso at this point in our story you have got a town were lots of people think o police officer has a problem with black people the white police chief looks into it and agrees seems a clear cut case fired the officer call out his bad behavior apologized the public and yet that is not what ends of happening which brings us tack to the way it actually happen tout of the breaking news out of the skigin wer a police officer who had who cluck clanmemrobilian as all has been fart when the news ha the chief louis did what he said and fired officer anderson there was no explanation why he was fired the closest they got to that came eleven days later when the city released their official report on anderson the results of the investigation chief louis ordered this report it is one of the reasons i got interested in this it is over of four hundred pages it seems its gaing a bee kind of a reckin it of the kind of officer andersen ad bendering is two decades on the meskigan police force and clude all the ins idents you have heard about settle some big questions about the kind o officer he was but the report was nothing that the report almost entirely pertrays officer anderson as well a pretty great police officer it is hundreds of pages clearing him of wrong doing and showcason things he done well in his career it much that the first time i read it i did not even understand how this was used as justification for anderson being fired much of what had come up and what people were talking about was not even addresse there is an analysis of andersen's traffic stop showing it did not appear he was targeting non white drivers here is a big section about his commendations there is ten interviews with officers white and non white talking about how they think anderson's fair and a good officer and they wish he could come back to work some seem boiler plate but others seem heartfelt one black officer without prompting talks about how andersen has gone out of his way to help him at work and been a guest at his house he is been your house the investigator asks he has says black officer he help me put a roof on my house and his father and whife spent the whole day at my house many of the things the chief found disturbing that convinced him anderson had a problem with black people they just were not in there the vidy of him pushing the old woman on to the ground or louis 's concerns about the number of people anderson shot the only interview where anyone says anything negative about anderson i's the interview with the moffices and they only talk about the flags an the ckca application the local actavist ebony davis summed up the report this way he was a great officer he did not do anything wrong but have memorobelia and they fired him to keep us happy how did we get to this from a police chief who believes this officer has ae problem with black people to this mammoths report that does not say that at all chief louis 's investigators handed him a report that comes to very different conclu sions than he had it is the report you would issue if he wanted to keep anderson on the streets i never got in answer to why the reportis just as lotatory stuff i askd to talk to the people who did the investigation n the city said no as chief louis surprisingly he told me he thought the report was critical honestly it seemed he had not read it in a while andmaybe did not remember what the hack had happene inside miskegan city government they could possibly connect those dobs the best answer i got is here enact three how to fire a police officer oke let us go back to that moment when chief louis decided he wanted to fire anderson not because of the official investigation he had not even seen that yet he wanted to fire anderson because of his own analysis after he decided that he met what the cities lawyers and they talked about how it would be tricky to fire anderson and be tricky because of the reason louis wanted to get rid of him it tard to prove a police officer treats black people differently and has a pattern of discriminating they said if louis tried to fire him for that he really might fail take the vidio of anderson shoving the old woman anderseen to argue it was justified or maybe was an acciden take any of these incidents one by one he could say that there was some reason caus here is always a defense mister anderson had a defense mister anderson had representation chief louis ays he called around to othe police chiefs the police union officials before around the stateop ye went you will never sustain that an in the union world i was told by a lot of people my de cision was to terminate that it would not buustae that you would not have grounds for termination i would i'd proably lose it later on down down the road it it happenes i mee there is it just since i' been ho would say there is probaly three different times people been fired and awarded their job's fack miskegin city mandadg yor frank peterson he was in these meetings with chief louis and miskigan's lawyers and we just did not want that to happen in this case some of the cases were ocay with it if but this one was under no circumstance could be afor to have him be awarded his job back it is hard to fire a police officer that is to pretty much everywhere in this country as he probably know police unions are powerful they'v lot to protections in their contracts and the instances where police officers do get fired for racism there' been a bunch o cases over the last coule yers wilmington north carolina albany new york wor in michigain and the thing is in all those cases police were not fired from his treating people of color on the job they were fired for things they set because they wright raceis comments on line where they get caught on a recorting saying explicitly raceis things there is a caught red handedness to it and the way those departments fired the officers was by arguing the races comments violated the basic cot of conduct for their jobs the cote of athics and wilmington says officers cannot do things that reflect on favorably on the department or themselves and chief louis after puzzling for a while over what legal argument he could use to fire anderson he had kind of an ahamoment an h cont a stumbled into a strategy that the other cityes used in our pulst proceedures one of the things you have to do is you yourself have to have the community trust if yous in our pulst proceedures the communty has t have some kond of trust you to curry out your duties i looked it up and indeed this was in some tachnicality verid deep in department policy e was right at the beginning in the chief's preface that louise rode himself he refers to the public trust when louis told me that this was his argument and he was going to try to fire anderson for losing the publics trust i could not help ut think if this was the bar every were for every officer a lot o officers would be fired tomorrow the is and half of american say they have confidents in police these days one benefit of this strategy was simplicity all they had to prove was that anderson had the stuff in his house and the people said he could not be trusted because of it louis would not have to argue all these individual incidens that the lawyers told him he might lose ohn another appealing thing about this plan it would be fast louis wanted to send to message by acting quickly and in fact from the day the maffices posted het was only five weaks intill anderson was fire amazingly quick for this kind of thing but to maketure anderson would not fight him and try to get his job back the chief did seemd to give a few things away at the barganing tableley for starters he did not really fire anderson in actuality anderson signed a separation agreement he agreed to walk away voluntarily not say anything bad about the city not to keep his job it was just going to be over in exchange the city would let him leave with his pension and retirement held care benefints after two decades on the job this strategy for getting rid of a police officer is not unusual a former police chief named daniel oats wrote an article in the washington post where he said in nine years running the department in a ror colorado he had sixteen cobs he wanted to fire he only fired four of them he was reversed on three of those wut the other twelve he says he quote bent over backwards to negotiate their departures with creative severence packagens not because he wanted to he felt he had no other choice in the negotiations between the city and officer anderson the complaints about anderson's history did come up but his kind of a bargaining chim louis told me he made it clear to anderson and the unionshat the case for his termination was based on what was in his house and how he lost the public trust but he said if anderson fought that most it could become about a lot more nister it could become about anderson's past and other things that he done and i was i was prepared to show this pattern thi had other complains te wor in the hopper that were coming forth that i was going to quire in those vaxt in the union knew it oh if you win this one this has come next then this could become next and that is why i was decided we would just in this relationship and he would move on in other words if anderson took this deal the city would not dig in to thext stuff anderson to walk away without a real reckoning over his past that is the best explanation i have for why the four hundred and twenty one page report is the way it is and why it does not really dig in to anderson's mistreatment of people i should mention in his prefase to the report the chief promises more he sais there w'll be further investigation into additional complaints against officer anderson's behavior on the job now that this part ton that did not happen though and it is been two years the department spokesmen told me there are no additional investigations in to anderson in the works bancohin coming out the way the cities deal with officer anderson affected mathises who woke that that four hundrer twenty wone page report iv had something totally surprising about themselves and that that is a menute scagopubligradio whent on programme continues this a smarican life om or a glass with our story about policing a muskuigan michigan to day's episode a city walks into an investigation im the police chief made a trade off hebelieved officer anderson had prob black people he believed a completely affected the way he did his job but he thought he could not fire him for it he forced him out for quote losing the publics trust with that cce ce oplication atd is part of the de o the city's official four hundred twenty one patre port did not say anything negative abot out anderson treated black people on his job that trade off anderson at weeve but he kept his pension the city's official investigation wur traded to mis a outstanding officer that trade off had consequences for the people whose face book post began all of us the mathisis and for others bankof hin picks up without for people who got the short end of anderson steale best i can tell the public at large just kind of accepted with the city did anderson was gone maybe he grumbled that he got his pension but fine oqet but it was not that way for duke's stalling at all just have remind you of his experience with officer anderson anderson was called to his mamm's birthday party because of a noise complaint and ascalated things until he ended a pepperspring a bunch of old people an arresting duke in one of his uncles they filed complaints with the police department a tried to raised the alarm about anderson but nothing happene know never reached out to hear their side of the story years later when the mathisis came forward about the stuff in anderson's house duke thought finally every one's gon to see but the way the city handled it it did not go that way because the city's report did not talk about the pattern anderson hat with black people what would it have meant to you if the police chief as part of this process would have said essentially he had the sky was a problem oh everything oh my my hope was that they was one looking to marcase agan whole right innocent naeveness i hope that they reach out to me hop they look into marcase hop they lookin juliau's case hope they look into all these cases an something really happens and anhe go to the families and make a mans with these families that he terrize thot we youre oping that you are goingtog got fonco oen most ephon i thought that is wohatd invescasion is you gon lookinto every situation that he had a ant interaction was but the investication hey say was onl have that was just to get us hopeful right gulds people hopeful sotn't you rid an anger saw poise can be on the streets whit o nobody one to doing things to our polices well say everything we need to say to make them come down thassit hat's realy also about it is a weird thing about the story all that stuff that chief leuis said to me about how he was convinced that officer anderson had problem with black people and a pattern of incidents mis treating them he is never said that publicly not in the report not in comments to the press no city official has said anything that not until now this story i was the one to break that to people duke's stalling i mean that would ha make me for a whole la better if he would have said what he say to you behind closed ors an public about this officer to hear that comes from with in that you agreed and you felt the same way he had a history of a hertin or effecting mand as sad group of people and we fired him and got rid on because it hav reason to let us know that we on e saying page her i mean that is how you build at trust with the community when it came to the way that anderson treated his family duke ould always felt that race was a part of it they did have acted differently if they were white but it was this slippery part and it was hard to prove twhich happens all the time person accused of races m can say i do not have a race his pon in my body or i'm the least race's person and then all ofthe sudden conversation is this dead end every one's just must throw up their hands and be guess yeu cannot prove wits in their heart this wi in everythan yes i've know what in a roast i i offices self that would te and o know was a raceal bag but i could not take it to court and we am because they nevers misstifily say aything that li you really ot a cause ombody an you learely got o lities i thangs in orderi can treat you an ut never cally i can treat you one never quile you thed youcay esiton on races but you knewl was kne was you it is a trap door and ten years earlier duke ould watched anderson slipped through it and when the city released their report it was he had to watch anderson slipped through it for a second time ei went back and i told chief louis wuld duke another said to me that if the city and louis saw a racial pattern of bad conduct and mistreatment by officer anderson the city should have set it honestly and i see wher the con fro i iget but when it came time for us to do the investigation i felt i but everything in there to sustain this case and to get him to end his employment here to get the outcome that you felt was importance for this and ind i can prove it to day i can look back gu see we did it right but there can som misses should say it is not complete untill the chief put the racesyou do not ther can weere i guess work in i gust live to day to disagree i din't feel that was nec surry what i felt was ne sers in that report and worked for what i would call a correct outcome but but i guessed the question that i'm asking it is just why not a a public statement there' sharing youre take of there there is a pattern of problems here why not a public statement saying you ges a right thete was something wrong here i i think we did i make a publich statement of that we went you cannot be employere nd and mat effact you should be a plece ofcer te went around and around louis was adaman they made the right choice to get anderson out act five no good deed goes unpunished the people who were the most effectd directly effected by the city's decision never to publicly comment on how anderson treated black people where the people who stuck their next out and set this all in motion robin rain a mathus he mat thi is were already being harassed i laid out the details of that last time threats to their childrenand people in town shouting slurrs at them people stocking their house but when the cty put out its report it made all that worse because of something surprising it set about them it was something dadyn even know and it was something that changed the way people in miskigan saw them towards the end of the report the maskigan police department revealed that that day when robin rayn a toward officer anderson's house that was not actually the first time they crossed passd with hem in fact over the years they interacted with him a few times robin rain a found this out the day the citys report came out i believe we's in a car ran somewhere in a somebody sint tis te reporter somebike that yo wen on a way up side or something and ranan iws wa it was one of these incidents they caught every one's attention especially the mathises it was from two thousand eight robin rayno totally remembered this thing but they never put it together that it was officer andersen in fact both ta and andersen told investigators they know each other for the mat thises this particular incident had just cone a mushed in with other interactions theyd had with police they did not remember a particular officer it was just some random cob who treated them badly i went to tell you the whole story because of the outlandish coincidence of this if you remember the reason rob felt compelled to go public about the flags and the cakecake c application was because he imagined some day somewhere officer andersen would pull over a couple and things would get ugly turned out robin rayno had been that couple a deccate earlier it was the fourth of july and he tdouse and ade robin raynah had grabbed a bite at burger king they were on their way home and rob had to pe really bad he was going a little fast but not that fast heven accorting to officer andersen who says in his police report that he clock them going between thirty one and thirty eight in a twenty five tenish over anderson pulled them over pretty much right at their house he flit the lights and i pull up right at my sad door we wliterally right in front of our house ret literally parkd right in front of our house officer andersen comes up to the car and i you what yous you speet us e sor i had go to bath when ich is gatagl bathroom bad hou tis is going sake a secn my wife was ed sgot taglo to bathroom he shut up madam ba ba bla rob says he and raynon were shut ut officer andersen went back

this point rayna got out of the car to talk to their kids officer andersen turned his attention to her when he did he cont a gave up on rob and rob was able to run inside to pey then andersn walked over to ryna he told me to get my assback in the car and i was standing at the door was not ouht all the way out of the car i was the door was open and i was standing there telling my kids that everything was going to be o cayor whatever am he was telling me to get my asback in the car and i'm telling him i'm talking to my kids the're scared whatever it and i do not remember rayna sas she wast kind of pin between the car and andersen and that is when he try to put me in the headlock and al i did was tri overy i do not want him to however he did it he did tissan mussan my nose are what ever my nose was bleadin but when i went back this to pertack to myself that is when he got hid rynar says she lifted up her arms to block andersen and her arm hid him rob in t e middle of this comes back out of the house to find rayna with a bloody face and officer andersen wrestling her to the ground he stearched to walk up what is happeni when i'se come ot sad the gate yes tay des thay destly put his mnd en what yous do not plos gone out som standon why rayn just be cool be cool coo and the he grabbl what were they saying what were they saying when you came at la he was you resist in e rest you resist in t e res my hoswe jus had to go to baes i told you to stain to car told jus tan car he grabbed er and he master here down on the car you res omor wild is to trying to get away from and you having to stand there on the other side of the hance with your kids and watch this holesan and oldin i was word at is wont o shooter in front o of me in a kis once andersen had ryna on the ground he put handcuffs on both of he rest saying i told you to get yher asked down ah now you are going to fuckan jail suff that and my kids were screaming at this point we surprised that that happened all thison no i g ate the way the aggression he had i knew something was can happened i was not surprised that it did happened i was more mad because i happene in front of my kids han they were terrified cause they were younger than just treat erate the issue here to start was driving about thirty five an a twenty five andersen's report from that night described more or less the same course of offence the key difference is that officer andersen says rynond did not hit him inadvertently he says she swung around and sloppenn rayna was charged with resisting an obstracting a police officer i charged the curry's potential prison time when my husband found out i was facing five years in prison he said no he said were fight and this cause they gopt tinament to take a deal am he said no were gin to get a lawyer were ing to fight this he said i want the dasport cam as avinence he said because that will see exactly what hat everybody wasl see what happened the malfases say their lawyer requested the dash camp footed from the stop according to the mathases they were told the vidio could not be located and then suddenly rayna was offered and knew much reduced plea deal she decided she jiswanted to be done with all this and she took it ut the night of the traffic stop back in two thousand ate robin rynond did not think it was about race do not ag just being a dig or he is had a hard migd maybe o te the previous person may be pooled over something gave ahard time and he just taken ou on everybody else he is own a powertri i have a bade om i'm on ti control that is what i thought i din't think anything about him be in braces i just thought ye he was a cop on a portrip i mean i've seeing mexican cops do the same thing to mexicans and black cops do the same thing to blacks it is just some of em have their power trips i just thought he was on a poetrip that was how they soughit when it happened but now after seeing the s things in andersen's home a decae later they both looked at it differently i do not think he would have did that with a with a white cub wunikar he en lik oka go use bathroom or om is going lets you off cause he was just just jis respect in hind slight looking at it everything he did was a raceis act from when he first looked at us hee did not have good intentions tics a man is racees and i know that now but had i known it back then probably been aladed then i was pissed i citnat i d wish i would have probably assaulted him before aasulted me that is the truth if the city specifically chieflewis would have said publicly some version of what he actually thought about officer andersen that he had a pattern of being overly aggressive escolating situations especially with people who were not white then i think when people found out about this traffic stop they might have seen it in that lite but without that contaxt anderson's version is the one people believed it is andersen's account in that four hundred twenty one page report the city issued he stopped robin rayna rayn got out of hand she assaultat him because of that this revelation that they would had this run in with officer andersen years earlier it really did change how lots of people saw them athisis that is when more threats came and ther people sin all year you are out for officer anderson because he put your wife in yer because it s because of that then may was all your might just a good gat because you ouht it officer anderson for having a cofederate fag in a clan application this because we were holding a grods against the police offs of course robin rayna had not sought out andersen's house on some bendetta the realter sent them the listing but this version of the story took hold that is was still outit that that report that a city hal put out it is me an my wife had a probe we in we went after when we were talking i told rob what chief leuis said to me that andersen had a pattern of behavior and a problem with black people just would duke stalling robin had no clue no clue louis felt that way no clue louis saw the same things in andersen that he did and the fact the city left that out it made rob mad why whel you say that in the report in the begin yit would av changed everything everything me an my wife would not be looked iy as some liars that we woult after you you soon up here creane is falseness it is just room tell the truth manage police she want to tell the truth but the matteris done what truthfully the infimation that shou just got from chief lewis if that wouldnave been put into report then tey would say the mas yart he in a great job thank you the way the mathesis see it even if the chief removed andersen for betraying the public strust even if the reason for the firing was not the way he treated black people the city could have removed anderson without also giving him a clean bill of health the cut a said we have looked into this were troubled by the way he treats people it was not oka we do not want officers acting the way that he did ac six was it worth it is hard for robin rayn had to cout culate the ways this changed their lives the rist they took was a single act a single moment but the impact of it is still happening even a couple years later the cost for them are still adding up some of what all this has cost the maththis is are things that have ended up in no report no investigation official or unofficial the harass men the threats the conspiracy theory now floating round out there the robin rayna were out to get officer anderson the last time i saw rob i asked him how he looks back on all tit given the result i'm just glad that ye ran round the streets he is not rast no more mine wordies and nobody will get kuled by alls ernesy itud be a justifia shoot cause he can make ap would he want to because he killed o porse you do you feel it was worth it i'll feel us i me my wife save lives but non will we de raynda did not disagree shoose glad anderson lost this job really pretty fast that toesn't always happen but the practical cost she can help it look at those too the then with all thu a back lash that was n that that all the negative stuff it just made me second guess what we did i felt i did sut mot wrong maybe we should not didt maybe we should is kept our mouth shut but that the end of the day who as to say that he would not still be workin in another young black man gets killed or thereis another rayna who goes to prison for five years because he says that she assaulted him and it it i i'm complict because one minut i'm we did do the right thing we did do the right thing but then when you go through everything that we have been goin through its kind hard maybe we should know though robin raynah did what they did out of concern for other people's safety but they ended up sacrificing their own they used to feel the police rout there to protect them tit help them and now on any given day the worried that their not here is rayna i promise you every day i leave this house when i drived to work i pray to god that i do not get pulld over because i'm scared i'm legal i have a license i have insurance and i'm scared e make rob drive me to work alot and it is hard on him because he has to wake up to come get me at five in the morning and then take my daughter to school and do this and do that and but i my anxi to get bat i do not wanto dav cause i'm scared him to get pulled over and and anything can happen it might be somebody who knew him w right or one of his friends those worries an fears they tell me they are not just when they leave the house they have seeped in the last thing i'll play for you is from rayna this was from five months after the city ad terminated anderson when most of the people in meskigan had stopped thinking about all this im i probably get two three hours sleep here and there once we started get in the thrats and im but i i had a lot of bad dreams i could not sleep i would have to i used to put a chair riht by that window wand just set out and look out the window in the dark just i could see im tis to keep an iyon what was going o yeoutnd that we have a monitur with our security camerals and i would lay it and my bed with me and i would just hold it and watch it for ours cause it shows all of our camerels is all six i'd watch all the little scrans and for hours i could not sleep and that is what i would do and how long did that last i still do it sometimes i do not sit there no more but i will sit here ere or i will lay in my bat an i'll hold the monitor right in my hand in his lastnouben he was sometimes te or i set on the stairs right there at the forth stair i can see right out that night when mi worse light is on sli sent there i texted rob the other day he told me they still get thratd sometimes and they still watch the monitors regularly that is the normnaw he wrote ralways on guard i gan wong i think o on them for the last six months as bancovon is een morking on this story he and i have talked about and the thing that i have wondered about myself about this whole thing this whole time was oket if you are a police officer with the histery officer andersons all these intractions with cevilians a goo badly over twenty one years why did it take this freek evet people spotting a ca c keoplication on a wall for anybody wook to is record the way the chiefted it is something about hem could not they have flagged him sooner across the country re we sethse incidents were police are mistreating people it seems if there were some system to catch problem officers it can make a difference does any police department try in a real way an an effective way to do that flag them deal with them aother ben i i was not a one in this question you also were cone of obsess with us yet i put this question this exact question to several policing experts a and eventually one of them told me about these things called early warning systems ah and basically what these are are computer programes that track problematic incidens in an officers career a and they flag an officer if there is too many of them and one of tese experts told me that if meskigan have one of these systems thend all of this would hav been different a a yet right but then i checkd and meskigan does have one of these systems in place oh it does it does but id did not lead to any action against officer andersen oka then what is he problem well i mean it turns out that a lot of these systems are just really bad a and there is a few reasons for it one of them is that some of the systems this includes miskigans they rely really heavily on police officers re porting each other on which does it happen very often it realies on citizen complaints a which we just know that people do not complain about police officers very often because they worry that nothings can be done which is true often right yet totally true ah another reason thei're bad is that a when these systems get installed a they have to be negotiated with police unions and police unions kind of defang them a and the last reason it turns out they might be measuring just the wrong things ah a few years ago a a group at the university of chicago got together and they wanted to change the way this works basically they wanted to money ball the whole situation thy were to break down all the things police do on the job into numbers and statistics and then they wanted to find the stats that best predict bad behavior sog man example of of what these moneyboflstats would be oket one example a they say the old systems would measure just the sheer number of times a police officer would use force if they wrestle somebody to the ground or if they taste somebody a and what they want instead they say it tells you just way more if you measure something they call proportionality of force and what that is is how much force is a police officer using given the situation that there in ah are they using force in a situation that would not usually call for it o we can think of officer anderson going into the back yard and ending up pepper spraying a bunch of unarmed people over a noise complaint overnoise complaint or or shoving that old woman of the ground that is using a lot of forese were forces necessarily needet right exactly i talk to a policing expert name bron cuper men he is a former chicago police officer and he is one of the people trying to get people to use these new money ball type stats he told me the university of chicago group crench the numbers for a lot of officers and they were looking at whether they were using force and situations that would not usually call for it yyou learn two things you learn that most police are great at the escolation and you learn that some police are always trying to use is much force as they lawfully can or the policy naples from torit or the top end of that factorae those officers are much more likely to have a major avers that occur right something terrible the nature o whit you can turn on and see on te be here and there right to ma another one what os to the track another thing tha these folks are looking at is something called discrationary arrest that is essentially an officer goes into a situation the desn necessarily requirin arrest and makes one yes they pulling over the maffices for going thirty five and a twenty five that results in a an arrest or oag as jus te traffics up as a speeding tic echan nesoa result and arrest yet exactly ye same with duke stalling right it the noise complaint and he ands up arresting duke and his uncle a case all that goes unti i anogarathem or whatever yet exactly and one the most interesting things that these people are finding is that patterns of problematic behavior with police officers typically go together if an officer has one kind of bad behavior than the probably can have others the officer who pushes down an old lady is more likely to be an officer whos involved in say three shootings u and there also more likely to be the officer who is now at a traffic stop telling a couple to shut up we do not generally fine that oh an officer is just throud or an officer just uses a little too much force and if we use the story that you shared this officer was not just rud right that is the general accurate story we do not really just find well this officer is otherwise great but is just across disrespectal right but the data would generally show that officers going to be struggling ino other parts of their job they are using more force than one would expect they are using a higher proportionality of force i just want to add another thing that their tracking is who police officers are doing problematic things to if an officer uses more force with people of coller say tak that is can a show up does this mone about system work better what we know do they actually catch more problem officers and get the to change or n a get rid fem i mean what roun humorman says s they have only been doing this for few years it is still pretty early to tell how it is working but he says some departments get better results than others and the key variable is how they follow through when an officer gets flagd ar lot of departments exor using new madibo vhersions of the stots no not that many ron huborman's company which is based on all this university of chicago research is called bench mark analytics and that one is working withabout a hundred and fifty policing agencies awhich i know sounds kind of alotat frm but ye there is eighteen thous and policing agencies olliver the country most of america is miskagen right that that is the average or the normal police farmin in america which is there might be something in place but fundamentally it is not it does not have both the data in the citistication to identify oplomatic patterns you jost i asked ron humurm what of the big obstacles for getting these systems up in running and he said some of him our superstraightforward you knows a money in tack an getting at in place a but the big problem he said is is politics a police unions they just tipically fight anything that involves scrutinizing and disciplining officers you an't to get these systems in that is where the resistances canto be wel ben thnk u very much thank you a whats tne is bon o the tons on wos te ot twhen wo on

welcome to the hubermanlao science sciencepactoeli i mader huberman and o professor of naurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is mark and dresine mark endreson is a software engineer and an investor intechnology companies he cofounded and developed mosaic which was one of the first widely used webbrowsers he also cofounded and developed netscape which was one of the earliest widespread used webbrowsers and he cofounded and is a general partner at andresan harwots one of the most successful silicon valley venture capital firms all of that is to say that mark endreson is one of the most successful innovaders and investors ever i was extremely excited to record this episode with mark for several reasons first of all he himself is an incredible innovader second of all he is an uncanniability to spot the innovaders of the future and third mark has shown over and over again the ability to understand how technologies not yet even developed are going to impact the way that humans interact at large our conversation starts off by discussing what makes for an exceptional innovador as well as what sorts of environmental conditions make for exceptional innovation and creativity more generally in that context we talk about risk taking not just in terms of risktaking in one's profession but about how some people not all but how some people who are risktakers and innovaders in the context of their work also seem to take a lot of risks in their personal life and some of the consequences that can bring then we discuss some of the most transformative technologies that are now emerging such as novel approaches to developing clean energy as well as a i or artificial intelligence with respect to a i mark shares his views as to why a i is likely to greatly improve human experience and we discuss the multiple roles the a i is very likely to have in all of our lives in the near future mark explains how not to long from now all of us are very likely to have a i assistants for instance assistance that give us highly informed health advice highly informed psychological advice indeed it is very likely that all of us will soon have a i assistance that govern most if not all of our daily decisions and mark explains how if done correctly this can be a tremendously positive addition to our life in doing mark provides a stark counter argument for those that argue that a i is going to diminish human experience if your hearing about and were concerned about the ways that a i is likely to destroy us to day you are going to hear about the many different ways that a i technologies now in development are likely to enhance our human experience at every level what you will soon find is that while to day's discussion does centre around technology and technology development it is really a discussion about human beings and human psychology whether you have an interest in technology development and or a i i'm certain that you will find today's discussion to be an important and highly lucid view into what will soon be the fuature that we all live in before we begin i'd to emphasize at this podcast is separate fom my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element elements is an electrolite drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of the electrolites sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratioes but no sugar the electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health physical health and performance even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think our energy levels and our physical performance element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration and it does by including the three electrolites in the exact ratioes they need to be present i drink element first thing the morning when i wake up iually mix it with about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water if i'm exercising i'll drink one while i'm exercising in i tend to drink one after exercising as well many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because obviously we do not want to consume sodium in excess however for people to have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are consuming very clean diets that is consuming not many process foods or highly process foods oftentimes we are not getting enough sodium magnesium an potassium and we can suffer as a consequence and with element simply by mixingn water taste delicious it is very easy to get that proper hydration if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemen t dock clm slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el m ment dot calm slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep that is getting a great night sleep is the foundation of all mental health physical healh and performance when we are sleeping well everything goes far better when we are not sleeping well were enough everything gets far worse at the level mental health physical health and performance non one of the keythings to getting a great night sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is it ou have to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is because in order to full and stay deeply asleep you need your cor body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized you want your corebody temperature to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep it is very easy to induce that drop incor body temperature by cooling your mattress early in throughout the night and warming your mattress toward morning i started sleeping on an eght sleep mattress cover a few years ago and it is completely transform the quality of the sleep that i get much that i actually loathe traveling because i do not have my eightsleep mattress cover when i travel if you would to try eite sleep you can go to eight sleep doc cam slash hubermen and you will save up to a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ssa candida u k select countries in the eu and australia again that is ei sleep dot calm slash huberman and now for my discussion with mark and reason mark welcome hey thank you delighted to have you here and have many questions for you about innovation ah i your view of the landscape of tecand humanity in general i want to start off by talking about innovation from three different perspectives there is the inner game to speak or the psychology of the innovater or innovaters things their propensity for engaging in conflict or not their propensity for having a dreamer a vision and in particular their innovation as it relates to some psychological trait or expression we will get to that in a moment the second component that i'm curious about is the outer landscape around innovaders who they place them selves with a the sorts of choices that they make and also the sorts of personal relationships that they might have or not have and then the last component is this notion of the larger landscape that they happen to find themselves in what time in history what is the geography bayaria new york do by et cetera to start off is there a common trait of innovaters that you think is absolutely essential as a seed a to creating things that are really impactful i'm not a psychologist but i have picked up some of the cossipts a some of they have some of the terms and i iabere is a great moment o delight my life when i learned about the big five personality traits staas aha there is h way to actually describe er they answer of this question and at least reasonably scientific terms aand i i think what you are looking for when you r when you talk about real innovaters people who actually do really creator brig to work i think you talk abo t a couple things one is very high and what is called trait openness which is one o the bg one of the big five awhich is basely just flat out open and new ideas ainter course that the nature ofe traide openness is trate u en this neansyou are ot just open o new ideas an one categrare youre open to many different kinds of new ideas and we might talk about the fact that a lot of innovators also are ver creative people in other aspects of their lives right even outside of other ther their specific creative bomain that is important but of course just being open is not sufficient cause if you are just open you ou just bea curious an explorer right and spend your tire life reading and an doing thyu no talking o people and never actually create something you also need a a couple of their things you ned a high level of conscientiousness tres another one ofthe big five you ned somebody who is really willing to apply themselves inin our world typically over a period of many years right to be able ttto accomplish something right yothey tey they typicaly work very hard a that often gets obscured cause the stories thet at getting told about theses people are yows just thes tis cad nhe to say this idea and it was a stroke a genias and it was a moment en time and you knows just all he was lucky an the lic now why for most these people it is years and years an ears of of applied effort inso you needs you need somebody wit can extreme yoe o basy willingness to difer gratification an really apply themselves to aa specific thing for a long time a man of course this is why there re't very many these people as there are not many people who are high and openness andhigh and conscientiousnessicaus to certain exstent they are they are opposed right traits and you needsombody us both of those third is you ned somebody high and disagreeableness which is the third of the big five as you ned somebody who is just basically ordinary a right because if they are not ordinary then they will be talked out of their ideas by people who will be alle that s the reaction must be leve new ideas s toh that is done amen somebody who is too agreeable will be easily dissuaded to not pursue e know do not pull in the thread any more se need somebody highly disagreeable again thet nature disagreeableness as they tend to be disagreeable disagreeable about everything it they tend to be these very sout of aconiclastic kind of ranigad characters a and then there is just a tablestakes component which as they just also ne to be high acu they just stay just need to be really smart is is just it is hard to innovated any categor if you cannot sent the side large months information quickly a and those are for basically high spikes you very rare traits that basically have to a fe to come together ah you could probably also say they they probably some point need to be relatively low in nauraticism which is another the big five cons tif their juneurotic they probably cn't handle di stress it is kind of tis this this tile in there and thn a course of youre if you aren't if youren to this that the sort of science at ti five bits if e o these are all people who are on the far outlying kond of point on the on the normal distribution across all these traits and and then that just gets you to i think tha the sort of hardest topic of all around this thist this whole concept as just just there are very few of these people do you think they are born with these traits ye wll heyre born with the traits and then and then a corse the traits are not you nowt do nots ore not destiny and that that the traits are not determine estic in the sense of that you just cause they have those personallity trats does not mean ther theyre ano you kno deliver grat crativity but they need to have those properties because otherwise ther does not either gt to be able to do the work or the not can enjoy it righter i mean look a lot thes people are highly capable confitent people itis very easy for them to get high pangjobs in traditional institutions and get lots of you kno traditional words and enn up with big pa checks and there is lot of people at big institutions that we we know a youand i know well and i i deal with many of these where people get pait a lot of money and they get a lot of respect and they go for twenty years is grat and they never crate nd thing new right sa there is there is lot administrators a lot o them be a lot of thot of men of an anadministrative jobs am an thit is fine that is got the world needs seen ofthe world needs that also right tha ththe invators cannot run everything coes everythin that the the rate of change would be too high society i think pobably would beable to handle it you need some people who are on the other side who are in a cond keep the lights on and keep things running a but but there is this decision that people have to make which is a cay if i have the sort of latent capability to do this i's this ectally what i want to spend my life doing and do i want to go through the stress and the pain trama right ind the anxiety right in the risk of failure right and dodo i really want to once in a while you run in to somebody who just cannot do it any other way they they just have to wos an example thatn te lot yelants the mean of he haramonexample of our time and he and i i bring him up in part because tis ye such an obv is example but a parkcas he is talked about this a in in in ininterviews where he hebosly ses he is i cannot turn it off yes come i have to pursue them right it is why he is running five companies at the same time and working on a sects right a iitis just he cannot he cannot turn it off you non loik there is a lot of other people who are pprobably have the caability to do it who and it up talkin themselves in to or whatever events conspire to put them in a position where they d something else a you kn obviously the arepeople who try to be treative who just do not have the the cupability and therthere ise some bandiagram there of determinism through traits but also choices in life and then also o course the situation of which they are born the contect within which they grow up culture right what their parents expect of them and d im forth and you have to you knyoucannat get al the way through this you have to thread all these all these natles ken of at the same time do you think there are folks out there that meet these criteria who are disagreeable but that can fane agreeableness that can for those just les ing marches raised his right hand em am another words that thet cansort of em phrase that comes to mine maybe because i can relate to a little bit they em sneak up through the system meaning they behave athically as it relates to the requirements o the system they are not breaking laws ar breaking rules in fact quite the opposite there paying attention to the rules and following the rules until they get to a place where being disagreeable feels less threatening to the were over all sense of security yow we lok the really highly competent people do not have to break laws right its it is the there was this there was this there was tha myth you kow that sai er happen roun to b be the god father and then there is thas care to mire lansky youu know whois ran basicthy to offya yuknow fifty sixty seven years ago and there is a stof scrat line of well my lanscead only applie him self tor any general motors he woul tav bend the best sey of all time it is know not really right people who are greater ound be companies theydo not have to they on't have to be mobosses thy do not have to break laws they can they cant they can do they can work it the there is smartnes ophisticated enough to be able to work it side the sist hem thy doft need to take the easy out i do nothink there is any implication that they have to you now that they have to if to be claws that said theyhave to rect normous right in in n specifically athe thing this is probpably the thing that gets miss the moscus the process of the process of innovating the processecrating something new once it works the stories get rat con as they say a in comic books the stories get adapted to our it was inevitable all long you kow everybody always knew that this was a good idea the person has won altheys a ward society embrace them and is if if ininvariably if you if you were with them when that was when theywere actually doing the work or if you actually get a couple drinks into them and talkn about it of bey now that is not how it happen at all they faced a wall of skepticism just a wall of basically social essentially denial no this is not in ta work no i'm not going join your lab no i'm not gonto comeer for your company no i'm not con oa buy your product right now i'm not goin to meet with you and they they they they get just tremendous social recistems i the the they are not getting positive feed back from their from from their social not works the way that more agreeable people need to have rightn tis is why theso i agreeableness is the problem for inovation if you your agreeable you are inlist in the people around you they can to tell you that new ideas are stupid great end of story you are't you are not goin to proceed u and i would put it more on they need to be able to deal with then you beal i deal with social discomfort to the level of ostriacism m or at some point they'r gento get shaken out and theire discintaquit doyou think that people that meet these criteria do best by banding with others that meet these criteria early or is it importanthat they form this deep sense hifself deability to cry oneself to sleep at night or you knon't line the feedal position worrying thet things are not going to work out and then still get up the next morning and get red back out there john prarker has the best line by the way onnon this he says a now being ow being out to prerner being a creator is a ou now getting puchd the face over and over again he said eventually you start to the tasteof yor own blood and i love that lyine cause it makes everybody massively un comfortable ri but it gives you a sense of how basically painful the process is ysou talk any outor brner you nos to of who is been through it about that there ayo that is exacthat is exactly what its there is this there is a big individual component to itbut but look it can be very lonely right and especially ween a very hard i think to do this if if nobody round you is trying to do anything youven remotely similar right an for getting just universally negeative responses udo not very few people i think very few people have the ego strength to be able survive that for years i do think tere is a huge advantage and in this wy you u you see clusters is he huge ad vanish to clustering right and you et ind in you to throughout histery you have had this clustering of fact right you hav clustering of the great artists and sculpters and ranicence florence you have the clustering of the flusfers of grees you hae the clustering on of tect people is siloik a valley you have the clustering iv creative fu now arts mov tv people and loss angelus right and forth and on fir there is always a scene right there is there 's all there is always a nexis and a place or where people come to gether for for these kins of things generally speaking somebody wants to work antack in ae it intact there can be much better off being around a lot o people who are trying to do that kind of thing than they are ou kno place wher nobody else is doing it having said that the clustering has you can have downsides they can have side of facts and and you put any group of people to gather and you do start to get group think even among people who are individually very dis agreeable and these same clusteris where you get these very ideous and cratic people they do have fads and trans just every place else rigt and they get they get they get wrapped up in their own social dynamics to good news this the social dynamic in those places is usually very forward looking right and it is usually it is usually it is idedon wits a hurd of a conoc class looking for the expict thing right a conto class look ing for thexpect thing that is good the herd part right thats whar you got to be careful of even when you are in one of the environments you have to be careful that your not getting sect in to the roup think to much we say group think you mean excess ive friction do you do pressure testing each other's ideas to the point where thinks just do not move forward or you talking about group think where people to start to form a consens is ar the self belief that gosh we are strong because we are different whul he can we bett re difind group think especially less youither one of those things both happen those are goods s those are good ah the part of grup think i'm toing about is just we all we all basically zeroan we we desend observing ou n the same ideas riht thehen holly way thers this classic thing its anthethethei their years were te lv us in thereis a lot of volcano vovies think why are their pese volcadomiies and it is just ito there is just something in justall right there is jus something in the air you now the look tack the silkyn valley has this therre thereare moments in time where youll iu'll have these watit is the old thing i what is difference fon the fat in the trenc right the fact fat is the trin that does not last right and you kno selling a valley is subject tof fats and both fats and trends just any place else wright notherwords you take smart disagreable people woe pleasin together they well act a herd rght they they well end oup thinking the same things unless they try very hard not to you have talked about these personality traits of great inovaters before and we are talking about them now you invest in innovators you try and identify them and you are one you can recognize these traits her are making the presumption that you have these traits indeed you do will just a get that out of the way have you observed people trying to feign these traits and are there any specific questions or behaviors that are give away that their pretending to be the young steep jobs or that their pretending to be the the young henry ford u picture list of other other names that qualify us authentic legitimate innovaters we will not name names of people have tried to disguise themselves as true innovaders but what are some of the i the the litmis tests and ai realize here that we do not want you to give these away to the point where their i lose their potency but if you could share a few of those theno gedward resh prettyon book on the m yes soso first of all yes tere are people who dovt my try to comman and they s persound ass thing something ot they re not and theyyou kno lif theyve read l the books they will have listen at this interview right theythey will they know they tudy everything an they they construct a fasad and they commen to present to something theyr not i mi say the amount of that varies exactly correlated to the nastack rgt and when stock prices are superlow oune aloy get the opposite was sir prices of superlow people get twotomora lives and people who sould be doing it basically give up cause they just think hat whatever whatever twuld the industries over the tran is over whatever it is all hopeless an you get this flushing things annobody ever shows up at a stock market low riton says on the nw an the ne an the new next tick thing and and and doestand and does not really want ed do it because because there are higher status the kinds of people who do the thing tht you are dig but there they'r fundamentally ranted for social status the're they are trying theyr theyre the'r tryngto get the social status that without ashy without actuallyte substance and there are always other places to go get social status sso after two thousand the joke was im when i got to selling avalleya ninety three nety four the valley is dead we we dack bout that by ninety eight it was roaring and you had a lot of these people showing up youre basou basy had a lot f lot people showing up with withside of ten a stories two thousand marcecrash but two thousand one the joke was that im there were these terms be t see and be to b and in nineteen ninety eight they men be to seamen im a business to consumer and be to bem int businese to business just the two diffren kinds of business models fin in at companies but two thousand one a be t be to be mence back to banking i be to seamen back to consulting t right which is the high status people who that people orianted to status who showed up to be in tac we'rl gasscrew it this is over stick a forcan and i'm to go back to you knon gobasacks or go back to makinsiy you knowr i can merrican merrican be hig status and youyou you get this flushing kind of a fact that happens in it in a down turn that' set on in a big upswaing out you you get you get a lot of get a lo of people showing up with with a lot of umyou knw with a lot of yu knon koind of lessay public persona without the substance to backan up im the way we stress thatgnactly say exactly how we test for this which because it is the tast exactly addresses the issue in a way that is impossible to fake and an esecially tis sectualy the same yhomiside detectives tryin to find out if u if u if you if you have actually your innacenty hethe you kill somebody its the same its the same tactic a which is you you ask increasingly detailed questions a right and ththe way a homasycop does this as you kow what wre ou doing last night you knoh i was at a moving which moving without i o which theatre you knowt y which seated you sit oka what was the end of the moving i lik right and you ask increasiy detail questions and people have trouble it it is some point people have trouble making olp and things just fus in tat just cone about vioust bulshet and basically fake founders basically have the same problem they have a consta very able to really a conceptional theory of wha they 're doing that they have kind of engineerd ah but as they get in the details that just i just fusses out whereas the the the true people that you want a back that can do it basically what you find is they have spent five or ten or twenty years subsessing on the details of whatever it ist thereabout to do and they are deep in the detailes that they know much more about it than you ever will an fact the best possible reactions when they get mad right which is also a homisi cosay ig ichactuly wys youu astuly want them you on't beous they want the emotional response of i cannot believe that you are asking me questions this detailed and spe ific and picky and they kind of figure out what you are doing a and then they get upset that is go that is perfect right but but but they they have ou but then they have to approve in themselves and in the sense of they have to be of lask the questions n in in great detail do you think that people that are able to answer those questions in great detail have actually taken the time to systematically think through the iffands of all the possible implications o what they aregoing to do and they have a specific vision in mind of how things need to turn out or will turn out or do you think that am they have a a vision and it is a no matter what it will work out because the world work sort of bend around it i mean in other words you think that they place their vision in context wor they simply have a vision and they have that tonnel vision of that thing and that is can be it let us use you furding sample am with netscape ii mean it is how i first came to know your name am when you were conceiving n at scape di you think ocate there is this serch ngin in this browser in an it is going to be this thing that looks this way an works this way and feels this way did you think that and also think about that there was going tobe a gallery of other serch engines and it would fit into that landscape of other sorcengions or just projecting your vision of this thing as this unique an special bringchild i mat w give the general answer an that we can tuck about the specific exnemp the general answer is ot from aterbrner sha greativity annovation as what economist call decision making under in certainty and it is have been both parts as important decision makeing your catn make a tono decisions cos if to decide what to do what not to do and an uncertainty which is the world's a complicated place n an mathematical terms the royal is a complex adapto system with feed back loutes and it is really imin it it is it is exstretyn isagasm of rothing t another in his novels he he wrote about this feeld call psychlo hastry ort which is they idea that ther lyke a supercon puter that can predict the future of human affairs right and it is we do not have that yyrthat later we stenly doft have that yet a and you are just dealing you do not military a a commanders call this the fog of war rigt youyouyou are just dealing witht situation where the number variables are just off the charts it is all these other people right who are inherently in predictable making all these to cisions in different directions and then the whole system is commenatorial which s sees people a cliding with eath other in fluence in the decisions and i may look the most straight forward con a way to think about this is i just it is amazing anybody believes in economic centra planning it oif blows my mind cas is sually is just try openg a restaurant try just opening a restaurant on the corner down here and fifty fifty odds the restauants can a work an all you have to do it a run a restaurant is have a thing in sir food and and i's most restaurants fail right and in res tauant people run restaurants are pretty smart the the usually think about these things very hard thy all want a succeed and it it is hard to do that and to start it ta company or to start an artistic movemen or two or to fight a war r you are just going into this basically about conceptional battle ground or you military turns real battle ground where there is just incredible levels of complexity branching future paths dso thethere is nothing it is its you konsther's nothing pedictable en w weel of fourse they see tha the the sort a drot put thtthe really good innovators they have got a drive to basically be able to cope with that in deal withthat and they they basicaly do that an two steps one is they try a pre plan as much as they possibly can and and and we call that the process of navigating the call the idea maze right and the idea maze basically as i've got the general idea n it might be the inearnest gan to work or surture whatever and the i cychoct in their head they have thought through if cok if tie do it this way that way this third way heare's what will happen then i have to do that hand i have to do this then i have to bring us imtty do that here is the tennical challeng him gen a hit and they have got in their v goin their heads as best anybody could they have they have got as complete a sort of a map of possible future sise they can possibly haven th and this is where i say when you ask them in creasing detail questions that is whit you are trying to kind to get them to kind and chart out is o ka how far ahead have you thought and how much are you anticipating all of the different twist an turns at this skinto take o case then they start on day one and then of course what happens is now they are an't now the're in it they are ind now the're in the fog war right theren thrue turn certainty and now that idea maze is maybe not helpful practically but now they'egoin to be basially constructing o on the fly day by day as they learn and discover new things and tat's the world changes around them and of course it is of feed back loo ecause they are nin a chare not youknw if theyre's things starts to work it is can o change the world and then the fact the world is changing as ganto cause te know their plan to youknow to change as well am and yot the great wit the geat ones basically they they course correct they court the great ones course corect every single day you knw they take stock of what they have learned a they they modify the plan a the geat one's ten to think in terns of hypotheses a scientific sort of mentality which as ta tend to think coke i'min to try this i'm going to go into the world im man a nounce thim doing this for sure iam goin to say this is my plan am ittell my employs that and tel my vestures that i mon t put is take in there owns my plan in themen to try it right am and even though i sound i have complete certainty i know that i need to tes to find out whether it can work and if it is not then i have to go back to ofto same people i have to say while actually when it going left for going right and they have to run that lo thousands of times right in theyhad you now to get through the other side ofd it this this light of the creation of this great term pivot which has been very helpful in our industry cas tthe word when i was when i was on the wern we use wat fuck up a tificlike sounds much better omething much more professional but yet you make mistakes ist just ust just too complicated understand you course correct you ould just you evolve often these things at least in business the business is that end of working really well tend to be different than the original plan but thats that is part of the process of a really smart founder isictly working their way through reality right as as as their executing their lan the way youre describing this has parallels to a lot of models an biology tand the practice of science a random walks but hat are not truly random seuto random walks in biology et cetera but one thing that a is becoming clear from the way you are describing this is that i could imagine a great risk to early success for instance somebody develops a product people are excited by it i'm they start implement that product but then the landscape changes and they do not learn how to pivot to use the am less profane version right they do not learn how to do that in other words the and i think of everything these days am r most everything in terms of a rewardscheduals and dopamean reward schaduls cause that is the universal currency of reward i' and when you talk about the shohn parker quotof i'm learning to enjoy the taste tof one's own blood that is very different then learning to enjoy the taste of success right it is about internalizing success as a process of being self determined and less agreeable et cetera in otherwords building up of those five traits becomes the source of dope o mean perhaps in a way that is highly adapt uts on the outside we just see the product the end product the iflone the mack book the thatscape et cetera but i have to presume and i'm not a psychologist am but i have the nero physiology and of a studyed the dopening system enough to know that what is being rewarded in the contects of what you are describing sounds to be reinforcement of those five traits rather then oh it is going to be this particular product or the companys can a this way the logoes can to be this or that that all seems the preferal to am what is really going on that great innovators are really in the process of of establishing neural circuitry that is all about reinforcing the me and the process of being me yes this this goesty asis as extrinsic verses intrinsic medivation and thet's the ty jobs conisanversion o this writer this cerna hippiversion of this was the journey is the reward an yeyeu se i ste as told yes told his employs that its looke we know everybody thinks in terms of these big public markers thistlike price or the ipiow ore the product launch or whatever es now it is esactually the the process itself is the point right if you had your point if you hve that metality than that is int that is an intrinsic motivation ot an ex extrinsic motivation and and that is a kind of intrancic motivation that can keep you going for a long time another way to think about it is competing against yourself right it is can i get better at doing this right n can i prove to myself that i can get better im there is also big social component to this and this is one of the reasons why soike a vally punches far above its wagt as a place im there is a psychological componentwhich as also goes to the comparison set i'm a phenomena that we have deserved over time is the leading a ta company in any city we will axpire to be as large as the previous leading ti company in that city but often not larger right caus s theys sort o had to have a model of success and as long as they beat that level of success they kind of you non't checke the box they have made its theny t et but then in contrast your inselic avally and you look around on it is just thace book an tisco an orical and to te packard and gladiators yen you just looking at these giants you no many of them mor still e knot our suckerberg still you knon't go n to work every day and trynatran likeand these people are a leno th the romales are alive right there n it is clear how much better they are and how much bicker theire complishments are and what we find is young founders and that environment have much greater espirations rekos it just again if it maybe mayit that what may be as the social status maybe theres there is n extrinsic component to that but ir mayere maybe it helps calibrate that in ternal system the bassically say actually you do not know the opportunity her is not to build a local you k which may all local maximum frm a success but let us buill to a global maximum form a success which is which is something is mick as ompossibly can i'm ultimately the great ones are probably driven more internally than externally when any one it comes down to it and that is where you get this phenomen wereyou get people who are extremely successful an extremely welthy wh very easily compunch out and move to f g indust call it and there is still work in sixteen hour days ranis is ah obviously something explains tathanas nothing do with external rewards andan i think it is it is it is an eternal thing as many of i've been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsering the pod cast ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with ag one i'm sure to get enough vitemens and minerals and the probiotics that i need endit also contains adaptagins to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to ta sgrite for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer g one if you would to try ag one they will to drink ag one doc cam slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitemen d three k to again that is drink ag one dot cam slash hubermen i've heard you talk alot about the inner landscape the inner psychology of these fokesen i appreciate they were going e been deeper into that to day and we will talk about the landscape rown wether not silicon valley or new york whether not their specific cities that are ideal for certain types of pursuits i think thre as an article written by palgrams some years ago about am the conversations that you over here in a city will tell you everything ye need to know about whether not you belong there a in terms of your a professional pursuits a some of thats changed over time and now we shoul pally ad austen to the mixas a cause it was written some time ago in any event i want a return to that but i want to focuss on an aspect of this in trinsic versis etrinsic motivators in terms of something that is a bit more criptic which is a one's personal relationships ouknow if i think about the a catalogue of innovators and silicon valley some of them stive jobs had complicated personal ladge romantic personal lives early on and i sounds he worked it out i do not know i ad i was not there a couples therapis but he a when he died he was in marriage that for all the world seem a happy marriage a you also have examples of innovators who have had many partners many children with other partners elon comes to mind a the on't ly i'me discloseing anything that is not already obvious am those could have been happy relationships and just had many of them but the reason i'm asking this as you can imagine that for the innovator the person with these traits whose tryn to build up this this thing whatever it is that having some one or several people in some cases a who just truly believe in you when the rest of the world may not believe in you yet or at all could be immensely powerful and we have examples from cults that a i embody this we have examples from politics we have examples from tacinnovation and science and iave always been fascinated by this because i feel its the more cryptic and yet very potent form of allowing soe one to build themselves up it is a commination of inner psychology and extrinsic motivation because obviously if that pers n we are to die or leave them or cheat on them or that you kon pare up with some other innovater which we have seen several times recently end in the past it can be devastating to that person but what are your thoughts on the rule of personal and in particulary romantic relationship as it relates to people having an idea and their feeling that they can really bring that idea to fruition in the world itso real next bag you have philos of examples in all directions and i think it' something it' something something following first as we talked about the personality tracs of these people they tend to be highly disagreeable does not foster a good romantic relyt i wifct ben really i may have heard that once or mice you a friend may have giveen me that exim ya right may be ou jus ne to find the right person who ompliments that an its willing to youknow there is there is lot of relationships ware you it is always this question about relationships right which is o you an a have the same personality profrofile the same behaviorale tratespasesicallyas yhour partner or deso an i have yu knwsaistis is at an opposites opposite thing and you kno l i'm sure you have sen that our relationships for you will hve somebodyes highly disagreeable whos spared with smebody is highly agreeable an ire su eres ot right cause one person just gess to be on their sop mokself the time an th other persons just look i it is fine right its fine it is good a youe plet too disagreeable people to gather maybe sparks fly and they have great conversations all the time and may be they come to hate each other and u anyway these people if you are gin to be with one of these people your firshing out of the disagreeable end of the pond and and again when i see disagreeable i do not mean youn these arre yhese are normal distributions i do not mean sixty per cent disageablhat eighty per sent disagreeable th people were talking about a ninety nine point nine nine perspect isagrareeable rights o these are ornery ordinery people part of it is that and then of course they have the other personality traites right there there super conscientious their superdriv and as a consequence they tend to work really hard they tend an ot have a lot of time for camlifications for other things there not they wont an they dn't enjoy them if they are force to call on them and again that he kind of thing can frita ind a relationship ththere is a there is a fair min in there that is loaded somebody is in a partner with one of these people in theses to be signed up for the ride that that is a hard thing it is ahard thing to do or you need a true partnership or two of these which is also hard to do i think ut's part of it and the look i think a big part of it as you kow people achieve a certain level of success and you knw either in their minds or publicly and then they start to be abl to get away with thanks i and they start to be able to psike woloca now were rich and successful and famous and now i ave deserve an thisore y get i've have you this now in the relm of personal choice you get i in this thing where people start to think that they to serve thinks and they start to behave in very bad ways ins send them they blow up their personal worlds as a consequence and maybe they have regret at later and may be they do not salways a always a question yes i think there is that and then i dontkno yes some people just need maybe the other part of it as some people just need more emotional support than others and i do not know that that is a big i dn't kno that that telts eitheir way i know i know some of these people who have great loving relationships and seem to draw very much on having this kind of firm foundation to rely upon and ten i know other people who are just their personal liveser just toa continue a strain rack and it does not seem does not seem to matter professionally they just keep doing what they are doing and and and maybe there is a maybe we can talk hereabout it whatever is the personality tate for ristaking some people are incredibly risk prone that they need to take a risk an all asjects of their lives at all times if if if part of their life get stable they find a way to blow it up and that some some of tese people you could describe in those terms also et let us talk about that because i think risttaking and sensation seeking is something that fascinates me for my own reasons and in my observations of others does it dove tail with these five traits in a way that can really serve innovation in ways that can benefit everybody the reason i say to benefit everybody is because there is a view of how we are painting this picture of the innovater as jist really cruel person but often times what we are talking about our innovations that make the world far better for billions of people ninclain by the way we everyting were ting but also is not just in tack or sciencer or in in business it is all s everyhing wralso tock motis true for the arts rightso no nyor the history of artistic expression as seein youn yo people with all fhecan kinds of tres wel see about piccaso and his and his regular turn over of lovers and partners and he was very open about the fact that it was one of the sources of his productivity a slash creativity he was not shy about that i i always lrwards alive to day i might be alow that dever he might be judge o will differently right or that was his story for behaving in a pattern that thit is very no awful for thepeople around him and he did not care right might maybe they left him noho knows right you knowt tis puts in takest all this but but no case i have a theories o her heare's a theory this this is one of these i keepe a list of thingstht'll get me kicked out of dinner party atitopics an a given point we read it before he go in yi just i i on onn on o re call that i can i can get out of these things but here heare's the thing they get me kicked out of dinner party a especially these dhays i think of the kind of person whereis sjike very clear that they are superhig out two point there is somebody s superhigh output whatever to main therein they done things a fundamental ly change the world they brought knew whether his businesses or tychnologies or art you worse of art i you kno entire schools of of creative expression some cases up to the world and then at a certain point they blow themselves to smitherins right and they do that either through a massive financial scandal they do that through a massive personal you non' break down they do that through some sort of public expression the cause os them a huge a mont of problems they say they say the wrong thing may be not once but several hundred times and blow themselves to smitherins and and there is this youknow theres this kind of arc there is this moral arc that people kind of ano ply which hiy's the icaris tha th flying too close to the sun and now he had a coming and he needed to keep his ego under control and y get kind of this you now cont of this this this this judgement that applies u i have a different theory on this the term i use to describe these people and a lot of and by the ay a lot of other people who do not act to blow themselves up tut get close to it which is the whole nothe set of people ah ah i call them marters to civilizational progress right and were backward civilizational progress lok the only way civilization gets move forward is when people this do something new right cause civilization as a whole does not do new things right grupsof people do not do new things right these these things do not happen automatically lik bt b by default nothing changes the only way civilization'll change on any of these axies ever happens is because one of these people stands up and says no no i men to do something different than what everybody else as every done before this is the this is progress this is actually how it happens sometimes they get lin as to reworded sometimes they get crucified ssometimes the crucification is literal sometimes this justyou kno symbolic but they are those kinds of people aand then and then nd then marters whenwhen they go down in flames they have and and again this is where it really scruce of people's moral judgments caus everybody wants to have the sort of superclear story of cok he did a bad thing and he was punished and i am noneo oo kno n he was the kind of person who was going to do great things and also was going to take on a level of risk and take on a level of sort of extreme behavior such that he was going to expose himself to flying to close the sun wingsmeltn crashd toa ground but but it is a package deal right the reason you have the pecasos an the betovens and all these people is because they are willing to take these extreme level of risks they they they are that creative an original not just in their art or their business but in everythng else if they do if they will set themselves up to be able to fail psychologic a psychologist would probler psychatrist or palways say yu kow may be yuknow to what extent to they ashally they have a death wish do they do they shally you kow it some point to they want to punish themselves o thy want to fail that i do not know but you see thats they they they they deliberately move themselves to close the sun you can se you can see what has happening caus if they get too far from the sunthe deliberately move back towards it right they kow they they come right back and tey they they want the risk aandso anyway i i yach marters to civilizational progress this is how progress happens when these people crash and burn the natural you now inclination is to judge morally i tend to think we should basically say look and and i do not even kow if this means giveng them a moral pass thor whatever but it is look this is how cible they civilization progresses and we need at least understand that there is a self sacrificial aspect to this may be tragic and and oftin is tragic but it is it is quite litterally self sacrificial are there any examples of great innovaters who we are able to compart mentalize the risttaking ot to such a degree that they had what seem to be immorally impacable life in every domain except in their business purceds that is right some people are very some people are very highly controlled that im some people are able to very narrowly andi don' i do not renly want to sihe myself in exmple in a lot of this but i will tell you as an example i ni will never use dat in business i number one number two i have the most plascid personal life you can imagine number three ve i'm the least last person th world is ever do an extreme sport man i'm not even going to go in the sawn on the iyesbath they i'm noi'm not doing any this i do not der doing it i'm not o lwekying no i i'm no no not i tat ih i'm not on the tight and i'm not you kow i'm not goim down to see the ti tanic litness t you wearen' im not doing any thi i'm not doing any the stuff i've no interest i do not all i do not skee i i've no interest in any of the stuff right and there are and i know people this right thoare very highchievers is just yat they they'r they are they are completely sigmant ed the're extreme ristakers in business tere completely buttond down on the personal side the'r completely buttond down you kow finacially the're they theyre scrute scrupulous who following every rule in law you can poss ly imagine but but they are still fantastic intovators and that i know many others who are just theye hetheir life is on fire all the time in every possible way and whenever it looks the fire is turning in t embers they figer out a way to religke the fire ht m an they just really want to live on the edge ndso i i think thats maybe i think that is an independent baryable an again i would apply the same thing i think the samething a plies to the arts myou classical music as an example i think bock was you non fras an example one of them we not kind of best o musicians of all time had just completely sedate persona l life never had any averent behaviour at all in is personal life famil family man cons acads py apparently you now pillar of the community ight and if bouh could be bouht and yet not burn his way through three hundred mistressress or whatever maybe your canto in the amout these two different categories of innovaders those that take on tremendous risk in all domains of their life and those that take on tremendous risk in a very compartmentalized way im i doft knowhat the percentages are i but ihave to wonder if in this modern age of the public being far less forgivable i'm referring to is cancel culture im do you think that we are limiting the number of innovations in total bi just simply frightening or eliminating an eenormous category of innovaders because they do not have the confidence or the means or the im strategies in place to regulate they are just either bowing out or they are getting crossed off thor gtting cancelled one by one do you think the public is less tolerant than the used to be or more tolerant well the systems that a i i'm not going to be careful here i think the im the large institution systems are not tolerant of what the public tells them they should not be tolerant of im and if there is enough noise there is enough noise in the mob i think institutions bow out and here i'm refraing not just to univer they essentially say oca they let the cancellation proceed or they and maybe they are maybe they are the gaval that comes down but but they are not the the lever thet got the thing going and som not just thing about universities i'm also thing about advertisers a'm thinking about im the big movy houses that i'm cancel of film that a given actor might be in because they had something in their personal life that still getting worked out i'm thinking about people who im are in a legal process that is not yet resolved but the public his decided they area bad person et cetera my questions thag we really talking about the public iigritegry with question ma come back to it but mn mn s i m an examine one part of your question which is is this really the public wor talking about and nd i wud just say exhibit a as who is the current front runner a for the re publican nomination a to day the public lehest on one side of the political isle seems very on board right a number to look a there is a certain musician who flew too close o the sun blew himself to smitherand sees still hitting all time highs on a stran a muse ex stremes every month the public seems fine i i think the public might i i would argue the public as action more open to these things than it actually may be ever has been amwho could tik what ithas a case i think it is a it is a diferatiation this is what what your question as aming out but it is a differentiation between the public an the eleads amits al is al is ai my view is everything you just described as in a leat phenomenon a an actually the public is very much not on board with ut ishene an and what is actually happening as the division wut it wats happen as the publican he aleas of gapped out tthe the public is more for giving of of of what previously migh have been con sidered kind of abern extreme behavior am right is it til ave sgot fitsger all therre no second acts in american lives it turns out completely wrong turns that their second acts thertd acts forth as apparently canhave an linen number of acts the public is actually up for it i mean i think it somebody mi tison right i feel lik he is every e no his life examplifies a everything that is amazing and great and also terrible about america if we took rat tiesin to dinner to night at any restaurant anywhere in the night estates what would hapen hed be loved o he would be likelord he would be the outpouring of enthusiasm and passion and love would be incredible it would be unbelievelisinis a great example it just the and gi nont even to get a drop mor im navga say agre without a disagrv that of just we di think we would all intuitively know that the public is just one hundred resat absolutely he is a legent he is a legeing hes a living byt in love in mine hes a cultural touchtone absolutelyand you see when he shows up it movies reght he shows i've remember that i man the big rate throughr i figure the sat with respect to him cause i do not really falli sports but when he s howed up in that it as at that first hang over mevi and he shows out n u nows i was in a theatre and the augist disc but neon us crazy there is excited to see him yet he evokes delight i always say that nik tison is the only person i am aware of that can wear a shurt with his own name on it and it somehow does not seem a wrong in fact he just kind of makes you him more it is it his ego feels very contoured in a way that a he knows who he isnin who he was and and yet there is a there is a humbleness woven in maybe as a consequence of all that he is been through i do not know but yet people love my public levs him now exactly now you now f he shows up to likeshrt harvard i i think yeu can probably got to got in ti freaction i do not know i do not know wein david simon the ga who wrote the wire gave i gave a talk of harvard and and it sounded to me based on his report of that which is very interesting in fact that people adore people who are connected to everybody in that way a villic everybody loves mike from from above his datus besides belowis datus he is just or he he occupies this this halo of o loveind adoration o c yet men look at the other side of this as thet is is he llets and you conv alluding to the is of the institution it basically it is the people who ware at least nominally in charge or fee thas they should be entaryi want to make sure we a defind elet you not ness terly tiking my people who are wealthy your tling my people who have authority within institution the ultimate definition in aelea s who can get who fired right that is the old ultimate t who can get who fire blake hotted blackliss to an ostra sise when push prosecuted jailed i quud push constoshof right i think that is always the question who can destroy his career and f course you will notice that that is heavily e cymmetric emen ma men these fights play out theire is very clear whet i can get the other the other sid firein which side which side cannot am and yet lick i think we we live in a period of time or the eleass ave gottn to the extreme in a number dimansions in a man in thatin is characterized by for sure extreme group think am extreme sanctimony a extreme ina moral e sa dudgen a you kow extreme this this weird sort of modern purtanism ah and then an extreme sort of morality of punishment and terror ah i guesns they are prerceived enemies a but but i want ted i wnt to got through that because i ictually think i actually thik thit is a very different phenomenon i think what is happeneing they leats is very different that was happening in t in the population at large and that of course i i think thereis a feed back loop in there which is i think the population at large is not on board with that programm right i think the eletes are aware that the populatin is not on board of that programme i think they judge the population negatively as ae consequence that causes the eleast to harden their own positions that causes them to be even more alienating to the populatiment and there you kow theyren sort of an oppositional negative feed back loop ah and yeit is cantoby and it is but against the sort of question o who who can get who fired and itleads are really good at getting normal people fired a ostracize baands hippieces in the press whatever h yu kow for normal people to get a leats fired they have to really bantogother id really mount a serious challenge which mostly does not happen ubut might be startingto hppenen some casses do you think this am power of the of the eleats over amstemed from social media s or going against its original purpose amnw think social mediathing your giving each in every person theire onlal reality devetio their own voice and yet am we have seen a dramatic uptake in the number of cancellations in firings related to immoral behavior based on things that were either done or amplified on social media it is almost as if am the public its holding the wrong aend of the knife yes the way o describe it i use these two terms there is somebhot interchangeable but eleats in institutions and nd there there is somebot interchangeable con rens institutions the eleats ight is itso sort of a self renself r inforcing think a an now institutions of all kinds institutions at everything from in of government birocracys companyis not profit ts foundations engios te companies on anon an on people who are in people who ware in charge of big complexes and the thet carry a lot of basically power and influence in capability and money is a consequence of their positional authority right the head of a giant foundation may never have done anything in their life that would constamly neve a hapin of them masa person but they are in charge of this you knon't gyngantic molt ta billint our complex and have all this par the results that is just defined terms ou least institutions am it is eshly interesting a gallop a a has a been doing poles on the following quit on tha question of trust in institutions which is sort of there for proxy for trust in eleats a basey since the early inineteen seventys a and what you find and and they do this across all the categories of big institutions you o busy every every everyone i s talkd about a bunch abothers big business mall business banks newspapers broadcast telovision a the military police you theyv got thirty categories or something basey what you see is almost all the categorys base it be started in the early seventies that sixture seventy per cent trust and now theyv inbase i almost across the board they have just done it we had a complete bastically lineor slide down for fifty years exically my up my whole life a and the the thre now bottoming ouch congress and journalists bott amount it ten per cent i e jugrips everybody hates are congress andjournalists a and then it is a lot of other big institutions are twenty in their twentyes thirties forties ashally big business eshe scores fairly high tackactuy scores quite high the military scores quite high but basicaly everything else has really caved in and this thi sort of might findamental challenge everybody who basically says you you did not do this but you will hear this the simple form of this which is socia media caus the current trouble and it is call this in example ycollapse in faith in institutions and and leads 's call that part of the current trouble a eres ik all socia media caus antimsic ll not socia media socia media is new right in the last in such metings effectivelly new practically speaking since twenty ten twenty twelve as when it really took off aand if's the trans started in the early nige en seventies right in is ban continuous then we are dealing with something broader n na martin gury i wrote i think the best book on this calle the revolt of the public where he goes through this in detail and and he does he does say that i'm socia med ye had a lot to do with what is happened last decade besids is yet if you go back you look further it was basically two things coinciding one was just a general change in the media nvironments and particular the nineteen seven ties is when you started an especially thenineteen eighties is when you started to get am is if we talk radio which was a new outlet a and then you also start you has look out cabletelivision and then you also by the way seciall interesting in the fifty sixties you ar paper back books which is another one of these which was an outlet you you had a fracturing in the media landscape that started in the fifties through the eighties and then of course the inter nat ut wide open having said that if the alases an institutions were fantastic you would knw it more than ever she has information is more recessible and the other thing that he says and i agree with is thethe public is not being tricked in the thinking the bilyes institutions are bad theyre ther thei'r learning tit their bad right in the mystery and therefore the mystery of the gallop poleis why those numbers are not all just asero right which is ar you kno arguly yknewin lotti cases where they should be i think one reason that and by the way he thinks this is bad he and i have a differe view here is oure he and i disagree he thinks this is bad he he basically says you you cannot replace it leats with nothing you cannot replace institutions with nothing if if if just what you are just left with is justcan o be wreckag shian left with us as completely basically atamized how to control society that has no ability o marshall ou know any sort of activity any direction is jus tno be a doggy dog offul in a world i have a very different view on that which we canwhich we can tick about id love to ed love to hear your views on that i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood andy an e to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health golls i'm a big believer in getting regular blood

energy regulation if you to track inside tracker you can visit inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside trackor dok calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off that the quick question alwas can asked be for we go there is i think that one reason that i an many other people sould reflectively assume that social media cause the the demise of our faith in institutions is well first of all i was not aware of this i lack of correlation between the the decline in faith in institutions and and the rise of social media but secondarily that we have seen some movements that have is sentially rooted themselves in teats in comments in posts they get amplified and those treats and comment simposts come from everyday people in fact i cannot name one person who initiated ai given a cancillation or movement because it was the sort of dog piling or mob a'm adding on to some person of his assentiy anonymous i think that for many of us we ha we have the bottom to use norl science language a sort of a bottom up in a perspective oh you kow some one sees something am in their daily life or experiences something in their daily life and they tweet about it or they comment about it are they post about it and then enough people dog pile on the accused that am it picks up force and then the elets feel compelled u ob igated to cansel somebody a that tends to be the narrative and i think the logical conclusion is o oun a social media allows for this to happen whereas normaly some one would just be standing on the corner shouting or calling lawyers that do not have faith in them and you goet the the arran broch of itch model of a aum tht turns into a movy but that is a rare case of this lone woman who is got this idea in mind about how am big institution is is doing wrong a or somebody is doing wrong in the world and then can leverage beg institution excuse me but the way the you describe it is that the leats ar am ar leading this o y this shift hotersso what is the role of the public in it i mea men just togive it a concrete example a if for instance no one am tweeded or commented a me to or no one teated or commented about am some ill behavior of some o know universy faculty member or a business person would the leat have come down on them anyway oh an ways happening wulh be somewhat i've seen over th ears am is is it its there is much astra trafing right now there are entire categars of people who are pay to do this a some of them woe call turnalist a some of them woe call activeas some of them we call un ago now profit some ofthem we call university professors y some of them woe call grastodn whatever they are ay to do this e ouna reasoni done if you neverelook into the a this in formation a industrial complex there is the sole universe a basically these funded groups that basically do quotem cot missin for coto o miss informasion and and and they are constantly mounting these kinds of attacks they are constly trying to gin up this kind of basically panic to cause somebodyto get fire to it is not a grassory no it is the opposite ressorates no i' almost always retrace these things back it was it was a journalist it was an active as it was a it was a poy was a public figure of some kind am these ar atben there is thes are antbornervs in in a sort of word way theyre there basically there they are paid there they are job mission calling in li it is all wrapped up together they'r true believers but the're ls getting paid to do it handthere is a giant funning commyn here is a very large funning complex for this coming from you knowcertain ni profile o people who put huge monts money int is it is well known yes well i mean it is not my world this is what the socia media companies a ben on the receiving end of for the last ecape ah is it is this it is it is base it is basic it is basically a political media active ism complex with very depochits behind it and you have got people who baseit literally people who set all day and watch the t v net work on the other side or watch the trter feeds heither side and they wait they they basicaly waiht it is every politician is beent a case for long time not every every politician who goes out gof stuff speeches youl see there is always somebody in the crowd of the cand quarter r it now with the phone recording them and that somebody from the other campaign who is paid somebody to just be there and record every single thing the polishision says that that when a at romney says whatever the forty seven percent thing theyve got it on tape and then they clip it and the an the try to make a vieral hat thi stuff is and again these people believe what they are doing i'm not saying it is even dishonest these people believe hat theyr doing tey think they are fighting the holy war they think they are protecting himocracy they think they are protecting civilization they think they are protecting whatever it is they'r protecting ah but but they and then they know how to use the tools they they know how th they know how to tratage and up the outrage and then by the ways sometimes at work since you social cascates sometimes at work sometimes thit does not sometimes they cascate sometimes they do not but if you follow tese people and twetter the this is what they do every day the're couse they trying to life this fire right ah i a su ye it was is really bottom up but it sounds it sort of by the mead level and then and the the captures the eleats and then the thing takes on ir life of hi his own by the way it also intersects with the trust in safety groups at the socia media firms right who are responsible for figuring out who its promoted whok its band right across this and you will notice one large socia media company has recently changed hands and has tin pemeted a different kind of at of trust ind safety and all of a suddeny different kind of wy cotmovement has all of a sudden started to work that was not working before that and in another kind of by cotmovement is not workings volanymore ah an there is 't for sure there is an intermediation happening look that the stuff that is happening in the world to day as being intermediate d through s tro media consocian me is the defining media of our time ah but there are people who know how to do this dand do this for a living sso no i i very much viou this as a ihave you very much the cancellation way f this whole thing it is it is ait is ait is it is ain it is atn a leat phenomenon aand when it appears to be a grascerous thing it is it is it is it is either grasserates among the eletes which yeres is possible cause there is e no fairly large number people who are sind up for that that particlar grusade ah but there is also a lot of astrater from thes takcon placeinsid thetn the question is lookay at what point is the population at large ship pulled into this and and maybe maybe there are movements et certain points in time where they do get pulled in and then may be later they get dis solution than than there is some question there and then there is another question of well if the population at large as cin a dosip with these movents are or they gin to be the same movements is the feoleas want n now the a least howrdy least can a react when the population actually fully expresses itself right and there is nd i said there is a feed back lute between these where the more extremely eleas get they tend to push the population to markstreme views on theother side and vice virs sas soat pinkpinpox back and forth andso actises this is our world this explains a lot am i want to make sure that matma ti you a my a shallenburg er mati you be a bunchntes guise have done a lot of work just just if you just look in was called the mis in formation industrial complex you will find a network of money and power that is really quite amuzing i've seen am more n more shellenburger showing up am and hes just lhat you sut on thi stop he and he anti be taand there just their littlely just tracking money i is just its it is very clear ow the money flows inconcluding a remarkable mon of money out of the government ind wishes of course in theory very concerning ery interesting government should not be funding programms that take away people's constetional rights and yet somehow that is whatsment happening very interesting i want to make sure that i hear your ideas about wide the a decline in confidence in institutions and is not necessarily problematic m is its going to be a a total destruction burning down on the fo orse that will lead to new life is that your view welso this this is the thing and and look it is a question if youre tis couple questions in here which is lost how how bad is it really how bad are they ii you knowi think hit pretty bad a lot ofthem are pretty bectually bad a and itssso that is one to question and then yot tht look the other question is oquet if the institution has gone bad or a grip of vilieas ave gone bad can can its this wonderful word reform i can can can they be reform and everybody was mast to reform everything and yet somehow nothing ever quite ever gets reformed i a and we plon't try to reform you ar house ind polsing to barrier fordectason we are not kno ling tere bellin fyour houseis han ever before somehow reform movements seem to lead to more jusst more badstuff but anyway if you have an existing astution can it be reform can it be fixed from the inside you the li quat's happenin universities there 's tha lott er there professoris ar stamford as an example who very much think that they can fix stanford i ii do not now what you think it does not seem its going and productov directions right now ell i mean there' many things about stamfor that function extremely well an it is a big institution it certainly got its issues any other place a there also my employer ni me some interesting loks hou wants me to get a litle more vocal here a no no you doft no oh no i man i thnk that im me o peems yet i mean one of the things about being a research or a big institution stamford is what first of all it meats the crichery the describe before you look to the left you look to the wrighter anywhere above or below you and you have excellence ri i mhy ave go noble prize when below me whos dad hy also want to know about prize and there is scientific offspring is likely to win i mean you it it inspires you to do bigger things than than one ordinarily whald no matter what there is that and that is great and that persists am there is all the a bure cratic red tape about tryng to get things done and how to implement decisions is very hard a and there lot reasons for that and then of course therear e the things that a you knon't any peopler aware ofer there are a public accusations about people and positions af great leadership and that is getting played out ins and the whole thing becomes kind of overwhelming and a little it opaque when you are just tryng to b run your lab we'r live your life and i think one of the reasons for a this lack of reform that you referring to 's because there is no position o reformer riht deans are dealing with the lot of issues provus or dealing with a lot of issues presdents are dealing with a lot of issues and and then som in some cases and we do not have a dedicated role of reformer some one to go in and say listen there is just a lot of fat on this sand you we need to trem it or we needs o create this or dou that there is there just as in a system to do that and that is i thinking part because a universities or are built on old systems and it is build it is the n york subway s still it is amazing it still works as well as it does and yet it is got aton of problems also well its to te to te to the point the point wic i recon devatea the the ouniversitue specificlly but thy the point is look if you do think it se sisequent bad then you have to make it never mind youg to fick out if you think it stu to to rent bat but the population largely does think that at the very least the people are rint institutions ought ae really think hard about what that means but people still strive to go to these places and i still hear from people who lit for instance did not go to college or talking about how university degree is useless they will tell you how proud they are that their son or daughter is going to stamford wor is going u sea laor is going to banish champagne i mean it is almost to me that is always the most a shocking contradiction is yet these institutions do not matter but then when people wone to hold up a card that says why their kit is great it is it is not about how many pushups they can doer that they started their own business most of the time it is their going to this university and i think what is going on here do you thnk the medin voter in the mati states can have their tic o to stamford no no no and an and you do not medie voter in te states could have the kit admitted to stamford even with perfect tasaty no no n this idan age the competition is fierce that it requires more first of all i gan re dealing here yes yo re dealig wirthere with a small number of very illy institutions people may ad mire them or not amost people are have no kondactivity to the whatsoever in the statistics in the wholing universities are not doing well the but the population at lawr a yot whe may have fantasies about ther get going stamford but the reality evtitence the have a very very tay collapsing vie of these institutions a soso nwits is his tis shol go straight to the questionof alternatives thand right which is oque if you believe that there is colassicg faith in the institutions if you believe that it is merit at least in some ways a if you believe that reform is effectually impossible then you are face w andwe can debate each of those but e population at large seems to believe a lot of that a then there is a question of oue cant can it be replaced and if are you better off replacing these things basically while the old things still exist or do you acually need to basically clear the field to beableto have the new thing exist the universities are great cay study of this because of the student because of ho student loans work right and the and the wast tudent lons work is to to be able to be a unitto be to be an actual competitive universityn compete you need to have actiess to federal student lending is if you do not everybody has to pay out a pocket than it is complete lhy out to reach for anybody other than a certain class of either extremely rich or foreign now students a see ned actess federal student lon facility to get actess to federal studntlon facility to be an a credited university guess who runs the acreditation concil i do not know thexisting universities right sotsa it is it isa it is a it is a it is it is h self landering machine they they decideod the u universities are guess how many new universities get a credit ed right easyer to be able zera an zero right a and as long as that system is in place an as long as they have the government wired the way that they do in as long as they control who gets access to federal student loan funding of course there is not cnto be any competition iof course there cannot be a new institution its cannot be able to get to scale it is not possible and if you actually wanted to create a new system that was bettery in the at would thar ou doesns sor hundreds of ways ic could offase offace yu be better if you restorning to day a it probably cannot be done as long as the existing institutions are actually intact aan n thit is my conteragainst t to martin which is you we luck ww forget to tear down the old there may be a pearin o destruction before get the new but we are never ging to get to the new if we do not tared on the old when you say counter to martin you tellyu mut the author of revolt tof the barger yout eargery says is look is he said basically m what martin says martn says is as follows a the eletes deserve contempt but the only thing worse than thesiletes that deserve contempt would be noalease at all right in in in ecause any basically says on the other side on the other side of the destruction of the eletes in the institutions is is nihilism you are baseo left with nothing an then by the way there is a nihilistic street coming there is anihilistic street in in the culture in the politics to day there are people who basically would just say yo jus tur ter th whole system down right in thewithout any particular plan for for what follows and you you h i think he makes a good point and that you want to be careful that you actually have a plan on theither side that you think is actually achievable butbet thi but again the counteragum to that is if you are not willing to actually carred on the old you are not getting get to the new now whats heirest of course is this is what happens everyday in business right the entire way how how do that the capital ist system works the way that is that the old companies when they are no longer the best to what they do they get torn down and then they ultimately die and they get replace by better companies have not seen u seers in a while exactly and we know it is tut interesting is we know in in capitalism in arket economy we know that that is the sign of health the sign of how the system is working properly right in fact we get actually judge by anda trust authorities in the government on that basis right it is the best to fance agaist and a trustcharges is no people are comen ekellus an tha're doing a riliga job of it thathat that is how we know we are doing our joban in fact in business we are specifically it is specificaly illegal for companies the same minstery to get together and plot and conspire and plan and have things these ar creditation bureaus we we would get if i created the equivalent in my companies of the cond of creditation burow that the universitie shave i'd get straight to fidle prison and i trust viilation sherman act straight to prison people h ebeen sent to prison for that in the business world we know that you want everything subject to market competition we know that ou want crat if destruction we know that you want replacement of the old with with superior new just once we get outside of business for all we doft want anythat w we want be say stagnation and log rollang right and in satyiu o adbasically ou istitutional you kow as e suress you knw an tanglements and conflicts if inturest as far as the eye can see and then we are surprised by the results let us play it out as a bit of thought experiment let us say that one small banding together of people who want to start a new university where free exchange of open ideas were unless somebody has aggregious behavior violent behavior truly sextually in appropriate behavior against somebody you now the committing a crime i they are allowed to be there there allowedto be a student or faculty member were administrator and let you say this a accredidation bureau a loud student loans for this one particular universiy or let us say that there was an independent source of funding for that university such that students could just apply there they did not ned to be part of this this a leat accredited group u which is sounds very moff y frankly u not serely violent but certainly coersive in te inand in the way that it wallz people out let us say that then there were twenty or thirty of those or forty of those do you think that over time that model would overtake the the existing model is it it interesting that those do not exist rethe shirlock homes the dotor din bar it is interesting n there is thre's two possibilities one as nobody wants that which i do not believe in any other as the system as wired in a way that will o simply not allow it i in you did a hypothetical in which the system would allow it mygt reslots that as now course the system w allow that where the people the band togethers you no have enough money or get enough resources to say look we can we can afford to give loans to na a ten thousand students preor o ten thousand is in a trivial number when thing about the size of a university and and you non the most of them howfully w graduate in four years and the will be turn over and do you think that the e great future innovaders would tend to orient toward that model more than they currently due toward the traditional model a mamyuwoad i'm tryin to get back to yours how do you think that the current model thwarts innovation as well as maybe some ways that it still supports innovation certainly cancellation and the risk of cancellation from the way that we framed it earlier is going to discourage ristakers of the category of ristakers that take risk in at every every do not man that really to fly close to the sun and sometimes into the sun or our doing research tat us just not politically it yet looking in to issues that ow we kno you write that that we cannot even talk about on this py cast probably without without causing a distraction of what we are actually tin to talk about but gives up the whole game revery exactly u the i keep a file and it is a written file i'm because i'm afraid to put it in into electronic form of all the things that i'm afraid to talk about publicly because i come from a lineage of advisers who are all three died young and i figure if nothing else i'll die and then you all make it into the world tand when e'll say five ten years twenty years and i if not youm i know a certain yo when to die at some point n then what will see whereall those issues stand in any event tere's thetless getting longer or time or shorter oh it is deatily getting longer tat interesting yet's get it is getting much longer i mean u there 're just many issues that i would love to explore on this podcast with experts an that i cannot explore just be even if i had a panel of them because of the way that things get sound bited and sagmented out and taken out of context its the whole conversation is lost and afortunately they are an immense number equally interesting conversations u that i'm excide to have ah but it is it is a lle disturban youremember ly sychaism a no oh i si famous that n the sot history oe uniona is the famous thangs o thera suc gnetagnetas is name not li sank o ah that is hite sounds familiar but i'm not i'm not calling to mone and he was the godi of hedid go communist gant genetics a be the the field to genetics with the sovies did not approve the field o genetics because of course they belied in the creation of the new man and you non told y quality and genettics did not support that if you were doing the traditional jenatics you were you a bit you now it is verilys fired if not if not killed and the skyles sankle stood up and said al i've got marcias gjenetics and iave not a whole new field ti jenetics the basiclly as politically complient and then they ash the implement of that in the agriculture system of the sove union and it is it is the origin of one of the bicgary since that the sovi union actialy fell which was they ultimately could not feed themselves create a new notion of biology as it really slition an letically cretbiology ndso soey not only created it they taught it they demandeded it they required it and then they implemented it in agriculture a ssoso yes it is it is i never understood there is much o things in history i never understood until the last decate thats one of hem well i send for myself at the level of deleading certain things but i do not contort what i do talk about i tento to play on m lush open fields a just makes mis gois goes to the rot this goes to the rot and i'll combect your question but dis goes to the rot in the exsysting system which is wewe vine by thoughiam no different i'm just you i'm not i'm trying not to myself on fire either but that the rot in the exysting system and by system i meanie institutions in the eleates tho the rot is that the set of things that are no longer allow it the min that list is opis expanding over time a and that is a real li is tre speaking it does not end in good places is a this group of a particular generation that we can look forward to the time when they venthy die off it is thort of the boomers bless them money else we got a while good good news bad news we gent gennacs as weare right gent i'm gon at genac genics as weard as wee we cont a slipped in the middle er were kindit we we were kind of the am i do not now to describe it we were the condof non political generation cono sandwichmens mad the umers them oneels genzee is a very i think open question right now which way they go i could imagine them being actually much more intense than the moneels all these issues i coul also mation that react into the moneels and being farmer open minded we do not knowhath yis coming go asking to go maght be different groups of them genaxs allsom forty seven year fifty fifty ri o hey ware the same yet grobius in john hugs films and were the the jochs and the hippies in the punks and the it we are all divided and they were all segmented but then at all sort of mish mash together a few years later and i thinkthey had a lot to do with you said the sort of a political aspect of our generationwe just knew we te genishes knew the bomers for nuts right all the cramiis is that conomical earther one ofthe geat accounts oo the air m this family ti is wright wit tin care tor michael pkton and you's just the sgy is just a ther bu a my boomer hippicparents are crazy i've tuscin the goingto businesin ashally to something productive lyt thet there was something aconic about that character and in our culture and you now people lke me rea aviously goingto business you do not goingto political lace tov bisem and then it is just man that came withthe back around with the next generation just a touch wor quick on theuniversity thing lik there are people trying to do and i'amaxhly cag to do wa thing this afternoon with the you niversily osten which is which is which is which is one of these and there are people trying to do new universities you now i i don' i say it is certainly possible i hope they succeed i'm palling for them i thik it be great i think it be great if they were lot more of them who founded thes universit a this is ta whole group of people i do not knwan to go freelance on that cause i do not know originally who the idea was universy of osten yot u t osten yes its a not ou t ostens call is called universi of ostener they call it i think it is u ata wat is it you t x and in is o lot of very sharp people ssociator with it and then the the they are gong to tryto very very much exactly h what you describe their itry do new one i would just tell you the wall of opposition thaf the're up against is profound ri m and part of it is economic which is can they ever get access to federal stodent landing and i you knowi i hope that they can but i i you nw it seems nearly in conceivable the way the sistems rick to day and then the other is just theire in a they theyar already have come under haming any any anybody any h anybody who publicly assocsays with them who is introduction a de immia imediat he gets let on fire right in their s cansilaction campans sothere up against a wall of social ostracism am they are up against a wall of nopressataks am they are up against a wall of am you now people just doing the thang pount pounsing on any any time anybody says anything they can try to prin the place down it is remind ome o am gerry springer episodes and herale vero episodes were am you knows if a teen listen to aum danzic or marilyn mansin type music or metalica that they were con sidered a devil worship ight we write now we just laugh right wee that is crazy right e wll listen to music with all sorts of lyrics and ideas and looks and and that is crazy am but there were people legitimately sent to prison i thing with the westmamphis three write these kids out and westmamphis that look different acted iffering were accused of murders the the eventually was am made clear they clearly did not commit but they were imprisond because of the music they listen to i mean the sounds very similar to that and i remember seeing bumberseers free the westmenphis three and i thought thi a with some crazy thing you look into it and this is and iit is alo bit niche but am menthes are real lives and tere was a active a which hunt for people that lookdifferent and acted different and yet now we are sort of in this inverted world where a on the one hand we are all told that we can express ourselves however weu want but on the other hand you cannot get a bunch of people together to take classes where they learned biology and sociology and econ in texas wild yes welso a you now the simple explanation as it is this is puritanism ight his ays the original american purent is puritanism the just works itself out though the system in different ways a ifferent times you kno there is this phenomena s a religious phenomen on america calld tha the great awakenings there is justhere thereare eoll be these periods american history where there ar spacily religiocity fades and then there will be thi snapback of factory 'll have this basically this you kow from frenzy basically of of religion of yo in te old days it would have and yu now tant revivals and people speaking in to g small thist stuff am and then in the modern world it is it iseem ts it is of the form that there wer livin througit now a yes tispasically these waves thi sort of american religious you romor religion in our time religious impulses in our time do not get exprety caus we live ind we live in more advance times right we live in scientifically in form times and religious impulses in our time do not show up as over they religious they show up in a secularized form i which of course conveniently as is is there for not subject to the first amendment separation churchian state right as long as the church a secular it is no problem and but but were we are acting out these kind of religiou scripts over and over again and we are in the middle of another religious frendzy there is a fraze tid i hear a lot and i do not necessarily believe it but i want your thoughts on it which is it the pendulum always swings back yeh not quite eso i feel too because i'll take boi temly great take any number of things that weve talked about and i should crazy the the way things have have gone with institutions or its crazy wey things have gone with social meedyar at crazy bill in the blank and people say well the pandulum always swings back the likest the stock market or something yo afterevery crash they will be an eventual boom and bich fir sir by the way does not interver ther right rit most most stock markets we have of course survivorship it is all sur mivers everything is surviver it is all everything to satisfy as she survivorship by us right if you look globaly most stock markets over time crash and burn and ever recover the american stoc market asm ols recover iht always refrange the americans not now but i globaly but the reason everybody refers te american tock market as consist the one that does not do that the other two hundred or whatever the crash and burn and ever recover e let us go check anon ther ar ar an argentina stot mrket right now i adi think it is come a back s ime said now my fathers argentine and imgrade to the you ask in the nineteen sixty he would definitely agree wit now that does not come it does not come eunow wen wit en their stockscras they do not come back i and then theall sanchoism this that union ever recovered from li thanchoism and ever came back at led to the end of the country n literally the things hat took down this o the union ore oil and and we the wheat thing you can trace the crace suspact toli san coism and at no look i and almoys trings back is true only in the cases oran everybody just conveniently forgets all the other circumstances where that does not happen wone of the thinks people you see this in business also people have a really hard time confronting really bad news i do not know if you have notice that and ike every doctor who is listening rand ows anosha but there are situate you seedent busines thei ar situations that ses the star track mover a start ract the kobiachimru a simulator right to the big lesson of he come the startri captain as you had to go through the smul lation call the copiashon mruin the point was there is no oy it is a no windsnario right and then an then it turned out a captain cirk was the only person ever when the sareo in the ay that he did it was he we went in had a time and hackd the simulator rent it was the only way to actually get through and then there is a debate whether t fire him or make hm a captain they ade him a captain and the promi ha in real life we you do get the kobiachimru on a regular basis there are ashall no whon situations that you cannot work yeure way out of and ats a leader you cannot ever cop to that right cans you have to carry things forward and you hove to look for every every possible trace you can but every once in a while you doren in hi situation where it is really not re coverable n at least i found people just cannot cop with that aso and sow what happens as they basically than they vacly just excluded from their memory that it ever happen glad you brought up stimulators cause i wol want to make sure that we talk about the new an emerging landscape of a i artificial intelligence and i could tryin a smooth are conversation af a moment to got with the this one a by creating some clever side way but i'm not going to except i'm going to ask is there a possibility that a i is going to remedy some of what we are talking about let us make showe that we ere marked hat for discussion weill be later but first off because some of the listeners this pot cast might not be as familiar with a i is perhaps they should be we have all heard about artificial intelligence people her about machine learning et cetera but it be great if you could de find tr ust what a i is em people almost to mely hera in think o a robots taking over i'man awake up and eminto be in a strap to the bed and my organs are gineing pulled out o mes em that robots are ging to be in my bank account they coud kill all my children and and distopia for most clearly that is not the way it iskin togo if you believe that machines can augment human intelligence and human intelligence is a good thing tell us what a i is and em where you think it can take us both good and bad yes there was a big debate when the computer was first invent that which is in the nineten thirty sninehteen forties the cur people down turring and john mon noyman and tese people and the big debate at the time was because they knew they wanted build computers that they had the basic idea and no there had been calculating machines before that and there had been there had been these looms that you basely progame toe punch cards and that there was a there was a pre history to computers that had to do it building sort of increasely complexd calculating machines that they were cont upon a track but they knew they were in to be able to build they call a general purpose computer that could basically you could programme in the way theu programm computers to day but they ad a big debate early on which is should the fundamental architecture of the computer be based on either a calculating machines catch registers and looms and right and and other things that or should be based on a model of the human brain and they actually had this idea of computers model an human brain back that u and this was this concept of clled naral networks and it is especually fairly astonishing from from arecer stamdpoint the original paper on narl networksaxtually was published in ighteen forty three right theydn't have our level of narral science but the ashly knew about the narron and they ashally had a theory of naros in teir connecting ins anapses and information processing in the brain even even even back thet ah and a lot of people's time basically said what we should basically have the computer from the starty model after the human brain caus if we could ive the computer could do everything that the human bring can do that would be the best possible general purpose computer and then you could have it do jobson you could have it you now creat artt you coul hve it do all kinds of things humancs can do ah it turns out that did not't happen ah in our world when happen it stad was that industry when in the other direction it whent basically in the model of the calculating machine or the catch register and i think practically speaking that kin i had to be the case cause that was actually the technology that was was practical at the time ah ut but that is the path a wawwe all have experiences with up to an including the iphlon in our pocket is computers built on that bitsy calculating machine model not the uman brain model and what that means is computers as we have come to understand them thatyouknowther basically mathematical sovants you knw best right they are there really good it doing lost o mathematical calculations they are really good executing these extremely detailed computer programs theyre hyper literal a one of the things you learn early when youre a programmer is as a progras the human programmer you have to get every single instruction you give the computer correct as it will do exactly what tell it to do and and an bugs and computer programms are always the mistake on the part of the programmer interesting you never blame the compuer you always when the tf the programmer caus that that that is the nature of the thing that you are dealing with one downsqore offin the whole thing ye yet ifs the prok is the pogramer's fault ah if you nok any programmr theyll agree with this o belic av if there is a problemince it is my fault i did it i cannot blame the computer the omputer has no judgment it has no ability to introprat synthesize under develop an independent understanding of anything if just ast literally just doing what i tellige to ou step by step for eighty years we have had this just you knw of this very kind of hyper literal kind of cond o model computers these are called a tachnically this ter what arecalled vo noymen machines based ter the mathematicion shone mon noymen they run in that way and they been very successful and very important and ar world is then shape by them but there was always this other idea out there which is ok howbot a completely different approach which as base base much more on how the human brain operates ah or at least or r our kind of best understanding of how the human prain operates rightsthose are not the same thing the basey says look a what what if you could have a compuner sibing hiper literal what if you could havp it actually be conceptiuale right am and creative and able to synthesize in formation right unable to draw judgments and able to a a behave in a you knwin ways that are not deterministic but ar rather a bu creative right and n n nn he applications for this of course are endless and for example the self driving car the only way tht you can make a you cannot param a computer with rules to make your self draving car you have to do what tessla and waymonies ofe the companies ave done now you have to you e ay i right youf t use this other architecture i and you have to basely teach them how to recognize objects an images at high speeds the same way basily the same way th human brain does and those are those are called nurl nutworse running in side essentially let the machine operate basteon priors we we almost clipt a a bowlder going up this particular drive and o therefore this shape that previously the machine did not recognize as a bowlder an now introduces to its catalogue of bowlders is that is that yhelle ge g ou example less eve makiv even strarker for self driving car a theres something in the road is it a small child or a o plastic shopping back being blown by the wind very important difference if it is the shopping bag you you deflly want to go straight through it be cause if you deviate off course you might if you can make a fast jus the same is the same chalege we have not were driving you kdont you do not want a swerb to vat a shopping back as you might have something that you didnte see in the side it is a small child for sure you want it for right am and it bes very bit likt in in that moment and small children common different shapes in descriptions and a ring iffrn kinds of c they might to tumble on to the road the same way of bag would tumblthete might look ter tumbling and by the way they might not be r i tey might be wearing a holl hallowe mask you wrihtes the base them ey mightnot have a recognizeable human face right an t might r might be a kid with in one leg right youfully one an not hithose right light that yyou cannot this what may see we figured out is you cannot apply the rules based approach of a onoyman machine n two bacically real life and expect the computer to be in any way understanding or razilien to change to basically things happening real life this is why thereas aoias beent such a stark divided between what the machine can do and what the what the human can do a and bat basly what is happene as in the last decade that second type of computer of the nurl notrepace computer has started to actually work ait started to work aftily first ind erestly in vision recognizing object an images which was by the triving car starting to work a fase recognition face recognition when i was started off in visual nur science which is really my original home am in narrow science the idea that a computer were camra could you face recognition better than human was very low probability event am base on the techknology we had at the time base on the understanding of te face recognition sells in the fusive form giris now you would be smartist to put all your money on the machine yet you want to find faces in airports even with masks on and beto aprofileverses straight on machines can do it far better than most all people mean now these super recognizers but even they cannot match the best machines now ten years ago what i just said was the exact rever s fate faces handwriting a right a and then voice being able to understand voice a mi cove if yuse just as use refuse gugledox that it has a built in voice transcription ife sort of the bastly indistry leading kind of voice transcription if you use voic strinscriptioni gugledox its breathtaking the good you di ou to speak into it in it just types what your what you are saying well that is godcause in my phone everyone whil i'll say i nee to go pick up a few things and they will say i need to pick up a few fongs and a ne apple needs to get on board a whatever the voice recognition is the gugles using maybe it knows you better than you think aso i was not the topici was avoiding discussing no sar that is on the lesstret you les a a li there there is actually to say thas yet there is a reason actaly why you al good an apple is not right now wat that kind of thing itit actually goes to actually the especially aediological thing of all of all things am a u apple does not ot permit pooling of data a for any purpose including training a ey wereas gugld does m and an apples just stake their brand on privacy and among that a sort of o plege that they do not pull your data and all of apples a e is a ey that has to happen locally on your phone were as gugl's a ey can happen in the cloud rihti can have me cross poolda now by the way some people think that that is bad cause they think poollyn datas bad but that that is an example of the shift thas happening indas you reate now which is you have the separation betwen the people who ware embracing the new way of training es and the people who basically for whatever reason are not you m excuse me yu you say t some people think it is bad because o privacy issues of thy thing it is bad because of i reduced functionality of that a ey oh no you your deaf gan a get u there is three reasons a eyes as started to work one of them is just simply larger data sets u larger amounts of data specifically the reason why objects and images are now the reason machines are now better than humans that recognizing objects images are recognizing faces it is because modern facial recognition a eyes are trained to across all photos an te in and out of people billions and ans and buildings of photoes right unlimited number of photoes of people an thin and at attempts to train facial recognitions systems ten or twenty years ago they be trained on you now thousans pretends tof thousands of photos the input datas simply much more of fat much larger this the reason t get to the conclusion on this t this the reason why chat p t were well as trat p t one of the reasons trat p t were well as it is trained on the entire in andot of text and the entire intinet of tax was not something that was available for you to train an a ion until it came to actually exist itself which as new and the last unot misically decate in the case of face recognition i coand see ou having a much larder in put data set would be beneficial if the gull is to recognize mark indriesin's face because you are looking for signal the noise against everything else right but in the case of chat g p t when you are pooling all text on the internet and you ask chat g p t to say im construct a paragraph about a mark indrsons prediction of the future of human beings over the next ten years u en the a likely to be most successful industries g cach b t that if it is pooling across all text how does it know what is authentically mark indrison's text because in the case of face recognition you have a u you have got a standard to work from a a verified image verses everything else in the case of text you have to make sure that what you are starting with is verified text from your mouth which make sense of its coming from vidio but then if that vidio is deep vakued all a sudden what is true your your your valid mark indryson is of question and then everything chach b t is producing that is then of question r i would say there is a before and after thing here there is ca befort there is a before catu pty and after you be t question ecause the existence if you pto itself chane changes changes t the answer before chat ou b t the reason the wri versionareason today is train an data up till september twenty twenty one ut there s tha cot oug of the traint on the trainin said up till september twenty twenty one almost all taxan in or not was written by a human beinge and then most of that was written by people under their own names some of it was not but a lot but a lot of it was and why you knows from me is cause it was published in a magazine under my name or it is a potcascranscript in it sen it is under my name and and generally speaking if you just did a serch on whater thingsmatontdrition is writtean said ninety plus per sent of that would be would be correct nd th hsomebody might have witten a fake paroty article or something that but not that many people were spending that much time writing fake articles about things i said it nhow many people can pretend to be exacty right and generally speak you you can conteget your arms around the idea that there is a corpous in material a say with me or by the way samething with you there is a corpus of of you to transcripts another your uracconomic papers and talks you given nun kind of get your hands arond that and that is that is how these systems are traine that theythey take all that dayto colecto ly they put it in there and and that is why this works as well as it does and that is why if you asked chat u p t to speak or write me or you or omebody else it ut will ashlly generally do really good job cause it behas that it has all r prior ot textin its in its training data that is at from here on out this gets harder and of course the reason thits gets harder is because now we have a ivin create tax we hav a i thic can great taxtat industrial scale e water marked is a i generatn ags nonoon not how hard would it be to do tt i think it is impossible i thn it is im possible there are people who are trying to do that this is a hot topic in the class your mush stacking af friend is got a fourteen ro get in in in a class and there is the is recurring scandals the every kit in the class is using c p tito wright their essays or to help them wright their essays a and then the a tha the teacher is using one of there is a tool that you can use that it preports to be able to tell you whether something was written by c p t but it is only right sixty per cent of the time and there is this case where the student wrote an essay where their parent sat and watch them write the essay and then they submitted at in this tool got the conclusion a correct and then the student feels outrage cas he got on fairly cheated but the teacher is ple here all using the tool then it turns out there is another tool that basically you feet in taxt in achly is sort of ah it its asthey call it a summeriser wotor reallyas is is the chetin mechanism to debasically just a shuffle the wrds around enough that it sheds whatever characteristics were assocsiated with theres i go an arms race going on in educational settings right now round this exact question i do not i do not think it is possible to o they re people working on the water mark anothing its possible to the water marking and i think it is just kind of obvious why it is not possible to do that which is you can just read the output for yourself it is it is really good how are you actually gon to tell the difference between that in something that a real person wrote and the by the way you can also ask j g p t to wrte in iferent styles right you can tell it ou a wrighte in the style of a fifteen year old right you can tell it to wriht in the style of you kow a non native english speaker right or if you are not native english speaker you can tell to write in the style of an english speaker a native english speaker right and itthe tool itself will help you evade ii i do not think that nk there is a lot of people who are in a want to distinguish right quortreal vers is fak i think those days are i think those days are over genies a b i genes a put out the bottle by nd by the way i should think its this does not map to this does not after my world of view of how we use the tactknowledgin anyway which which we can come back to there is that 's that s and and then there is the problem therefore of the called dfate problem then ther'sthe problemof deliberate basically manipulation and that is likeyin one of your and when wone of your many enemies i ily istenemies mine who basly is whil i know im in to get im right im an i im an am in a create im ani ama use it to create something that looks a hubrman transcrapt whan i'm an havehi' salei bad thangs n ravido or avity or avitio eme jo rogan and i were deep faked inevidio i doft want a flag people to it i wont i will not talk about what it was about but where it for all the world look au conversation that we were having and we never had that specific conversation conlis tht's can happen for sureanc there there is cants what thers can an need to be as ser me t be basely registries where basically you you n think in your case you will you will i'm submit your legitimate a contant into a registry under your unicryptograpic hey right and that basically there will be al way to check against that registry to see whether that was the real thing and i think this needs to be done for for sur for public figureis andyou speent for politicians and you nus be done for your music what about taking what is already out there and being able to authenticated or not in the same way that many times per week i get asked is this your account about some a direct message that somebody got on instogram and i always tell them look i only have the one account this one verified o count although now with the advent of pay to play verification makes it a little less potent as a uno security blanket for knowing ifit is not this account then it is not me but in any case the is accounts pop up all the time pretending to be me and im i'm relatively low on the on the scale not at not low but relatively low on the scale to say a a beonsay or something that who has even hundreds of millions of followers is there a system in mine where people coul go in and and verify tac click yes or know this is me this is not me and even there there is the opportunity for people to fudge to eliminate things about themselves that they do not want out there by saying now that not me it was not i i did not i shoe say thatter create thatno thit is right and yes tenologically tie sactily pretty straight for that the wit implements this stologically as with public ycol public chryptography which is the basis for how your chryptography information is secured in the world to day and and busy what you would do the implementation for me this would be you would you would tpick whatever is your most trusted channel i say it less an treug you to channels in example were just everybody just knows that it is you an your you to channel as you'v ben doing it for ten years or whatever i is just obvious and you just publish in the about me page on you ou to you just publish you you your public chyptographic key thit is unique to you right and that any time anybody wants to chack to see whether any piece of content is actually you they go to the registry in theclaus somewhere and they basically submit they basely say ocate is this hym and then they can basically youto see whether somebody with your public key you had acually certified that this was at that you made am now who rents that registery is interesting question am if that registery is run by the government we will all that the ministr ministry of truth i think that is probably a bad idea am if that registery is run by a company a we would ou now call that basially the quithon of a credit beer or something that maybe that is how it happens the problem with that is that company now becomes hacking target number on right if every bat bat person on earth right as you can you knoif anybody brace into that company you kow they can they can they can fake all kinds of thing that they own the truth rightly on the truths right and and by the ay in side irs right also their employes can monkey with it right see if to really trust that company am the third way to do is with a bwatching right and this whether the chrypto bloching tonology you could have a distributed system this distributed at ta base ah in the cloud that is run through aboachan and that implements this schryptography in the certification process what about quantom iner net am is that another way to incript these things i know a most of our listers ware problynough familiar contom min er net but im put simply it is away to im secure communications on the in er net let ious leav it at that im it is sophisticated and wll pro you a whole episode about this is some point but maybyou have a secinc way of describing quantom iner net but that would be better and if please please offer it up but is quantomin ter net going to be one way to secure these kinds of daton and resources you may be in in the in the future years the future we do not yet have working quontin computers an practice it is not it is not currently somethng you could do but may be may be inedecator to im tell me imen to take a stab at to finding quane ad minner net one sendence is a way in which if any one were to try and peer in on a conversation on the inner netta sentiually would be futile because of the way that a quanti mineurnette a a change is the way that the communication is happening fast and many times in any one conversationis chent sencially changing the translation or the language fast that there is just no way to keep up with it is that more or less accurate o conconceivably nnot enot yet but o going back to a i most people here abou a i are afraid of a i u mnd i will well i think moste who are not in form just goes back to our leters as masses thing oh interesting i well i heard you say that ind this is from a really wonderful tweet thread that we will link in the shownote captions that that you put out i'm not long ago and that i've read now several times and that every one really should take the time to read it pride takes about twenty minutes to read it carefully and to think about each piece in it is a highly recommend it but you said and'm quoting here let us address a the fifth the one thing i actually agree with which is a i will make it easier for bad people to do bad things yes imos sss yat firstall there is a general freacout i happening oronday i i think it is frimerarly it is one of these againis in aly driven freacout i do not think the man in the street now nos cares or feels one or the other i aus theres not a relevant concaptans probably to sonsicsatisfection i'm there is there is i think there is thereis n lea driven freak out this happening right now im i think that i lea driven freakout has many aspects to it that i think are in correct just not surprising i would think that given that i think feales are in corect a a a lot of thi s but i thing theare very wrong about a number of thngsthey aresaying about a i a but that is sad luck it is a it isa this is a very powerful new tocnology wriht this is a new general purpose thinking technology right what if machines could think wright and what if you could use machines that think and what if you could have them think for you there is obviously a lot of good that could come from that a but also people nwhat criminals could use them to plan better primes a you nou terris could use theme to plan better toer atacks and forth and these are going to be tools that bad people can use to do bad things forsure a i can think of some waysa i could be leverage to do fantastic things am in the realm of medicine and a i pathologist perhaps can scan ten thousand slides of histhology and find the one mig cro tumor celler aberation that would turn into a full blown tumor whereas the a even mildly fatigued or well rested human pathologis t as great as they com might miss that and perhaps the best solution is for both of them to do it and then for the human to verify what the a iy is found and vice firstmimisr tha's just one example i mand i can come up with thousands of examples where this would be wonderful a youve another abother medicine a you talking about someanataletic result which is good important the other is the machines arecan be much better bedside manner theery me much better dealing with the patient aan we already note there is alredy ben a study tere's ridty ben a study on this o the is already study done in this m a where a tha there is a a a study tom scrape thousands of medical questions off if an in in it forum and then they had real doctors answer the questions and then they had busy duputy for answer the questions and then they had another panel of doctor score the responses riht ththere are patience experiment that on here this is a tast can contain within withwithin the medical world but inthe that that th the panel of the judges the panel o doctors hrough the judges score the answers an bofacial accracy and on out bedside manner i on empathy aad the duputy for r was o was scub was equal or better on most of the factual questions analetically already om in it is not even a specically trane medimedically i om but it was overwhelmingly better i'm on empathy amazing right om and ou know ii dont think i do not you you treut patient do treat patients directly an you are real yyou do not yes o how will do we run clinical trials but i do not i do not do any direct clynsy i your ii've no direct euxstress to this but from the surgeons ive from ser which you talk to surgeons or you talk to people who train surgens what they will tell you is surgents neen to have an emotional remove from their patience in order to do good jo with the surgery the side effect of that a and by the way look it is a hell of a job to have to go in and tell somebody that there in a die rete that they have see that i never n a re cover then everin a walk again er whatever it is and there is a there sir somethng inherent in that job where they to keep in emotional reserve from the patient yright to e able to do the job and it' expected of them as professionals the machine has no such limitation thnk the machine be his sympathetic as you want it to be for as long as you want it to be it can be infinitely sympathetic it is happy to talk tou it for in the morning it is happito sympathize with you it is and by the way it is not just sympathizing you in the way that oh it is just lyi wih sus making up words to li to you to make you feel good it can also sympathize with you in terms of helping you through all the things that you can as you do to improve your situation right and ou o boy if you can you keep a patient actually on track with the physical therapy programm can you keep a patient on track with the nutritional programm can you keep a patient off a dructor alcohom right and if they have a machine medical companion that is with them all the time that theyr talking to all the time that is infinitely patient infinitely wise righ infinitely loving right it is justking to be there all the time and is can be encouraging and is can be saying you do such a great jive yesterday i know youcan do thes agan to day cogto behavour altherapy is an obvious fit here these things are gong to be great its says se b t and that is that is already starting bu you can already use chat p t isas is a s b tthervis if you want it sictually quite good at it and there is there is a universe here that is it goes to what you aidthere is a universe here that is opening up which is what what i believe it is its it is partnership between man machine right it is its the sembiotic relationship not an avrseral relationship and that tht exactly the doctor is going to pair with a i thoul do all the things you described but the patient is also going to pair with eh i and i think it is i think i think this this partnership that' goin to mergescan to lead among other things to actualy much better helthour comes i've realied for much of my life on excellent mentors from a very young age and still now in order to make best decisions possible with the information i had and rarely were they availble for in the morning sometimes a but not on a frequent basis and they fatigue anybody else and they have their own stuff anybody else baggage events in their life et cetera what you are describing is a sort of a i coach or therapist of sorts that hopefully would learn to identify our best self and encourage us to be our best self and when i say best self i do not mean that in any kind of pop psychology way mean i could imagine e i very easily knowing how well i slept the night before and what types of good or bad decisions i tan to make it to ofclock in the afternoon a when i've only had five hours of sleep or may be just less rem sleep the night before i might encourage me to take a little more time to think about something makeamel a tap on the rist through a device that no one else would detect to you do not refrain from something never can judge you s never can be resentful it is nevergin to be upset you do not listen to it it it is never geingto gon vocation it is can to be there for you lik i think this is that this is the way people are going to live its can a start with kives and then over time as can be alson the way people areging to live is there going to have a exactly friend theroupist companion mentor coach teacher right assistant and that that that that or or by the way bay be multiple of those if it may be that ration time with six different posonas interacting which is o hole another possibility but there can a hame ittee i committeee i committeetait diffen personis and and maye by the wy when theyare difficult decisions be ade your life may be what you want a here is the argument among the different prosonus a and you are just going yet you are just going to grow up you'r jst goin to have this in your life and youe can always be able to talk to it and always be able to learn from it and always be able to help it ma yon't and it is just gest going to it is gat its con be a sombatic relationship its coan itings be much better wen to live th th if you lar any a lot ou of it what modalities will it includes i can imagine a my phone has this am engine in it o this a it companion and i'm listening in head phones as i walk in to work and it is giving me some anot just encouragement some warning some am thoughts that i things that i might ask markindrecent today that i might not have thought of aand on a i could also imagine it having a more human form i can imagine it being a tactile having some haptics tapping to remind me that its not yan enter our conversation in a way that that it interferes ore distracts you but i would be ware oright a you non't things of that sort i mean how many different modalities are we going to alow these a i coaches to approach us with and is anyone actually thinkingabout the hard wore piece right now cause i'm hearing a lot about the soft ware piece a what ies the hard warepiece look yes the antris as where sellic aboutlis con t icand the ountrponeral community is going to try all of those at god by theway the bae companies an and ands turn o sern to try all those and there is obviously there is big companies that are working you kow there the big companies of a talked about a variety of these including you kow hads of displays a are of ye are kinds of things am ef there is lots of people doing voice yo thvoice thing is voices are rea possibility at me just be an an your piece a there is a new start up that just unvailed a a a new thing im where is ectually they iactually project you will have a pendent you wear a necklace and it itually projects literally project imagjust on your hand yoe're on the table ar on the wall in front of you me be that is how it shows up a yather people working on called haptic or touch base a kinds of things there are people working on actually picking up on neare signals ot of your arm am righte to be able to im a to be able to a do there is some people there is enougs there is some science for being able to do basically sopulcl szation am maybe you could pick up you cound pick up that way a do not conduction yettthese are all going to be tried as one question is the physical form of it and then and the the other question is the soffroversion of it which is co a what is the level of abstraction that you want to deal with these things and liken id you writ wright now what is a question answer a paret i i iself al chatmot ask questinga an answer as ae questiongi an answer well you want the have to go for sureto more of a fluid conversation you wnte to gild up more knowledge if you are and you do not wanto have to explain yourself a second time and forth and then you want to be able to tell it things lie woll remind me this the matter you non be sure to tol me when acts a but then may be over time more and more you want et actually deciding when it is can talk to you right and when it thinks it has something to say it sas at anotherwise to stay silent and and normally at least in my head unless i make a concerted effort to do otherwise i do not think in complete sentences presumaly this thes a i these machines could learn my style of fragmented internal dialogue and al maybe ave in your piece and i'm walking in and and i start hearing something but it some that you knw advice et cetera encouragemen discouragement but at' some point those sounds that i hear in an erophone are very different than seeing something your hearing something in the room we know this based on the noral science of musical perception language perception hearing something in your head is very different and i could imagine it some point that the a i will cross a precipice where if it has in line wiring to actually control neral activity in specific brain areas and i do not mean very precisely even just stimulating a little more prefruntal cortical activity for instance through the ear piece l ultrsound wave now can stimulate prefuntal quartecs in a non inbasive way that is beeng used clinically an experimentally am that the a i could decide that i need to be a little bit more context taware right ah this is something that is very beneficial for those listening that are trying to figure haw a navigate through life it is eyouno know the context youre in and know the catalogue of behaviors and words that are appropriate for that situation and not others and ah this would go along with agreeableness perhaps but stragegic agreeableness right context is important m there is nothing diabolical about that contet is importan but i could imagine yei recognizing out ward entering a particular environment i'm now actually in a ramp up activity in prefontal quartexs a little bit in a certain way that allows you to be more situationally aware of yourself an others which is great unless i cannot necessarily short circuit that influence because at some point the a iy is a haly then controlling my brain activity and my decision making an my speech i think that is what people fearis that once we cross that precipice that we are giving up control to the artificial versions of our human intelligencan look i think we have to decide we we collect e lingways individuals i think have to decide exactly how to do than and this is the big thing that i believe about a i is just a much more i was a practical view of the world than a lot of a panic that your is just these are machines tthey are able to do things that increasingly ore thet things that people can do in some circumstances but these are machines we built the machines we decide how to use the machines w rot the machines turned on there turned on wit oft ten turned off theire turned off and yes i i think that is absolute the kind of thing that the individual persons should always be in charge of everyone was in i have to imagine some people are till afraid of crisper of genetit a bagenetiting stands to revolutionize our treatment of all sorts of diseases inserting into leading padicular gines in adulthood right not having to a re combine in the wom a new a new organism is an immensely powerful tool and yet the chinese scientist who did crisper on humans this has been done actually did is postoc it stamford with steep quake than went to china the crisperon babies mutated am something i believe it was the h i the one of the h i b receptors i'm told it was with the intention of augmenting human memory it had very little to do in fact with limiting susceptibility tachi the per say to do with the way that that receptors involved in human memory am the world demonize to that person we es heu do not know what happened to them whether not they have a laboratory now or the're sitting in jail it is unclear but in china an elsewhere people are doing crisper on humans we know this i meant's not legal in the you ass in of other countries but it is happening am do you think it is a mistake for us to fear these technologies much that we back away from them an end up ten twenty years behind other countries that could use it for both benevolent or a malevolent reasons yes it is always and you ow wit that you ct the details matter it it is technology by tochnology but i say theres tos two things there is a you always have to think an in these questions i think it terms of contrfatinals and opportunity cost right and chrisper's interesting one cristpor uman if you lave the human gekno nature may place the human geno ike in all kinds of ways that when you pick a spouseing yo have a child with that spousal bor ou a in at a recomination you are reallyas you are quite possibly im mou nw with your gang as con you you'r determining the future of humanity right by those trelic y nature i may me t mutations this is the ol this is the old question of basically stateen us is als state of nature state of grays we do not vasially it is nature good and t theyre for artificial things are bad ah you nowhich is kind of shot an loke people hae athical views that am i'm always of the view that natures of bitch and wants us dead nature's out to get us man nature wans to kill us right am nature wilnts to evolve all kinds of horrible virus as nature as in plagues nature ast to to whether nature nature us to all kinds of stuff i meu lik th the original nature religion was e original religion right that was te original thing people worshipped n the reason was because nature was to thing that was out to get you riht a before you had scientific andtechnological methods to be able to to be able to deal with it the idea of not doing these things to me is just saying all were just gin a turn over the future of everything to nature r and i do not think that there is no reason to belie that that leads in a particularly good directiond or bet you knont tha that is not about valu nitial decision ah and then the related thing that cons from that is this always this question around was called the precautioner principle ah which shows up in all these conversations somethings risper ah which basically is this it is this principle that basify says the inventors of a new tacnology should be required to prove that itwill not ave nakeetive effects before they roll it out ah this of course is a very new idea this is acually a new idea of in eighteen seventies ah issestu inventoned by the german greens an eighteen seventies a before that people did not think in those terms people just invented things a and roll them out and we got all modern civilization by people inventing things nd and and rolling them out ah the german greens came up ath precautioner principle for one specific purpose i'l bet you can guess what it is a it was to prevent tamen newclear power a it was to shut down attempts to do as civilian new clear power ah and if you fast forward fifty years later youare wow that was a big mistake right a wit wat what they said at the time was you have to prove that new clearactors ere not when i melt out an calls all kinds of probms in of course ays an engineer can you prove that that will never happen you an't yu you cannot rull out thingsthat might happen in the future ah and that that philosophy was used to stop new clear power by the way not just in europe but also you us and around much o the rest tof the world if your somebody whos concerned about carbonamissions of course this is the worst thing that happend in last fifty years and terms of energy wwe actually have the silver bullet answer to unlimited energy with your carbonomissions new clear power we we choose not to do it not only wy do you choose not to do it reshe shutting don the plants that we have now right in california we just shut down youknw th the big plants germany just shut down their plants germany's the middle of an energy war with russia right that we are informed as exestential for the future of europe but unless the risk of new clear a power plan a knelt down has increased in have to imagine is s gon the other way am what is the rationoun behind shutting down these plants and not expanding because new clear as bad right newclears iky new clear is newclnewclear has been tag just sounds bad ymclear ye yei ow new clear you caretil what ha what hav n shut down postal offices and y here go postal wat whatd happen was new clear tecnolgy arrived on planet earth as a weapon right it arrived and in the form of the t first thing they ded is tog the middle world wore tos the first thing tit was the atome pom they drops oner hand and then then there were all the debates tha followed a round toe clear weapons and disarmamen and there is a whole conversation to be had by the way about that is there s it different views yoe could have on that an then it is in fifties an sixties where they started o roll out cevillian clear power and then there were accitend there were melt threwere accests or was likeying o through mile island melted down and in an uturnoble ou know elted down in sothe union and even recently you kno fucushima melted down an another hade been melt down and i think it was a combination of it is a weapon it is sort of iky this surpose ens the scientis some times of the ic factor right i sort of itsenos radioacti glos green you kow by the ay it becomes ta s it becomes a mythical fictional thing in see of all these movies of corrble ou no supervillains power by an clear energy an al this all this stuff well the insrode of the simpsons right is the new clear power plan and the three eyed fish in the t all to all the negative implications is new clear power plant run by at least on te simpson's idiots and that is tha a the distopia where people are unaware of just how bad it is and who owns the c tlear power plant ran is evil you kow the the evil capitalis striht laing its cnnected till can no capitalis am right and s blaming tat groaning for the demise of creti yhe certainly did not healp right u but if literally this amazing thing were it yrou just thinking for just thinking rationally scientifically you are o cav we want to git red a carbon this is the obvious way to do it soca fon fact richard nixon a di two two things it really matter in th one is he defined in nineteen seventy ones and they call project independents a which was to create a thousand new state of the ar and clear plants cevilling to clear plants in th you lask ba te canedy and to get you as completely off of oil i cut the entire uess energy gread over to new clear power electricity cut over to electric cars the whole thing detache from car rbon am you will notice that did not happen a why dod that not happen cause he also created the e pe and the new cly regulartory commission which then prevented that from happening right and the newclear regulartory commission did not authorize a new newclear plant in the u use for forty years why would he him string himself that and we got distracted bhwa by but water gate yean beit no ai think elsburg just died recently i i really suppending on papers yes this they opligated but it is the yae exactly its this thing yet he did not youknow he left off ice shortly ther after he did not have time to fully i figure tes out i do not knowhether he would have figured it out or not you knont look forward could af figured it out carter could av figured it out ragon could figured it out any disguise couln figured it out it is the most obvien knowing what we nowe to day it is the most obvious thing in the world the rush a thing is the amazing thing is europe is literally funding russhes invasion of ucrane by paying them for oil right and they cannot shut off the oil cause they will not cut over to new clear right and then a cors what happens ocause then here is the other kicker of what happens right which is they wont do newclear but they wanted to renewables right sustainaple energy and what they do as they do a soler and wind learn wind are not reliable cause it sometimes gets stark out and sometimes the wind s blow and then what happens this they fire offthe coal plants right and the ashal consequence of the precautionary principle for the purpose it was invent said is a mass of spite can use of coal the they ging us back over a hundred year yes correct that is the consequence of the crautioner principle that is the consequence of that mentality and it is a failure of a principle on its own merits for the thing it was designed for and then there there is a whole movement of people who want to apply it t every new thing and and and this is the hotopic on a i write owand in washington which is all my god these people have to prove that this can never get use for it things i am hung up on is newclear thing and and i wonder u can it just be renamed i mean seriously i mean that there is something about the naming of things we know this in biology right i mean a lamarqui and evolution in these thay ther bad these are bad words an biology but we had a guest on this potcasto did rechavius over in israel who is shown inherited traits but you talk about his le marky and than it has all sorts of negative implications but he is the his discoveries have important implications for everything from inherited trama to treatment of disease i mean there is all sorts of positives that await us if we are able to reframe our thinking around something that yes indeed could be used for evil ambut that has enormous potential and that is in agreement with nature write this fundamental truth that a least to my knowledge kno one is revising in any significant way any time soon what if it were called something else cause heave new clear its it is called a sustainable right i mean it is amazing how marketing can can shift our perspective of robats for instance or a anyway i'm sure you can come up with better examples than i can but a is there a a good solid par a firm working from the new clear sigdt thunburgan grenethonbrkai sa sel thumburgy and thunburgan if she got if she was in favour of it ye which by the ay she is not she is deadset ang uist it she said that honor prercent ya ta based on esed on fravy burgyan principle tis prevailing the prevailing as they can avoon mantalis om fift fifty years ton thet new clears evil they they will not consider it there are by the ay certain inviron mantalist who disapree with us and steart brand as the one that spend the most public and he has in packable credentials in the space and he wrote the holers cattle ong coors downwaki a dam he is renten hoe much of ot rearling u sing booksense and he he wrote a recent books that goes through and detail es us obviously the correct enfironmental thing to do wis nowtlear power aan we should b we should be implementing project in dependence we shold be building a thousand we shulspecifically we should he did not say this that is what i was say we should hire charles cook i shold harer cok industries right a they should build us a thousand to cler par flants then we should give him the presential mental freedom for saving the environment and thot right wat us independent of our reliance on way ya there we are done with oyal wortnos think about what happens or done with oil zera missions we are one with ha middal eat were done we are done we were not droling or not droing on american land any m r were not drowing on foreign lands we have no military entanglements an places where were drilling were not despoiling the laska were not nothing no off sor rigs no nothing were done and you bes se to eyeu build state of the art plants engineer properly you have the just completely contained when there is new lheir waiste you just intume the waste right in concreteso it it t just sits there your forever a it is is very small you nw footprint you no kind of thing and you usty done and this the to me a si scientifically tcnologically this is just the most obvious thing in the world a it is a massive tell on the part of the people who claim to be proen varonment that tey're not in favour of this and if i were to say am tweat that i'm prone new clear power because it is the more sustainable former power fif i hypathetically did that to day what would happen to me in this in the crypto fachas o dirty youbl catilist monster hw er you i'm unlikely to run that experiment ow ways wht we call a a donkan experiment it is yermanan arterr anter your terrible human being we dthat we were looking for evidente the youre terrible hi being a now now we know it right it a this is a geat example of of tha ita i i gave i anter a book in the way ont here with this my favorit new bookus in the title of t is when reasont goes on holiday this is a great example of it is the the people who are o do the people who simultaneously say there environmentalist to say there aunt a new clear power tha the positions simply do not reconcile but that does not bother them at all i be clear i predict none at none of this willhappen amazing h i need to learn more about lon clear power long col long coll loncle investing call because you think we are just cin a revert it is the energy source of the future lo caus it cannot be solar and wen does there not reliables soo need something itif it is not in clear its can no be either royal natural gass re call and you are unwilling to say bet on new clear because you do not think that am the seo political the leadust triends that are driving against new cly ar likely to dissipate any time soon not of chance i cannot imagine it would be great if they did but that that it is ththey are tha the the powers that we are very loctan on this as a position i they have been saingness for fifty years and they have to reverse themselves off ith a bad position if at for fifty years people really do not to do that one thing that is good about this and other podcases that young people listen and they eventually will take over and by the way i well say alseso that there are yo tler oto pernurse a there are a shlly bu there are but npeny on cit there are much if young ountrepernervus who are basely not taking now for an answer men theyre trying to develop ut in particular as people trying develop knew very small form factor under their power plants with the variety possible use cisses you kont look maybe you knoft may be they show op per the beter mouse trap on people take a second look but we will say just rename it a my understanding is that you think we should go all in on a i with the constraints that we discover we need in order to rain in safety ind things an a sort not unlike social media not unlike the internate i do not what we should have done with the tlear pawer and in terms of the a youre infinite number of ways that a i can be in vision to harm us how do youthnk we should cope with that sut unpsychologically now because it canmagine a lot of people listening this conversation or think it oket that all sounds great but there are just too many what ifs that are terrible right what if the machines take over would if in all the silly example i gave earlier but whatif one day i gu log into my a harder in bank account and it is all gone the iversion of myself ran off with some one else and know with all my money o right in my a eye coach abandon me for somebody else after learned all the stuffs that i taught it it took off with somebody else strand it and it has my bank account numbers this kind of thing it really make the snary horrible right if you kept going yaved a well we can throwin a benevolent a example as well a to counter it but a isit l kind of fun to think about where the human mind gosa first i i say we got ta separate the real problis in ti fake problems and there is a lot they'l lot of sinstic concernas i think rie us not real and the once you decids an example ike it is not that is not what is can happen and i can ex plain wy this not wats can appen yu you shouldtthere is a set of st tastet of fake once the fake ones or or one ore the ones at just erns i think patologically grounded then oat rational it is the a s can a wake up an teside to kell us all it is can a by god's can at develop the kid of agent see res can a stealer money her plenty in eurstots in everything else kids a i that is just thate's not ow it works a and then there is also all thse concerns din you destruction of society concerns and tis is mis information heetspeech pdeefaks all that stuff ah which i i dont think it is a real as a is actually real problem a andthe there is a but people of a much of economic concerns around am you no wats can to take all the jobs and all thos kinds of things we coul talk about that i do not think those those arethose are i nontlin thas acually the thing that happens but then there are two actual real concerns that i shal do very much agree with and one of them is is what you said which is a bad people doing bad things and there is thre's a whole set of things to be done inside there the big one is we should use a i to build defences against all the bad things right and for for example thet there is a concern a s can make it easier for for bad people to build pathagens right is i pathogens and laps whichshe no bad people bad scientists can do to day but thisngkin to make it easier easier to do well obviously we should have the quivlent of an operation worp speed operating you now in perpetuity anyway right byt then we should use a i to build much better by our defences right and we should be using a i to day to design firexample ful spectr vaxenes against every possible form of pathagen right and we defensive mechanism am hacking you can use i to bild better defense to us right and you should you should have a whole new kind of security sweet wraped around you wraped aound your day tor rapped around your money were you you you are having a i a repel am attacks i dis in formation ha speech deep facts all that stuff you should have an a i felter when youse the inr nat where it ou you should not have to figure out whether it is really me or whether it is it is a made up thing you should have an a i assistanc is doing that for you oh yi mean these asill banners and cloaks tha eusey on socia mea this has been deemed missin formatien if you'r me you always clare r rt rike as you what is behind the scrim and then or this is a i do not always look at that the this image is is grewsome tipe things sometimes i just pass on that but if it is something that seems debatable of course you look why you shold have it you should have an a i assistant with you wen your hin or no you shuld beable to tell the a i assistant what you want right yes i want the full i want the full experience o show me everything u i want it from a cu point of view and i do not want to hear from these other people who i do not i by the way it seem tot my eight year old is using this i do not want anything that can a cot cause of problemen i want everything fultern and and and eh i base felters that that you program an control ar in a work much better it man be much more honest and straightforward and clear in forthan than what we have to day anyway itso basely wha i want people o do as think every time you think of a risk of how can be used jus think of lacoke we can use such a build a counter measure in the great thing about the conter measuris is thiy can not only offset a i risks they can offset other risks riht caus we already live in a world where pasthage ands are problem right we ought to have better vaxines anyway right we already live in a world where ther a syprahacking seprataris m there aready live in a world where there is bad content on the or not and we have the ability now to build much better a i power tools to deal with all those things i also love the idea of the a i physiciance you do not getting decent health carer in this country is difficult even for people who have means or insurance ean the number of phone calls an waits that you have to go through to get a reforel to see aspecialist i meanst at it is absurd i mean the process of is absurd i mat it makes one partily or frankly ill just to go through the process of having to do all that i do not know how any one does it and grant i do not have the highest degree of patience but i'm pretty patient and it drives me insane to you just get a remedial care but i can think of a lot of benevolent usis of a i and an i'm grateful that you bring this up and i hear and that you have tweedd about it in that thread again will refer people to that and that you are thinking about this i have t imagine that in your roll is invest er am nowadays that your also thnking about a i quite often a in terms of all these rolls am and does that mean that there are a lot of a young people who are really bullishon e i and are going for it o ke this is here distay o now we ave nen o am crisper which is sorted in this liminal place where bos at companies are not shore if they should invest or not in in a in crisper because it is unclear whether not the governing bodies are going to alouge nettid just it was unclear o fifteen years ago if they were going alougyin farapy but now we know they do allouging there enemy nof ther there is a fight i have you said that there is a fightheres a fight happening in washington right now o for exactly what should be legal are not legal a and there is quite a bittof rest i think attach that fight right now cause there are some people and there thet are bei telling a very effect of tory to try to get people either outly i or specific we limited to a small number of it companies which i think is petecually tishastrous a by the way you also is supernegative a butyou has turn supernegative on basly all ne to olgy theye are moving to try to outly i which if they succeed out law e is flight o do not want it but that is saying i an outlaw the inner and it i do not see how you can stop this train iamd frankly they are not be fan of thentr not either there i think they regret you has a very e especially at you beare acrass the people run t you in brussels have a very negative view on a lot of moternity but what i'm hearing here calls to mind things that ihave heard people davi gog and say which is ther'e many a lazy undiscipline people out there that nowdays it is easier and easier to become exceptional i've heard him say something to that extendet almost sounds there'e many countries that are just backing off of a particular technologies because it just sounds bad from the piar perspective am that it is creating great and low hanging fruit opportunities for people to barge forward and countries to barge forard if they are willing to embrace the stuff it is but u never when you have tohave a country that wants to do that a those exests in thre their countries that a buand then the other is look they they need to be able to withstand the attack from o stronger countries that do not want them to do it right you t at you has nominal control over what whatever it is twenty goven or whatever member countries even if youre whatever the germans get all fired up about whatever brustles con still in allot o cases just flat out is s we control them matel the not to do it ight and then t you ess let me look we have we have a lot of control over a lot of the world butwe sounds lik we sit somewhere sort of in between they ra now people are developing a i technologies in you es companies right it is happening that it to day as happening but us that there is a set of people who are very focust in washington wit now about trying to either bannet outright am or trying to as i said limited to a small number bi companies am and then look china's got a whold of th the th run in the sistr chinas got a whole different cannot take on this right than we do and theyare of course going to allow it for sure but they'ecn allowd in the ways that that their their system wants ifs i happen right wes just lear much morse for pot population control am ant implement of thoritarianism a and then of course they they they are going to spread their technology and their vision of how society should run across the world right we were were back in a cold word anamic we wereith a of ta union where there are two different systems that have fundamentally different views on on issued yo consepts freedom and n individual choices freedvous meach and on am and you kont we kno where the chinese stand were still fingering out where we stand if their ot of s time having a ot of gets of frentic i'm having specifically a lot us gets of frentic conversations of people in to see right now where if i talk to them at china does not come up they just hattack they hate ameri con tect companies they hate a i they hate social media they ate this they hate that they hte cript oug they ate everything and they just wantit punish men ban and they are just very very negative but then if we have a conversation half hour later we talk about china then the conversation totally different now we need a partnership betwen the yus government and american tect companies to defeat china its i es the exact opposite discussion riis that four competiveness on chinas pecific on on in terms of the the uess response in washington when you bring up these technologies s i'll lump crisper in their things crisp or new clear power a i an all sounds very cold very distopy into a lot of people and yet the're all these benevolent uses as we have been talking about and then you say you raise issue china and they sounds this big uno dark cloud emerging and then all a sadden it is we need to galvanize and and i develop these tachnologies to counter their effort is it fear of them ors it compativeness or both lso without them in the picture a you just have this and bas if is it there is an old bedran i is it saying as a i may guess mi brather ma my brather gess my cousin me my brother my cousin against the o ther world right likely with he sevil is actualy its evolution and action if evo anything would thing about it is tat there is no external thrat then the conflict turns inward a and then an ten that point there is a big fight between pecifically tack and then i was to say generally politics and in my interpretation that fight is it is a fight for status itit is fundamentally f ight for statuson for power iwhich is i four in politics you this you the status co of how power and status work in our society you do not want these new tachnowlos us to show up and change things cous changeis bad i change change threatens your position tat threatens youre the respect that people have for you and your control over over things iam i think it ispremarily a statusfiet which we can talk about but that the china thing is just a straight up geopolitical usfor s as them a satus a cold morsonareo and you kno look twenty years ago the prevailing to you in washington was we need be frends the china ight an we aregoing to be trading partners to china and yes there are to talitary and dictatorship but if we trade with them over time they will become mor democratic in the last five to ten years is become more and more clear f thet thats jus not true a and now there is a lot of people on both political parties and you see who very much regret that and want to change too much more of a sort of a cold wore footing are you willing to comment on tik talk and tachnologiese that emerge from china that are in m wide spread use within you ask how much you trust them or do not trust them i can om go on record myself by saying that early on when tiktoc was released we were told to stamper faculty that we should not and could not have tiktock accounts nor we chap accounts sar with there a lot of really bright chinese takontreners and engineers who ar trying to do good things im totally a'll have slositive about that i think thmany the people mean mean very well the chinese have a specific system the system is very clear and unambiguous and the system is everythig in chinais own by the party di not its sany menon by the stateson by the partison by the chinese comes party thechinese commonest party owns everything n they control everything by the way it isactually illegal to this day it is a legal foregn y foreign investor by equity and a chinese company there is all these slag basically legal macmachinations thet people do to try to do something that psychi aconomic equillent to that but is actually still illegal to do that the chine chinese have no intention the chinese commonest party has no intention of letting foreigners own any of china zero intention of that and thy they they regularly move to me sure that that does not happen they own everything they control everything we was sard intebed you but people in chinac can investin american come e an dou all the time well they can subject to yuus government constraints there there is a there is a uus government system that attempts to mediate that called sipius m and thereare more and more therere more andmore limitations being put on that but if you can get through that approval process than legally you can do that whereas the same is not true with respect to china a and am th they just have a system and if youre if youre the se o of a chinese company it is not optional if you the seo bite downcerseo tensan is not optiyou your relationship with the chinese commonist party is not optional is required and was required as you are a unit of the party and you and your company do what the party says and the party says we get fal access tall yesterday to in america you say yes when the party says you change the algrothm to optomize to a certain social resolt you say yes rit is just its whatever is whatever is whatever she gampang and his party codres decide and that is what is gets implemented if you the see you ove a chinese tuck company there is a political officer assigned to you ho has an office down the hall and at any given time he can come down the hall he can grave you out of your staff meading or board meating and he can takein on the hall and he can make you set for hours and study marxis em an she chon't ping thought and quits you on at te test you on it and you would better pass the test right lik li sos a strait political control thing in the by the way if you get cross was with them when we see i teck founders getting called up to congress for what looks interrogation but it is prolly pretty light interrogation compared to all another countries ye its itsit is it state it staye power they van tos stay theys hafe this view of top down shay power and they view it is that their system and they view that is necessary for a lots of historical and moral reasonce thincethy've defind and that is how they run and then they have got a view that says how they want to propagate that vision outside the country and they have these programes beltin road ight thet base ticly are intended to propagate can of teir vision world wide and they are who they are i ge thi will say that tey do not lie about it right theyr ther very strt for it they give speeches they write books you can buy she chin't think speeches he goes though th whole thing they have theotheir teck twenty twenty five plan wutthows select ten years ago tif their hole i i gentas all in there and is their goal that you knowin two hundred years three hundred years that chinais the superpowr ich olling everything on yet or twenty yours thirty years sir two your three years yo they got a shorte herize i me li thertheyr yaht theyr theyr i mean if i your che is say ever yon greadye's little bey this i gass but yat if your they want a win well the the crisper inhumans example that i gave earlier was interesting me because for suallmon or scientist and they could have edited any genes but they chose to addit the genes involved in the attempt to create supermemory babies which presumetly grow into super memory adults and whether not they succeed in that is not clear those babies are alive and presumely by now walking talking as far as i know whether not theyav supermemories is not clear but chinas clearly unafraid to augment biology in that way am and i believe that that is inevitable that is can happen elsewhere i'm probly first for the treatment of disease but at some point a'm assuming people organ augment biology to make smarter kids made people am not always but a often will select mates based on the traits they would their children to inherit this happens far more frequently than could be deemed a bad e ase either that or people are bad because people do this all the time selecting mates that have physical and a psychological and cognim traites that you would your offspring to have crisper is a more targeted approach of course the reason i'm con giving this example and an examples it is that i fee much of the way that am governments and the and the public reactiv technologies its ti just take that first glimpse and it just feels scary a othing but the old apple add of the nineteen eighty four ad imen here was one very scary version of the personal computer and computers and robots taking over and every un automatons and then there was the apple version where it is all about creativity love and peace and had the pseudo psychadelic california thing going for it again great marketing seems to convert peoples thinking about technology such that what was once viewed as very scary and dangerous and distopian is in owasis of opportunity why are people afraid of new technologies this this the thing i 've tried to understand for a long time because the history is clear ah andte history basically as every new technology is creeted by what is called a moral panic am and it is basically thi histerical freak out of some kind that cosses people to bay sleep predict the end of the world and you go back in time and actually thi historical sort of e fact it happens even is things now weree just pok back in its ludicrous right and you mention earlier the satanic panic of the of the aits something of the concern around tie heavy metal music right before that there was a freegot aroun comic books in the fifties there was a free cot around jas music and the twenties and thirties devil music there was a free out the rival bicycles cause t a moral panic and eighteen sixteen seeht binicycle bicycles yes there was tis thing at the time bicycles were the first they were the first very easy to use personal frensportaction thing that bace wh let kids travel between towns ah a you now quickly without any overhead to take teri teva horse to jump to bike im go ah and there was a historical panics di civily around at the time young women for the first time were able to venture outside the con fines the toun to mbe a ave a by friend another town and the magazines of the time ranall thy stories on thi a phenomenon medical phenomenon called bicycle face and the idea bicycle face was the exertion cause by peddling a bicycle would cause your face yuyou face of grimace and and if you run the bicycle for two long your face would lock in the place n th right an the ar i me you l you would be unattracti of wore of course unable to them you non get married at cars there was a moral panic around car o red flag laws there althes laws that greeted the automobile automobile free people out sai there ll tese laws if in the early days the automobile in a lot of places you had to un you would take a ride an automobile an auomobiles they broke autoall the time be only rich people had automobile to be you and your mechanic n the car right afr when it broke down and then you had to hire another guy to walk two hundred yards in front of the car with the red flag ah and he had to waiv the red flag and you couldonly drive as fast as he could walk as the red flag was to warrn people that the the car was coming and and then and then in enicos pennsylvania they had the most reconian version which was ah theye were very word about the car scarrying the horses and there was a law that said if you saw horse coming ah you need to stop the car you youhad to disassemble th car and you had to hide the pieces of the car behind the nearest haybale wait for the horse to go by u and in then you could put your car back together sit sat a ways example is electric lighting there was a panic around withis s can acomplet completely ruin yous completely ruin the romance of the dark and it was in a cause hold new kind of terrible civilization where evrything is always brightly lit it just all these examples and psychoca what on earth is happening that this is always what happens aman i finally found this book that i thing has at has a good model for it e book is called men machines an modern times and ss written by this a might tey professor sixty years ago it it predates the in or not but it uses a lot of a historical samples and what he says mas eus he says theres there is ectualy a three stage response the is ae three stage socital response to new technologyes it is very predictable he sayd stage one is on basically just denial oh just ignore we just do not payn testion this nobedy takes thiserious lavery just thes just to black out on the whole topic u he says stage the stage once stage too is rational counter argument stage too is where you line up all the different reasons why this cannot possibly work it cannot possibly every get ceaper yo now this that of younot fast enough for whatever the thing is then he says stage three he says is when the name calling begins he says stage three is wen right right when they have faile ignor it and they have failed to argue society out of it they move to the ame calling right and what is the name calling the name calling as this is evil i's the moral paic this is evil this is terrible this is awful this is going to destroy everything do not you understand all this just ist just this is thi's horrifying it and you ou know the person working on our being reckless and evol and all hell this stuff and you must be stopped and and he says the reason for that is because basically fundamentally what these things are as there a war over status it is o iso it is a war over status and theire for a war over power and and then of course al a'ltom altimately money but bu status status yyoumanstatus is the thing and and ankas what he says is what what is the sosital impact of a new technology the sesital impact of a new technology is at reorder status in society the people who are specialists in that technology become high status and the people who are specialists in the previous way of doing things become lo sttus and generally people do not adapt right generally if you are the kind of person who is high status because your at your yeuren evolved adaptation to an existing technology you are probably not thet kind of persons ganning enthuse the enthusiastically try to replyint yourself on to a new tyhnology th an this is every politician who is just any complete state of panic of a social media wireo the freet out of a social medias caus they all know that the whole nature of monopolitics is change the entire battery of techniques tha use to get elect ted the foresocia media are now obsolete obviously the best new politicians the future gan to be hn to precent crations of social media and podcasts an bi i fodcast ad were seeing this now as we had towards the next present o election that podcast clearly are going to be featured very heavily in tht next selection because long form content is i hold different landscape this is exact sai this is the roexist is usufico rogan your rogans had what he is had burney he is had tulsea he is had a whole series of our came most arsa and that is create a lot of contrali countries but also my understanding i tha he i'm sure he is invited everybody i'm sure he i'm sure he would loved at by no i'm sure he would loved at trophon i'm sure heu'd have to ask him i mean i think that om every podcaster has their own ethose surround who they invite on and why and how im i certainly cannot spea for him i bi om but i have to imagine that any opportunity to have true long form discourse that would allow people to really understand people's positions on things i have to imagine that he would be in favour of that is the the worst thing ye or somebody else went right you now some of some other tomi dot by castran odally woad right and there is my point my exactly tolly grwith you but my point is if if youre politician if you are if you'are it isa alegacy poitishn right you have the option of embracing the newtecnology you can do it any time you want right yyou but youyou do not they are not they will not whi they will not do it and why will not they do it well o case first of al they want t ignor it nor it they want to pretend tet things are not changing second is they want have rational contrecomments for why thee sisting campain system works the way that it does in this in the at nesisting media networks an heers ow you use things thin hers ti giv speeches and hes the closey ware in the tie an the thing in the pocket square an tin you gotocol sisis how you succeeded was coming up to that systems he got all your arguments is to why that will not work any more and then and then we have now proceeded to that ththe name callin face which is now its evil right no lwat's evil for somebody to show up in putting on on honest stream god forbid for three hours and actually say what they think right is gan to distresy society right it is exactly right tits it is it is it is a classic example of this pattern and any way some worrint morson says in the book theysic this is the forever pattern this will never change this sort f this is one of those things where you can learn about it and still enoug it the entire world to learn about this and still nothing change us because at the end of the day it is not it has it is not the tact that is the question it is t it is the reordering of status a i've a lot of thoughts about the podcast component a i'll just say this because i want to get back to the topic of innovation of tegnology am but on a long form podcast there is know safezone the person can get up and walk out but if the person interviewing them and certainly joe is the best of the very best if not the most skilled podcaster in the tire universe at continuing to press people on specific topics when there trn to bob and weave and wriggle real out he will just keep either drilling or alter the question somewhat in a way that forces them to finally come up with any anser of some sort and i think that probably puts certain people's quarters all levels through the roof am such that they just would never go on there i think there is another deeper question also or another other questn along with that which is how many people actually have something to say i real sicsti rigty how many people can actually talk in away that is ectualy nteresting that nybody else for any length of time how much subsance is there really and a lot of historical politics was to be able to manufacturer af facad where you honestly as far as you cannot tell ho t hw deep the thoughts are lie even if they have deep thoughts it' it is kept it is kept away from you thy would certainly never cop to it it isgling to be an interesting next what is it about a twenty monthsor hey had nonetit in e catict an pantic on the name calling aboureay started yet i was gon ly this list of three things denial am i the counter argument and name calling seems with a i a t's alrages jump to numbers two an three ysi were already it two and three in its kind of leaning three ye on the script i thos as unusual just because im it had nutin algies to take off they almost always have a pree history they almost always have thirty or forty your history where people tried and fail to get them to work before they took off a i asn't aidy your pree history it has a very long one iand then i it just it all sudden started o work dramatically well seemingly overnight and i it went from basically it as far as most people were concerned it went from it does not work at all to it works incredibly well in one stop and that almost never happens itsi an i ashing thing that is exactly whats happening i think it is actly speed running this procression just just because if you use my journey er you used tup to your any of these things for five minutes you are just while quite obviously this thing is canto by them i obviously in my life thi signi y the best thing affer lik this is amazing this all thes ways that i can use it and the and then therefore immediately you are all my god this is gan to transform everything therefor step three i straight to the name callwing in the face of all this i there are innovaders out there maybe they are where they are innovaders m maybe they are already starting companies or maybe i they are just some i young or older person who has these qfive traits in abundance were does not but know somebody who does and is partnering with them in some sort of idea im and you have an amazing track recor that identifying these people im i thinking part because you have thoe same traits yourself i've heard you say the following athe world is a very malleable place if what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive in passion the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think that is a remarkable quote a because it says at least two things a to me one is that a you have a very clear understanding of the inner workings of these great innovators we talked a little bit about that earlier these five trates et cetera but that also you have an intense understanding of the world landscape and the way that we have been talking about it for the last hour or is that it is a really intense and kind of oppressive landscape you have got countries and organizations and the leeds an a journalists that that ar trying to not isterly trying but or suppressing the innovation process i'm in the sort that the picture that i'm getting you it is it we are trying to innovate inside of a vice that is getting progressively tighter and yet this quote argues that it is the the person tha boy or girl man or woman who says well what that all might be true but my view of the world is the way the world's gon o bend or i'm in a create a dent in that vice that allows me to exist the way that i want wor what i'm actually going to uncurl the vice the other direction and i at once picking up a sort of am pessimistic glass half empty a view of the world as well as a glass hafful tou and tell me about that and and tom if you would because you tell us about that from the perspective of some one listening who is thinking i've got an idea and i know it is a really good one cause i just know i might not have the confidence of extrinsic reward yet but i just know there is a seed of something what does it take to foster that and how did we foster real innovation in the landscape that were talking about yes pardnas i think you just in one of the wayt of scrarders i think you was the innovator ne to be signed up to fight to fight right nin this is were the fictional portrayals of start ups i thinks take people of course are evens cientists arewhatever cause theyann en ther's great success stories they it can appritified ah after the fact amney md it me to be cute and fon ands yat now i conproduct anybody who actually did anyof these things now ther these things are is justly brutal exercises in just sheere will power in fighting you no fighting fighting forces that are tring to get you pardon as you just you have to be sign up for the fight and this kind it goes to the conscientiousness thing or talking about we also my partner ben uses the trum courage a lot which is some combination of jus stubbornness but coupled with a willingness to take pain and not stop and how people think very bad things of you for a long time until it turns out you elflly prove yourself prove yourself correct yoef yore wiing to do that li get's it is a contoniesr is that it is a contact sport is these are un easy roads right it is a context port you have to be signed up a for the fight the advantage that you have is an innevador it is hat is at the end of the day the truth actually matters and all the arguments in the world heclassic victor hugo quote is there is nothing more powerful in the world than an idea whose time has come right liting if if it is real right and and thits is just pure substance if the thing is real if the idea is real i gef it is a legitimately good scientific discovery about how the nature works if it is a new invention u if it is a new work of art and if it is real then you you you do at the end of the day you have that on your side and all f the people who are fighting you an arguing with you and tlling they do not have that on their side right it is it is not they are strowing up with some other thing and theyre my thing is better than your thing that is not the main problem right the main problem is i have a thing i'm convinced everybody else is telling me it stupid wrong it should be illegal whatever the thing is but at the end of the day i still have the thing right and at the end of the day that yout that that the truth really matters is substance rally matters if it is real it is really givan example it is really hard historically to fin an example of a new technology that came into the world that was then pulled back and we can be ar new clear as maybe it maybe an example of that but even still they are stole in no niclar tereare stilliny clear plans running to day u youknow that that that still exists i say the same thing is scientific ti at least igh of makes you this i do notknow i do not know any scientif iscovery that was made and ta people at ii know i know theire airs a science that are not politically correct to talk about to day but every scientist knows the truth tha the truth is still the truth me even the gunetisis in the sove union who were forced to bynd la sancoism likhe knew the whole time that it was wrong i got that that in conploti convinced of yet they could not delude themselves especially because the basic training that one gets in any field establishes some court truths upon which even the crazy ideas have torest and if they do not as you pointed out thinks fall the pieces i would say that even the technologies that am did not pan out and in some cases were disastrous but that were great ideas at the beginning ore starting to pan out the example all give is that now most people are aware of the elizabeth homes thernos de bacel iant to put it lightly analyzing a what is in a single drop of blood is away to analyze hormones and diseases the anabodies et cetera imean that is a great idea it is a terrific idea thats abots having a phlambatimis come to your house or e hove to go iny et tapped with you knowing the pulling vials and the whole thing there is now a company a borne out of stamford that is doing exactly what she sought to do except that at least the courtz ruled that am she fudged the thing and is that is why she is in jail right now am but the idea of getting whide array of markers from a single drop of blood is an absolutely spectacular idea the biggest challenge that company is going to confront is the idea that it is just the next ternos but if they have got the thing and they are not fudging it as it apparently therinos was am i think am everythingle work out alla victor hugo exemty now caus we must go back eone if they f tha of that gefs tif they gets the work if it is reald it cen t be otithi this is the thang of the opponents the opponents tthey are not bringing their own ideas theyr not bringin their ole my ideas better than yours dus not wat's happening they are bringing tha silence or count argument right ord an walling ll this is why i think people who need to be loved probably stand a am reduced chance of success and maybe that is also why having people close to you that do love you and allowing that to be sufficient can be very beneficial this gets back to the idea of partnership and family around innovators am because if you feel filled up by those people local to you youon't ean your home then you do not need people on the innernette saying nice things about you are your ideas because you are good and you can forge forward a another question about innovation is the teams that you assemble around you and you have talked before about a thi sort of small squadron model a ye sor david in goliath a examples is well where you' a small group of individuals can am createds acknology that frankly outdoes what a youon giant facebook might be doing or what am any other large company might be doing there area lot of theories as to why that would happen but i know you have some unique theories am why do you think small groups can defeat large organizations the conventional explanation as i think correct and is just that am large organizations have a lot of advantages but they jus have a very hard time am actually executing anything because of all the overhead sso large arganizations have commentorial communication overheadright that the number of people who have to be consulted who have to agree on things get to be staggering e amount of time it takes to scele the meeting it be saggering you knee get these really big companies and they have some issue their dealing with and it takes a month to scentl the premeeting to li plan for the meating whichis can have o a months later which is thing in a results in a postmeeting which sill then result in o poor presentation which will e on result an i planning offsight right a theyr lot i thought i could amilis baba what you are describing all giving me hig stovkova wat skovkovka was a document ory he out that this is this is yet itit is just these these are i may you wouldo have these organization thatd a hundred thousand people are more your ou'red more of a nation state than a co than than than a company umh and you have got all these competing internal you knoit is the bet of an thing same before you valleys internal at most big companies you are internal enemies are wamor dangerous to you than anybody in the outside e get them can you library donl kno ye you'r you'r big compete the bi compt ad a big company the big competition is for for the next promotion right and and and the enemy for he next promotion is the next executive over in your company that is your enemy the other the competitor on the outside as an abstraction maybe they will matter some day whatever i got a be thac i inside my own company right and thatthe internal warfare is at least as intense as the external worfare and yes hit just examinehis is just all the you osiron law of all these big big rocracies an ow they function if if a big rocracy ever does anything productive i think it is a miracle i's a miracle of the point were theye shuld be a celebration think tere shold be partiesthere sho be to cortake parades for big large organizations that i shald do things that that is great does it i it is rare it does not hapen very often anyway and ask the conbational explanation whereas looke small cot small companis small teams an othere is a lot af they cannot do ecause they cannot knear they'r not oup rany at scale than in of golb coverage and lean all thse kind of feno thy on't have the resources and forth but at least they can move quickly right they can organize fast they can have't me non if there isn't issue today they canhave the menie to day they con sult the issue to day right everybody they need to sult the issues in the room today than sai they can dismove a lot faster i think that ist part of it but i think there is another deeper thing underneath that that people really do not to talk about it takes a spectful circle to where we started which is just the sheer number of people in the world who are caple of doing things is just a very small set of people and you are not goin a hafe a hundred of them an a company or a thousand or ten thousand you are gonto have three eight or ten maybe hey some of them are flying too close to the sun some of them are blowing themselves up rsom some of them are i be ow i shl first learing that that i beside f my first atinal job job as that i beom when it was and when wwhen i be on a still on top of the world right before it cave don and the early ninetes and when i was there it was for hundred and forty thousand employs we shan' gan if you inflation at just to day for that same size of business in flation adjusted market size adjusted it would be e's equivalent to day f a two or three million personor inization it was a it was a nation state ah there were six thousand people in my division we were next store of another building withat another six thousand people and another division ou just you could work there for years and ever meet anybody who did not work for ibium the first half of every meeting was just ibeamers introducing themselvesto each other they jus mind boggling in that the level of of cerplexity but they were powerful ah that they had a a it at four years efore got their nineteeneighty five they were eighty per cent of the market caplisation of the entire teck industry right t they were at a level of dominance that even you kow guggler apple today is not even close to right at the time that that is how powerful they were and they had a system and it worked really well for fifty years they had a system which was mostly employs in the company were expected to basely rigid follow rules they dress the same acted the same they did everything out of the play book they know thy they were trained very specifically ah but they had this categri people they call wild ducks ahmnis was an idea that the founder thomas lass an come u with wild ducks and the wild docks were they often had the formal title of an nibium fellow and they were the people who could make new things and there were eight of them and they got to break all the rules and they got to invent nu products they got to go off and work on something knew that every port back ah they got to pull people off abother projects to work with them ah they got no budgeet when they neded it they they reported directly to the s io they got whenever they needed he supported the madoing it and they were glass breakers and you knw they showed a tho the one in oustin of the time was thas ki andy heller and he would show up and genes and calbe boots and amongst an ocean of men an blue suits white tchurts redtizes ah and put us cobby bos up on the table and it was fine for andy hellog that and it was not fine for you to do that right they vari specivficlly identified we have not we have not we have a almost an aristocratic class within our our company they gets to play by different rules now the expectation as they deliver right they they their job is to invet the ext break through product but we i be a management know that the six thousand person to bis shis not get about the next product we know is can to be crazy ante heller an his in its commer boots and i was always very impris and yet ultimately abam had its issues but that model worked for fifty years right workin credibly well and i i think that is basily the model of at works o and is but it is a paradox right which is how do you have a large burocratic regiments ad organization whether its academio or government or business or anything that has all these ruale followers in it and all these people who are jealous of their status and do not want things to change but then still have that spark of of a creativity i would say mostly est impossible mostly it just does not happen those people get driven out right and any intack what happens as those people get driven out as we will fund them these ar the people we find drowsye say yet i i these a thother you are in the business of finding and funding the wild the wild docs sas exactly right and and actually this is actually a to close the close the loup this is actually i think the simplist explanation for ibium ultimately came down and then each p ser an eighties also catio thes i been acby kind of wore model there re these incredible modelistic incredible companies for forty or fifty years the the kind of both cape d in n th in the eighties and nineties and and actually think it was the emergencs of ventur capital it was the emergence of a parallel funding system where the wild docs or in each piece case their their superstartonical people could actually leave and start theiron companies and again we goes back to university discussion ere having is this is what does not exist of the university level this certainly does not exist if the government level and until recently in media idn't existent till there is this thing that we call pontcas exactly rit exactly we gost clearly have picked up some om mamen tum and i i would hope that these other wild duck models will will i move quickly yow but the one thing right and this the one thing is the people on the other side or conto be mat us hell ye they are going to well i think om theire pass denial om the counter arguments continue the name calling is prolific and calling is fully under wey y will market we have covered a lot of topics but as with every time i talk to you i learn o very much i'm grateful for you taking the time my dear schedul talk about all of these topics in depts with us you i be remissive i dint say that it is clear to me now that you are heiper realistic about the landscape ah but you are also intensely optimistic about the existence of wild ducks and those around them that support them that are necessary for the implementation of their ideas at some point and tat also you have am a real rebelins iddeu that is oso welcome on this podcast and it is a oso needed in these times an every time on behalf of myself and the rest of us here

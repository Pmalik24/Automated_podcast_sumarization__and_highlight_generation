welcome to the huberman laconca the u science the science tase toce frli i manjer huberman and o ro professor of naurobiology and opthemology and stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor leesa feldman barrett doctor lesa feldman barrett is tha distinguished professor of psychology at north eastern university she also holds appointments at harvard medical school and massachusetts general hospital where she is the chief scientific officer of the centere of law brain and behavior doctor barret has considered one of the top world experts in the study of emotions and her laboratory has studied emotions using approaches both from the fields of psychology and naurow science indeed to day you will learn about the neurl circuits and the psychological under pinnings of what we call emotions you will learn what emotions truly are and how to interpret different emotional states you wil also learn how emotions relate to things motivation consciousness and affect affect is the term that refers to a more general state of brain and body that increases or decreases the probability that you will experience certain emotions during to day's discussion doctor feldman barret also teaches us how to regulate our emotions effectively as well as how to better interpret the emotional states of others you will also learn about the powerful relationship that exists between our emotional states and the movement of our body in fact much of to day's discussion is both practical and will be highly informative in terms of the mechanisms underlying emotions and it is likely to also be surprising to you in the number of ways it certainly was surprising to me i've been a close follower of doctor feldman barrett's work over many years now and have always founded we tremendously informative and when i say her work i mean both her academic published papers as well as her public lectures that she is given and her two fabulous books on emotions in the brain the first one entitled how emotions are made and the second book which includes information about emotions but extends beyond that entitle seven and half lessons about the brain as you will see from to day's discussion doctor feldman barret is not only extremely informed about the naro science and psychology of emotion she is also fabulous slee good at teaching us that information inclear terms and inactionable ways you will also notice several times she pushes back on my questions in some cases even telling me that my questions are ill posed and i have to tell you that i was absolutely delighted that she did that because you will see that every time she did that it was with the clear purpose of putting more specificity on the question and thereby more specificity and clarity on the answer which of course she delivers by the end of to day's discussion you will have both a broad and in deep understanding of what emotions are and their origins in our brain and body you will also have many practical tools with which to better understand and navigate emotional states and moreover you will have many practical tools in order to increase your levels of motivation and better understand your various states of consciousness before we begin i'd to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health an performance one of the keythings to getting a great night sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature has to drop by one to three degrees and in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your body temperture actually has to increase by one to three degrees with eight sleep it is very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment it is a mattress cover that allows you to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle end end of your night and in doing allow you to fall and stay d ply asleep throughout the night and wake up feeling extremely refreshed i started sleeping on an eight sleep matchers cover well over two years ago and it has greatly improve the quality of my sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dot calm slash huberman to save up to hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the ou essay candida ou k select countries in the eu and australia again that is eight sleep dot calm slash huberman to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a programe that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feed back using a continuous gluco smonitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucos or sometimes refer to as blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus thoughout the day you want to keep your blood luco steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food comminations as well as food timing and things exercise combine to impact your blood luco slevels i started using levels a little over a year ago and it give me a lot of inside into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my over all energy and in doing it really allowed me to optimise how i eat what i eat when i exercise and on such that my bloodglucos levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you are interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucos monitor yourself go to levels dot link slash huberman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link elli nd k slash hubermen to get two free months of membership and now for my discussion with doctor leesa feldman bear it doctor les a feldman ber it welcome how i my leasure to be here i've wanted to talk to you for a very long time i'd to talk about emotions i think everyone has a sense somehow of what an emotion is feeling happy feeling sad feeling excited feeling a curious perhaps it is even emotion i do not know you will tell us what are the cor componence what are ae sort of mackrom nutrience of of an emotion a because i know there is a debate about whether not we should be talk about emotions firststates but what is an emotion we all are familiar with what one feels to us but from a scientific perspective how do you define an emotion well scient this is all scientists debate about this i'm nobody in the last hundred and fifty years has ever been able to agry on what an emotion is am and i think from my perspective the interesting but tricky bit is that any time you want a talk about what the basic building blocks are of emotion none of those basic building blocks are specific to emotion for example there are group of scientists who will tell you well an emotion is a co ordinated response were you have a change in am some physical state a change in the brain a change in the physical state am which am leads you to make a particular facial expression you have got physiological changes in the body changes in the brain changes in the face or in motor movements pay but that describes spasically every moment of your life i youre face is always moving in some way if it was not you would look an avatar basically work were constantly engaged in in movements and those movements have to be co ordinated with the physiological changes in the body because whether ere whether we are in a state that we would conventionally call emotion or not because the physiologyis supporting those itsupporting the the glue cousts and the xygen and all the things that you need to make a movements of your body and of course all these movements are being co ordinated by your brain of course there is a co ordinated sat of a features that does not really describe how emotions are distinct from any other experience that you have but the the claim was for really long time that there would be diagnostic patterns case when something triggered fear you would have an increase in heart rate and you would have am a propensity to run away or to freeze or em not tus tefall asleep although that is something animals do when they are faced for the creditor but that is not part of the western stareatype for fear that was not what scientists were looking for and a and also that you would make a a particular facial expression which was presumed to be the universal expression of fear were you widen your eyes when you gasp am that facial set of facial movements in other cultures in melanesian culture for example is em is a symbol of threat where you are threatening somewhat you are threatening them with a gression basically is a war face but in western cultures that is the the face that western scientists believed was the the the distinctive a part of that distinctive pattern for fear and the way that scientists defind emotion for a long time was these kind of em states where you would see this diagnostic on somble of signals and that would mean that any time some one showed one of those signals they may move their face in a partular way or their heart increased at a particular time youd be able to diagnose them as being in a state of fear as opposed to a state of anger or sadness whatever the empirical eviden ents am just does not bear that out and it was kind of a mystery the mystery is how is it that you feel angry or sad or happy or full of gratitude or awhe how is it that you experiente these moments but scientists cannot find a single sat of physical martyrs that correspond with each state distinctively right that in any way that you could tell them apart that is a that was a really big puzzle for really long time i have to ask you about this perhaps smyth perhaps truth about facial expressions and emotions because as you were explaining the coor components of emotions i had to think back to the classic text book images of the different faces associated with fear with delight with confusion non an on we will get to that and your opinions on that scientifically n in formed opinions of course but there is a bit of a myth that the emotion system and the facial expression system run in both directions for instance people will say if you smile it is harder to feel sad or anxious i cannot say tht's been my experience but i very well could be wrong we know that when people's emotional states change their facial expressions often will change ridif you see some one crying on the street awersissomemdy smiling really bigly you we can make some assumptions about what might be going on ainternally for them but put simply is it true that changing one's facial expression can d direct shifts in the brain and body perhaps that change our emotional state if you will permit me what i would say is that your question is ill posed first of all it presumes that there is an emotion system and that there is a facial expression system now clearly is a system for moving facial muscles oquet but a movement is not the same as an expression a movement is a movement an expression is an interpretation of the meaning of a movement not all movements of the face are expressions am and this is a a problem is a problem in science 'm in it is often the case i think in my experience in the science of emotion but elsewhere to that scientists in their efforts to make their work im meaningful to people we will try to interpret theire findings in in ways that the average person would afind interesting or the way that a physician would find interesting or a teacher or woatd have you to be able to use this information but then they forget that they are actually making an interpretation and they start to refer to their observations with the labels of interpretation facial movements are facial movements people move their faces and that those movements have meaning but they are not always to express an internal state in fact one might think that they are very rearly to im express an internal state i do not know that there is offacial expression system either that is there' certainly i said a their there circuitry for moving a face but im but what those movements mean im t is highly variable and that would be my second point than where i would say when you see some one crying on the street you are not looking only at their face you might be aware that your focussing on their face that might be the part of the entire censory on somble that you are focussing your attention on but your brain is taking in an entire on sombleo signals as it is taking in not just the men a movements of the face the tears or whatever it is taking in all of the the entire censory ray the sounds thet smells what is going on inside your own body your brain is being u bumbarded with signals from from all of those sources and when it is making a meaning out of any signal it is doing it in and on somble of signals research shows that babies cries are not a custically specific to when they are tired or hungry or right the you can i can show you a vidio without contxt and show you some one crying an you might make a judgment you might think make the steratipic judgment in the west or that person is sad dthen we pan out in really it is a little girl who is dad just came home from your rock or something right brains are always interpreting faces in context they are making guesses thiss something that i've talked about quite a bit that we do not read movements in people we do not red emotions in facial expressions we make inferences about the emotional meaning a facial movements and we do it in and on somble of other signals the the contact as you if you will and that is really what is what is happening do i think that that there is feed back from the face to the brain sure i mean there is feed back from every muscle but there is this constant conversa tion between the brain and the body am the brain is sending motor commands the body is has sensory surfaces which are sending signals back to the brain if the face is influencing the brain it is doing in a way that is not special it it is doing it in a way that that works for all other parts of your body too and i guess what i would say this cond of along winded answer but over time your brain has learned that certain patterns of signal over time am recur and if you are smiling if your brain is telling your your facial muscles to move in a particular way that looks smiling am it is happening in a larger un sumble signals and than the brain is predicting what is goingto happen next because it is learned over time what happens next probablistically if you think about that as cause then sure but it is not is it is not thi simplistic kind of idea that an emotion is triggered am i it causs facial muscles to move in a particular way and therefore if you just pose your face in in those in that particular arrangement if that will somehow feed back to the emotion system and change that system cause there are no there is no emotion system in your brain and the the causation just is not that it is not that simplistically mechanistic the mextense to me i a frankly never bought the idea that just smiling would make me feel happy am especially if my internal state was not one of happiness fighting the internal state also a in the early two thousands i think it was there was a lot of discussion about how positioning the body and certain ways taking up more space would allow people to feel more powerful tand a some of these studies am an argued that the were even hormonal shifts associated with a'm taking up more space that were associate with feelings of empowerment and than when shrinking of oneself was in associate with t elevated cartes all statesons i say all this and i i want to be clear that a i do not take a simplistic view of the nervous system oroe crim system and ii did not a i do not think that you were implying that either one may sure that anyone listening in watching is not thinking that a for instance that cort is all as bad cortis all is wonderful and essential you just need it regulated properly or that a the idea that the body and emotional states are are inextricable in lenkth makes a ton of sense to me but the idea that you could just grab on to one of the nodes in the ei no have to be careful not say motion system am position of the body being hunched over makes you depressed now then ever made sense to me taking up more space makes you feel more a powerful that does not i it cannot be that way and yet we were told for about a decade through especilly through popular press that this stuff was true am and what i love about your work is that it includes anernatomical psychological a network perspective that that there is not one seat of emotions and and on am f we coan go a loabit further into the facial expression piece for a moment ri was taught in my psychology in neral science text books cause it was right theire in front of me that there were some qer categories of facial expression that were universal cross cultures that conveyed something about the internal state of the person that the downward ou no lips in the corner and and some and may be even a furrowing of the brow was associ ated with negative alent states sadness perhaps even depression tha the opposite of upward turned corners of the mouth and widening of the eyes was delight and excitement somebone that feels pretty true to my experience but how do you an others serious scientists of emotions view that somewhat classic literature know yes i'll just say that mi am my journey here my scientific journey was not one of am attempting to overturn am a century's worth of i we lid to swear bulshet basicleamin is just it is its its sterioits pasically western staria types inshrined as scientific a fact and that sounds ilike a pretty harsh thing to say but i think i pretty much stand by that at this point am but for me when i was a graduate son when i wasnat undergraduate in at in psychology and in physiology an an inthrapology i also had read that darwin said that there were these pestinctive facial expressions that a were co ordinated with specific emotional states the specific stass of the nervous system this was darwin's view and i assumed it was correct am until i started to try to use that information am in the lab and everything fell apart when you show some one in a laboratory a student ere i'm somebody from the community a face a disembodied face where there ought the persons eyes are widened in the face an their gasping a steretipic fer expression most of the time they do not know what it is and i would try to use these faces and as stimulean experiments and they were not they were not working the way that theyare supposed to work and there were really going all the way back to the beginning of psychology there were always debates about whether or not this was actually accurate and there is a really interesting story about how darwin came to this idea which i can tell you about but it it is not because he cared about a motion and he was basically taking his own very western views about emotion to make some claims about evolution actually i've more to say about that and about why it is a problem to take anything that anybody said even darwin frum hun a hundred and fifty or years ago o whatever it is and treat it its a modern text he was writing at a particular time for particular purpose and that does not necessarily mean that whatever he wrote is true but i'll just tellyou what the evidence says that there has been in psychology a debate really vicious debate actually for probably fifty years about the nature offacial expressions and whether theyre universal and whether there is this one to one correspondence between a particular face and offacial configuration in a particular emotional state smiling and happiness scowling an anger wrinkling your nose and disgust and in two thousand sixteen i think the association for psychological science tasked me and some other senior scientists a with a attempting to write a white paper a concensus paper on what the literature actually show what is a reserch actually show he r ead all the research can you find a pattern there does it actually reveal anything about whether or not facial expressions are universal particularly for emotion em an the way they do this they have a journal for this purpose for taking a widely held belief that is highly debated and bringing together a panel of experts who disagree with each other at the outset and they have to work together to see if tey can come to consents this over the data and this is something that people have tried in the past and we never really vicious people have been vicious with each ether over this question whan we brought together a group of people met several people refused to serve senior scientist refused to serve on this panel by a a feur an they are fundin nersal that is a whole other conversation about why sin a certain scientists would not one to engage wit a with em people who disagree with them em that is a interesting conversation to have but em i do not think it is as simple actually as just they their careerist or they they care about their money or or funding or whatever that would be an easy answer but i do not actually think that is what is going on but that is another sor of the anyway a there were five of us who got together em all senior scientists all from different fields some of us had not met each other before we all knew of each other of course and we met over zoume for two and a half years is as precoved cause people were all over the world right and we we read over a thousand papers i was the only one in this group of the five of us who my starting hypothesis was that facial movements are meaningful but they are not there is no one to one correspond ens between a particular facial configuration a scowl and anger not not just that it would vary across cultures but that it varies for you across situations i mean do you scowl every time you are angry i do not scowl every time i'm angry in fact and i also scowl at times when i'm not angry and there are scientific reasons to think that that the that a the collection of facial expressions that people make when they are angry or when they are sat or whatever would be highly variable that was my starting position and then the there were very before guyes there were i just refer them as e gus cause it was me and fore guys and the guyse they all to some extent thought that facial expressions were universal but the had differing reasons and all for for for hipothesizing that they also had different commitments degrees of commetment to that perposition but we write off the bat sort of agreed that we did not matter who was right that was just not well ofit the only thing that mattered was that we could come to the consenseus over the data and if we could not we had to really pin point why what would be the critical experiments that would have to be done in order for us to come to consensis over the data and we also agreed that i'm we had all kinds of contingency seid up you have got five senior people who were all running big labs and they are investing upwards of three years working on a paper if we cannot come to consenseus when we going to day or we ging to write one paper an sort of right about the process or where we goingto write separate papers or but we we had all these contingencies laid out but the key here i think is that we agreed that we were not going to be adverserial about it cause it did not matter who was right and in fact if somebody had to admit they were wrong and some one was good a have to admit they were wrong a d it turns at all of us were wrong about something but it we were going to be supportive of each other and and really encourage each other an because being wrong is no one likes to be wrong but for scientists to admit their wrong is hard and it is something that we should encourage each other to do i think more and and more publicly and i think the people who do that are really brave and that was my position and they all agreed and the long story sured here is that two and a half years a thousand papers later we all very reasonably came to consense us that there was no evidence for facial expressions of emotion being universal and that instead what is what there is clear evidence of is that facial expressions the way that people move their face is in in in moments of expression is highly variable meaning sometimes in anger you scowl mada analysis statistical summaries of many many many studies even in the west show that people scowl aabout thirty five per cent of the time when they are angry which is more than chance get you good publication and the preceedings of the national academy but that bein sixty five per cent of the time people are moving their faces in other meaningful ways that is not scowling if you actually used a scowl or even a scowl and blood pressure or just maybe not one signal but sulk a couple signals but you would be wrong more than half the time you would miss more than half the cases and even more importantly i think that that is the reliability questions there is low reliability for the correspondence between a sc owl an anger it is above chance scowling is one expression of anger but it is certainly not the dominant one and there is no dominant one it is just highly variable depending on the situation that you are in sometimes when i'm angry i sit quietly in plot the demies of my enemy sometimes i smile in anger sometimes i cry in anger it really depends on the situation im but more importantly half of the scowls that people make are not related to anger that means that the specificity is again higher than chance but not that much higher than chance if you see someone scowling the chances are that they might not be angry they might be concentrating really hard or they might have gas i mean there are lot of reasons why people make a scowl im and with we found this for every emotion category that had ever been studied and i want you to notice what i just did there i'm not i'm no longer referring to unemotion as if it is an antity or a thing though anger is not one thing it is a category of things a grouping of things and if i'me not mistaken it includes verbs ritti anger as a set of verbactions in in the brain and body yes it is a process it is ant on of it exactly it is not a noun it is a verb and it is a and it is a process but the point is that am it is it is a highly variable grouping of instancs if you are if you are talking about all instances of anger all instances of anger that you have ever experience or witnessed im it is a highly variable grouping of instances that very not they that does not mean the random but what the body does in anger depends on what the physical movements will be in anger and that depends on the situation that you are in and what your goal is and im and there are ways to talk about that in norou science terms which are a little more precise but the important thing to understand here i think is that we are only talking about western cultures now the minute that you go outside of the west to at or even to the east i mean there are other cultures they have been studied im e china and cultures in china and japan in carea there they all have access to knowledge about westernd culture al practice is enorm what happens when you go to remote cultures which im have much less access and they is not they have no access because we live in a globalized world even hunter gatherers and tanzanea the hadza have access to western practice is enormous but much less much less and we did do that and im and all bets are off there i mean most of the time they do not even they do not even understand or experience facial movements as having anything to do with emotion if they saw in a mogy of a smili face would they just assum it was a comthey might think it is a face the because thas we but another some fairly hard wired brain circuitry for the the two eyes at and at and a line beneath it and something in the middle this suto knows that organization of of just spacial yanters chuse up face for btat bur most prodout laly interesting at you say that because yes of course that is true but it is not there at birth what is there at birth is a preference for that configuration right it is it is their sum and we could talk about why that is their exactually very controversial but im but what babies what newborn's orient to they orient to that or they orient to that configuration but it does not have to be eface and then very quickly they start learning faces because they are posed to fate that mean really the first three months of life is almost a massive continuous tutorial on what faces are because theyre ye owt being fed and n everyone is ein your face laring me last night and you se the baby is friends o on ab unbelievably keup baby the big cheeks in you wat and there' tis desire to see the baby smile ri glad do the things that an ave that the baby shows some sortof facial expression that makes it seemg it is a little bit em resistin what you do you stop doing it you change up your strategy and an when e baby cracks a smile akenow im going to assume that the babe mayor may not have been happy inside im that woll baby had but when they do there is a restipracity than we smile actly as that that there is a templet that that is very robos stripe but i want you to notice that firsiall i'm not saying that im that recognizing faces a face as a face is not hard wired it is but it is hard wired by not by genes alone right and in fact there is a really wonderful book called not by genes alone pasically there is cultural inheritance we have the kind of nature that requires in urture we have the kind of genes that require early learning we have we need wiring instructions from the world to get the rest of the information that we need to be competent culturally competent in our in our in our lives and that starts at birth it probably starts before birth even im but im in third trimaster theres some evidence of learning feedal learning even in the third trimaster im the point is not that people are not hard wired for viewing faces are recognizing faces usjus where does that hard wireing come from it is not by genes alone genes are not the blue print the brain is expecting certain imputs from the world and needs that because infant brains are wiring in themselves to their world and part of that world as people making faces and smiling and those people happene to also be th ones who are maintain who are maintaining that baby's nervous system mean there is reward learning right a reinforcement learning right off the bat because these are the people who keep you comfortable they are the ones who feed you theire the ones who help you get to sleep and one and forth and you are goin to be very very sensitive to changes in the contingencies of their behavior your brain as a pattern learner's just goin to learn those patterns if we know that smiling it more smiling is a cu for happiness it is cause we have learned it and that does not mean that that learning is not hard wired it just means that it that information got into your brain by cultural inheritance which is a part of evolutionary theory in the extended evolutionary synthes it is not in the original not in the original a formulation that some people still con ta stick to as many of i've been taking g one daily since two thousand twelve som delighted that thei're sponsering the pod cast g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitements and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with g one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need and it also contains a daptigence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste gright for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer g one if you would to try ag one they will to drink g one dot cm slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitemin d three k to again that is drink one doc com slash hubermen it is far more newance ah than it was presented to me in those tex books in and it sounds it was outright wrong on many dimensions well an i just mention when ing thew this is really serious stuff sometimes people think well what is the big deal this is such a big deal i'll tell you wha it is a big deal because in our culture people believe that they can read mental states of other people by their face and theypbelieve it much that it is in shrined in the legal system and there are people who lose their lives because juries believe that they can read remorse or or the lack of it and in fact there was just a case u last year i believe where the innocence project i got inballed because there was a woman who was on death row and what put her on death ro was a police officers claim that he could read her emotions by her the comportment of her face and her body and and i it was possible to get a stay of execution that she could be retried and s i'm not saying she was guilty or not guilty e'm just saying what put her on death row was evidence that would not be admissible in a scientific way now m and there are there are lots of cases where judgments are made that end up impacting people's lives in pretty serious ways this is a really serious thing un it is it is puzzling to me why it is it is got such traction this idea that there are these universal expressions that we can use to read each other it is it is just not true i mean the science just it is overwhelmingly i feel scientists i do not to use the tea word the aft word fact he non's a scary word te were truth but i think in this case i feel i can i can really at least with a little tea i can i can use that you probably have particular facial movements that you make on a regular basis that are tells for you i know i do you kow my husband can look at my actions and he can make really decent guesses about what is going on for me upstairs right but that is because he is known me for thirty years actually thirty ears to day i shoul just saaaly mattashother thirty years ago today but he is brains are pattern learners i'm not sayng that everything is random in that there is it is all noise i'm saying that they are just are not these universal templates that just it is not that and we really have to stop assuming that that that there are well i'm glad that you are getting that message out therein im very thankful that you high lighted the seriousness of this these miths that have propagated and that is a perfect segway into what i was already going to ask which is a it is based on something that i think it is in very much agreement with what you are saying a previous guestd on this podcast then was our first guesed episode doctor carledyce roth calli good mind it standford incredible by a engineer really you do not point oh one persent in his category of science as well as a practising a psychitris said something which really stuck with me over the years which i once heard him say we do not really know how other people feel at all in fact most of the time we do not even know how we feel and that prompted the question for me about how good or poor are we at gaging our own emotional states and in particular at labeling them both to others and for ourselves and and hear st the the direct question is language sufficient to capture this incredibly complex thing that were calling emotions for instance the other dayi was in new york with my sister than she left i went out for a bid i was having a pretty good day an then i returned to the place where i was staying and i was hit with this feeling of intense loneliness and i do not know why and then i had a bunch of ideas about how that related to growing up and nib i was consey friends the next day and i'm an adult and i could use some top down regulation and i ut may be i'm a little tired right in cause i had not slept aswell the night before ibeen pretty rested recently and then i actully wrote my journal at sad you kno may be most of feeling good as being pretty well rested and nodted any physical pain that is a big part of feeling good is the absence of fatigue and the absence of physical pain and and then i thought while that is just basic as two building blocks it is clearly insufficient but then i could not think of a word to adequately describe the emotion that came about an hour later when i was feeling a little bit better but not completely better was i lonely not really not any more was i sad not really but as i had had it out into the city o sing i do not realy have a word for how i feel i'm sort of oqet not great not lo and i think that we have emotional labels i certainly do for piques these pique emotional states superhappy i loved o the time with my sister we is every year this was a particularly good year for us to do this and and it went really well we are texting back and forth how great it was i certainly know what it feels to be really down in in the pits i've got language for that but then there is as huge range in between and i guess the simple question is should we even trusthe languages a way to understand how wer feeling or ther additional if not better signals that we should perhaps learne to e laborate am our understanding of emotions with i'm going to give you a a simple answer and that i'm going to give you a more complicated answer the simple answer is now language is not sufficient period i think the way that you have well i should say one language is not sufficient english is not sufficient and probably french on its own is not sufficient and probably sahely on its own is not sufficient although it is very interesting that the the states that we mark with words in each a culture some of them over lap but a lot of them do not and it is very very useful to have labels of emotion concepts from other cultures that that capture configurations a at lhera state that we we do not really mark we do not mark those in and for distinctively pull them out as as different from other states i loon to know what some of those ord oh there the're im i should have brought them with me i mean there there are some there is one there is a german word which i cannot remember the name of the word but it is im the experience of some one having a fase that deserves a punch i'm sure some onl tell us in the helmets some one some one who knows germanere spenc im there please put that word in in the commec te door do not punch in another one that is my favorite is im i'm ligot which is am it is a polynesian im head hunting a a amotion word and it means im exuberant o gression in a group socker were het ere head hunting i were you are basically i'm ore i should say also i'm in the military when i was listening tampiar one day couple of years ago must v been more than thacis in my book is probably more than seven years ago i was listening to these guye talk thes former r i'm im military a person i'll talk about being i'm deployed in a war we'r they are with their buddies and there they are basically hunting the enemy and they feel exuberant ther and and ther i's not that they are happy but theyre it is pleasant and it is very intense very high arousal it and in the moment it it seemed right and then they come back i'm you kno when they ask themselves they come back and there now their deployments ended now they are back home in their are my apsycho path i enjoy killing people what is this about and i'm thinking no now you just experienced ligid and if you had a word for it you would understand that it is a groupy feeling where you are all in it together and it is really intense and they were experiencing the i'm the intensity of of i'm having their life on the line and and being responsible for their for their brothers and sisters an in in their troop for and yo i'm that the wut they would realize is is a perfectly it is perfectly within the range of normal human variation it is just that in english we do not have a word for it really but ther're words ther are concepts in other language is right or theye not the other one leter it is called geagle which is where when you see a baby whose really cuand you just one alike i eo ar yyo es i if at kill or chee as eeks er jus jumping at you and yet yen n a pari your delightful people gand yhad they was just facing out a they one of those ye i ansing babies and yet and it is sister ye it is and that i think jeggl it is call ts eagle eagle o egle niser from the other ot ye ther we did non ye ell at ot i that the that tha hes yedut yetn e ian are there is one in japa think there is a japanese word for the despair that you feel when you got a bad hair cut really yecause it is i mean it is really is a different kind of feeling thand you kow caus you have got a wafer it to grow whatever any ways the pointing that is words for us mark particular states and they are not all that they are not always the states that other people in other cultures care about but i there is a but the even again the phrasing of your question i just want to come back to and i'm not trying to pick it you by elfree nowt i lie at but what you said before when you said my question was ill posed in your in the answer that followed it made a very clear why and i learnd something about how the a then the not emotion system but the thingze plural that that create emotions work i feelfree i ii grew up in the same culture that you did i'm not canadian by birth but but in the academic culture i mean the stuff that we take on line by the way folks is nothing compared to the clin of hazing that i experience growing up in a in academic culture as it was done then i do not kno if it' still that way now i feelfree yet i com me toler than i look well now i think my point is that i'm trying a get at here is that when we ask questions andy of us me to anybody ask a question there are certain assumptions that we are making in order to allow us to pose the question and sometimes what i'm taking issue with is not the question itself but it is the assumptions behind the question right and this is a very classic thing in philosophy of science which i know i just said the peaword philosophy which scientists deuneasually they roll their eyes back in their head and fall over when you talk about that but i think it is really important can language is language sufficient to label or to t to gage emotional states kind of sounds and this is the assumption that people make that there is a state in here called an emotion and now i have to label it i have to identify it that is not how it works that is not what your brain is doing at all and in order to explain what i think is happening and what i mi best tavailable gas based on what i understand it is not even remotely that that is just not a meaningful question at all i'm i do think words are important i just do not think that they have to be insufficient by virtue of what the brains actually doing and the way that i come out this is just really different from a lot of my colleagues really for a hundred years at least i hate when people say things that lice for a hundred years but it really is for for a hundred years at least what psychologists and narrogh scientists do rdid and are still doing is they start with a folk experience a folk category a common sense experience i feel angry i'm making a decision i'm having a memory in remembering something they start with their experience and then they go looking for the physical basis of that experience in the brain en in the body i think that is really problematic because not everybody in the world actually uses those categories or has those experiences a lot of that has to do with the scientific publication process or shuld one of the most important statements i ever heard is from the late ted jones one of the greatest neranatomis of probably the last five hundred years ah which was the following he said a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a person produces a scientific paper and many hunder e ye you ga gets a square in the face can your allright thatme basically every drug disrupts if taken an hour to before sleep changes the amount of remscanc that you get is i could imagine that almost any perturbation of the language system the body the facial movement system could give you a cording a fact that you could write a paper about yet but that doe n't mean it has any semblance whatsoever to wat happening in the world when we are other people aantemotions and here is the there is much in what you said that i i just want is veris it is very saying to talk to you the first thing i'll say is that em we often will identify we we is in the people but also scientists identify biological am signals a by what we believe them to mean psychologically seratonan is is a happiness chemical no saeratonan involved as a metabolic regulator it is a metabolic regulator and whatever it is doing it is allowing an animal to spend resource is when the animal that animal's brain is not sure there is a reward at the end of that right wyou were saying before the absence of fatigue the absence of discomfort that is a that is a pleasant feelwell yes maybe saratonan has something to do with pleasantness becaus it has something to do with energetics right court is all cortis all is on a stress formone it is not a stress worma i mean it is a whormone that is secreted more when the brain believes that there is a big metabolic outlay that is required that is what stress is basiglly it is the brain believes there is a big metabolic outlay that is about to be required and it matters these kind of little samantic tweeks they matter a lot because of how we do is of how we do research i would say i do not start with the categories that derive from english and my own experience i start with the nervous system i try to learn what is the best available evidence for how that nervous system evolved how it developed how it struck shured right anatomy to me is very important some of my best hypotheses come from just learning the anatomy an realizing only nother's a connection there that is direct that that should mean something i mean em i could give you lots of examples of em where we have had we have made discoveryes solely because we noticed an and a set of anatomical connections and were really curious about what they might be involved with but if you stort with that premis than you think about the brain and i think about the brain a really different way right i do not think about the brain as a stimulous driven organ em i think about it more this that that the brain is em first of all the brain is not running a model or were making inferences about the world all the brain knows iss are signals from the censory surfaces of its body your brain is modelling you are retna and it is modelling your coclia and it is modelling the censory surfaces of the skin and sure signals are hit those surfaces and those surfaces transduced those signals and send them up to the brain but the brain only knows the body and anything it knows about the world it knows about the world through the body through the censory surfaces of the body that is the first for me really big important point the second important point is that i think about the brain as being trapped in a dark silent box called your skull and it is weared saying these things to you you are much you are you are really esteemed nerue scientists here i have explaining to you no ut how i think the brain works is just very when it worn't for our audience but's also important for even though yes i know i know these fact bu t it is i believe it is always a informative to go back to the fundamental sir because i we forget ash i would say that the a some one once described am the i'll call him the great cosies a great visual in ther scientists a visial of ner scientist tony mothion a founded the department of obneral science in an why you once set your a real intellectual is somebody that can appreciate and work with a topic at multible levels of pirannularity firshi rut it is not ab and oftentimes it the the more expertese os associate with more focust on detail i love returning dow cin or bas at i i think that mi at least es consid i think about the brains being trapped in this box and am it is receiving signals continuously from the censory surfaces of the body that those signals are the outcomes of some set of changes and the brain does not know what the changes are it does not know the causes of those signals it just knows the outcomes hat knows the signals that is what i's receiving and it has to guess at what the causes of those signals are in order to stay a life am and that is in philosophy called an inverse problem the brain just has a massive continuous inverse problem that it has to deal with all the time tao cannot hav it does not have access to all the information now it is just a guessing machine it is a guessing machine for example am if you here a loud bang what is that ladbang could be a car door slamming it could be thunder it could be a carback firing it could be a gun shot the brain does not know it has to guess and it is not making a guess a intellectual guess the guess is a motor plan it is a plan for changing the internal state of the body in order to support motor sceleto motor movements do i need to run do i need to shut the window do i need to get an umbrella do it do a nydole my breath because the car is back fired what ar i need to do where does that plan come from well it comes from past experience the experience that is been wired into the brain am but the but i think that the evidence suggest that what the brain is doing is basically reinstating bit is in pieces of past experience remembering although we do not experience ourselves as remembering but basically it is reimplementing on sambles of signals from the past that are similar to the present in some way now a bonch of things which are similar to each other in psychology is a category what the brain is doing is it is creating it is constructing category and in fact we think about the brain as a continuous category constructor it is constructing a category of possible future is possible outcomes possible motor plans and how does it know which is the right one cause it is not just picking one there is going to be some sample that it is realy it is reimplementing but how does it know which one which is the right one as there can only be one welli feel in the example of a loud noise what i emerely thought of as you were describing that is that my system would become aware of it i become aware of it but then it is a question of is there another loud noise how closely are those loud noises space is it getting louder or less loud and then a bunch of categories i it is a bookshelf with an infinite number of books but then with the second loud noise now it is just one a wing of the library and then with that the next thing that happens and the contact it stare s narrowing in the pretty soon you get presented with the book that says you kow the roof is about her heren and and i think ururper you are analogy there is pointing out toothigs one is that i'm really why why what the brains attempting to do is to reduce uncertainty because uncertainty is superexpensive now sometimes we deliberately cultivate uncertainty right we do not we deliberately try to learn things we do not that we do not know weyou know put ourselves in novel situations we seek novelty and because it is fun and interesting and whatever sure but imagine every single waking moment of your life was that where you did not know you could not narrow things down from the library to the wing to the bookshelf to the the to the the particular shelf on that bookshelf to ther what yet you interrifi yeti would not himthat is the label i would give again would be terrified i as i could not plan anything or you anything beuse all possibilities are right it is and it is just actually metabogally unsustainable and there are some there are some brains that are wired in a way that they do not predict very well they do not create these categories very well and they are they are dealing with in really unbelievable amounts of uncertainty that is one thing i is but the part of what is the goal here if you could say there is a goal is to reduce uncertainty and i'm going to get to why this has anything to do with emotion in a minute but i just need to set up the ground arules are the assumptions of of what i'm what i'm working with here the other thing thoug you pointed out which i think it is really important is that the i'm none of this is static it is all evolving over time right the signals are evolving over time both the signals that are constantly hitting the censory surfaces of the body and making their way to the brain but also the intrinsic signals in the brain it is all changing over time when we talk o bout contact that is important how is the brain making a decision about similarity what are the features that are similar it is it is not just at a single snap shot an time it is always happening dynamically over time right and most of the time though you do not ask yours you do not wait to hear a second sound you do not you are not deliberately attempting to figure out what the sound is your brain is just sorting it out right and it is sorting it out by narrowing down the possibilities and there are some selection mechanisms in the brain that help it guess better but also the signals coming from the world im are are also helping to select which possibility am is the right one i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackrs a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endian e to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals i'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turm health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tusts out there you get information back about blood lippits about hormones and on but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids with those hormon levels at cetera mean and behavioural supplement nutritian andother protocals to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health inside trackrs ultimat plan now

thing of saving private rhynd were the the the guisent are about to hit the ground on d day are flinching with every crack of gun fire the'rust everything's a stupementless to move are not and and then some of the more seasoned soldiers are literally et having bullets whizzing by their head and people are dropping dead all around them and they are moving forward steliad and stable and upright and in part we look at that in and say ocate their courageoust their season maybe their desensitize in certain ways but actually it fits much better with the idea they somewhat you are saying it fit is much better with the idea that im they have intimate knowledge both conscious and unconscious knowledge that something right next to them is a threat but not a threat worth responding to right exact what if yit were headed straight for them they would quite quite understand what i wud day its is that it is a it is not a you kno i keep referring to things as signals and really im just i'm yu that is my generic word for a quantity of energy of some sort but your brain my brain every brain is constantly making signal noise distinct distinctions do i need to care about this do i do i not need to care about tha's right and we have ways of learning and we alls have ways of cuing each other am humans use i gazed to cue each other about what is signal ind what is noise right fou and i were sitting were helets say we were aut a coffee shop and we were in a part of town that i'd never been to before and we were sitting having coffee and a loud siren went by if you turned and looke i'd probably turn and look because you just cued me that that was something i need to care about if you ignored it i'd probably ignore it because you just cued me that i did not need to worry about it i did not need to care and we are constantly doing that with each other and we also do it with little ba abies and with kids and that is how we teach children this a signal this is noise this you need to worry about this you can ignore and yet you are your description is perfect what does this have to do any of this have to do with e motion in order to answer that part of the question i i wont a say o ket you have got these signals the brain is has these electrical signals going on we will just ignore the hormonal signals for the moment caus that is compligant one is complicant it is got therall these electrical signals going on it is when it is remembering something it is just basily reinstating a pattern of signals and it is got these signals coming in a from the censory srfices o case what is what is the brain doing it is a signal processor what is it i do not mean a computer i mean a signal processor in the engineering sense what is it what is it doing without getting into all the dynamics of prediction and whatever but the brain is doing is it is some it is a sembling a set of features it is some of the features that it is assembling are very close in detail to the censory surfaces of the body in primary visual quartec there is a retinatopic map the details there are very very low level a line and edge same thing in primary auditory quartecs right it is ton otopic theire tones but's very very very low level details and we might thereare many mny many many of these little features we would say there there is it is a high dimensional array lots and lots and lots and lots of features and then and let us just talk about one structure just the cerebral quartec thet's not worry about l just but what i'm about to say is basically true of really the rest of the brain as well if you take the quartes off the surface of the cuartical sheet off the that wavy gortical sheet to get off the rest of the brain the sub quartical parts and you stretch it out a napkin you can see there is a compression gradi and they are in the architecture of the nurons at the primary censory areas there are these tiny little praminal nurons that are representing these lip these very low level features and they feed into bigger nurons which feed into bigger nurns which feed into more bigger nurons what is happening is you have got this very detailed array being compressed in its dimensionality intil you get to the middle of the brain at the front where there are many fewer nurons but theire bigger and they have many more connections it is a dimensionality reduction that is happening suggestiv make sure i understand a correctly and that the audience understands the physical world obviously is i'm transformed by our sensory apparati the retna the coclea the the sensing nurons in our skin a it is physical things mechanical pressure light phanton soundwaves ok though t that is translated into nurl code which is chemical and electrical and and those censoryinputs are are fairly vast in the o high dimension hidimensionality lots of different orientations of lines lot even yound even though it originates wich just three a confhotopigmens lots of opportunity for incoding different shades of color contrast ok and all of that and you have lots of little nurons to represent all the possibilities of the physical world that are occurring but as that information is past further up along syou' have to be careful with high the use of hieraches caus that is controversion alidays not for political reasons but for accuracy reasons a as that information is passed along there is more a convergence onto a smaller number of larger nurons these are nors that have access to a lot of information but in coarser form rights thereare low yells compressing an empy three hig wen empy re compresses information for example the quartexes representing features i no represent i'm just using that n a generic way because that is also controversial about exactly how is the binkibut ye but utfor now amusing it just in a generic way you go from lines and edges to a shape a round shape to a face to rights to you are you are basically you are you are im you are going what is happening is there are summaries of summaries of summaries of samilis a i hope everyone hears that cause i've been in this field in nor a science a long time as you move along the neracis from the censory a pathelium now itsounds very very nomincally curish but from the surface of the skin inward you are getting summaries ye a son more and more summeries i think thats important a that is a that is a a gazilian doll ar statement for understanding the nervous system but t each of those points correspond to sume mental feature a line or an edge or a circle or a square or a face or right but but now then you when you when you are in the mid line at the front what are those features well those features are things the're they are multimodal summaries meaning they are summaries of the sights and sounds and smells and right but theand they are lower dimentional meaning there their coarser the're things threat reward pleasure i mean really abstract that is what abstract means it does not mean that those representations have no censory or motor meaning that tatit means that threat for example a summary can have many different patterns associated with it and the brain is treating them all as equivalent this this at to me again feel important for people to understand because as i'm hearing this in this word summaries is just ringing my mind it' important because one of the coor components of my experience of my emotions cause at's all i can really say for sure my subjective interpretation and labeling in my own emotions is that they are pretty broad bins a agrive for many broad bends and that that is where i was exactly where i was going what about the word anger where is that represented well that is a that is a one of these multimotal abstractions in fact anger is just a couple of phoneames it is a couple of sounds but those sounds the sound of anger corresponds over thousands of instances that you have learned in your life to very different patterns of censory motor features thit is right because what is going on in your body during anger can very what the way you move your face in anger can very depinng on the situation what you see some one else doing in anger can very in the word anger or any word is actually just a multimotole summary of many many many many instances which are in their censory and motor features the sensory and motor meaning very different and it seems to me are highly constrained by developmental and cultural experience i resolutely cause just to day i learned that there is a word in japan for the feeling that one has of having gotten a haircut they do not there is a word in germany that pretains to the feeling of wanting to punch some one specifically because of the look on their fell lies who are you you the to you it feels their asking to be punched and theven is how you added yet more dimention i addie to it upon learning just those things just to day there is additional dimentionality brought in such that if i were to ever am want uponh somebody in the face simply because of the look on their face that i would not necessarily label that as anger alone it now has another dimension to it and think i'm finally i think i'm finally strying to understand how the developmental and the cultural influences plus the fact that language is a pretty crude descriptor for this noral process that you are descived absolutely absolutely but boocase o bit been before you use the word granularity and samganeuse that word too in fact i ive coined that phrase emotional granularity am this is an aside i coined that phrase almost thirty years ago and now people study it its a phenomenon which is cool in a sense but also i cinauana keepreminding them that is a word that refers to process it is not a thing it is a process and but the processis when the brain is a category constructor how fine grained are the categories how precise to the categories right if you are using if youre feature of e quivalents that your brain is using its threat you are in really big trouble cas they are a gazilian different sensory motor patterns that could go with threat you are categories going to be massive how does the brain figure out which of those massive number of options is the one to use in this in in this instance if on the other hand you do not just want to use sensory motor patterns as the features of equivalents are the features that you are use ing to say this instance wright now is similar to these past instances if i had to search right now what is similar to right now it would be me sitting across ha table from somebody who has a beard and is i'm dressed in black and there there area lot of details there that probably do not matter right yuyou would be searching for specific match from the past that is not very efficient either you need something in the middle and youthen that is to say you need to have cat your brain has to be able to make categories that are more fine grained but not superfine grane but they have to be more fine grain than just threat do you want to keep in the library nalegy that i made really you want to keep the rest of the library axcessible at some level you astel you are not just staring at that one book but if you use the category bad this feels bad then you are brain is basically i'm going to be partially constructing an entire wing full of books up tire wing full of options if you use the word angry i'm then maybe it is a bookcase it is constructing a bookcase full of options and a category that is the size of a bookcase and if you were using the word frustrated then maybe it is a shelf the brain can learn to construct categories at different scales of gengeneralizability if i'm in an instance and i'm my brain is making a guest is it drawing from past instances that we are associated with the word anger we are associated with the word fear maybe it is some combination it is the words are just features there just sounds there are all all sorts of other features what was my heart doing bu but what kind of motor actions did i make what did i see next the point being with i'm trunnit bring here is that it is not your brain createsa an emotional staye and then labeles it what your brain is doing is creating a category of possible futures of what is going to hat what it is going to do next and that state is largely determined by the what the brain is remembering and how it is drawing from that huge population that huge library of options which books is it sampling i love thi much because it explain much that frankly as en perplexing to me and also somewhat troubling to me for instance i a we hear but emotional intelligence and and sometimes i wonder whether not am true emotional intelligence would be what you just described the understanding of how this process work that you can work with it and i deftly want to talk about how one can work with this knowledge because i think it is incredibly powerful in it is a explanatory power but also amits actionable power a the other thing is that it is clear to me just based on my experience today of hearing these words from other cultures that relate to different emotional states that thi system unlike a lot of systems in the brain i to think it is fairly plastic the moment that that there are additional dimensions to sadness anger et cetera there is something comforting about that what is really unsettling is the idea that we have such a broad bins that we are we would define a near infinite number of situations as just fear that would sock that is not a good existence and yet i have to ask whether not you think that as a species not as a culture but in our entire species whether or not we are taking the exact opposite approach that were moving into the imogi isation is at a word i'll make it a word thand people can assault me in the comments a the emogi is ation of this very rich and complex system we are tarting to get into this mode of i'm on opost an angry face and therefore this is a bad i'm angry at you this is a bad interaction worgan it is its uncombat potentially combative or and may be untwitter acts or instograham or other social media sides or kind of the the epidomy of this where you reduce this high dimensional space in you you keep tha the censory stimulation very high s movy after movy after movy and coller and sound and people doing crazy parcours stuff and berris eating grafts or whatever it is inturpying not bearsein draugts wit lu what i mean and you can see stuff that sexual and violent and political and emotional and sweet and then the cats are kissing the monkey and year or the monkeys kissing the cat and its high dimensionality in terms of censory space but then what we call it were oh this is an amogi you assign in a moto your hearting something youre giving it thumbs up or thumbs down i almost feel we were tring to a we were regressing to a state where we are kin an infant tryn a figure ut what the heals going on and were saying it you get six categories of response when in reality a we should probably be expanding the number of different responses that we can have in order to accurately match the way that our nervous system actually works yes exactly there are many different things we culd talk about with respect to the summary that you descape which i i think is completely accurate what i would say is that if you look through even just the last i do not know hundred sar years the nineteenth nineteenth twentieth centuries maybe you can see that the complexity of the of peoples responses expands and contracts right for example this is something that iave written really specutively about am but one of the things that i found really interesting am is that know authoritarianism authoritarian thinking is the reduction of complexity to somethings that are really really simple you'r getting rid of all the complexity to basically these very very course low dimensional judgments and things become black and white m it is the avoidance of complexity em that there can be simple single answers to things and it happens in human culture at times and then then there is an expansion of complexity at times too what predicts that what is it in the human nervous system or our collective human nervous unoliqeuere were just a bunch of brains attached to bodies in er acting with other braits and bodies rits a what is it that causes these ripples of and and i have some thoughts about that that are really really really speculative em but i think the other thing that is that is really important is that we have talked about its we will go back to our our cortical sheet that we have and by the way this just just one compression gradiant and the brain there are others to right there at least four others that i can think of em this is just one but all compression gradeds work the same way which is that enow we have talked about going from the low level details m compressing to these multimodal summeres thes really simple features that are right but that compression is what engineers would call lossy meaning you lose the information you lose the information when you go from lines and edges to a face those nurons they just know the face they do not have they lose what they have thrown away the details they have thrown away those details are gone for those nurons that representi iit are of access they do not have access to it we know we said well the brain is making a guess i's making a guess about what these what this big very very high dimensional soup of signals in the world and in the body what are they mean rit when the brain makes a guess it starts with the compressed low dimensional signals it starts with the features anger or threat or it starts with these summaries and that it hass to infur or guess at every synaps there is a guess that is being made about what the details are at the next level because what is happening is the guess is basically the brain going from these really general things to these very specific censory motor patterns it happens along the cortical sheet it happens also down the nuraxis down the nur from the quartex to the midbrain to the brainstem to the spinal cord you have to go from a representation of run to the actual physical movements of muscl spendalls and angles of joints and things that what you are doing is youare going in the other direction you are adding detail you are particularizing and the brain is guessing it is guessing well if it is using anger as the general feature well which it which instance of anger is it and what are the specifics that are going to happen and out of that would not in forgive me but and what are the adaptive steps that i might take er not take is om quoting alot to day forgive me but in the words of the great sharrington noble prise when hi physiolojust the final common pathway is movement mis movement and that and movement is new ant strihe humans i ispust have among the greatest variety of different speeds and types of movement i think about parcor gymnastics think about then what a it a cheeduck can do cheet us are impressive a gymnist is truly impressive in terms of the range of movements and speeds et cetera in any event the ultimate choice of the nervous ist em as to make is wether not to move which direction how fast or stay still ma forward move back and and i just all just add ecause i i'm hoping that you will expand on this it is been said before that ultimately the nervous system is trying to make decisions about yum yuch or me they cim ma gain move towards something if i can move away from it or my just get a stay put well then only that is only it that tha the tha that is a very that i would say that those are very low to mension all features thog those are those compressed features but that is not the only thing the brain has to decide that is just a misnomer well get that i can get out of that low pickle that i put myself in by saying that i did not say that i kno now i will not got who did cause now i very famous norside to ttt but he tryd to reduce it all he is at caltack it am he is not somebody yo studies emotion he studies the visual system but he said t at that that there is a that that the nerl circuits musecause he studies mice or or sentialy bend in to a yum yuhan me outputs and and i i've always liked it on the one hand caus threes work and it is simple but rarely is the way that we describe things the way to action an mer a we would in n studying humans we would say whell that is affect that the affect that is mood or you nows just is it is it i'm should i move towards it is it pleasant shat i move away from it is it unpleasant or is it irrelevant basically i do not care o cay think about when you are feeling horrible he just feel you feel who you just feel you feel bad wouldo you do you do not know t you do not no because you do not have a plan of action and that is ultimately that is what those those compressed summary features those very low coarse features they have to be decompressed into details otherwise you do not know what to do ultimately what the brain is doing is its sampling from the past based on similarity to the present to plan and action and when i say action i do not just mean skeletal motor action moving a limb it you the first actions that are planed are the actions of co ordinating the heart and the lungs and all of the internal actions that are required to support the motor the skeleto motor movement your brain is making a is categorizing ins making its its creating a category and its their are options there those options the motor plans begin with should the heart beat faster should t be slower does blood pressure need to go up should the should the blood vessels constrict or should they dilate tm should t breathing be deeper or smore shallow i mean those are the first plans that get made and then milla seconds later there are the skeletom motor plans and then your experience of the world derives from those motor plants thos vicero motor that is the plans for the vicera for the internal organs and the skeleto motor some just confer them as motor those motor plans actually give rise tou experience of the world there is not some state that exists as an emotional state which than you apply a label to the label is a just a set of features that are useful for generalizing from the past to the present and the ben size or the the of of what a word refers to can change it can chain it is different for different people and it can change in your lifetime and you can add neubins that is you can for exemple thereis a there is a concept guskin look which i pr ably just butcherd if you speak turkish i'm sorry but it is them it has features of it of loss and people blocking your goals we would say it is anger and sadness together that is giscan look when you lose something in your pissed off about it am that is a but that is a category on it is own rig its just a different way of parcing that that that really detailed soup and the more words the more words are just useful for pointing to a set of features that are similar to each other what i mean by that is if i say to you andrew i had pets a last night for dinner pet's a two sounds two syllables that those two syllables sat they stand in for fifty different censory an motor features cause i do not have to say to you i had a food i did not have peace lessnight but lets say git i had a food that was round and flat and had soss and also cheese and it it had muserelachees and also little parmagoncheese and it had mushrooms on it and a little bit of i'll live and am that is really really a detailed and complicated but instead i can just say iad pet's a two features two sound two syllables phonimes and with those two phonames i have just communicated to you in your brain my brain had fifty features it was representing of details and now i have just communicated those to you or some number of them with two sounds very efficient now of course you might think that i was from chicago and had deep dish petza and i'll just resist i do not want i offend anybody from chicago it is not yat's not alss that that is not real pets am writs you could then ask me oh was it but you are from chicago is that deep dish bee sun than i would say no no i'm actually from terona which is just new york and some not wise thin crustpeats which is really the only kind of piece of there is just saying but you do not but my point is that words are just stand in for they are just lowtthiese low dimensional features theselese sot of gross features that stand in for many many many many little detailed features and that is how we communicate with each other and ten we are constrained by you knont what we know in are yes then what we can say and out of the xtent of orroca and i'll just say that little babyes three months old they do not speak yet and they do not understand language but they can use words to learn abstract categories we abstract just means that that the word refers to many different patterns of censory motor features the word is em or the category the things that make the instance is similar em are a function em were goal not the cenery motor features you say to a baby very explicitly a cause of gretogig about three four month old babyes ripe babies can also do this implicitly to em but in experiments you say to a baby look sweety this is a bling and you put the bling down and it makes a beaping noise and then you say now this look differend feels differend riht smells different look sweety this is a bling it beaps now you take something else which also is different and you say look sweety this is a bling now the baby expects this to beap by the way folks just listening at least a just i gave three samples first with a pen then a coffee mug and then her very own watch a three very distinct objects but all of which make a that are told a the baby is told make aa bling sound and they will been those three ye visually distinct objects functinalliyg distinct objects into one single ben because they make u that because they are sharing a function which is to be i think this is is important and i am and if i may i i i want to ask whether or not we can take this incredible understanding of emotions that is really what we are talking about well really talking about how the brain my my version of how the brain works and how emotions emerge out of theirs this tembasically and and absolutely am ye described it far better than i could and and an anchor that to this concept of movement t the movement is the final common path with the understanding that the movement system and forgive me but that we have systems in the brain and body that allow us to move that is for sure systems plurrel that they run in both directions in other words how we feel what we feel our emotions has some bearing on the movements that are more or less likely for us in a given contact and our movements clearly can also influence the way that we feel internally well i well i mean if em if we just look at how things are happening hereis here is what the anatomy tells us that when the brain makes a guess that guess starts as a motor plan stars is a viteral motorplan in a skeleter motorplan heartray changes breathing changes what pressure changes and and potentially skeltal muscle movement it and literal copies literal copies affirent copies of those signals are sent to they propagate to the censory areas telling the br rain telling those nurons this is the last time we made this in this context when this other stuff just happened the this temporal context tright thand we made these movements here is what we saw next here is what we felp next here is what we smelled next i think of this of the image the popsof my mind we should explaing to be what yeu farns copy is a in neurou science in euranatomy a the connection to a structures called an afferent with an eh and the connections out from a structure calle that ye far but at the way of nas even matter it is just basically the point here is that in our experience and ar in the way the brain you brain conjures an experience of hey and and that experienceis that you feel something first you see something you feel something you act that is not what is happening what is happening is your brain is preparing the action first and the feeling what and your experience comes from that action preparation it is a copy i's literally you have axons that are sending motor signals down the the brain stem to the spinal cord and literal copies of those axons those as ons have branches that colaterals branches that just send axsons other places the same signal that is being sent to your spinal cord to move stuff in your body that same signal is being sent to other nurons in the brain as predictions of the sensations that are going to happen in a second from now a moment from now public fastfer the second but in coble mill seconds if you move and yes it is the case that what you feel is linked to what you do and what you do is link to what you feel but not in this simple mechanistic way that that neur scientists and psychologists have been using for ever you it s not you are you are you you are probed by a stimulus you you see something you hear something and then you processed and evaluated and then youe react to it no that is not what is happening what is actually happening under the hood is that based on how things are right now your brain makes a guess or some guesses and those guestsis start as motor plans and the consequence of those motor plans are predicted sensations and then of course censory signals are coming from the censory surfaces and they and here is the really here is to me the really the most mind boggling thing about this fol explanation if you are censory nurons in your censore areas are already they are firing that the the the action potentials the spiking has changed base on these prepared motor movements these are censory predictions and when i give talksin on my webside to have some cool examples of of how this works you can experience it yourself you start to experience you hear things that are not there you you feel vibrations in your chest that are not there because your brain is predicting its predicting these sensations let us say the sensations come tthe sensory signals i should say lime the censory signals from the censory surfaces of the body make it to the brain if you have if your nurons are already firing in a way to anticipate those signals those signals just confirm the firing and then they are done they do not make it any further into the brain when you are predicting well your experienceis constructed completely by your brain the signals from the censory surfaces are there just to confirm or to change the signals if there is things you did not anticipate then those a errors of prediction those afe the signals that are propagated and become compressed and stuff and we have a special name for that in science we call it learning ou know anticlark is a philosopher who writes a lot about prediction predicting brain and and on and he talks about normal la everyday experience as being a controlled hallucination that is true yet i subscribed to that am it is a fairly adapted and most circumstances controlled hallucination but but it has its limitations and it i mean what we are talking about am if i can be a somewhat of a summarineer on youn tell me if at my summary is to worse am is that firs al that the nerl systems and the brain let us jus call the nervous system creturing bot brain and body are incredibly dynamic there is it is bunch of imputs those in puts gets are incredibly elaborate they get summarized the summary prepares the body for a certain action that is a motor commands premotor commands and then some action may or may not be taken but already as soon as an action is taken or not taken the whole state of the neral system is different it is changed as a consequence of just of what just happen of course when people hear that and when i hear that indeed i i feel wots it is a toss system to study becausethese ar dynamical neral systems and and we have the technology to put people in functional scanners and look at what lights up to speak we have the capacity to ask people how they feel based on questionairs but you can imagine that is incredibly crudes then you give them liker scales of yu now rate from one to ten how happy or sad you are and see your adding some some depth intomentionality to but it is incredibly crude it is nothing real experience and if somebody is more verbal less verbal maybe they somematicize more or less mean i but example comes to mind it ooccasionally you l arn from social media which often i learn from sociamedian some one once said i do not think in thoughts i think in feels and i thought i get greatly you are probably also from northern california and i said wait andrew stopping judgemental what do you mean and i aske they said i experience emotions in their mind first as a as a bodily state then the label comes much later that is not how it works for me it feels fairly more integrated brain and body for me but other people started chiming and no i think of emotion i experience emotions clearly as a verbal label it is all in they are head and you start to realize that we might all being coding the world slightly differently or very differently and it is changing in time then the question becomes how what are the anchor points in terms of our understanding of emotions that we can work wirth and and and the following questions come to mine i'm neither you nor ir clinitions as far as i know i'm certainly not i met laualy train to the clennes oh there you go i'm right again at i ham an ee i i have not ri have not practiced in really gasilyins o vearat will you ha your were your more than qualifyd to answer the question i am about to ask which is to me there is a great conflict of information in the psychology psychiatry and less just call it wellness and mental health space which is when we are feeling lousy not good let us put vailance on it just lousy i do not want in the state that we were having an emotion that we do not want to have there is an entire category of information that says you need to feel your feelings oun to feeliour feelings you need to acknowledge that they are there you need to go in to the feeling maybe even full catharsis you need to amplify the feelings until they quenqui leave your body after all steve jobs was into scream therapy and the helped him mx punges anger who knows you get these examples he is pry the worst example cause it semed he was angry a lot from what i re but then there is another category of thought which is no you need to use your ability to top down control in hibition of the quarteks on lower structures again im deliberately using crude language here to say wait this is an emotion emotions pass this is not real this is just a limited set of a high dimentionality stuff that is been summarised and it i do not need to feel this way i can make myself feel differently maybe i'll go for a run in fact i always feel better after i go for a run even this question as simple as should we feel or our feelings or should we not feel our feelings and of course you would hope that this would be answered appropriately such that people do not go harm other people are themselves but but assuming that the'renot can harm other people o themselves verbally or physically then you really get yourself into a bit of a pickle we do not understand what to do with emotions hours it wer other peoples because clearly we do not understand emotions persay i would say i'm going to answer your question and then i want a u o picket the wore the i want a picket and assumption because it it is come up actualy a couple of times and there is something superimportant in your descriptions that i just want to pull out for for the listeners isthing is really important and you are doing it very naturally but i think some people it would beit just bears commenting on let me just deel what the question iv should we feel our feelings or use our words we say to little kins use your words do not throw a tan trom right but then there is also this other feeling with all just feel it is important to feel and you do not want to get hav it be pent up and an reveals your body and ik gaat a pillow yo having ther scream therei be bite the pillow scream the plow terre the pillar and theres you can pay five thousand dollars for we out of doing this yesand i'll tell you n t feel better agaand the answer there is it is the wrong question flexibility is important for everything always right im first of all you do not have you doft have emotions in your body your body does not keep the score yo great book title because it supercatchy yot with all due respect to i think the important work of vendrico i think it oversimplified and let people to believe that their backpain was trama and that all trama is somaticize and it is not no it is not but i i would go further and say first of all your body doest keep the score your brain keeps the score your body is the score cart that is superimportant and he has done really important work but his explanations for why things work it scientifically incorrect it just is because we do not feel things in our bodies we everything we feel we feel in our brains we do not see in our eyes we see in our brains of course we need our eyes but we do not see in our eyes just if you pinch your your hand with take skin and pinched between to to fingers the skin you do not feel that actually in your hand you feel it in your brain that is the magic of the brain in a sense what i would say is it em i it depends on the situation and what your goal is im sometimes it is useful to use your words and sometimes it is useful to go for a run it just depends on what your goal is wll both the that cases yere youre a that you gave both us example scuse me yer it is a way of shifting off the emotion i guess what i mask is well some thome you do not want to shift off the emotion sometimes the mote sometimes the wisest thing to do is live in the emotion that is you no sometimes a discomfort sometimes when something feels bad it does not mean something is wrong it just might mean that you are doing something hard ell earlier i hanble when your tik about the the broad categrisation motions i i wrote down your simple as good when it feels good youl i had just feel really girat but then on things feel lousy well that is where you wants could be beneficiyet absolutely because were because emotions are recipes for action when you go from veel it feeling bad to feeling angerary or sad it is a recipe for action and i would also say and this just this is an analogy but i i sort of i stand by it i'm i when i was am i had major baxergery couple of years ago and i know something about chronic pain it is not my area of study but i know something about it cause i'e ie aunt reanalyzed o some data sets and i've read a lot som not an expert but i have ideas and i thought to myself well i just t ida one a end up with chronic back pain what i did was i made sre after i got through the first couple of weeks where i really needed oxy coat on that i could walk you knowi was up in walking the same day i had surgery if you could call it walking is sortof a uphamism forlic hobbling around on a with a walker but i'm i made sure that i felt the pain that is i doset myself with discomfort quite deliberately because i wanted to make sure that i ii'm sorry for using cartesian language i do not know how else to say this i i wanted my brain to be taking in the prediction air i wanted my brain to to feel the to o i wanted to focus attention on the changing disyou know the the changing discomfort over time because it meant that my body was heeling as the discomfort got less but my brain would never feel that discomfort changing if i a took pain killer and because the prediction error the things that the brain does not predict our teaching signals and i think it is true also in your life sometimes you want to feel it because you you want to feel the discomfort because it is instructive about something and sometimes it is not and that is maybe that is not really in answer but the only way you can figure that out for yourself is to do it sometimes if you are always getting rid of discomfort you never know when it is useful and it is useful sometimes but now i want to get to this point that i was making before we are talking about feeling and emotion interchaned they are interchangeable and they are not right here is how i would say it your brain is always regulating your body twenty four seven and your body is always sending sensory signals back to the brain about the sensory state of the body and our nervous systems are not wired for us to experience those censory changes that are happening in the body in any degree of detail we are just not and it is a good thing thake right now as we talk here our hearts are beating and are pancreous is squishing stuff out lin liver is filtering and bryou know oxagin concentragions ore changing all there is a whole drama going on inside each of us and our listeners and we are largely not aware and i hope our listeners are not aware because if they were they would not be listening to anything we were saying they would be completely in in raptured or were in discomfort at what is going on inside them instead the brain creates a low dimensionable summary this gross kind of barometer which is feeling affective feeling we call it or you could call it mood but scientist c ll it affect with an eg feeling pleasant feeling unpleasant feeling worked ap feeling calm feeling comfortable feeling uncomfortable it is kind of a general barometer of the state of the body and it is not emotion that those feelings those features of feeling are features of consciousness because your brain is always regulating your body your body's always sending signals back to the brain the brain is always representing them in this low dimensional way whether your paying attention or not whether the brain is focusing it is applying attention to those nur ons or not thet those signals are there and even when we are not emotional if you are driving on the highway and somebody cuts you off and you think what an assfhul the asspulness of that person that intensity of that negative affect it is you experience it as a property of that person but really it is coming from you it is it is not a property of that person it is that is a feature of your experience in that moment and affect is always there sometimes it is in the foreground sometimes is in the background but it is always there and it is a summary of physical things which is why it helps to if you take ibe prophin or tilonal it will redue it mean study show it reduces negative feeling if you go for a run if you go for a walk if you shift your attention to the outside world thand the features that of experience that ore derived from the inside world diminish that is why going for a run helps are going for a walk helps or getting sleep helps right these are all things where your changing the state of your body and the sensory state of your body's changing an you are affect changes but emotions are the story that the brain tels about what c aus the censory signals that affect derives from what cause those changes what ae i need to do about those changes that is that is that get it is a much bigger event than just these features of experience which are all features of consciousness which are always there they are always there and in fact in our culture we we pathologized people when they just experience their bodies as physical sensations and not is emotions we say othat person much o somatisizing or somatizing they are not they should there really there they should be experience bing in motion but really there yoexperiencing a stomach ache and that is bad but that is actually a judgment call that is probably sometimes wrong sometimes it is probably better to experience a stomach ache sometimes it is more productive part of being emotionly intelligent as knowing when not to construct an emotion right before the covid pandemic was announced officially i was in new zealand giving talks and my daughter who was it wo was in college at that time was flying i literally i think less than a week before the pandemic was announced she got on a plan and she flewta new zealand to met me because it was spring break and i always would bring her with me on spring break and in that and i remember really vividly i was in new zealand there was only one case one case of covid in new zealand at that point and i i got on the phone to my husband and i say i'm experiencing a very high level of arousal and it is very very unpleasant now my husband knows me very well and he said yet there is a lot f uncertainty and i said i know now he did not say to me whell you are anxious and you just do not really know it i cause i was not anxious i was feeling uncertain and as or maybe people ar now that when there is a lot of uncertainty there is also a lot of arousal because the brain is attempting to learn and the nermodulators that are important for learning new things happened also cause a a subjective sense of arousal and some they actually also modulate your audonomignervous systems to your heart can be fast from reverend our go to explanation for what that is is to experience that arousal as anxiety but i was uncertain and remember that how your brain the story it is telling itself the category it is making is a plan for action what doe you do in anxiety in fear you freeze or you run away what do you doin uncertainty you forage for information you tolerate the discomfort and you forage for information which is what i was doing when i called and said what should we do should i meet her the airportant turn round come back or should we have a vacation i do not really know am and what i ended up doing was foraging for information or another couple days and then made a split second decision in the eir when we were flying from one island to the other and whi just reruted us and we went home and then the borders closed two days later but my point is that it this is not just a psychological mumbo jumbo you con train yourself to experience your heart pounding in your chest as determination but when my daughter thisis all in how motions are made these examples but they are true mean my daughter just us this book i rod a couple years ago when my daughter was twelve years old she was te sting for a blackbelt in carati she was five feet all not even and she was testing against these massively large adolessen boys they who were a foot taller than her and her sensa who was a temptically blackbell did not say to her do not be aferad he said get your butterflies flying in formation and i was in rapture only anmy gon this kinds tonally brilliant that is the best meaning to give to arousal that changes the meaning of it what you do when you create an emotion is your giving meaning to those affective feelings and you have more control then you might think in how you do that you can do it by changing the physical state that gives rise to those feelings but you can also change it by learning more how to make more categories and how to make them more fluidly am that you do something different and the it is not the things will necessarily feel any more unpleasant or any less or are any more pleasant it is that the feeling becomes a source of wisdom it is a cue to do something different tis a case awhere i absolutely believe that a knowledge about how emotions and affect and states of the brain and body work which is what you are beautifully describing for people to day is extremely useful in an of itself and i think it om and i it is a frankly t'si it is a refreshing and welcome departure from a lot of the conversations that we normally have on this part cast where youknw we talk lae lu about protocals we tike about tools i thinks that people can do ways they can implement the knowledge and her this is certainly one of those cases as well but uem it is a beautiful one and a very important one where the knowledge itself just the knowledge of additional words for different states i love the example of butter putting butterflies into formation because it it inherent to that is that you are not try to get rid of the butterfliese quite the opposite you are deploring them in certain ways and the is an action step and a psychological step there of course that is required but that it is not a in a few morning sunlight for an average of ten minutes to set your circatian rhythm which is something that i say over and over again i'll going to the grave saying that the put put a window over my graves as some li can get in at this point by which shuld be fine with me but in any case em knowledge is power something that we hear but it is not always true often it is knowledge is power but you need to do ex whyanze in a certain order but hear what you have provided and you you are continue to provide is knowledge that people can use that real estate within their brain i'm deliberately not giving it a name a because it is it is distributed real estate that allows them to take an unpleasant feeling and work with it that it has more dimensionality than we probably realize that is becoming clear to me that rarely if ever is there less dimentionality you can always give it more dimentionality by just shifting your attention and you can practise this really there is the story that i tell about when i the brief a moment when i tryd to learn how to paint and a there is an object a cup and you have this three dimentional object and you want a rander it on a too dimensional canvass you could just try to draw the cup and then what you get is a pretty shiddy looking cup em bat what what a realist pai ter will teach you to do is to take the cup and to break it apart into pieces of light and then what you try to paint or the pieces of light to you'r transfering your first what you are doing is you are taking this very low dimensional coarse object called a cup in your breaking it into tiny little pieces of light is what the visual system itis what the visual system does and what you are doing is your catagrizing it differently in order to emphasize the features that are more high dimensional that are in there right there in there in in the brain but you can but what you are doing essentially is your your having the brain your brain is applying attention to basically a focus more on those details and then you transfer the details on to the two dimensional canvass and what you get is a pretty decent looking three dimensional cup on a tw dimenional canvass unlat unless you are me and tand then it still look shiddy wie now and maybe all i'll take up again sometime in the future but my point is that you can do that with your own sensory condition of your body in emotion you can deliberately focus on what your heart is doing to the cheered the best of your ability that you can sense it right or you can deliberately focuss on your breathing or you can deliberately focus onewhat your muscles or how how tense they feel you can you can change the dimensionality of your experience by the shifting of your attention lo it end out forgive me for giveing another example by thing its one that will resinate with both of us in hopefully with our liss nurses well which is the great olversacs nourologist an author am talked about and rode about you'r you would work with these patients that were either had locked in cindrum or severe autism or severe terets ir parkinsons and your most people would even clinitions who specialize in those areas would look at those people n say that their living in a diminished world it is it is their lak capacities that other people have and and it is all about the athe absence of certain abilities and and then what he did eventually was incredible he loved animals he would spend time thinking about what it would be for instance to be a bat hanging in the corner of a room and experience the room not through vision but mainly through ecolocation and he would pend a lot of time thinking about that he also did a lot of drugs at one point is fereand stopped not because they were very destructive drugs not just psychodelics but also met them phetamines o yes he has that but he eventually changed his practice to trying to experience human emotion but first think about animal censory experience and he would do that for lots of different types of animals octapuss and bats and all these erethings and then it allowed him in his words it allowed him to than interact with patience in a way where he could feel maybe even empathize a little bit with how they experienced life and then he would write books about it in a way and here on borrowing some one else's words that storied these people into almost greater larger than life characters and now of courst he was not trying to detract from their suffering but he was trying to give people an understanding of what that suffering was through their actual experience and he did in my opinion and the opinion menar other people a masterful job not doing that but it came through much in the same way that your our teacher said you knowt pay attention to the way the that the changes in light across thethat the object as suppose to trying to drop draw the object themselves that when we that that the take away here that i i think were arriving at is that that you have provided is that if we take a if we add to mentionality to our description of or experience of the censory imputs and there is all ton of it to reach to and we may even come up with some new internal labels or languagh base labels that we can experience the world and much richer and much more adapted forit absolutely and i i love i love your stories and i love this story in particular about oliver sax because a it resinates with my experience when i was reading em ed yong's new book oh em it first he wrote ah we contain multitudes which you o think one of politser and then ah what is the recent way with th animalof immense wer an immense world and what i what i was thinking was it is a first of all it is a masterful masterful masterful book i wish i had written that book ii wrote him a fan letter else li m book here ma am but because he helps you exexperience what what i want to say is this that there are all these animals that have different sensory surfaces than we do and they can detect signals in the world that are that we that are not relevant to us because we do not have sensory serfaces for them and it reminds you first of all that what you experience as reality is really not in the world alone and it is not in your head alone it is in the transaction between the two you are the nurons in your brain and in your nervous system are also part of the reality and reality is the transaction raliality are are the features that are the transaction between signals in the world and signals in your brain and the parts of the world that some other animals experience that we will never experience they are not really part of our reality because they do not interact with any of the anything that we have but for those animals it is part of their niciits part of their nicius just the word for the parts of the world that matter to you basically and i was thinking that if people read this book and u know maybe it will help them have empathy for other people who do not have minde theirs and who do not experience the world in the way that they do your description of what wout am oliver sact his woul his them his actions were in his gald it did occur to me that this book by a yong would be a great too all for helping people to understand that the way that they experience the world it might be different then how other people experience the world and even a little bit of a window on that it would be a good thing i'd to ask you more about this word affect and then i'd to discuss how things that we do or do not do mig be useful for putting us in broad categories of affect that we might experience particular a rays of emotions a this is my attempt to understand affect in an effort to think about some actionable items i love the word affect the way you described it as re setting up a but tenshal ar a series of potentialities for different emotions to occur i make it a point to get sunlight in my eyes in the morning to try and wake up my buring and body because indeed it does that a ot broadly speaking i make an effort to get good sleep at night because that makes everything better then when i'm not sleeping well or enough it makes everything worse this is non clinical non nuaunt's language but i think most people when they hear affect and they think about the examples i just gave not of understand yallic when a kid is tired t le tem kid to get cranky when worse sleep defrive yo get cranky indeed there are times when i'm sleep deprived and little things great on me they would a splinter just feels s oper annoying it maybe ven painful but whet am well rested things are going better it is not that that to tell us more about affect because i think it is a really important ancer point for us to understand emotions in ourselves and other people ner scientists think about the sensory systems for touch and propriaception which we call somad a sensation as being in the service of motor skeler motor movements you really the our sense of touch and even vision actually also works this way am and ye and actually addition does to these senses actually serve in am the brains ability to control the movements of the body and the same thing is true a for the am regulating the systems of the body brains one of their fundamental jobs are to co ordinate and am regulate the systems inside your body your heart your lungs you are got all the moving parts and the information the the sensory signals that that those am organs and and tissues in on send back to the brain am as i said before those sensory signals are importantto the brains ability to regulate the body but we do not feel them directly we usually experience them as affective feelings these very simple physical sorts of feelings and then we elaborate them in various ways they they really when they get very intense that those are the moments when the brain creates us to creates amotion out of them the brains regulation of the body the predictive regulation of the body is the technical term is allow stasis but when i'm explaining this to the public i use a metaphor and all metaphors are wrong but some metaphors are less wrong and useful the metaphor that i use is em your brain is running a budget for your body and it is not budgeting money it is budget in glue coasts and salt in oxygen and water an all the neutrients that you need to stay alive and well and you can think about withdrawals from that budget burning glue coase or using up oxygen you can think about deposits sleeping and eating you can think about savings when you are with afriend who you trust and everything you do actually is just slightly less metable expensso right and you can also think about taxes if you are stresse socially stressed within two hours of eating a meal that same meal will cost you a hund and the equivalent of a hundred and four more calleries in the inefficiency that you will metabolize it because of that stress uem me you will burn more energy you will be more inefficient in metabolizing the food it is as if you had eaten a hundred four more caloryso i hav exactly backer and over the course of a year that is eleven pounds when we say that people are taxin almost yet we would it is literally there er language would ask thar er language words go the way i describe it is that you can think about affect as a quick and dirty summary of the state of your body budget if things are going reasonably well then you will feel oquet you might even feel pleasant if you are running a defasit in your body budget then you are going to feel fatigued or we are distressed and that does not mean something is necessarily wrong for example when you exercise you get to a certain point where you have reached your vantilatory load usually it is twenty minutes in or ten minutes in or whatever o being a harger working and you sry to feel unpleasant and fatigued but that does not mean that something is wrong that just means that you are working really hard and you have to push through it and then when you are drink water and you eat afterwards in replenishiand then you are fune right in fact you are better it is it is a a way of unbuilding a better stronger future you affect is basically when when things when you feelly really worked up it probably means that something is uncertain somewhere i just think of bat these as quick and dirty ways of thinking about you are you are what you are what you'r affect means and and then oftentimes as we have said before emotion regulation that is controlling emotion really actually it is not much about changing the meaning of affct it is changing the affect and it is useful to understand that affect is tied to the state of your body or actually what is tied to is your brains beliefs about the state of your body youre brain is modelling the state of the body and that is in terraception that is the technical word an terreception is not you are awareness of your body it is your brains modelling of your body what youre brain believes to be true about the metabolic state of your body and that is how i think about affect that is how i thing about my own affect that is and my daughter actually who was depressed for i should say depression is a bankrupt body budget you just cannot move you feel fatigue fatigued that you cannot move and you are v ery distressed is bankruptcy and actually if you i mean depression is a metabolic illness and if you look at the symptoms of depression they really are about metabolic having metabolic depisits basically and it is interesting that one of the hollmarked features of depression subjectively speaking is e lack of positive anticipation about the future which makes perfect sense from the perspective of a depleded grandbody bout you yes exactly your and your basically think about the fact that prediction error wright if you are feeling unpleasant you are not going to be anticipating pleasant things and even if those things that are in the world could give you pleasure you will not notice them because learning from prediction error things that you did not predict is expensive and if you do not have the resources you are nock on i right it is but anyway's my daughter came up with this after we had this very interesting thing that happened to us at another trip and we were in sweden because i was giving a a keen ot at the carolinska institute and we went i took her to sweden and this is when she was recovering from depression and she is just one of the millions of youn adults who adolescence and young adulse who wrs experiencing depression and i we got to sweden and she was very very jet lag we both were was one of these we had to yo plains trains an automobileil just yon getting there and she wook up the next morning and she weshe looked horrible she felt horrible it actually seemed to me she was about to enter another depressive episode and i said to her i basially got her out obed i fed her a meal i gave her four i beprophen and i put her back to sleep and she got up five hours la te when she was absolutely fine her mood was fine nowi'm not telling you that i be prophin is the an any topresson that you should take if you are depressed but what i'm telling you is that you said something antry that was interesting in the being ginning you sid am i fatigued does my body do i have pain somewhere as my body hurt these are well right when basically what she was having was she was fatigued and she was having what i would call miss called the technical word is viceral no suception which means her stomach hurt her everything hurt and sure her muscles trouble her to but it was really hurt in urds really she just was distressed and the the i be prphand helped her get back to sleep and then she slept and she got up and she was completely fine and then we walked around stalk home for the rest of the day talking about this experience which for her was flipping on a lightswitch how emotions are made this book that i referred to i wrote that book for her i wrote that book for her but also for me because it was a way of putting down on paper all the things that i wanted her to know that and that i thought other people should know about their kids and maybe even their kids could read it but what she did with that whac she came up with a new concept called the emotional flew and the emotional flew is when you are having a bad body budgeting day and you'r just youdn't get enough sleep may be or there is some stress at at worker at school that you cannot get rid of otherwise my husband likes to say well a you knowe other people's opinions of you are just electrica lectivity in somebody is head which i love ester's another way of categorising it a sort of taking apart the taking a part the cup into pieces of light right and whatever there are just these moments where you feel topleaded and you could use that i mean that we usually we often use affect to as a as a indicator of how the world is if i feel bad something must be bad wrong in the world but you ave to resist that sometimes because sometimes it there is nothing wrong in the world thit is just that you didn' getting of sleep or you need to have a little bit more protine or maybe you have not gone for a walk and you are stiff or whatever you need to do some stretching ar those that as sarge inteurupe but i think people are going to want to anchor to a few of these a you positive steps that they can take to reto i do not say replenish but to shift affect in positive directions a sleep movement nutrition yes and i've heard you say before that we are essentially a meno acid forging machines ye i knoce you said protine you did not say you need a bagal you said protine we can go down that rabbit hole maybe maybe we do maybe we do not but i want to use this al just as a quick opportuniti s say as you are saying all this one can immediately understand why alcohol and drugs of abuse are both compelling right you are not feeling well yaso take your feeling un tired take a stimulant that releases do arming in up an effrnd but you'r taxing you are already taxed body budget yes in a way that then puts you in a more to pleaded stately or alcohol yet you feel lousy a alchall never did this for me but friends i have who are recovered alcoholics will tell me that it was a magic a lixer an made them feel right the hs their language but then of course there is a price to pay later because than it drops your base line below where it was not a sh absolutely one hundred one hundred and tem per sent t i just also wen to say that is seratone and ar is aressasar eyes maybe and when i say maybe what i mean by that is if you really have a metabolic problem say something is wrong with your metacondria or you are recovering from an illness and that were were there is just some metabali prom in your body that metabal prom is real if you start to feel unpleasant you will i mean feel unpleasant you will feel your mood will be negative if you stare taking srato if you stare taking essess or eyes which will leave more saratone and in the scynapses of your a ner on's before its rit is taken up again that will duce the system you will be able suspend you will be able to move you will feel you have more energy for a while but your nervous system is is a complex system and it is going to make adjustments elsewhere to try to deal with that budgeting problem exactly what happens when you take drugs of abuse and hat what happens on the short term can happen for some people with essess or eyes on the longer term weare at first to sarcs to work and then its stopt stops working and you start to gain wait and and your because your metabolism is slowing because your brain is attempting to deal with that with that budgeting problem it really matters what the what the source is it could be that your brain believes you have a budgeting problem but there really is not one it could be that the really is one these things matter to how you treat it one thing ut i am just mention about assessorise and i unfortunately for reasons o confidentiality i cannot psit the source on this but let me to say that somebody ise highly informed in the in the landscape of of former suitical treatments for am psychiatric challenges has told me that there is an emerging theory among psychiatrices kind of a collective emerging theory that am one of the reasons why nowadays you hearabout called treatment resistant depression but you did not hear about called treatment resistant depression prior to the advent of assessorise is that there is a growing body of thought in the psychiatric community the assessorise may overtime as your pointing out deplete the very n eral systems that subger enhanced mood it is it is different thin a drug of abuse that gives you a very acute effect mathem phetamine or cohane or alcohol but that over time you may actually be pulling the very neral circuits and nor chemicals that would allow for positive affect deeper and deeper into the trenches ye to speak and there is a growing number people who simply do not respond to the drugs any longer or other treatments right i was not trying to say the mechanism is the same i was basically saying the theme is the same and that i'm agreing with yat what happens over the shore term with drugs if abuse happens over the longer term with for some people with us as arise because it has not been recognized yet that the that at the basis depression is a metabolic problem and when you have a metabolic problem dibeties or obesity or a wer a hart disease it is not that that causes depression it is that there is a confin problem which is that somewhere in this very complex system of your metabolism there is there there is a drag and it produces negative mood and that is how you experience it sometimes it is good not to turn it is productive not to turn a that negative affect into an emotion sometimes sometimes the cigar is just as cigar sometimes you just need to deal with the affective problem by dealing with the physical your physical state and that is the tricky bit is knowing when is affect telling you something is wrong with the world and when is it telling you that there is something wrong with your physical state that you need attend to i think everything to me at least starts with a good nights sleep on a caston basis and and every psychiatric challenge and indeed suicide itself it seems to be asociated with and often preceded by challenges in sleeping alkin at isn in in circating rhythm i think that is why ht to me sleep is the foundation of mental health and physical health absolutely inso when i tell people when they say what can i do as they wof there is only if there is only one thing that you could pick i would say get get a good niche sleep on a regular basis if you could pick to more i would say eat healthfully stop eating sudo food do not get me wrong i love french rise i love french wrise they are that is gods with perfect food i'm really but eat healthfully they eat real food and get exercise and if you do those three things i know i sound a mother and feel fer to roll your eyes at me but as a near scientists those are the actually before you start u with all the bekno mentalizing jedie tricks you could just start with this and that would actually take you pretty far and an and that will resinate very well with our audience em the basics of sleep exercise food sunlight and social connection o one is anxious and gand those five or the ones that that we just keep returning to over and over again and i think people say all what is just simple a motherly advice but i would i think that those five things even just the one thing around sleep that there is some work that is required to get that done it is not as simple the categories are simple but the work that is required to get great sleep as often as one can on a consistent basis if your raising kids have a career live in the world am there is a lot there and that is where i think there is there is a there is an elaboration of of things and ene neads o learn to be flexible wher'se traveling how do you do that when be no friends are visiting how do you do that when weathers off it and on a that the relationship pieces im iscan i i res ani lat you mengion that yeol lat you ban because you said before and and this was another on those moments i listen to a listen tos many of your podcast as i possibly can but yes i think it was the first of the second one with lexs freedmen where you said you knw we are regulating each others nervous systems i will never forget and i imagine that you married your husband for a number of different reasons but am when people pair up with romantic partners with friends with co workers the ideal situation is one in which we are not taxed where maybe even people and just being around them ore just knowing that they are in our lives provides a sort of deposit to yet it is a savings it provides te savings for sure and then i think that is a lot of what emotional residence to plack on a pop language on it it isis all about yet who feels good to be around who does not feel ga yeteri would say the best thing for a human nervous system is another human and the worst thing for human nervous system is also another human and you really want to be around the people who make you the best the best version of yourself that you could be and that does not mean that you always get a savings sometimes year sometimes you are taking care of that person and youre you are absorbing some of the their burden right and vice versa but i would say the research on social icillation and loneliness and on shows us that you nont whele along with research on syncrany and there is just a whole bunch of research to to suggest that a we are the curetakers of each other's nervous systems and it does not matter what your opinion is it does not it just but we just that is how we evolved tha species and you get to decide what kind of a person are you going to be are you going to be are you going to be a savings are you going to be a tacks and in general it seems that people who decide that they are going to be a savings am tand to because people gravitate towards that want more of that yeand hopefully would provide that also i'mand i think the reciprocity pcere feels from really strong well that is ovverly interesting ting about m about the syncrany work critso there is work that if you researcs that if you put people together who do not even know each other but if they if they each other in they they have a sense of trust even after a couple of minutes they start to synchranize their physical signals ir hartrate sarts to syncranize their movements sarjes synchenize thare hartly probably syncranizes cause their breathing starts to synchronize right and it is really interesting to see what you what you typically see is that who is pacing and who is leading one person is the leader and then the other person is the pacer am i got that language from when i learned hybnos us by the way and am but it switches back and forth who is the leader in i in a good in a inat what we say good ana in an interaction that looks productive it its switching all the time who is who is pacing and who is leading it is not that always one person is is am is in charge to speak physiologically speaking we did as series recently on mental health with palconti whos a psychatris an the word narsicism came up a few times because people have a lot of questions about that yon he emphasize that narsisists are not confident they they operate from a place of of a defasit of pleasure it is never enough and an intense envy although that is not how they present and theire often usually not aware of it themselves but it is what leads healthy people to feel as if the interactions with those people narses often can be very compelling in the moment but they feel very taxed after words in kind of confused by what happened and it sounds it a ties back to this lack of syncrany on the positive side of things it is also clear from what you just said that when people regulate each other's nervous systems in a way where people are making little deposits in providing savings for each other or maybe things are just neutral that those nervous systems are then in a position to pay attention other things too and m not just trying work out the dynamics oh for sure u oh and that is very true at work there is researt showing that i'm especially in the creativity sector innovation sector of the economy the best predictor of performance on the job is the extent to which people feel an we after you account for sleep and and watering and sleeping and feeding right the that am the best predictor is the amount of trust that you have in your team and in you are managers because if the world is predictable could still be things culd be hard even when things are unpredictable you have people who have your back and basically what you are doing is you are you are they are making deposits or savings thei're causing savings in each other's body but jit is there their resources can be spent on the harder things which is failing and cannot having to pick yourself back up and try again which is partly what you do when you are an innovator i think that there is also recers to show that in your personal life when you do random acts of kindness for people or when you are kind in general you drive also a body budgeting benefit from that am for a while i had a friend who am we would meet each other for lunch once a month and you kow we would take turns paying and wen we could both pay for ourselves but wev got a got a double hit he paid for me one month and then i would pay for him one month and then yo know we get the double hit of a being kind to some one else and i and also they got the benefit of some one being kind to them and i'll just say i think kindness is a i do not know that we have many conversations about that in our culture right now but i think kndness is very very underated and should be when i'm when my when i feel shit i bake bread for my neighbour who is in his seventies him and his wife that is what i do when i when i'm not feeling good and fi ou mean after i have taken care of the physical the possible o physical causes i and then i feel great because he is always he is always grateful and and then i felt i made his day better and then also he helps me inother ways with my garden and stuff cause he is just a master gardener and i feel we have this relationship where we help each other and i know it sounds really sappy but and even though all the research backs up what i'm saying i it does not quite describe the feeling of when some one is just really happy because you just gave them a little surprise and there that that there is just some juce in that i think on some culture out there there is a word for that i'm soing arela i sure theas well ihave to say am i've thoroughly enjoyed this conversation no yu i iave been looking forwr to it for a long time and you have provided us with a really broad arc but also a deep dive into not just how emotions are made not just about affect but as you mention early or really how the nervous system works and i am certain in fact that our audiences taking this in and realizing that that knowledge is incredibly powerful the the addition of new aunts but to language into sor self reflection states am as extremely valuable in often times when one gets into conversation that has some level of reductionism and you get into noming clature an things that it can really pull away from the real life experience of something but this is exactly the opposite what you have done for us to day is you have provided such a rich array of information that adds written richness and depths to the real life experience and im and that is really invaluable on behalf of myself and all the listeners and the

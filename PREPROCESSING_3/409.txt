welcome to the hubermen lapo science science ay to e r i may ndrew hubermen and om a professor of neurbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor casey halpern doctor halpern is the chief of nauro surgery at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine his laboratory focuses on bullemia bingeeting disorder and other forms of obsessive compulsive behaviors normally when we hear about eating disorders or obsessive compulsive disorders of other kinds the conversation quickly migrates to pharmicalogic interventions and ceratonan or dopomne or talk therope interventions many of which can be effective the halpern laboratory however takes an entirely different approach while they embrace pharmicalogic and behaviora an talk theropianterventions their main focus is the development and application of engineer devices to go directly into the brain and stimulate the nurons the nerve cells that generate compulsions that cause people to want to eat more even when their stomach is full in other words they do brain surgery of various kinds sometimes removing small bits of brain sometimes stimulating small bits of brain with electrical current and even stimulating the brain through the intaxscull that is without having a drill down beneath the skull in order to alleviate and indeed sometimes cure these conditions to day's discussion whenh doctor halpern was an absolutely fascinating one for me because it represents the leading edge of what is happening in modification of brain circuits and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease for instance they just recently published a paper in nature medicine one of the premeer journals out there entitled pilot study of responsive nucleous eccummons deep brain stimulation for loss of control eating the nucles ocummons is an area of our brains that we all have in fact we have two of them one on each side of the brain that is intimately involved in the release of dopomine for particular modiv ated behaviors and while most often we thing about dopomine for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in in this context they are using stimulation and control of neuronal activity innucleous eccumbons to control loss of control eating something that when people suffer from it dispite knowing they should eat despite not even wanting to eat they find themselves eating again this represents really the leading edge of where nerow science is going and certainly is going to be an are of naroscience thats going to expand in the years to come and doctor halpern and the members of his laboratory are among a very small group of scientists in the world that are using the types opproaches that are described a minute ago and thatyou can hear more about in to day's episode in order to resolve some of the most difficult and debilitating human conditions during to day's discussion you will also learn about the use of deep brain stimulation and other approaches for the treatment of movement disorders such as e sential tremor parkinson's disease and various types of distonias which are challenges in generating particular types of movements whether not you or somebody that suffers from an eating disorder from obsessive compulsive disorder r from a movement disorder to day's episode is sure to teach you not only about what is happening in those arenas but also in the arenas of noro science generally in fact i would take today's episode is especially important for any one that wants to understand how the brain works and what the future of brain modification really looks for all of us before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electorolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar wsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nerans to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites an cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back tolectrolike ratio of one thousand miligrams that is one graham of sodium two hunder milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element e doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleement e doccom slash huberman and now for my discussion with doctor casey halpern casey i should say doctor halpurn this listening welcome thank you gretobe yaas ben long time coming we recolleagues at stamford and then recently you move course to universy pennsylvania also in incredible institution wer resorry to lose youso is betote for me to stamford's loss is you pens gain but let us talk about your work past and present zive told the listeners already your nuro surgeon which i consider the asstronants of ner science because you are in somewhat uncharted territory ere very uncharged territory and yet precision is everything i the the margins of error are very very small for those that are not familiar with the differences between ner surgery neurology sychiatry you just educate us a bit what does a noro surgeon do and what does the fact that your nurse surgeon do for your view ofe the brain how d you think about and conceptionalized the brin it is a scope of nero surgery is quite broad o whet i was in medical school i i was drawn to ner surgery because of a procedure known as depbraind stimulation when i was a pen as a college student i actually watched my first deeprain stimulation surgery performe by gordon boltuck who to to day does not one of my creer mentors deeprainstimulation is a one surgery that nervous surgeons offer but it is actually sort of a very small minority of what nervos surgery does a a we take out brain tumors we clip annurisms in the brain a we take care patients that have hatromatic brain injury a concussion aspine surgeries ninety persent of what nrvo surtions do around the country a yiure takeng care of herneated disks and lumbar fusions ththescope is the entire central nervous system include including the crifle nervous systemd we take care patients with carpal tunnelsongero and nerve disorders now of the course of the past two decatesors there is been a a mission in the field to to subspecialize and historically nervsurgeons did everything in that domain but now we subspecialize and i am lucky to be at pen medicine were we can focus on one of these areas a ima chief of startact in fontial nero surgery all i do is deep brain stimulations surgery and a compliment to that is focus hulturo sound or transcranial focus ulturo sound which is a non invasive way to do in oblation in the brain recently f d approved and it is efty a proove for tremor at the moment a these two procedures are for me my every day but a still the minority of what neros urgons have to offer the majority of nero surgery in my mind is is a bit more structural than it is physiology or deeply rooted in in how the brain functions a when we take out a braintumor we have to find a a safe trajectory to get to the brain tumor and then we remove it and we help the patient recover in the ice sou similar to a brain anurs often we do not have to go into the brain to clippor brain anurs and but we go around the brain or under the brain to get there and in my mind those surgers are bit more structural deepbrain stimulation a the surger that i do routinely is a procedure where yes there is structure involve of course we have to place a a very thin wire that is insulated deepene to aa part of the brain that is involved in parkinson's disease for example a but that is actually not the therapy the therapy is delivering electrical stimulation through the tip of that wire or one of the tips as directally are multipl contacts at the bottom of the wire very small a but that is all done out of the operating iur this stimulation wire is connected to a a battery pack or apulse generator that is kind of a pacemaker and we deliver this therapy i kow es telpations it is a bit more i have to implant a a a tool to to deliveryou a medication but that medication is conve in the form of electricity and it is can to be delivered into a very small region of the brain and it is that procedure that is it inspired me to not just become a nerossergion but a has really defined the a focus of my recerch laboratory as well may be by way of antic you could tell us a one of the more outrageous were surprising or who knows a delightful and thrilling things about the brain that you have observed as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas you knowin text books we always hear about a the cond of dark stuff stimulate one brain area somebody goes into a rage stimulate another brain area firson starts laughing andcontrollably first of all am given that some of the information tit is not much but some of the information text books is in correct is are those sorts of statements true can one observe those in the clinic and what are some of the more interesting a and i do not know cerly mean entertaining but a surprising things that you have seen when you have a poked around in the brain a deliberately of course and i what have you seen what you heard i have to say i i i am amazed by these effects a everydect i'm very privilege to be able to interract with the human brain in this way it is always in them itwith the goal of trying to provide somebody with the meaning fultherapy but when we deliver electrical stimulation the these electrotes while they might be sitting in a very small region of the brain there are are regions within a few millimeters of where these electrodes are that if stimulated could cause a temporary very brief side effact aa moment of laughter you said or a moment of panic and of course we can just shut that electrode off but often these side effects could e be theraputic and actually that is how we have discovered ways to use deep brain stimulation a not just for movement disorders parkinson dises but for example patients with parkinson disease that have a psyciatric a a comorbidity depression or obsessive compulsive disorder alot of these pations are highly compulsive and impulsive a sometimes these problems actually melt away and we are tryng to help their tremor but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue has gotten better or their mood has improved and why is that well you knw there is probably more than one reason you can help somebody is mood by making their tremor go away of course but we see laughter in the clenic sometimes and and why is that that is because we are stimulating parts of the brain that are not just involved in these motor circuits but they are also involved in what we call a limbic circuit or or part of the brain involved in emotion and if we learn how to modulate those areas therputically step by step we can actial develop these therapies for other indications depression i would say the most impressive and consistent effect we have when we have a patient with tremor who has been tremoring for the past twenty years if we can deliver stimulation thoh that electroe in the clinic we have immediate relief o tremor and that is the effect that inspired me to be a nerous surgeon when i was in college i've never wearly wanted to do anything else except help develop that type of their putic for an other another kind of symptom i'm very interested in obisity and related eaten disorders compulsive behavior that urge to atto have something that might be delicious but dangerous or unhealthy or aa drug aor compulsion we sey in osedy or tos of compulsive disorder a interestingly we see tremor melt away when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain we can see these psyciatric more sychiatric problems are not all syciatric disorders but let us say a a disorders of the brain we can see symptoms of those disorders also improve and often immediately just we do with tremor a i see it all the time to to to pick out one a would be would be a challenge because a for me this is my i every day the speed of the relief that you described for tremor is really m incredible just thinking about drug therapies and theyre two there are side effects but the're still lot of mysteries as toferences why asess arise even work when they work and the timing is always challence timing dosage yes absolutely am i'd love to learn more from you about o sed i i have several reasons for asking this a first of all om a somewhat obsessive person i tend to be very very narrowly focust although i confess its not a stap function it takes me some time to turn off the chatter but one time into a thought train or a mode of being an thinking and work it is very hard for me to exit that that mode it is a deep trench adaptive in some circumstances less adapt in others as the otheris that when i was a kid i had a lowbit of a grunting tick i i had a a this intense intense desire to clear my throat am to the point where my my dad said you need to stop that ease to squeeze my hand every time i do it and i used to hide in the back see o the carer in the closet to do it because it provided much relief and then it eventually passed if i was not medicated they never did anything about it every once in a while now if i'm very fatigued if i've been working a lot i notice it starts to come back i'll do this kond of grunting and it is been a sort of a a pet in or a lotch symptom for me that reminds me that these the circuits exist in all of us and that sometimes they go hay wire and sometimes they just have settle am over excitation or something that sort and then the third reason is that i get thousands of questions abo osid could you perhaps just tell us what is osid tram what are some rain areas involved what ar the current range of treatments and what is the difference between someone who is obsessive and somebody who has true osid a a brief disclosure as as a narrow surgeon i do take care of patients with severe obsessive compulsive disorder a but my perspective on osid may be a little bit different than a psychiatris to who lives in breathes osid and sees patients every single day with osid ai probly take care of a three to five patients a year with deeper in stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder i do not see these patients as rutinely but my laboratory is geared as a researcher a i'm very focus on trying to improve outcomes of deepraind stimulation for for osid soway i do feel i have a expratis and and a perspective to share but just o a brief disclosure a i i do feel that as a narrow surgeon i am obligated to better understand wer the obsessions in the brain come from and how we can interrup them to stop the compulsion that is associated with the obsession sort of the intrinsic most feature of osid a better than we are actually doing it a for example if we were to offer a patient with tremor deeperain stimulation surgery of course there is some risk to the procedure but the outcome is consistent and positive that many patients are willing to take on that risk a for obsessive compulsil compulsive disorder the surgery risk is about the same however the benefit is not quite as reobust and a lot of patients and their refering sychitris are reluctant to refer these patients to us and it is completely understandable a i've been a leading an endeavor with a number of claverities around the country to try to better understand the circuits in the brain a study them in humans both invasively and not invasively that would be with an electre based surgery a sort of we do wit that plepsy to understand were sedures come from we would not understand beter were obsessions come from but were also working with imaging experts and genetisis to understand osid a at a broader level as well a i i consider osid to be a a spectra disorder ind a way aand i i i apologize to those to who might feel that i'm using that terming correctly i'm using it in a way to describe patients that have obsessiens and even some related compulsions might not meet criteria for osit a it may be something androu that that you have and as a narrow surgeon i'm really obsessive about safet and compulsive about my surgical prosedures i i think that some aspect of osid which we often joke about but we should consider seriously cause people do suffer from this a some aspect of it helps us a there are famous a see eos that probably have some level of o sidy ah surgeons and scientists alike ah perhaps if it can be controlled it is an asset and abut if it goes ari and is uncontrollable then it becomes obsessive compulsive disorder and a i tend to see the patients that are the most severe they have failed medication and there are multiple medicpatientstha are worth trying for osidi some can actually be very helpful ah which nor transmitter systems do they tend to pocet well essess arise or sort of the the first atline for osidy but also trysyclics can be helpful this is still the seretone and system ah but as we know the seretone of system in eracts with the you kow't know ritenurgic a system and the do not mean system it is hard to a a be specific to one of these things a and i think thats also why it is hard for us to predict how these medicatients are going toto work for these kinds of patients but trysyclics and esse surise can be very helpful and are definitely first line aand there is others a exposure respondse prevention is a probably the most effactive option which is kind of cognat behavoral there pebut these are different and offered by psychologists and this is a whole field and there is a a a field i shuld say a whole clinic at my institutien a a focus do started by ednafoa a a a pen who this is what they do for these patients a it is offer these types of cognitive therapiese exposure to the stresser and to try to get patiens to habituate to whatever it is that stresses them and causes these a compulsions to help these patients live in every day an function the these are all fabuously helpful pay a therapies for variety of patients but there is still about thirty percent of patients that still suffer from osidi and some of them have severocity sometimes its modera to severe and those of the patients that i'm really motif it try to help a our therapies for those patients right now i would say are are worth pursuing but not optable a and it is it is one of those thingsthat we have to balance as a researcher because when you see patients this you want t everything cannot help them and i think it is importan to educate patients on the risk and benefits of them this is deep brainstimulation surgery but also capsalodomy which is more than ablation approach a little bit deeprin stimulation but rather than delivering stimulation though an electurea you can actually heap the tissue and even destroy it some would say this part of the brain is very safe to destroy its kind of an appendixs a others would say it safer to modulate i have seen a patients do very well with these oblatients and you ask me earlier what what i find amazing about the brain these affects that we can have sometimes the lack of effect is what ama sing you can actually a traverse parts of the brain without having any advers affects on patients a function at least that you can test a but you can also destroy small parts of the brain or talking three or four milameters in size these little oblatients can be really helpful for patients but have no obvious sideeffects that we can tell perhaps after a short recovery from surgery a but none the less destpy how safe they might be a these serdic receed are still our curgical procedures and patients are hesi preceed especially when they know that their chance of a transformative effect is quite low we we can generally a achieve a responder rate of about fifty per cent a and responders still have symptimatic osid i'm really a acervan spired to a really find a way to deliver these therapies in a more disease specific or symptom specific way but a were years away propably from from that ther besince it is all part of a recert study at the moment what brain areas should i think about when i think about osid years ago i remember opening attex book thngwas an undergraduate still and work from judith wrap aport at the national institutes of mental health this would be lay eighties oreally nineties was a had done some nur imaging or maybe was pet of ar some other imaging technique and had identified portions of the bazil gangleafter am cotdy pitanum ty structures in osd and a maybe some differences in boys verses girals what brain areas are their sex differences and terms of osidi and were one to come into your clinec this for this sort of a work of oblations or stimulation a where would you fir start to probe in the brain it this is a a a disorder of both quartec and the subsub quartex a the cortical control areas areas that are involved in inhipitori control we have found to not function properly impatience with osid areas the odr front al quartex and the prefrontal quartex if you image these areas or study them even in a a a roded model of osid which quite onestly these models they model aspects of osit but osit is a human condition you cannot really model this whole condition in a in a moute or rat but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat short an notg ou ther her o exactly that is that is not necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder but that is compulsive behaviour and perhaps if you can amiliorate that in a rat that might be helpful for patient with osid but we have to approach animal modelling of oit thoughtfully a and i an i and most scientist do i think amwhet we study osit and in models or in inhumans with imaging and and we are trying to do it invasively with with electros we do an eplopsy patients we we find that areas in the quartecs the prefrontol and oer r fronta qarteks are are not functioning they the way they would in a non ost patient theyare often hyper functioning a such that while you might say whele their hyperofunctionings o are not these patients functiong better that the hyperfocus the hyperofocust exactly a no i i would say it is is not much an upper or down it is more that they are just disfunctional and we need to find a way to try to restore normal function to these areas 's not much directional really a we we tend to over simplify brain function by thinking about it with directionality too much a unfortunately imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation or hypo activation and that is where i think these kinds of things can be misconstrued but what i would call the quartical aries of osids that they are disregulated a and we need to find a way to trennormalize their function a the fronchallobis is huge but airies of the frontial lobe thetr bit more basil the o f seo obeafrom a quartex in th prefontal quartex definitely consistently seem to be a implicated impatients with a o s d and then their projections to the subquartexas is the basil ganglyali you were saying caught a putamen are the dorsal strade im and these are inner connected with the ventral strade am this is an ary the brain that i a focas a lot of my energy and a this is the ventral stratum which is not limited to but includes the newcles eccumbants a this is an area of the brain that a we know to be involved in gating reward seeking behavior when it is perturbed it seems to gait compulsive behaviour meaning a rat will pursue a reward to spite punishment despite a footshock for example and that can be a similar to i nosydy patient they will a check their home for safety until three i m in the morning and not sleep that night in a way that is similar to a rat seeking out a foodrward a despite a footshock a doing something because of te urge but despite the risk and perhaps there is some normal judgment there a we all have to take risks to function in everyday society a to be successful we have to take e risk a to take care patients with surgery there is some risk there we make a judgment call and a that is not a condition that that is just normal a but when our judgment is consistently a sort of puts us tat risk that is where we have something o sd but osids also it is one of many conditions that suffer from these kinds of proms we tend to label them a because they tend to present in a consistent way s we have patients with o sc d that have hyprochecking behavior or a contemination behavior where they if they feel contemined theyill wash their hands for hours repeatedly or if they drop their tooth prush on the floor this will lead to a compulsive behavior of cleaning a tooth brash rush in your teeth consistently very very common symptoms that we see a or signs at the patients report to us or or that we observe but you do not patients with eating disorders they tend to if if they have been gine disorder thou over eat if they have believe mea they might purge despite the risk of these things and a addiction is is similar we we ten to drug seek if were addicted a i will we pal fo a dealer a in order to get our fix and despite the risk and and that type of urged despite the risk is something that i i've always been really interested and in it is a common denominator to all of these problems and if you think about these problm these are some of the most common conditions in our society to day i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional needs i've been taking athltic greens since two thousand and twelve im delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereasn i storry taking thletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health iur got is very important ics populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turm health and those probatics in athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition ithleti grens contains a number of adaptigens vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastesgripe if you' to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic gren stock calm slash hubermen and they will ive you five free travel packs that make it realy easy to mix up athltic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera nd they will give you a year supply of vitemin d thre k too again that is thathletic greenstock calm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitem ind three k to i really appreciate that youre building this bridge for mo d to nucly s a commons which is of course associat with reward in various forms and will get to that am i'll char a personal anecdote as a as a form of question i was in college a and studying a lot i relied on cafen as a stimulant i've never really been into drugsa ov in lucky in that sense i do not drink and i to care lass ati all this appeared never li recreation drug s never drawn to them however when i was in college m at the time there was es epineferan pills that wore i'm common in a lot of sport supplements i thes rely preework out tipe things yes not unlike energy drinks now which i completely awoid im and i had this experience of taking one of these and drinking some coffee and of course it gave me a lift in energy these are very similar tem padomy never legal over the counter at the time there now either band e reli i do not recommend them and i had a lot of energy but what i noticed is that my grunting to came back and i had i made one mistake i still think of this as one mistake which was im i engage in a superstitious behavior i knocked on wood and thend itsomehow it felt very warding it gave me some tolly irrational but internally rational sense of of security around i freget what i was knocking on wood about and i found that i could not break that knock on wood compulsion i felt i needed to knock on wood and then i started sneaking knock on woods in midexam and studying and pretty soon i was knocking on wood often i developed a superstition and i'm curious about the role of superstition and compulsion in the cross over there make sense logically to me but i was equally shocked to learn that when i stop taking this stimulant which i was quite happy to to stop because hit did make me feel too alert could not sleep well et cetera that the superstition went away as well and i'm guessing this has something to do with some of the reward circuitry as it is called related to stimulants ium again i am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants although healthy use of cafne or safe use of cafine might be the one universally accepted stimulan im it was really surprising to me how quickly this came on how quickly it engaged my my thinking and my behaviour the obsessions and compulsions and how quickly itturned off when i stop taking this sport stimulant or whatever it was i n you remember i think it was some form of apan affor in a federan sh some s not apan efferance cuse me i'ma spoke a federan im is what i described om totally outside the bounds of a a logic ors wer my imagining it all no it happened i'm certain it happened i do not think you are imagining at all i your this the grunting that you you mentiond to me your firstify i did not the comment but that that sort of nots putalabel lot o but it sounds a tick and tixon in young males extremely common and they do tend to go away lincon likes is have a good friend who yi shu famous norl scientists i will not mention who it is whos workd very hard to suppress his is blinking tis and when he gets fatigued it comes back and and am he is very high function yes in his personal life in his professional life but i but when you are talking to im an he starts doing this the ca start wonderingly it is gone on yn it is unfortont people with these problems especially as they get more severe than you get toretcendrome it is hard to function in our society i have some friends that have teret i'll tell you i i'm just inspired because theyre im they are confident and you no people obviously notice these problems but they they just lived their life in tha very successful and that is not typical im i have i have friends that i went to pen with undergrad that had these kinds of problems thand i was always just happy and inspired by them but what is more typical as these probis caused people to lose their confidence and and not be no i pursue their profession as they may have done or im thinks of that nature i i think it is all related to the fact that we our brains are very vulnerable and to get back to your question about the stimulant i think i think your brain was very vulnerable to it you you certaine mayave had a predisposition to it a you mention that you have eur a little obsessive and with the tick there may be have this kind of on the on the mild side of the spectromo c d a and i i probably do as well by the way i also also have avoided a drugs for that reason in my life i'll drink a little bit of wine here an there but that is about it a and abut i i think most beal dulnibl it these things and we see these problems in relation to not just taking a stimulant but any kind of environmental exposure our own society causees much stress a and that is why i think we have these human conditions these are human conditions we try to model them in in animals but most animals do not have these kinds of problems yi've heard that you can animolike a monkey in the wild can have depression monkeyse version of depression but i do not think it is really typical or human depression and certainly it is not as prevalemt as depression is in our human society i think we have not evolved to manage the stresses that are in this society that we currently have and stimulants is probably one of them and i i i suspect you ware probably little evulnerable a it is possible the stimulant ta let to an overdrive of your prefuntal and oprofontal quartex and even brought out a little o sed behaviour related to this supero thi of superstition that you had a i believe that aentirely and i also think yow that is why thinks o c d and other kinds of psychiatric disorders tad to present themselves in college whend people leave their home and they are in school and their stressed and they are getting exposed to things that they have not been exposed to before outside of the home and youknow their brains are not evolved and a sophisticated enough yet to help them cope wit these kinds of stresses and how it manifest is in these kinds of conditions and iti do not ave put a label on those conditions but certainly could be a psychiatric disorter but ould also gest be lots of anxiety i could also be a the kind promps it thatyou had as well m and i think the newcly accumbents and the cortical airs tht we havebeen discussing that that sort of send projections to these areas are are probably at least one of the main circuits in bolve in these kinds of things relieved it is no longer present but i confess it i always feel it close by a a long run helps m yo not being as slightly fatigued not overly fatigue but slightly fatigues soin o mo out that te coun o physical compulsion but try to channel it am never taken any medication for and here i am i am still still going i may call you for a reforal itsome point butter this when i'm a im feeling o k am let us talk about newcleas sicummens and rewards circuitry and the relationship between o c d reward addiction and to jus kive your sense of were headed with this is into the realm of a food related and eating related a be behaviors in disorders yes i know you are doing it i'm sovery important work there what is neucleos icumbens i know we all have one were to a one on eacside the brain what is it at what rules does it play am in healthy bring behavior and in pathology the neucles ecumbens is a part of the brain part of our reward circuits the hub of the reward circuits that i've always been most fascinated and a there are scientists around the world some of the leading argue wes from the leading scientists in the world the father f a diction or ascience i call him a although he tells me i'm nots a ramalanka who has studied the nucas eccumbens since the beginning of his career who i worked with when i was at standford a fabulous scientist ament or taught me much a taught the world much incredible yeersand scientist and hand physician yes m m emd pt and a brilliant in both ways and a very fatherly in a lot a way in terms of teaching people how to how to do science and and be good citizens as well a but a ythe neucles ecumbens is an area that is also very complicated because it has a lot of functions a it interconnects with many parts of the brain a but there are some things about the nuces accombents that are very consistent a when i startd getting interested in reward and what a what i could do as a surgeon to tried to improve how we manage rewards and what i mean by that specifically is wif you have an urge for a reward that that is a normal phenomena a that is not something we are trying to stop the issue is if you have an urge for reward that either puts you or somebody else at risk it is probably a reward we should not have i suppose you coan say well depends on the size of the reward in the size of the risk and how that fits into your societal norms a but for example if you are a obs and a you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight and try to control your eating habits perhaps a better few choices is an important way for you to be healthier and and not pursuing those better food choices that is an urge that we probably need to treat if you are a drugatic and you aabuse heroine or opiit consider the opiat crisis right now or coqene a a which is ununtreatable at the moment a that that coqane might make you feel lut you haves some more energy that day to to deal with your work or that opiit might make you feel better caus life is tressful but the risk of doing those things is really high in fact petentially weaful a ut that is an urge that is treatable a you have osity and you cannot sleep at night because you are nervous that yofd inlock the door and you check thirty times a that is the reality for some people with severe osity a that is an urge we got a treat eating disorders the same eating eating disorders and obisity are obviously lik because of the relationship of a patient with food but there also quite to stinc not everybody with obisity has not eating disorder and obvisly not everybody with an in disorder has obisity a i'm particularly interested impatience that have been geating disorder as well as obisity because they are heavily liked not everybody with binging disorder has obisity but a on average most are overweight a we are doing a deep rinstulation trial at pen where we are trying to modulate the newply succumbens an understand it better inpatience that have failed gestric bypast sergery the most a gressive form a treatment for obisity and we and we believe they failed gestric pipa surger because of bigiting disorder meaning they ust cannot control how much they eat their obisity is either related or even do to overeating not some predisposition to a that body habitus obisity is a finatyce something that we can see not everybody is obist because of the same thing it is very important i was taught this by a close menturn friend tom wadden when he was the director of the aobisity centur at pen or the senterfor weight neating disorders and and he seid me you kno case a your be careful with obisity you are your interested ind addiction and i interstand your interested in the indictive tendencies of certain patience with obsit a a and and and their relationship with foo but not everybody with obisity has that problem and and in fact it is it is probably present tn about twenty percent of patiente with obisity but not taking a step back twenty per cent of patiene with obisity is still a massive problem a epidemic proportions and perhaps some of these patients have either some form of beengiing disorder or or should say some degree of iging disorder aor at least loss of control eating which is common to both a that is a feature that i think eating disorder experts obisity experts neir surgeons aobisity met aobisity medicin experts would agree is common to eating disorders and obisity and i also believe wit is common to attics a and perhaps patience with ositis serve a loss of control disorder a it is actually not a disorder known by the deisan five some digdostic manual but aa feature i sioulds say of these conditients that is common and that common denominator i believe can be restored or at least this problem can be amiliorated or improved upon by a better understanding and a tailor treatment to the neplis a common specifically a weh've learned in mice a that if you expose a mouse not as just a model if you expose a mouse to o high fat food not food that they would normally eat food that a is sixty per set fat high fats butter a we have learned that if you expose them to food that within two weeks there newly succombencs is not functioning a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food there is aspects of it that aare hiyper active i could say and there is aspects of it that our high poactive or decreased activity but either way it is it is not functioing properly and most likely that function is predisposing continued behavior and then probably eventually leads to things a habit that gets developed and that is the whole nother area of these kinds of problems that is very complicated and poorly understood but in any case if we just focus on the behavior a at hand it seems that repeated exposure to something high fat food a drug of abuse or any type of reward that is a really strong reward it in a way it can high jack normal functioning o the nucless accmbense the goal of our a in vase of trial is to try to restore normal functioning to that nucles accumbense a in mice there seems to be a signal that predicts when they are going to lose control and we can use that signal to delivery sort of a a real time there be in the form of deprain stimulation just a brief amount of stimulation and that actually blocks the behavior and what is interesting is overtime that signal actually decreases in frequency which suggests some level of restoring normal function to that circuit in a mouse we are trying to do that now in a human trial fascinating where is the stimulation provided because i would imagine that if one were to stimulate newcly succumments you would see a reinforcement of whatever behavior coincide or preceeded in the stimulationso the stimulation it is a aa brief delivery of stimulation anywhere between five and ten seconds that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling that is happening in thenucless accumbense there are disorders depression let us say that i i would discribe is a bit more of a state disorder and this is obviously oversimplified because we know that there is fluctuations in mood an depression is well do not let me oversimplify it too much am but a but fernawlets forgive the over sumplification if we if we accept that depression is a state disorder or may be parkans o disease is a state disorderrecognizing that the do flunctuate a these types of problems most likely not but not definitely most likely need a continuous therapy of sume for a their be that is consistent a perhaps if there be that fluctuates with the condition but nevertheless still consistent a been jiging disorder or o c d or addiction a and and beenging disorder in the conticts of obisity a lot of these patients are functiong quite normally every single day it is just that intermittently throughout the day there is brief interruptions in their normal functions such that they have thoughts about food or the drug of abuse ai ther really longing to have and we want a deliver a episodic theyre be delivered at the right time and only at the right time to try to interrupt the circuit aberration or the the problem at hand that is going to lead to that dangerous behavior and to kinn't get the patient back on track to what they 're doing a i do not necessarily think that it leads to a reinforcement a it is possible a we have to study that more but rather the goal is to just disrupt perhaps what is kind of habitual a or or at least this kind of recurring problem that is happening people that have been ging disorder at least it is severe level they tend a bitch about once a day but they do not beence all day long of course they have a moment perhaps when they get home from work and their strese where they might have a boud o bench what constitutes a benge and a also want to know dis benginging disorder come on suddenly meaning as an entire disorder one day people wake out something they benging disorderers is yonow a few too many buffets and i'm being entirely serious here it can ununlimited food and a circuit gets flipped or account of sarts moving into the hir p ms to speak am how dos it come on and a actually surprise to hear that it is once a day i would think just hear in benging this order i assom it is sety which probably fluctuates across the day as well but a mon't have thought any time people round food they u simply cannot control ther and take a food yeso wares this look in terms of the on set of the disorder and thend what you think in elie this once a day type of fumthat is pretty interesting severe biging disorder a these patients will bench about once a day could be couple times a day but in general's not more than that moderate is about three or four times a week for example the reason i think that that seems surprising to you and if you think about it it is surprising but bu but a notni agree with you but the reason for that is is actually just in the definitions of the word and as a narrow surgeon in full disclosures i as i mention you knw i do not see these patients clinically i see them for research trial purposes and i try to understand the literature around eating disorders and i obviously colaborate with fabulity ing disorders a a in these problems ir theyr highly innevateve people a but the word benge is a definition there there is a definition to that word and you cannot necessaisly beenge all day because our stomachs are not big enough a and a there is a limit to how much one can eat and to meet creter for binch you have to have a sense of loss of control you have to eat enormous amount of food in a brief period of time and yes generally that does not happen more than about once a day in a patient with severe benginine disorder a however they cannot lose control quite often and in fact perhaps even at every meal they might meet criteria for about o loss of control woere they yes they may have lost control but they might not have eaten enough to constitute what we would defind as a bence a and that would be in it a that there is no specific number to that by the way it is it is really just compared to their normal meal perhaps it is a fifty percent of their daily callories in that one brief moment a a that is that is why i think it seems surprising that bengers are not happening more often than that a what i would say is if we replaced the term binge with loss of control eating loss of control eat could happen doesen of times a week a and in fact near the patients that were studying we have we have seem patients that i lose control twenty thirty times a week a and that is probably the the term you hapen mind when your say you are surprise that is just one time a day and it is specificaly really to the fact that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food in such a brief period of time a 's hard to do that more than once in i see you mention that som preexisting anxiety might buy a somebody to have a benge i'm also fastininted by something i've observed before as when i was in college my my girl friend had a room ate who we were were was beliemic aand would benge and then perge and often a when she injested alcohol that would lead to a bnge sore which is kind of the opposite of anxiety when i think about alcohola something that slightly reduces prefrontal activity somewhat of a sedidive or certainly said of hiredosages this brings to something that yue sait i'm just goin a i will not say it as eloquently as you did that it seems it is not neither the case that anxiety leads to benging nor that hybo reduce activation of the for brain an lower anxiety leads to benjingus is it is this disregulation of circuitry that that the seasac could go either way and it and it can throw things off it is off balance in both cases yes ah it is a and that seems to be a that seems to pose a problem it seems tik git is a particularly tricky problem and kind of explains to me in my non clinical wareness why medication might be really hard to use as a way to treat this but that beingable to poke around in the brain and assay in real time in how do you feeld you fel binjing now or do you feel am further from the benjimpulse is that what you do with these patients ore they awake while you are stimulaing the brain cause it is one thing to say i stimulate a brainary and the binjing goes away or it i partial relief or complete relief but how do are they in there with a donnut and you are tempting them how do you hac shly know if it is a blading a brain areas going to lead to af releef or exascurbation or no impack on it on this disorder yes a itle there is a lot unpack there aum i'll try to go once to ut a time and if i if i mis something please r now and i tend to ask these three part questions if i the ar surgeons because i to challenge you gancause again o are the aske your nots of ner sines also i'm just can take a moment to poke it ner ser thatclo your rends a where ner surgeons and i canseir case and out o me consiers me a friend but i cr to him of rend am teasing there to which is first of all they all have incredible hands right they have i'm not such they all guard their hands with the kind of a protection that you would guard that the tools of the most important tools are your trade they are very careful with their hands you are not in the same them doing heavy deadlefs at you are not because of the way that inpact it in the moter onsthey it is all about fine control yes am fieurs nor surgeon does heavy deadleffs you might want a consider getting into frent nerve sir ut bit din't put any one at a work there and then the other the other thing is that you all are tend to be very calm people a least on the exterior we will return to this later ambut i do throw three or four questions out at once elevated autonomic arousal on a lertness yas well as decrease autonomic rousal a lertness moth seem to be able lead to binging and then there is this question of how do whether not to stimulate were to a blate or whether not to leave a structure alone in other ords what is one of these experiments look in the laboratory ye sira linic excuse me yeof course yei it these are questions i think abut all the time u and i do n't to come back to the dead lifting common u regarding and you and you refer to this earlier is well do not know fi addressed it sufficiently either is is sort of what what comes first here or how does this develop i i think first of all i i i i to understand these kinds of problems in in sort of the the construct of but i i consider to be a bit of too hit hypothesis a sa sert of need to the concussion literature you need the second hidis can be devastating if you have a concussion you on a only return to play when you are syntems are gone a'm cleared by a physicion a the contects of eating disorders or lets say bingine disorder an first of all i i did not mentionarly but this is the most common eatine disorder affects anywhere between three nd five per cent of the population a and i's probably under dike nost in obesity by the way if wi besty effects thirty five per cent of our population most likely been gene disorder effects more than three o five per cent but that is that is the current a literature a estimate on on the prevolence a how do we develop in genie disorder in is related to this anxiety question yo dow i think that there is a predisposition that is the first hit aum i should think all humans have this predisposition just some havenit more than others i do not think that we have evolved to live in a society where foods are readily available and enormously delicious and have much sugar and fat in them not that there is any tick you are problem with either of these mat bu my cronutriencs it is just the excess of it a and how they are refined ah that i think it is the problem thes hyh frutas coincervan almost everything we eat weit is in bread i aven' y been a wise and bread sometimes itis just cont crazy i do not i do not think we are revolved to live in a society that that has food that is readily available that and cheap by the way infact the cheaper the foods are thesort of the the more refined and palatable and i would argue dangerous teet i think they change our reward circuits for the worst am and put us at risk for wanting more i tend to get a headachewhen i eat food that and and perhaps that is a evolutionary advantage because i do not want to eat those whose cause it they actually do make me sick in a lot aways iy i cann't wish that hadic on everybody because perhaps we ouldn't have all these problems a early some of them would go away i think that is for the first tissue is a a predisposition to a or vulnerability to these types of foods which we undoubtedly all have to a certain extent but some more than others and then and then and that is that is the first hit is this predisposition in the contect of this sort of food focus society and then the second hit is probably's a stressful event or astressful life aum and it probably recurring stressful event i'm not sure this is published i've never sat down with tike a eating to sort of expert and and had this question of a howlass develops and i'm mot sure it is actually well well known but in a lottways i think that that answer anybody would agree with that we need sort of a predisposition and the exposure the environmental exposure in the genetic predisposition aum but also a stresser and that stresser is probably one that is recurring and it is obvious in our societyse stressers are everywhere and how we can manage them is is often poor and you kn i think we can all relate with that and then there is something else in the background that i think it is really important to mention is that patience with these kinds of problems ar embarrassed becauses our society does not think fondly of these kinds of patience benging disort of patience they they do tend to be over weight that is obviously a stigma obis obisity is another stigma then there is the opposite in a way it is an opposite by the way for from a fina type stanppoint that is anerecia i meand that is another stigma and you knogush not to make this about one sex over r another but whend when girls are told their pretty because theyre thin it just reinforces this problem and of course you want a compliment people and make them feel good about themselves but the problm is that in this vulnerable society that that can lead to problems because people start thinking o i should be thin or thinner am i i think that it is a little bit of a socital understanding that our brains are veryblnerable and i think that will really help changing society is hard and most of society's not portina ill meaning a it is all done by accident am but that that is the society that we live in if we can try to improve that stigma a and and be kinder to people in that way i think a lot of these promps would get better people that are obist that feel embarrassed by their obecity it does not help it only makes it worse coausd they give up same thing might be true for ateraxics am i really think it is important to consider all of these things and and that is why it is complicated and it it would be hard to do a well controlled study to understand it better because there many of these variables to control for that you realy cannot control for might built a control for them in in a mouse's home cage but not not in the society that we live in that that is kind of my brief sort of summer how i would answer your your first question than i i think your second question i i sort of take that is how do you study such a complicated problem in the operating room and and in the clenic because ahi mention the operating because that sort of the first step here a first we wone who we have a just to clarify we have a a and i funded a trial approve by the f t a for for research to do this first an human study am we have treated two patients we have four more to come at pen in am and in this study a it isomething i've been working towards my entire career a what we do not know is where in the newcly ciccumbence will we identifi selves or regions that seem to be a involved in this sor of reward seeking behavior i would call it a petitive it is cunta appetite but the word a petitive is i think a good word to yous wat what part of the newclys comments is a petitive is the whole thing a petter probably not it is huge in my world it is yue as a ho surgeon i i target parts of the brave that are three or four milimaters in size the newcless acompents is almost a senimeter in size well civilazi wis that large ye the reminds me of discussions around the mag galeveryone things a mage gole fear id miglas got a lot ifferent subregions and stimulation of certainars in the mag gala makes people feel great that is and other stimulation of other airs akes them feel terribly afraid exactly and and that should not surprise us because w hen we treat patients with parkinsons disease for tremor if we are in one part of the subthilemic nucleas will help their tremor if we are in another part of the subthilmic nucleus the naralljust is looking at me why is not this working and that should not surprise us we already know that you two or three milameters deviation or two or three milliameters away fom where we want to be and you might not have the result you want and that is probably also true for these more limbic structures the evicdula in nuclis occumbans a you now regarded the necly succumbens we traverse some of the neucles combens not all of it in order to place the electrode that we want to use to detect when cravings are happening for example and to tread a block the cravings from leading to the behavior related to the the reward seeking which is the overeating in this case a what we decided to do in te operating room was to actually try oa leverage a tool that we use all the time what we take care patients with parkinsons with parkinsons these blodly's patients not all have tremor and when we place an electured into this motor structure to try to improve their movement disorder a we often can hear tremor selves and they sound we convert their electrical signal to an audible signals we can shoul hear it a and in it sounds kind of the tremor looks the frequence of the signal is the same as the hand shaking awesanon and that the patient with parkinses is is trem trembling yet they are awake and you are poken around in a in a dedicated careful way of course one poke at a time one poke at a time with a very fine wirer send of wires listening to the electrical activity until you you encounters themselves that are sending out electrical activity ad a similar frequency exactly and then you can stimulate them ore quiet them and see if the tremor goes away we we are very confident that when we stimulate that area of in this case the subthilemic necleous a we we will make that tremor we will disrupt that tremor circuit and that tremor will dissolve and it does that is why parkinsons is beautiful and inspiring in a msur tractable yeh exactly what is the make us feel we understand the brain y at least in that limited way what is the a inalogue to tremor in terms of appetite and desire to be in traving craving is a term that there is al the other terms we could use by the way but that that is the term weve chosen to use for a number of reasons one because people relate with that term people that have been geating disorder or obsity they if you aske them if they crave the anser will often be yes if you aske them if they lose control or benge they might not know what you mean or they might not actually feel out of control even when they are a a but the word craving is relatable and we set out to see if we could identify craving s ells ah in a patient with o c d which is related in fact we trygget a very similar part of the brain ah we trid to identify sells related to obsessions and we believe we did do that itas a single case study a where we tryd to optimize where our electro would was place we had some proof of concept that we would be able to elicit a sir of disease specific symptom in the operating room assuming the patient could tolerate being awake not everybody needs to be awake for this proceedure but at lease for these first and human trials where a were trying to were trying to establish where in the brain we need to be hi think this type of approach is really critical and youdon by the way none of this has been published a but i think it is important for people to know this i i am willing to share some aspects of what we are trying to do a but a but that is that is really the first goal of this trial is too identify where the neucly succombens we can detect these craving cells we have to provoke food craving in the operatig rom that is the first thing how do you do that ah well a there are some a somewhat validated ways to do that ah for example we asked patients to provide pictures of food that they rate very highly as something at they would typically crave and you' are depending on the patient it might be something that is very salty it could be very sweet a donut a answered i love donots ers or great you shuld you should try the cronut when you'r her near exid finot that sort of thing reasons they wano want you lan the were wer on won by i a to try to stop yourself after that was fi were one of these patients given the fact that ah the binges come on pretty seldom once a day do you imagine you have them come to the the operating room fasted we are semme fasted their faste y o gaitheir fasted which prole their poly surgicold yes reasons for wanting that ers e com have to be i and then you tif youve done the craniotomy removed a patch of skull yes lower the wire s a neukally secumbens and then they are viewing pictures of food that they crave and thinking about it do they have am a factorycuse smells of crownuts ye i on elove to do the efactorycause we have not implemented that but that is tay a great a thank you ri'l give you for credit when we do ett gra at ioi'm glad as work is funded because i now this is when i i'll make this time it is not a joke when i referre to you all a you nur nourow surgeons a as the astronots of the brain ouat this is our on the extreme adge of what we do not know if about how the rain functions and this is far an away different in giving a mouse access to ive hi that foo not at that i'm not being dispurging of the mouse work but the person says well i'm the patient this case i might say i'm hungry i do not at sounds really good right now but craving to me is i i i'll cross the street cross town be late for my meeting e three of these yes maybe even hide that from somebody that cares about me does not want me doing this this kind of thing hide it fror myself yes this these kind of behaviors i'mprojecting unfortunate that i i have cravings for things in life but a do not ot s not among the more extreme of them a this is all happening in real time and you are listening to the cells the same way you would listen to in search for trem orcells exactly same exact tools and you doing that by am recording from a a small population orcells in the area yet in fact we do get multy unit activity whch is multiple cells a but we really try to find one a single unit to listen to wunder yet because it is just a much easier to understand what that one neron is doing verses try to list tomultiple and a we also a measure look of hipotential recordings but those are analyzed which is more f a population response thousands of cells n a horrice sells exactly am that we measure off line m the device that we use to sort of treat these patients are intervene a that were studying a iit cannot do singly in it recordings it is only doing these more population responses we correlate what we see in the operating m a the single unit level to the population response but we do that all off line am i can explain that in a moment a but yes we we try to identify these craving cells and a because this is a a feasibility study and we cannot you be in the operating searching for hours and hours and hours we do have some sort of we have guide lines that we have set for ourselves that we have a developed with the enniage or the ft a to make sure that what we are doing is feasible and safe as well we we will spend a limited time trying to identify these a craving cells but another a sort of a sstrategy that we think it is really importantis a the effect of the stimulation a lot of patients and this gets to sert of your question earlier about cut o what comes first a lot of people when they when they benge or they lose control over food am or seek drugs that moment of vulnerability is preceded i what we call it a moment of sort of pre meal negative affect which baselly means right before they benge he're feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious and they compensate for that momentary symptom i benging or losing control o for food not everybody we's crateer for a benge i i tread a a specify that we are not we are looking at loss of control eating specifically just because the creterian of a benge is not as critical for us am what we want be able to do is trigger stimulation when this craving is detected by the device ah but we trigger ite only when the craving is there and we believe that if we can sort of temporarily elevate their mood ever briefly again this is about five o ten seconds of stimulation only that perhaps that elevation and mood could actually sort of dus rupt the craving to benge cycle maybe that is a habit may be its not but if you crave and then you benge if we can interrupt that with this moment of feeling good that might be a really good therebe for a patient and in fact when we do deep rain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder we can fairly reliably induce a positive affect the problem is that it is not sustained and the reason is likely not sustain jus because with obsessive compulsive disorder we treat that condition with continuous stimulation and it is not surprising that overtime the effect cin it goes away when they are in the clenican we turn the device on our patients feel great and we feel likely' solve the problem but that call us the next day and their my my depression came back or myos d has not gotten better and my moods back to where it was can you can you get back to it was yesterday that felt great the brain loves formiostatic regula it does and it does not to shift atter regression to the north right a and i think there is sort of a tolerance effect there a that a is is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation and actually in a mouse if you do continuous stimulation am the the sort of blockade of been jeeting goes away actualy in a mouse weve actually demonstrated a we publish this not too long ago a impianaes that if you deliver stimulation intermittently and only when sort of a craving signal is detected to speak a that that at that effect will be the most robust and durable a but if you deliver it continuously actually the benefit goes away over time i've always encouraged my colleagues to consider more than episotic stimulation approach rather than continuous deprin stimulation but of course that that is for these more episotic conditions whereas these more quotoqot state disorders aas i oversimplified earlier they might need more of a continuous therapies that is definitely subject for a lot of research in the future a in any case am the goal in the operating room was to identify a craving cell a deliver stimulation safely but also to capture a moment of elevated mood we rable a a to do that as we at we are in our osedy patients as well and also to get an interroperative caskan we have a devices now in the operating room that allow us to get imaging in real time that theyre fabulous tools that we did not have ten years ago a we can confirm accuracy a wherthe eyou can see where the electur it is exact precisely exactly a with zero point five millimeters of air superprecise a they were as precise as we think we need to be a and we use conictomics there is a tool in a brain imaging called a tratography a where we can actually measure circuit connections it is it is a indirect assay but we believe it is powerful it has its a e sumptions but a anything in science but a we can actually a map out where the neuclys accumbence conneced to a the prefontal quortex sort of the cotocal control an hypitory control pathway and were that pathway intersects with the neuclis accumbence and we can target that area a structurely a those three goals of the surgery we we aim to set out to accomplish a and we believed if we achieve two of those three a that we would have a successful result in our in our early trial mazon given that at least to me the nonclination tha interaxia is the merror image of been gesing disorder and at least from what i learned one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions a but also quite common yes a is it possible that nucles accumbencs this called reward circuit is also involved in interaxia but somehow it is the resistance to eating the craving of the fasted state or something that that is being reinforced and and assis for two reasons one because i'm genuinely curious about interaxia i've observed interactin a number of people i know an its a the striking thing to see somebody just resist food despite all better knowledge of the fact that they are getting quite ill maybeen at risk of death but the other reason is that if in fact nucleas accumbens it is the sit which can harbour sells to promote craving and craving of a fasted states soi speak then that i think might tell us something fundamental about how the rain works which is that structures do not control functions per sa structures control dynamics s af interactions sooe a a workcaster conductor has a certain number of operations that they perform but really their main function is to cordinate the actions of a lot of things not to make sure that the violins always play in jest e certain way alongside the obos he can tell him non a musicion here ais yave n apreciesion for the ayes the teusually get left out what is tat the elbois the ei they usually gettignored my prtir plays the elboai the iy gets a great analogy by the way a you knowt i i i make the statement 's a little controversial but i actually think people would understand where it is where were i'm coming from a across all of these sort of somespecialties of medicine a but i i actually think especially with obisity remember its of pinatype that is reflective often but not always of a behavior a but if you consider patients that have obicity and they they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards foods the they overeat despite the risk of it i think those kinds of patients are more similar to anerecix han te are different a anerexia and obiscity are both pinatypes that are at least in the specificate of obicity and in anereia aa result of a compulsion to either over or under eat despite the risk a these types of compulsions are driven by decital pressures a a brainvoll nerabilities that are probably more similar a than than they are different they they just happene to manifest differently a why they manifest differently is probably related to each patient's predisposition or perhaps preference a that is hard to know you i i have a personal connection to thisiting disorders anereci included in a i i think it is a it is very scare a and it is a condition that a often in still fear in psychietrists a because i think not not everybody by the way sphenomenal a psychitris that i work with both at standford and a pen a the are also involved in my obisity study that take care of these patients i men these are heroes but there is lot of sychitias are not in this domain that find anereciascare for the recent you said at has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions that includes to pression a because not only can these patients di suicide but they die of metabolic complicationts of being under weight a it is say a it is it is a scaric condition i i relate with that i am trying over time to bridge what i'm doing in obisity and binging disorder too anreciafer for two reasons one because i think these probs are more similar than they are different and too because of the nead a and i think were well positioned a to a sort of tackle anerexia a a using similar approaches not identical but but similar approaches a the nucles ecumbents has been studied in patients with anerexiain china actually mi posttock my first postock who i had the honor to train a when i was at stanford is a nur surgeon in china when a before he came to me acte was invulved in in a trial of anerecia that had some benefits a and a atheir studies in a europe a a and elsewhere that i have examined preliminarily a the effects of deepran stimulation targeting the nuclis eccumbencs a afore anerecia colleagues of mine in canada aadreslazadois a wonderful nor surgeon scientist has been studying the effects of going after area twenty five which is directly nacted to the nucis eccumbents by a you do not ut's it is a monest enaptic connection in a lot of ways you o perhaps deliverin stimulation there could could be very similar to delivering simulationitho thes combens all part of one critical in hipitory control circuit he sen benefits as well i i deftly think there is some evidence that this is an arry that we need to be study am i think our more eposotic approach with responseof stimulation going after sort of a signal in the neuclis accumbencs that seems to be related to the compulsion to with hold for meeting i think it is what we will be trying to accomplish ain our study it is a right now just being conceived though ah yet ththese studies they move slowly because you have to get a grant that grant gets reviewed by the ad i ghe six months after you submit it often gets rejected because it is too innevative and two high risk that you have to edit it and decrease the risk it takes my a beastest i took two years to get funded and i worry about that time frame because that is a lot of time for patients that irectsly to suffer that i might be able to help at least in small sample of patience am but that that is the nature of how these things go you will have to get afto a approval to do these kinds of things we try to do all of this in parallels an enormous undertaking and in a lot of ways for strarting for scratch but in some ways we have some preliminary data to to go after this my hope is in about a year will have a similar trial for adirectsia a pen som more to come on that am and i not i were ot the only allaw it is trying to go after because of the the clear need what is the dat is of non invase of brain stimulation oblation and blocking activitying the brain i get a lot of questions about transcraninal magnetic stimulation i actuly had that done as a researt subject sure nows at burkly rich ivories lad put a coil on my head i was tapping my finger in concert to a a a drum beat and then all a sudden a because of the stimulation it was impossible for me to keep time yes with the drum beat entical it is a pretty wild experience to not have motor control and a then to have motor control returned at the flip of a swich when some one else's controlling the swencions exi especially eary my understanding is that transcranual magnetic stimulations being used to treat depression an number of other brain cindrums a non invasively no no drilling through the skull the surgeons do not that surgeon's love to cut and dril a with purpose but they u but i my understands that the spacial precision is not that grat is ultrasound is something i hear a lot about these days and my understan is t ultrosound can allow researchers inclinations to stimulate specivic brainer is perhaps with more precision maybe you just give us a youre coverage of what those are being used for what your thoughts on on a these forms of non invasive meaning no no flipping open of a piece of he skull tye brained stim ulation and blockad of brain activity sure i wanted a clarify also these these surgeries generally do not am by the way requiry a full craniotomy is usually just a small opening about the size of a dime in the bone su just just to clarify aimless do right a usually without pain yet le lob in a scalp nomming we gave a scalp block and the patients aregetting ivy sidation they generaly do not feel anything and if they do they tell me nd we give the more local edesthetic but that is they are usually asleep during that part it is meenably envasive but you nw in a lot always teres no such thing as a miniably envasive procedure in the brain it is a cind ofof tho li here you say that oh no i i'm not one of those nervous surgeons that you have probably encountered and we have mutual friends that a and these mutural friends are some of my favourite people in nervous surgery an they probably actualything more me than the not but a there are nor assurgeons that you are aps we right and then thes true for all surgeries thay they really in a lot of ways they think what they do is sort of the ground truth or is a closer to the ground truth and i i get that am a you do not probing with purpose i i actualreally that would use that if you do not mind a s it is just describing what you do e the y but i i actually have of always said this said publicly ive said it to my bos i've said this to my team a we need to embrace not avasive approaches a some of them are a little fluffy am fluffy in that we do not understand how they work we do not ensoy understand have deepracon lish works by the way a but because we do not know exactly hw they work they are not as precise as we would them to be we have work to do there and i actually think that work is duable a and actually under way am that stand for we have great claberaters that that i think our doing this people no one williams and contelistin a cornel and others am we a i think that t mas transcreno magnetic stimulation it is et prof for depression by the ways also empty a prove of o c d and for nicketin ediction we reathey put the coil for those three at or more or less yes if they put it over atlas always on the scalp and a over the front ol lop and there is different parts of the frontolobe that have been demonstrated to be a little better or a little bit worse am but what the ft has a proved a for depression i believe is a similar a to what is been a prove for a o c d but for addiction i believe it is a different target but hat we would have to ask our our t amus experts on that can they direct the turns curning my nexstimulation deep below the cuart a they try ah and we are awe areactually studying this in o sty patients now am i is a part of our invasive trial a we are we are trying to pool patients from a t amass trial that is in parallel to what we are doing am all funded by the a fandatiofersity research a were a we believe we can use t masto to define a circuit that if modulated it proves o sid i'll be it temporarily and in those patients of its temporary they would be appropriate for ant invasive study a something were actively working on i've always believe that narrow surgeons need to be part of the discussion with these non ivasive approaches we do not ned to do them am but a i think we can help make them more precise and to probe nonevasively with purpose am rather then a this more or kind of i do not know a non envasive blast of fact cut of i i just cannot imagine how that is going to be as effective as proping with purpose but you culd do that not evasively as well and i think we ned do better in that way i' duly that is possible and i think people are actively trying to do it am getting deep in the brain wot t am us i think we will always be hard but you can get there indirectly y using conactivity assays and targeting superficial structures that have high conectivity to deep structures am for example am perhaps one day there will be a t amas target for anerecia and obisity ah if we are scratching the surface with invasive approaches to these problems we were even doing less with the brain stimulation am we have much work to do there eating disorders and t amass have been aum sort of scarcely studyed or or there've been such tha research done in that in that space and it is an arrya that we need to to work on am for the obvious reason for example in a pation with anerect tey just thinking practically placing a devic in a patient who is significantly under weight might not be the best approach ou o wounde rosion and issues that could come up developing a non evasive approach i think is critical the problem is where do we target and the only way to answer that i think reliably is to accept that we have to get into the brain be for were out of the brain and with these kinds of conditients were only just starting to get into the brain i i worry that were a long way away from a non evasive approach that really works consistently am sstartian trouble u want to make sure we touch on altra sound yest ar o lit his historically it seem that there was a bit more permission for people to probe around in the human brain i i a sometimes refer podcast to somemof thse papers that were i'm done a allowing patients to self stimulate in the rain is awork done in the in the sixtis an now his name escapes be robert an when these couple papers publishin science allowing patients to stimulate a couple of a brain aryas asking which once they preferred and i was alway shocked and slightly am entrigue by the fact that the the brain area that all three of these patients i do not think how any syndrums anthing they volunteered for these experimenti al only i do not think could do this any more a regulatory ii think was not the same as it is now as have changed a fortunately but they am all three of them seems to some midline phelamic structure which for those lissingstusa every kind of in in the dead centere of the brain am more or less that a evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger which surprised me because i would have thought oh it is robert heath yes expermence rather than patience preferring to stimulate areas that evoke laughter or joy or a feeling of drunkenness sor delight ad it also explains a lot of what i observe an social media this er and a people repeatedly enganging in battles a thatter kind of trivial t seems frustration and anger might have its own reward circuitury a anyway i do not wan to go too far down that rabbit hole but i it a it is a deep one it is a deep one an and cone it gets to our nature ya it you knowis humans and what we find interesting or rewarding but the b anability to probe around the brain in a safe way without the need for somebody to be a very sick it would be i think would be enormously powerful an at least to my mind if i were in charge which i'm not am would offer the opportunity to really come to an understanding but how the human brain works without all these issues of how to translate from mous studies and again there is huge value to animal studies as we both agree but a many of the things that we want to know about the human brain involve asking the person had you would you feel when that seid of nurons is stimulated and what do not you feel and a mouse we can ask and ask but then i can tell some they do tell us that i can tell us in english am how do we overcome this challenge but first ultrasound or if you prefer after ultr sound what is ultrasound can be really useful towards solving these clinical issues in these basic issues yes i think am let us start with ultrasentim will come back to it a ultre sound right now transcranial magnetic gi magnetic residence guided focus ultrsound a a this this is an ftie approve method to deliver an oblation to the brain non invasively there are a reseatres myself included that are trying to use transcrania magnetic i did magnetic residen's guided focus sultrasound or emor i guided focus sultresound a to use it in a modulatory way not just as noblation but to drive norinal activity or inhibit it perhaps stol learning how to do that a there are trials a thete are trying to understand if you can use ultrasound to open the blood bran barrier you can deliver a medication to that specific a area a perhaps for a bringtumer or something that a it is a very exciting field a and it is epty a profe for tremor right now and i actually do it routinely a for patience with a tremor with parkansons or essentiral tremor and a i i love doin it it is a often just kind of a miracle because there is no incission i do not have to place an electret into the brain to achieve a similar result how eally into the a pathology of parkinsons can some one think about approaching this oeres is if somebody has a apparenter or sibling an their developing some resting tremor ye i wa see they should talk to anaurologist but yo nor surgeon but this non avasime reproach could be incredible for them i suppose to jest t only taking drugs to increase dopening levels yes depending on the reason you have tremor would dictake the kind of medication you would use it could be parkinsons but if it is not it might be e central tremor by the way such tremors ten times as common as parkinsons really such ae tremor as the most common neurologic condition in patients over the age of seventy we often are not aware of that people with the such a tremor feel they have the forgotten disease because there is no michael j fox for a central tremor i i sent a letter is as sorrys essential tremor or or esaid yousential trem yet e assess and t i al am i've actualy sent a letter to to bill clinton i've observed a tremor in him and i think he is actually disclosed that he has at in them hoped he would become a champion for for patients with the central tremor a seturday a conerat does as well as she is also public about it but i i was not able to get them eager to become the champion for this condition but michael ja fox these patients need a a champion that am but unfortunately it is a bit of a forgotten disease a nevertheless because of the ft approval of focasulture sound for tremor a others try to get some attention for shore and a it is fabulously effective these patients that treats patients on one side u sually their dominant hand or their worse hand and it da it really speaks to the fact that whal you can deliver not evasively and oblation to the brain in a hypothesized zon that we think it is related to the problem at hand and at least wi tremor it works really well could this be effective for psyciatric disease obesity eating disorders a well a perhaps a actually that would be the ideal the problem is we do not know where to do the oblation a there is a trial that we would to do for o c d where we would deliver an oblation to the same area of the brain that we been delivering oblations to for years for patients with o c d and it helps a bit that is called a capsilotamy a but really the autcomes probligan to be about the same it is a nice method because its it is not invasive but a we need to find a new target for these for these conditions and because of the common denominator a the urge despite the risk sort of that compulsion a yeperhaps it could be the same target i do not know a but i would argu we need to do these modulatory experiments either with a device or with a invasive recordings a to better understand where these problems are coming from to define where we should do an ultrasoun treatment am you are write a historically a a without much regulation we have we probed the brain a the problem we cannot learn a lot from those experiments now a well in this way at least a we do not know exactly whre those electrotes were we did not have emorize scanning or high quality catscanning to to know where those electros were with certainty and and we know two or three milimators matters and we also did not have the tools to place electrodes in a precise way back then unfortunate we cannot learn a lot from those experiments right now were sort of re designing them and there is a way to do it now a patients with epilypsy benefit from this all the time there has been a revolution in america it was in europe a before it was in america where we would do sterio and sephilocraphy which is basic doing an e e g a patience with epilepsy but with invasive electrodes and we would place tiny little wires less than a milimator in diameter all throughout the brain into parts of the brain that we believe are involved in scesures and we would admit the patients to the hospital and figure out where the seisures were starting and propagating and thand a yet we could stimulate those electroes to see if there was a symptom that was important and i try to identify a a region tat we thought we could either remove surgically ablate with a lazer or put a a stimulator in it perhaps a that is commonplace now for epilepsy a and it works extremely well an it is very safe of course it is sdeli brain procedure a but the a the complication rate is surprisingly low quite honestly for the amount of electores that we place a and is extremely well tolerated most these patients leave the hospital they do not eveen fillic they have had surgery a there is actually a lot of interest in using that procedure to study monto huls disorders a we are trying to do it for patients with obsessive comcompulsive disorder were awaiting an eftia decision on that a but actualy i credit a our colleagues at bailer and at you see as f for for studying this a already a we have fabulous colleagues that you see as f a that have studied depression using this type of approach a mutual friend of ours a any a chang who wofs a a wonderful friend and colleague somebody have emulated for many years as well a and and the the psachitry teemat you see us if have worked together on this sort of bringing together the epilepsy technique and the psachitry experts to study how we could better arget electrodes in depression and i'll tell you if they have a consistent harget perhaps there becomes and ultrason target a but right now the approach is a bit more reversible cause you can always shut that electrte off or even remove the electroe if perhaps it is not in the optimal location to treat the depression a but actually after a large volume of a cases perhaps they could pool that data to develop a a new ultrason target for depression i think that would be fabulous and probably is their long termical a not to speak for them but that would be something that i i'm sores on their rate ar and a bailers try to do the same thing afor depression a their aproaches are a little be different but a similar tool to try to understand a depression and were working with all these types of acolleague somethes are our friends to try to to bring this to a osity as well and it make sense to try to do this ferediction and obisity and at erexia you might ask wel why are you doing this for obsity right now in in our in our study and the riason is that am we have developed a target for obisity ad been geting disorder a developed out of mice that we believe a isrelevant for the human state because you can model this problem in a mouse a bit better thethan you can model depression or osity we feel tit we can rely on the preclinical studies more whereas with these perhaps more i do not as they more complicated but more human mental health conditions that are hard to mode in a mouse you really half to study in the human and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient o patient that has electose and try to provoke a dopress state or study epileptics doctor chang has done that have come morbid depression for example ah and that can really validate this approach as well but in the end it is it is getting into the human brain that we need to do in the disease specifically a that well eventually lead to a not in base of approach either a leision nor modulatory approach mogitory would be tiames or leision approach would be with a ultreson could not agree more am meanwhile because there are many many millions of people suffering from depressiong needing disorders parkensons and esential tremor a et cetera well first of all i should say base on everything you have told me thus far it is amazing to me that any pharmicologic treatments work because of how systemac they are an impacting seratone certain urging arounds over here and doblemen urging arounds over there and not targening any specific batch of sells it makes perfect senses whi all the side effects exist but earlier you said something that really grab my attention i want to come back to which is that if people can be made to feel or make themselves feel just a little bit better little less anxious just prior to a craving episode or a binge episode maybeven if people can become better at detecting their own internal states and when there can aveering toward a benge reveering toward using a drug or youn veering toward suicidal thinking ibased omewhat you said earlier that those kind of am free behaviour ol states a cond of drift on the on the steering am thous somewak powerful levels of awariness at least for now until we have a specific sites in the brain that we can target non in basive methods that culd be deployed to millions an millions of people seems that awareness seems maybe among the best tools that people could develop yes hunc pers ent agree with you ow for the person without cd or a who suffers from in or ectyear binginiisorder to their clinations i i i just want a highlight that you said that i meano i'm not again omnonicalinition i wa says i do not prescribanything i profess thinks a and tha but awareness of one thinking seems immensely powerful in this contect a and after all it is the clinical probe that you use because if let us say the patient wores a lie to you about their experience o what happens in their mind when yu stimulate you could basically the whole thing the whole surgery the whole procedure could go badly wrong it is it is up to the patient to be of course honest with you in their theyr you dvise to do that but to be honest with themselves about ah i've gone all day without a benge but that he smell of the donator the thought of the dona is starting to have a particular allure that awrness seems an incredibly powerful thing to own into and to build and cultivate yes i've always thought that if we can improve awareness we can i prove outcomes i think that is probably true for many of these patients the problem i think comes down to the fact that some of these patients are resistant treatment and the patients that we see as a surgeon for example are the patients that they have tried cognat behavorotherapy sertain ly've tried medicatients they have tried behaviourol management they are aware of theyr problem and they have shown that to us they can tell us when their craving but despite the craving and despite being involved in this invasive brainsurgical trial highly first an human novel study a which i think we will have a positive effect but it is still experimental a they still cannot stop themselves they are sias made aware as could possibly be dhat i use grammar their correctly i think a the're as aware as it could possibly be and they still lose control we have had thi studied in the lab we will bring patients to thelaporatory with this implaned device to to try to provoke this electrographic electrical signal a that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they are at home but before we actally initiate stimulation we want o to see candis device detect this craving sell signal which is goinng differen o what we saw the operating becausethat is a singl cell but these devices these electorets are about a milimator in diameter instead of a tenth of a millimator wisheswhat we use in the operating room a they are they are only hearing or or detecting i should say thousands of cells responses and we actually have away to provoke binges is called a mood provocations very well well very well validated live it provoking seizures in the epleps of mongturing unit but here in these rof a psychiatric moniturin unit tor the the food monituring unit a we we actally have a psychiatros an en sort of specialist common induce a mood that is related to each patient sort of self described bench episode to the psychitris comes in in provokes yes a feeling that can evoke the negative behaviourthat is exactly right that we can vidio and syncrinize the vidio to the brain signal recordings a the patients all wear an eyetracker we can see what theyre eating at all times and what they are looking at specifically and that allows us to have the best temporal resolution possible to understand what is happening right before the bite and even under vidios aveilancs through one day one way murror in a laboratory setic when patients are very well aware that there theyare to be studied if they are going to bench they still do and we believe they do because they just cannot control it as aware as they are of it and it is probably because they are the most severe i think if we can improve awariness not just the secide all wariness that of stucking better earlier but the patient awariness a around theyr problem i think that could be a powerful way to help many of these patients and that sort of the roll of cogne behaprial therapy a the problem with cogna behavro there bure say the limitation of it i i shouldnot have any problem withi think it is a wonderful treatment am is that if you stop it many these patients go back to their old behaviors i do not say old habits but they might be a habit but the old behaviors and am that is the promise it is not nisody lasting ind the absence of continued cogni behavior there be some people can benefit from it long turn but some cant a but i think in in in in the less sever patients improving wariness key but in these really refractory patients this is this is kind of this is the disease despite the awareness they cannot control themselves that is what we are trying to restore is that improved ability to control their behavior do you think there is a roll for machines and artificial intelligence here a er couple laboratories up o the universy af washington that are using particular signar tue patterns of within voice to try and help tuicide old a people were suticidally depressed no one they are headed towards an episode before they even can consciously know since gets right down ou shues o free will in weather out machines can be smarter than we are but evno one could argue that some of the search agarisms on gugle and other serch engines are actually more aware of our preferences than we are a basely what these are these are de vices that are listening to people talk all tay theyre also paying antention to patterns a breathing and how well people slappt it is at ar indegrating a a huge number of cues and then signaling somebody with a a a yellow light your headed into a depressive episode the prism i say i feuell fine where i feel pretty good this is gond of baseline state for me in the say a this is where you were preceeding the last episode that took you down a deep dark trench and it took months to get out of yo a i wonder whether not some of these deviceis could help with the sorts of things what were talking about to day i think am i've always said we have to get in the brain before we get out of it and if we get in the brain to understand what these signals look we will know what those not in basive signals are i think it is possible that we are a scientifically sophisticated enough to use machine learning a ans ser this kind of bot tetn technique to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive in a suicides the most dangerous impulse its something that is immensely a focus of the lab is impulsivity we have talk mostly about compulsion compulsion being you going after a reward or or the urge do spite the risk am impulsivities is similar but different it is it is kind of going after something am a little bit if you give you model impulsivity in in a mouse its related to iu no going after a a food reward without the sort of paired tone that you are the mouse disposed to wait for the mouse does nont await any more they they just go after the foot a i've been that mouse yet we all a we can all relate with us a to a certain extent against the spectrum am in anycase i nonsecuiter but i i i certainly think that there is a way to use our own body's physiology to anticipate when these impulses are coming on line how best to do that i think we are just scratching the surface but a these are the kinds of solutions we need these are some of these problems are of epidemic proportions the largest public health problems in this country in this world o besity opia crisis depression as suicital i mean hat's a third of our country may be more probably more and i think about it and a collingue of ours ait stamperpsychootry told me something that still just wes my mind which is that something seventy five per cent of the ant i depressent and ant anxiety medication that exist in the world is consumed in the united states s amazing which is i mean that is an outrageous number yet we do have an obsession this cussury for pharmacy and a the farmer citical industry is very powerful here and probably such some ashect of capitalism a'm capitalistic and ijust everybody else but a i do worry about that little bit a alem but you we tend to over prescribe and i think we has patients tender a over ont medication a we quick solutions and sometimes medications provided sometimes not or therofteneus abandate depends on the problem of course a am but but i i agree t at we need scalable solutions you o ii'm a ner surgeon i'm only o g to be able to treat the most severe of patients with these problems you you now we have only done about two hundred thousand deep brain stimulation surgeries ever i mean the prob work talking about heres fifty million americans there is no possibility that surgeons can address that problem but we could help inspire and initiative to go after that kind of problem or help make it more rigorous because the last thing we need is a some sort of wearable fancy tool that waste people's money in time we need real therpiece for these things not that these divices hat were discussing are not i think actually there is lots of promise and we use machine learning in the lab all the time i'm not he ha an electrical engineer or the computation al nersine just doing this type of work i i just help debelp the hypotheses around it but m and how fundrys around it but i i definitly think there is a a future for it i just i i suspect we are rescretion a surface on how best to do it it is talk about your hands ye all the nero surgeons i know are y o very faithfully protect o their hands anst ci bot it is cause ia assurances too expensive a but i'm guessing you all are not the ones to reach into the garber's disposal even if your eyes on the switch to make sure that that is not gain to get turned on ther're just too precious they are your livelihood yam and at earlier we talked about dead lifts ae other forms of exercise and the things tennis om ther therares drawing and painting a full range of things that one can her ther hands use your imagination foror am is it true that ner surgeons do not do any i really heavy grip activity because it can refine the motor pat motor circuits in the brain and elsewhere that can throw off ther ner surgery game i would say had many nero surgeons a avoid activities that put their hands at risk a another one by the way there sa an annual a sofful tornment a that a nu nerve surgeons come to an near city and such a park witho ther lessoff wall now i'm just wetin ye ye iis actually a very you do typical hearts hoffwle i doft know whe thet callsoffble and a actually aof two close colligues of mine have got injured at that tortment thebe this is a it is alsoi ye say here o noking fun but for those of youare going in the medical profession it is also one of them ore how shi in this i' just goin to say there is a deep hirchy of training in ner surgerydus a there is a certain harshness that is been conveyed to me about the training a much astra not training to be as wholly fair and maybe this is a tactic to a to weed out either the younger orethe older generation thats is evolution ight wea to revolve and ar wei an medical a week i guess well i i can say that one of the individuals that got injured is one of the mor senior surgens that i work with now and is one of the best athletes that i know and he is deafling hat week but you can get interplan the sports and a that being said i can tell you you briefly is a i think that you at's funny my my mother came to me recently she is she is osteo penia and she told me her doctor told her she is not a lowed to do dedliffs and was coquet a that is fine i not telling you should do dedliff such as do not exactly nderstand the relationship but a i cannot say that i do think i' i'll give you a little story here the reason why i'm being little hesitan to to confirm that i agree with you on the dedlifs is i a when i was operating this was when i was at standford i university operating and a as i mention alou ie wee get an introperative catscan i to confirm actrssy ofour lectures i do this for all of my surgers when i was reviewing that catscan the extrat technition looked at me and said whispered into my ear hes ai your posture really parrising your physical posturi wal doing your surger you a and i looked at hm and i kind of wanted to say i will not cursei tii iyei i i've been doing intermittnly during our conversation ecause he made me realize that i i realy did have bad postum and a we cund have had a little brief aside and hei learnd he was a personal trainer and a his name was zac and he a you he said to me you your postures week because or your postureis poor because your week you need to strengthin your body an strengthen your core i was ow he is powerlifting i i'm a little hesitant to do this and i'll tellyou i started very slowly and i cannot prescribe power lifting to everybody for the exact reson you said a and i'e forgotten hurt doing it by the way but i do think i i wish i started a little younker and i would argue that with close supervision and very well if you are if you have a very experienced trainer which i would argue you rn't her he surgeon or an asterunant a or or have a highly specialized profession where you need your your limbs to to to function dentist thinks that a if you areging to take something on this it really needs to be extremely carefully supervised and i can tell you that not my trainer had a profound impact on my life and my posture and my my physical health and a we did dedlift i'll admit when you rougt it up i i kind of truckle to myself but i yes i i have gotten mildly hurt deadlifting but it was when i was doing ut bon myself and i was kind of cocky and i was not paying attention but whe i was with him and he was all over my technique it actually was the most efficient way for me to feel stronger and it improve my posture a significantly and i i miss him since i've left california ii have a new trainer filled elpi his great but a aand and i still deblificationally with im but i a i can say i am opposed to dead lifting callously but if you are extremely well monitor by it experienced a personal trainor a weigt liftor i think i could be a greatrait i i love to be wrong in the comi because i'm a huge proponent and on the parcassionar on i am there there is much data now point in the fact that hundering one hundred eighty to two hundred minutes of his own to cardio conajogging cycling swimming type behaviour is very healthy for everybody and we should all be doing that at least that yes in answer is well and that resistance training on the order of six hard sets per muscle group per week or is realy imporn just offset deteriation of muscles and on learning is maof a scelial function and tendants strength and that is just to maintain we are not soing that all outsets to absolute failure but t as you point out with a with proper forms i even the narrow surgeon ore doing this which i think is is wonderful is as a final question a but one that i think really ore may be second to final question a earlier i commented on the a remarkable calm at least perceived calm a norrow surgeons it could because or could be effect of the training but it is obvious to me why one would want that trait in their narrow surgeon am you i would not want a hyperact ive certainly not an impulsive noro surgeon given that the margins of err ar tiny ispacial scale probably on the temporal scale too yes ay non't one people doing things in time that it were being spontaneous at all do you think that this a branch of medicine that you are in selects for people that at least can know how to control any kind of fluctuations and autonomic rawl they can calm themselves in real time and here is a specific question when i've never operated on the human brain although i had the privilege of being in the operating room and seeng this with some of our experiments with people in weare i remarkable thing i wish for everybody that would get this experience at some point not awfullyas a patient on thess they have a need but to observe it but what was just striking to me is a the verioust a steriotype behaviours of the surgeon and when i did surgeries as a graduates studen as a posttock in the brains of other types of animals i would find for instance that if i started to tremble a bit if i tapped my left foot that my hand would stable eyes a bit that there is this kind of need to move the body one feels the impulse maybe that is my my terret ligkt compulsions again but but that one can kind of am siphen off some of that energy in to another limb tha you could remain precise sort are these sorts of things that i'm talking about our maybes tirely my imagination but are these the sorts of things that one learns as a narrow surgeon how to still the body and still the mind doou have a meditative practice when you go into the operating room if you have a particularly challenging morning or were a poor night's sleep do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself and get yourself into the zone i think this would be very interesting for people to get some inside into even if they do not want to be ner surgeon yei i completely agree and i i appreciate the earlier a reference to naro surgeons as a astronauts cas i've also heard us compared to cowboys before and little bit less flattering i a some of what we do surgeically really does require a substantial mean of confidence a and that confidence hopefully comes fra years of training at experience a yyou always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced and that that that is problematic a luckily i rarely see that because our training is rigorous we have aabortive a american bord of nological surgeons that a sort of aallous and and assesses surgeons to continue practice a and holds us to a really high bar a i doo think it tends to attract a certain personality a in my some specialty i as a a deepbrain stimulation surgen we called stery o tactic and functional nerow surgery some people have likened us to the neurologis with a scalpal a we we tend to be a bit more intellectual a a maybe maybe bedside manners a little bit friendlier a and then there is the vasculine narow surgeon who does not sleep and the're not as friendly there is the spine surgeons who operate the most and there busy busy busy ah we there are some of these kind of reputations going around but i i agree with you there is a sort of a common feature of af a calmness aacross nerow surgeons and you kno there some of my obbousin my favourite people my closest friends a and i i can relate with them probably because of that a sort of a big picture they do not get sort of a flustered a they they tend to are they tend to be really good at figuring out haw o have quality time because we work really hard our ours are a significant and the time with our families are friends is less than we would it to be a that obvosy that is true for people who work hard across any profession but definily trute for nurow surgeons and i think that we are very good at figuring it how to make that time high quality a even just texting with some of my friends a that are thet are nerow surgeons a great friend of mine just became chairman it do conjust connecting with him by text which takes seconds you feel we feel connected and i think that is a that that is a trait amongst nour surgents we sort of know how to cut to the chase in a way ah and priortize our time ah it is a skill that we probably have it nately a but i's also part of the training when we are in turns now there is a lot of work our regulations that is probably quite appropriate by the way am i i think ore hours before were bordering aon on a not nesorily letch lus to say they were not ideal for mental health and sleep which we know or very important components a certaily we had no time for meditation i definitely did not i i wish i did am now knowing what i know about meditation of my my wife's a health coach i i get it i see it i i i practise it myself with her ah i see the value i wish i had that tool when i was in training because it stressful you even with the work our restrictions we still do not sleep very much were still a work a lot about eighty hours a week throughout the entire career ah there are times when it is more because after training there is no work our restrictions sometimes i feel as faculty we can abeused and the trainees are a little bit more protected now it it would diffrenly was the reverse at one point that is also a huge problem probaly mortal problem am and i'm joking a little but i i do not isaily think we are abused but certainly re ours ore significant but they come a bit more here and there all my ow our days when a operating those are long days but on the days that i'm lucky enough to be a researcher a you those days tend to be a bit gentlearnless i'm grand writing those tastes can be long as a i day as you question i doou think we are were sort of self selected for it but i also think its part of the training we because of the long hours that were in the hospital were taking care of sick patience and we have sort of a type a meant tor approach where our mentours are hard on us we learned to cope with our stress and be efficient and priortize things dispite the distress of it all and i think we take from that this sort of calm demeanour and perhaps aum perhaps it is just amplifies what weere probably drawn to because before we come to narrow surger we might rotated narrow surgery we might spend a month pretending to be a narrow surgeon learning from residence and and and faculty that are practicsing the the specialty but prior to actually starting your training you never experience anything being a a resident in narrw surgery a distress and the the volume of patience at have to take care of and the long nights it cannot be quite lonely by the way a you develop friends in the hospital but you sometimes ou're on you'r own when you are own call and you have back up you can call your chief resident or you'r attending but you really have to learn had a take care patience yourself you oms see form teams with nurses and staff and things that another residence but it cannot be lonely it can be really challenging and i think because of those experiences that all nerve surgeons go through we tend to have this sort of unflapable personality that perhaps we started with a bit compared to the average person but the training definitly emplifies it and do you have tools that you implement if you ever feel that youre getting slightly off center i do now i when i was in training i i actually remember in my second year most nursersry programs when you are junior resident in some ways that is your toughess year not in every way it is your toughes yeure because your your young and you'r inexperienced and you do not know what you do not know and and that that is why it' such a toughy ear bcause you have to learn a lot very quickly for patient safety reasons for self survival you kow you just have to learn a lot and youe on call by yourself in the hospital and it is a it is a real challenge and i think that i you personally i i gained a lot of weight during that year the only exercise i did consciously was taking the stairs i refused to take the elevator and i was at a pen at at hup where i currently practice now and i remember i would see patience anywhere from sort of the ground floor where the trobabat was ot ye are all the way up to founders twelfth twelfve flor and i would never take an elevator that was my rule for the yearcause i knew i would not have time to exercise but i would just take the stairs and the beginning of the year i i would be a little winded when i got to the twelfve flocker but by the end of the year actually did not really face me became but a great habit to have the problem with that though as i hered that unfortunately with you a lot of sleepless nights or not enough sleepless i and i had this terrible habit u drinking coffee late at night and i would put a lot of sugar in it and it was sert of the only way for me to get at quick a quick bowd of energy that for some reason i prior i tized at that time obviously knowing tat i would crash which i always did and i always kind of regretted but i still did it anyway and i i i attribute that to poor decision making inexperience and perhaps being a little bulnerable a i think we all are that is why i relate with a lot of e resers that i do and i remember i got married in my third year the year after my second year and my wife and i are my foncy at the time we started going to the gim together in the morning and my hours were a little better i would action be what aexercise before i operated that day and i operated almost every day as he third year resident i emember iet get to the gim reallya early in three months i lost twenty pounds and i was not trying to lose weight i just was sleeping better and taking care of myself and i emember when we got married i i i fitid t a tuxito that i had in college or it would a fit me in college at actie was at you texedo admittedly but it was the same size as my took seedo from college i i think that i i've always related with the problem that ar or our patients have to a certain extent and i when i've been most vulnerable which is what i was working the hardest with the least about a sleep i i related with it the most and yes exercise for me has always been my tool more recently exercise some some strength straining i think is important compared with cardio ah i do not do enough of either a but i defly you some and that helps meditation helps me a bit i do that every net for i go to sleep a i i use an ap for it it is pobping ut the best way to do meditation but if it keeps you doing it regularly exasts the best way to do it age i could notabe with you more it is one of those things where i look forard to it every night and you have sometimes wife falls a sleep and i come to bed a little later and i whisperm a you cave i turn the ap the o she does the same to mecause i think we both value it da i think that that that is been very helpful di i did not have that tool probly what i needed it most but i have a na and it it is very helpful i really appreciate you sharing o those tools a a number of people a i'm guessing out there might want o become nearo surgeons i really believe that in hearing to day's conversation that you will spark an interest in mediesine and or iner o surgery u was cerainly need to be a a a physiction before you a become on neuro surgens o and neurou surgery in some cases and that would be beautiful and i predict that will behappen that will happenscuse me as a consequence of what you have shared to day i really appreciate your mentioning of the emphasis and appreciation on a quality time a i very much see this as quality time i i

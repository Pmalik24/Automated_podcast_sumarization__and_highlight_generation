welcome to the hubrermen lad guest series where i and an expert guest i ust science an science ace tho ri mand your hubermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode march the fourth in the six episode series on fitness exercise an performance and to day's episode is all about optimal fitness programming that is how to design a fitness and exercise programm that can achieve the goals that you want for fitness and for sports performance doctor into yalpan great to be back in previous episodes you taught us about the various adaptations that occur at the level cells at love organs indee doth level the entire body that underlie things improvements and strength and speed hypertrophy acave muscle growth in the various forms of endurance and you laid out beautifully the various protocals that one can do in order to achieve each in every one of those adaptations to day i'd love for you to teach us how we can combine different protocals to achieve multipladaptations in parallel for instance how to improve endurance and strength how to achieve some level of hypertrophy perhaps directed hypertrophyite specific muscle groups while also maintaining endurance and perhaps improving speed for instance and if you would i'd love fo you to tell us how we can combine dfferent protocals and vary those across the week across the month across the year that we can make regular progress and perhaps even you could give us a window into the ways to make the fastest progress possible ye i would love to do that we know we haven vested a lot of time in the previous episodes howvering background and concepts and detail about the physiologies you understood why you are making the choices you are making and why other choices are less effective in this discussion i would actually to jump may be more directly to the answer and right kin get right into the protocalso an may be little but less background if your interest in that stuff i i suppose you have to go backwards litta bit and watch some of those a previous episodes but i would love to jump into just some samples of some case studies if you will and can walk through different proticles i know that over the course of my eleven years is a a college professor and of being in the public sface a little bit probably the most numerous style of question i have got is exactly that i know the rept range for this or i know the style of training for that adaptation but how do i put them together and i would dis to spend our time to day going through those things and the reason i want to do it is this some people listening at home surely a just love exercise they are already bought in and they are goin to train no matter what and theire interested jisactually being more effective and the way that you structure and put your plan together will enlarge part determine getting more progress for for less effort or actually being able to put the same monafordin in getting results faster there is also imfolks forobulicening who are ocay i exercise i do what i can i'm bought in to the benefits and you have talked laborately over the the hundred pluss episodes you have done about athe various benefits of exercise but you do not abs youre con of doing it because its important but you not there for those folks it is sort of oca how can we actually make the sing more effect we can make sure you hit the things you are aft toabsolute have to get for the short and long turn benefits right to make sure that you are looking the way you want a look you are performing physically that when you want to perform and then you can do that across your live span how can we give you all some structure i'm to wear again you do not have to turn into an absolute lover of physical fitness and it does not have to take over your life but you can still get more results for your same time restrictions whether that you have two days a week or five days week or only certain access to a quit man or experience whatever the case may be how can we help those folks as well put together a protocal that will get them close or their gulls with less restrictions fantastic an hoping that along the way you will also point us to how often to take the fitness ess astiment for each of the adaptations that you refer to in a previous episode well also ling to that fitness ess a iment sagment in the show nocaptions for this episode because that fitness ossastiment for different adaptations i think is a really powerful way for people tho touch enency how much long endurance do they have how how much uninerobic capacity do they have how much strength do they really have and then perhaps you would also be willing to throw in a couple of additional ways that we can assest our level of fitness in progress in this art of a fitness program across the year amazing i cannot wait to do that i think it is also important before we jump into acknowledge a lot of folks maybe thinking themselves i do not really necessarily need a plan why do i have to do that i do not have a certain go 'm going after i'm not running a race any time soon i'm not a compatitiveathlyd i just i go to gim an i work out and that is griht well i would to try to convince you that regardless of where you are at having a plan well achieve those things we just talked about which is more success and a shorter time for him there is actualy significant amount of resert to support this those individuals who go on a specific training plan compared to those who done not we will receive better results i independent of the effectiveness of the program right we have talk in previous episodes about tons a different styles in strategies and to reiterate it really does not matter which one you pick the fact you have a plan is always more effective than not having a plan and you again even if you are not planning on competing with something if you want a shorten the amount of time you are in the gem get more results from it how would strongly encourage to put something together the two largest reasons why people do not get results with their fitness raining prolical is number one atherents and then number two some sort of progressive overload both of those two things are challenging to accomplish without a plan right the reason people do not go to the gim one of them and one of the reasons why it takes them long as cause hey do not walking with the very specific plan it is sort of going it the grocery store and friguring out what you are going to buy verses knowing exactly what you aregtg to geting you shopping the scribing those things and getting out you will notice you are time inthe grocersory es half the length you are more productive and you did not waste money on exerthanks ay that alone will drive t hereence because you are now going to thing yourself all that ninetyment work out i do is actully really just sixty and now the next timeyou go to trainer man are i have ninety minutes you realize its only sixty er or forty or thirty or twenty whatever heus to be that alone will get you therethe second part of that which is overload it is very difficult to understand and remember while the last time i did lat raises i used i think five pounds and that i think i did twell well if you do not have some sort of system of tracking and this can be a simple is a note book just wriding down whath you did before and doing a litiut more the next time that is going to almost guarentee u success having some strocture and this structure can be fairly lose for to talk about a bonchto examples i is something i strongly encourage every one to utilize for their exercise before you begin id to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is also separate from doctor andy galpins teaching a research rolls at calstate fullerton it is however parto of our desire an effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we would to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is mormentus momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the huberman lab podcast is proud to be partnering with formentus for several important reasons first of all as i mention they are supplements are of extremely high quality second of all theire supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to develop a supplementation proto call you are going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the huberman labpodcast listeners reside outside the united states if youd

cooling heating and sleep tracking capastity i've been using an eight sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months and it has completely transformed my sleep i'm sleeping about the same amount but i'm sleeping far deeper and i'm now getting the proper ratios of called rapid eye movement or rem sleep and slow waved sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straight forward i've talked many times before on this plodcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of coor body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increes in coor body temperature with eight slee mattress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night a different temperature the middle the night and a different temperature as you approach morning each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight

programm a few minutes ago we were talking about how two of the major reasons people do not get as much at their training programs as they would is because of one a lack of adherente and two a lack of progressive overlook the solution to that is constructing a plan that lives within your realistic limitations i would to walk you through i my ten step approach to how ly desin training programms now before i do that i think it is fair and important for the idieus understand that this is simply my approach i've been doing this a long time i i've played college football and i wrote my own training programms back then i have and still working with professional atleass and pt tur in a fell the maj baseball as well as a ton of general population folks this is a combination of the evident space that we have been talking about in trms of best practices for strengthaninditioning as well as just my years of experience there are many many ways one could do this i'm not even suggesting this is the best this is simply how i do it this is exactly how i handle it when a new individual comes to me and how i teach my student step number one is a sassing properly and identifying a training goa now that is actiou sort of funny because we hear that a lot but a lot of people actally never take that step not te colony but in the room out but what is happening here is this morning a andy doctor galp and i wer were training together and i he was providing amazing tips on form and a sat rcadence in the sort of thing and he said what is your training goal for i the next twelve months and i pause and it turned into a very long pause a is an easy nice way of saying he did not have an answer i did not have an answer i i of course i do not just want to maintain what i've developed in turns of strength and emperatureean endurance but am i do not have a clear goall i'm hoping that by the end of to day's discussion iill beyond track to a clear set of goalsmazrn i'm not going to bore you all here but really i cannot strest en oug how important that step really truly is to getting results the analege you will use here is if you left your house and you were attempting to get to the grocery store m and you just start a driving and if you drove every possible rote you would eventually get to a grocery store and yes that can work a better approach is saying here is where i am there is where i want ta go what is the optima route there and that is really what you are doing with gul soit is a boring step it is not interesting to hear i do not have any real hac or tricks for you but it is step nuer one on purpose we have to know exactly where we are going you can do this in two ways why nember one is ju just pick something arbitrarily tocide i'm mon a run a five cay or i've done that before and i want t improve it by ten seconds i want a loose ten pounds you can just pick one that is great another way is to run through that fitness testing protocoll we described a a few episodes before and if you do that you can see which of these air is that maybyou have the largest lagging in or what is the most severe performance anchor is how we refer to it and then choose that is your primar n gol either otion some people come in to to training programs with a very clear goal in mine they want to admor muscl or whateve whatever cak great if you are idonly no you i ti jus can a work out then run the fist fitness testing protocall you will see what score is the lowest and and then you will maybe make that oppriorty for the next say three months the first step is to identify a specific or set of specific training gals a really nice tool for helping you set a goal is a system called smart right nother's lot ofbat a debate on what those accinems actually stand for but well get close inough smart is often specific measurable attainable realistic and time win starting off with as specific in general the more specific you'r goal is the hier likelihood you will have a succeeding in that m being measurable it means it needs to be something that you can actually put a metric on this can be objective or subjective but generally i to have at least one objectif measure remembering objective is something that is not based on feeling it is not up you this con be something simple your body waghte it could be how much you can bence prest what is your one mild time any whatever is most important you ould actually does not have to be a fitness related goal for example if you are using fitness as a way to enhance your sleep the main metric you may be interested in is mount of hours sleep slepet it could be something efficiency or whatever is most interest it could be work productive it does not really matter it does not have to actually be tha the fitness school but what is the motivation of why you are doing it that is specific measurable a attainable or eractionable was often described is something that is within your capability im attainable a bad example of attainable is something my goal is to win more games that may not be up to you at the team the other team your playing it could influence it the schadul et cetera attainable should be something that is within your control realistic or relevant to you is something that is against something real listic that you can achieve you would not want to make a goal that is and wyou want a double your body mass that this is not gonehappened think about the constrains how old are you what is your training experience how much time do you really have to invest in us and then pick something that is realistic and an honesty might little twist here is take that in minus ten per cent cas typically when people put together training programs their their goal tends to be quite lofty and they get some small per cented the way in realize their never going to get there and back off we actually the sort of reminds me of a a classic deception study that we did not in might have one time were we took people and we had them do this a maximal front race sbacecs you held a dumble out in front of you a frse long as you possibly could and the gold here was actuallya deception studies were tricking them and we said ookan we wanted to get normaty values to see how long people can hold this front race andi think we use something five per cent ofther bodywight and they came in they did at one time and we time them they did not get to see the clock they left and thn we said we got to come back ain repeat its right we got to do couple of tries here to get it normal value in cases off whatever well the perdicimus were split up into four groups group one actually was told that their time was fifteen per cent lower than that they actually got group too was five per cent lower group three was five per cent higher and group four was fifteen per cent hire the second time they came in to do it our gradual soon cot on co made a mistake and left the timeer in front of them the first time they gain they did the excihe the're just holding it thy do not now have any idea how liong the'r holding the second time theyhad a giant eye pad set just a little but off centered or they can clearly see it they watched the time go by and of course what happened was those folks say who did t one minute the very first time when they tested they came back in to do the second time and they are holding it and we told them they actually got forty five seconds when a reality they had done a minute they'r holding it holding it and they think they only did forty five seconds by the time they get the second forty forty wone forty too they get past forty five they almost all quit forty seven forty eight seconds cause they wanted to beat their previous score but then were cool i beat it and hen they quit early they were actually not yet tho failure but they were just happy enough to beat what they thought they' done and then they quit the other group on the inver a side again say hey got a minute we told them they got a minute in fifteen seconds they got to forty five seconds fifty seconds and stare a realizing who man i have thirty more seconds to go and they quit way oarly because the care was way too far out they realized i'm never going to get there i'm nisken as stop now can you guess which group did the best on the post ast once that were just within about five per cent of totally s they want ed to improve and again say they got a minute the first time we told them they got a minute five or sorry they got a minute five the first time we told them thy only nout a man they actually exceeded that greatly because they wanted to be our i'm making sure that that goal is properly a line it needs to be a little bit scarry a littleabout unwillistic whil you can have to work for this if it is too easy you will quit you will not feel a challenge if it is too hard though you will quleerally as well you want to make sure as that reasonable balands of life ashould a train to day we vet jus go if i do that o nockan hit i got ni i got a gin after it but not all my got this is no chance here s sena walk uay early it is a fantastic study i have to say a it is very simple i think it illustrates a number of important psychological principles about goa setting motivation self perception but also the dopemean system the the dople mean system is this universal reward system that meaning it does not only work for food or only work for fitness goals are only work for academic goals or relationship goals it it is the universal substraht for all that and m i should think there' some real gems of information an am the study design that you describe a just cu that for maybe a potential collaboration between our laboratories beg aumi think it is very important t but it does ce up another question o a a relevant to fitness particular which is what are your thoughts on intermediate goals let us say my goal is to drop to per cent itis two per cent of body fat from where i am now a year from now the roll into the next year from now about to per cent lower on body fat but maintain my lean body mass or may bean increase it yet how should i atsess progress am because the dople mean system loves a goal at love's anticipation of a goal but it responds best to wech for re up if you will our dope mean any time we get they signal that we are on the rite tract to that goal and that signal could be o cai did the work out i just trust that these monhoms ar going to give me the result i want but of course we know that when people get a glimmer of the idea or some object to feeback that the're on the right path that dople mean system really fires in provides motivation for continuing toward the ultimate goal and aas we have talked about in the unstrength speed and hyperthophy episode resistance training itself has this built into it because of the confusion of blood into the muscles you actualy get a a little window into what you might get in terms of an adaptation simply by ver by way of the called pump where as endurance type work generally does not have that you do not see yourself get better drop back and than adapt and actually get better but that is i see what you see with wait training given all of that contour of the dopening system what sorts of intermediate goals should i set for myself or should somebody set for themselfes and i realize it wll probably depend on the ultimate goal but would you say check in unon progress once every week every month three months i cannot i dont know if you can tell the look on my face aii love this thot this question in this topic i spin much time on it on my a senor graduate level prokn mosin course i've been fortunate to work with a few atit is where we have had multiple years and if you can really take the time to step back and go it is not about optimizing for the next six weeks and in this case it is not the next fight it is the champion ship fight that we need to get to in three years or it is the lympics which are on a quad programme rate youre really optimizing of that for year if you can have that foresight and really think about that and work backwards you can see some pretty tremendous things the the sort of saying tha is we gend we tend to over estimate wut we can get down in a week and underestimate what can happen in a year that can be extraordinarily powerful however you have to have those metrics called out ahead of time because you will lose motivation and that short turm because you will not see that result immediately but if you remember i'm on a path to four per cent or two per cent o what every need to be therefore i onl ly need to be this far right now and to be that far and the tat far it is actually quite clear and whatl we would actually do in that cenario not to go off tract yor site i can really go on the stuff is a t let let say was the year recommendation you gan to actually need to go to the last part of smart which is timely part of setting this goal is making sure you understand the time domain responsible on it is actually quite great here because not to go in ception on us wer we list within e list and rob kills us over here but number one of this program design thing was assessing your goal number two is identifying your defender but i mean by that is what is stopping you from hitting that goal you want to lose two per cent body fat an the next year okate great what is can a stop us once we can achieve that well goal no more that in in a second then you just start walking that two per cent backwards you might have to go something this look every time i start workn out really hard i always get hurt interesting o ca great maybe e instead of jumping really hard into it in an high intensity interval training programm nowing we are likely to hurt something or get burnt out or quit or whatever tha the defender is for you maybe we invest something right now which is maybe improving oreflexibility working on movement technic whatever's a stop you from getting he or maybe we progress slower we do not get there that will allow us to do the work necessary to hit that goald twelve months from out not two weeks from ow not two months for now maybe that is not the case maybe no look here i move well i fee am in a decent shape i've got enough muscle mass on me im we have talked in previous episodes why having insufficient muscle masses sometimes detramental for fat loss you checked all that boxes i do not get her very oft in right i got equipment around no problem i've got the time in my scatal and i have enough muscle greght well now we may be jusplited up and say look we got twelve month we got to per cent it is the simple is doing half of per cent per qarter of the year and now all we are looking at as that number right i do not half te necessarily get all these things done i can go quarter half per cent half per cent half per cent half per cent you are going to get there the other siton sonarra that i laid out a second ago it maybe neds look something this quarter one as ging to be zeril per cent o yea iit is right you may not lose a pound for the next three months we do not care that is not the goal of these freemits i know that' tegal this year that is our major macrocychel goall e're going to get there but to get there most effectively we need to invest in you' working more with your citopracte but wbut whatever the thing is right that will allow us to then go half a per cent quarter two when we can reeast art training but we are gin a ramp into it quarter three were into go another half of per cent and now we are half way there quart or for we have invested much you are ready to go or an go hard can get that last one per cent at last quarter and were gong to get there and you will not be hurt that makes it very clear and i can also invision how the precise structure of these intermediate goals would very depending on what sort of adaptation one is pursuing and i do remember from our previous epissodes a that fat loss itself is not an adaptation is a by product of other adaptation tosone him make sure that that i was paying attention e it is committed to memory absolute some goals such as fat loss of very quant quanifiable and yet they may not be lineer right it is it is hard to know i know it that the assumption is if y yu in jest ex fewer caleries than a required per day than you will lose ex amount of weigh some per centage from body fat i think om that cuse up the idea that we need to build some flexibility into our are thinking about these intermediate goals in order to just make sure that do not mean system is not tethered to exact numbers because after all a reduction to per cent body fat for instante is really desire to a achieve a different sort of over all body composition a recomposition a i do not know by the way that that is my exact goal i i think one of my mi gols is to be able to run a mile faster m and i'm sort of am haunted by this experience of wanting to run cross country an college and trying to walk on we were not a division one school but the threshold for being am considered for the team was you had to run a sub ten minute two mile which turns out to be very very fast that is really ha in i did not do that i did not even come close a but a and i do not think that i could reasonably do that now a behve no i'm notm not interested in committing to the kindof training required the sacrifice is not meaning ful enough for me a faranois but lowering ones a mile am time to run a mile by i dont know ten per cent seems a reasonable gal am across six months tur great in the case of a goal that am clearly there r specific training programs but this raises the issue of would if i have other goals as well a and at what point do people's having multiple goal starts to set up collisions between goals how do we know whether or not something is reasonabll not just on its own but because of the other things that one has am structured into their program being able to reduce a mile time by ten per cent in six months o k maybe that is duable maybe it is not you can tell me but also being able to ou a double the amount that they can a do for a single repetition exfor that matter ah at the same time that seems the oseem liking campatible goals right a couple of things number one the more specific and precise you can be with a single goal the faster you will get there generally in theory if you had one thing you wounter to achieve the best way to go about it is to focus on that give it the most priorly thet does not mean you cannot do anything else along the way you can but you would want a focus on that the more additional goals you bring in the more distraction you are creating for that primary goal te pending on what those goalse are you can actually do them the same time am some other combinations are less effactive think about it this we went through those nine adaptations and we went through them in a specific order on purpose the closer those adaptations altogether in that list the more compatible they are to training each other the further away they become more challenging just to give a few examples if you wanted to improve your speed in power you could basically train those simultaneously they would not in interfere with heach other at all in fact since power is speed times force it would becomplimentary if you just walk down the line from their to strength hay sane thing if you get faster that is gon o aid in strength because force is mastimes exeleration if you improve exceleration your contributing to strength same thing with power speed power and strength or generally very complimentary you can absolutely train all three of those gols at the same time and have no issues getting into hypertrophy now we have got a little bit of distinction if you areging to train strength and hypertrophe as we talked about on that episode at the bags those are gon to be complimentry you add on hee muscle you are goingto get stronger you start training for strength a's problic an a help you out on some mustlemass as you get to the end of that spectrum the overlap between the two starts to go away such that if you truly wanted to maximise strength above everything else if you continue to train for hypertury as well that is going to take too many resources out of your recovery been and you will not be able to do that the inverse would also be the same right if you' training the maxmy strength you would not be able to put enough of all you on to get sufficient hypertrophy if you want to then combine speed with hypertury youare going farther away fror m each other which means it is going to be more and more distraction the hyperchfy training would cause a ton of fatigue you would not be able to go at max speed for your speed or power strength youging to be compromising those results now speed training will not compromise your hyperthvy training because it is non fatiguing right and bomp here we have a litte bit of an interference effect one way but probably not the other let us move down the spectre in one more time and get into endurance we will not go through all of these thingths but you you etting idea here oh little bit of high intensity intervals o ca cool now would that compromise my speed power or strength probably because thre's a little bit of residual fatigue if the volume was long enough then you would be fun all your word about there is not necessarily some sort of celular mechanism it is tos simple fatigue it is amount of energy expenditure averses is that compromising my recovery to come back would those first three or four thos speed power strength interfere with your ability to elevate your anerobe capacity probably not almost surely in fact if you look at any of the literature on endurance training you will see that speed power and strength almost always improve endurance right and durance training addit on top of strength can be detrimental cannot have a neutral effect but generally does not help one get stronger by adding additional conditioning unless you are unfit you cannot get through the volume needed in the strength trength right one more example here wilso we do not drag this out too far in the case of something i want to loose fat wel hey we do not have to worry better inferance does not really matter if you are fatigue for your hyperchfy session not a big deal we are just trying to get some work done if you are hi percry sesh a patigia from your conditioning it is cool cause you got the work done you do not have to worry about it much i'm really kind of depends on the actual goal and what you want to pay attention do is actually what ore the chances of overlap which means were thit the adaptations you get physiologically that cross over from one to the other and then what ofe the ones that are actually going to start interfering in fact i have in my a in my class i have this giant matrixs charge of interference effect going from adaptations through a whole wonch of systems everything from handling p age to emphatic dranage to bonmental denity et cetera you can walk through these whole things and say which one's actually have a positive effact which ones have a mass iv positive fact and in which one's actually have a littbet of interference an i perhaps if you gets your nice enough we cal throw that into a new sletter or something some some petia for something to think there would be immensely valuable i think some of that more extensive information whence laid out in great form that it is easierty use wi am we should well now we have sat it si w we i did not be ai would do what i said perhaps i i din't s a great idea am the its aterrific idea a the idea that item's closer on to each other on the list of those nine diferant adaptations are going to be easier to achieve in parallel than item's further apart makes perfect sense and what i heard was that there is a a few coviots that might see minor but the but there actually quite important such as anything that is relatively low intensity and does not impede recovery can probably beincluded as a parallel go am some speed work in conjunction with some long duration cardio work ner in someth even though we are talkingabout number two on that list an number nine on that list in that case the longeration endurance even if it is low intensity may actually interfere with the speed if the volume gets too high if you are talking about i went on a thirty minute jog from most people that that it is totally fine what were really talking about here is when the miles start piling up on the the time reallye sarts getting there in commidation with some of things the factors we talked better which is exercise choice more eas centric landing base exercise tits is running for example this more likely to interfere then cycling icould you not landing swimming is lowan pacxso if you are going to do those things you can hedge your best little bit by choosing an exercise choice that is less inpactful i again if we are littlely ecause there is oftentimes confusing here was oh do not do ten minutes on the treadmill before you lift you can a ahol time out warmup is fine we are really talking about probably more than thirty plus minutes at higher than sixty percent harrit random number something that depends on the person et cetera but it has to be a decent chunk im again you can actually fix that by then disconsuming gallories you can also fix that by making sure everything else in the hidd an invisible stressor bucket is improve that s is one of our tricks hit will get into when we gan the recovery is you do not anessarily need o hav to reduce your training if you just ramp up your recovery ie to tee a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens ith letic greens is a vitem in mineral probiotic and adapteg in drink

major gulls were in working out they would say as you nicely a lisset outs before esthetic changes functionality and longevity but that one and three really kind of sit higher than most people would to perhaps even admit they want to look good which usually means they want to lose some fat gain some muscle in specific places i realize their folks out their want a gain a lot of muscle and its muscle everywhere but thing most peoplewould to have little more shape here a little more muscle there to either balance out their aesthetic or to accentuate certain parts of their physique and they would probably to shave off some subcutaneous fat although there are those exceptionallang people out there and they exist too i think it would be gain muscle in specific places lose fat and do it in a way that also provide some booth to their health span and longevity i would say that that might even be fifty per cent of people out there again i'm taking the liberty of of gestimating another been i would venture is interested in getting stronger and putting on more muscle certainly their number of people that are interested in doing that and that could be more muscle all over or more muscle with some accensuation to certain areous where they happen to be weaker or less less developed as it were and then the third been be people that really enjoy carty ascular work oh i should say the second been probably care about their longevity also but it is not really for re most ye i'm feel great now and i live to i'll live to be whatever but i only want to do it if i get that much muscle we know these kinds of folks iye do ron is whole and my class every year when i ask why you has all lifed and course i make them put their hand up you gas raund my clastering to put your hand up let you life twace and i ask why d you train health is long turn health is onolist and they all lie g'm any of you that selected health are liars your twenty to twenty five you are not exercising for health you are exercising you want to look a certain way or get stronger once you get past that undergraduale age though the actual desire to live longer and better actually becomes pretty real ye i think that there are peopl who want to feel better they they know that ave exercise and the results from excise can make them feel better the o that second been tends to be more focus on the esthetic change it seems wore being strong and then the third category think are people m i know a lot of folks this who really enjoy what are normally considered endurance type activities and here i just want a highlight again what you beautifully illustrate and previous episodes that you can gain a lot of endurance even using waights or machines it justands on how you use them right hatin's not about that the exercise about how you perform them and et cetera and you again beautifully provided all those details as to how to create endurance regardless om equipment standards et cetera but that third category seem to be people who enjoy running cycling swimming a hiking dancing activities that they can do for long periods of time that often will involve some sort of am skill that is based on improving motor patterns may be not much stride but i'm certainly for people thetter really love tennis people that am love a sport golf fright they want to be able to ni just laki they want tod walk the eighteen holes they want they want o have a great golf swaing et cetera i'm not a golf playerse or forgiving if my noman clatures olf s er three all r yet gol firs that golf ie got out you dn't play wlo yot golf you wouldn gol golf player i plad meatyour golf a few times that is about it oi stampered does have a beautiful golf course i'm told is shuld learn w plagolf i co co lay allray if you want you come up i'll play ot say how get me out i wol see it froug my lad category one i think is a significant fraction of people as we lay out these different ways to a sasscolls and as we approach the structure of a of a program as you will tell us if we could perhaps touch back to those every one in a while i again i'm takin the liberty of assuming that we will we will net about et eet a ninety per cent of people out there again those categories bing people who want to losome fat may be built sae muscle in specivicaries on their body and really want to be healthy they wnt a feel great and they want to have a long health spen ac and spend one live a long time feeling great second category people want o fuild more muscle and strength sure they do not want ta damage their health but th t's not their main focus their main focus is on building muscle and strength and then that third category of people who really want to do more endurance type work feel great and strong doing it but not because they can carry havy waigts while they are doing it but rather they can feel vital and they can push harder for longer and maybe even translate that to some ofthe more recreational type activities or sports tennis and things that are more long duration plaing stocker maybe even soft ball or things that yes sur ping soming althoug those three categors may we could call those been a bn s for sake of to day's discussion i think if you are willing to embrace ye a tha i think that will be informative toward our listeners in a way that simply not assuming what people's a different gulls are i might not be able to accomplish said differently hopefully by doing that am people will drive a lot more from the description of the program that youan no give us of it now i an certain that i want to let you return to your list of the five things that people need to consider when establishing a exercise programm ye greatless do that i also do ant acknowledge a point you have brought up acutely exercise does not mean just lifting weightes that is my back ground that isatis pen my time on i sorted the fault to examples in that category but it does not have to be that you have articulated plenty of other ways weyou can get amazing forms of exercise that that i've nothing to do with lifting wats for those folks in in whether was it been s or three i can ton the a we go a is again muscle loose fat be healthy now and forever pray been b is a get stronger gain muscle do not damage your health but not really focus on health in the immediate term and then graha been s is want to play or do endurance type activities and quortn't what feel strong doing it have more vigor to be able to do that longer and and maybe with more attention to skill et cetera and of course also want to improve their health what you have effectively done as you have given us three different avatars with three different gulls right the next step for each person or group is going to be to identify their defenders but before we get that we got a closes aloop on thi smart thing in each case they have either chosen that goal based on their personal preference or perhaps they dir our fitness testing frotocall and and realize they need to gain strangt whether the reason they chose to be in buckets b or a or see wat's because of our protocol ors is personal preference it really does not matter they still want to go through this process of laying out their gulls and making sure that again they are specific right im let us go through been see which is a great one you want to have a more energy and you wangt to feel stronger when you are doing your kite boarding you want t feel stronger when you finish your round of tennis round of golf game of tennis oh a gray that is a different strength absolt you see i hear i know you'r sang them amazing th at goald needs to be specific to that right it would be hard to make a goal alike i want ta feel better at the end of my round boy what that depends on too many other factors a better goal would be something this i want to be able to run this two mile loop that i do around my neighbourhood and i want to do it and have a lower heart rate at the end or i want to be able to get my heart rate back my heart would recovery back faster amazing that will that will probably aline with you feeling quotincle stronger with it riht i did the same corse in either i can do it at the same speed and it is not nearly ist heard or i can go faster whichever want it does not matter but that would be an example of a specific goal the other buckets you laid out kind of already half specific goals i want to get stronger will that that is going to be the goal the other ont is going to be im i want to loose some fat ok kat that is kind of the goal the sort of implicit in that it is the other people were eaud uslike i dont want to care about that i just want to be able to serf the great waves and the not feel exhausted afterwards are ight cool willthen you still should pick a metric that is not that activity may because it will not be within your control to pany on the waves in the temperature in oltestup that you can use as a proxy to say if i were to do something that represented me feeling probaly better when i serve what would that being its not perfect but it would be still as specific as you could get you still want to make sure it is measurable again this example might be something you can go to the pool and time how long it takes you to swim eightinter meters or something right it is a tainable n thn youll set a goal that is realistic and timely i'm goine o improve by five per cent in the next two months ok a cool that probably falls in the round andthen you are making the assumption that if you did that you will probably feel better when you go out to do your primary activity which to say serv im the really it is every time we work with an actual lathly that is what we do at least do not come to us to lift weights they do not come to us to get stronger they come to us because they want a play better and they wants the n the field more we were trying to convince them of is if you do this thing in the gem then that should translate into you being better at your sport recovering faster being less injured but it is still just a proxy and that is all you are doing with these other non specific goals especially when they'r performers bayscoals and we did not packate it that way but that is really what you talked about for bidn see there it is a performance ba skull i want to be able to perform when i'm in the field and my brain that is a sport and your brain it is when you are at yoga class it is the same thing i wee said this earlier in our series that if you have a body you are nathly i want to prepare your body such that it can do exactly what you want et to do you then get to have the choice of what you ask it to do you call it a sport you call it your saturday height with your family i do not really care it is the same thing you get control of your body performing the way you wanted to perform and that is what this whole thing is about great now that we have covered i think as much as we need to regarding assassing and choosing a gualm i want to get back this idea of identifying your defender you really need to think carefully about what is stopping you from hitting those gulls and you are forecasting a little bit you are also going back into your own personal history right do you have history of nee pain do you have a history of working too much a you have a history of a lot of travl you hae a history of getting thick lot what of these things tht are happening there to stopp you from hitting your gull o a couple of examples i've already laid out we do not need to go too much longer here but in the case of somebody who is in may be a been a right which is want to lose some fat maybe gained little ben a mussle oket what' stopping you from the strength and gadditioningside is it the fact that you cannot train consistent enough is it a fact that when you go to train you do notknow what to do is it a fact tha when you go train you traing and asks off in yout getting results o kat great all three of these differents an areos are going to result an different programms because they have different reasons your failing and that is really critical instead of just going i want a fat lost programm and picking one up off the internet it may not actually be addressing the point of failyoure for you the sooner you can choose your programs based on why your failing the sooner you'l start getting results do you have to run a little bit of a critical nowisis there and it can be now something scientific and could be a measurement and it also could just be youh thinking about you have tried this in the past and why did not at work i was not that interesting o ke tell me morne about why it was an interesting y just i'm not really in to machines and that is all i had o ket great or i loved it i love the jim i was at ani was getting results but it was far away oka interesting why did you stop before why did not work or if it did work in the past amazing let us go back to something similar but has your life changed at all is tere any different about now than when it worked three years ago yes no if not maybe we running right back if it is i gat work n a prsort of predict those things and you wnt to work a effectlly what i'm saying is throughout this entire tenstep process is going to be you want to make sure that there are the non negotiables that are in your life that ore going to be ahead of your fitness program and you want to work with those things not against them right cas life will win when it comes to your children when it comes to your job life is going to win you are gone to have to give up something it is goine to take some hard work but we want to fight the right battles for most people right even for our professional athes we get thus all the time soce to have nothing else to do but train right and i wll whll hold on now they are getting traded they have agents to de whit they may not have a contract they have families but babout it think life w'll get in the way i promise and you want a fight the battles that you can win not ones that yur going to lose and that is realy with this game is about if the battle is hay my job is superhactic o kay great word to come up with th different strategy that is more flexible maybe i'm still o to hold you o the fire im not coan be easier on you but were just not going to try to set up a situation where you have to do this work out mone day wednesday friday and saturday because your job is on the road and you are the provide all the the income for your family and you sho onc whatever the thing is right am that is what we really want identify when i say identify your defenders you need run a little bit of a critical analysis on this an a little bit of a tool i'll use for this is a maltification of another system i stold from cennycane which is we call a quadran system you can imagine everything in life goes into one of four buckets right now bucket one i'm jus gon a call business and this is anything to do with your job in com sort of all those things bucket two is relationships biginnis could be family or love light tak anything that we would call relationship social connection purpose bet o anything ither bucket three is your fitness and bucket four is your recovery one of the first steps we take is we walk through this wand we say allright you have ten points total and you get to distribute these ten points across the four areas not ten each you get ten total and s we walk though we say right now where are you giving your points and and we coan do this right now for you if you or i could make up a a cenaria do i do it tr great andrew a right now in the last months im if you had ten points total on thost for categories i'm wor where would you be distributing the most points which category and how many points o that be business it my work business work job sort of all those thing and how many at iten which does not i should say ever quite feel work i running laboratory in doing a the podcast does not ever really feel work in the traditional sense but it is career it is corret work it is it involves relationships but it is certainly does not enhance my fitness i'm eccept of my vocal corks and am and recovery a to with those a notes there a i would say am four or forty five you pic a five five far that is the most common number fi business five great once again i'm typical which makes me happy you nail one of the few ways ac i've been accused to being normal five for business mket what is the next highest and what is that score a am i do invest in relationships i would say ah does have to be around a can it be a t has a beltr a wholl intider to to all right or seven out o ten yere would you say it is fair that you spend roughly two and a half per cent of your is not a serly time it is energy time focus sort of all these things to and half times as much on your business as you o in your relationships it verys depending on what is going on an a feels a little skewed in the direction of business i might want to a just to a for three ratio there may be not ni am n a hold to five it to business relationships and then but just for sake of example and because iyen this is does not seem a exceedingly precise measure it can have some slop of course where would you put fitness in recovery i diffrntly put energy in to fitness unless i i only give that also at to it which leas one for recovery great that what you just laid out is again the most quin essential split you culd have in fact you run this game on everyone thate ging to come up a basecan the same ancer unless they do not work out or ar whatever right o get couple of rules here a recovery must be at minimum half of your fitness olication and your case to to one you'r fine a thing i say has to be half i has to be five out of ten points no is as it does not leave much for anything else i would it to be minimum twenty per cent of the total which means to out a ten ah now and when i say recovery i do not simply mean muscle i mean you need personal time you need meditation you need i injoint sleep you need to go to a concert and get out and see people and whatever the things it that give you energy back right some folks that is personal time some folks that social time whatever them you see you right yet i should get a lot of energy from my work drand it you now that is why some of these numbers are lo it you can always the kind os r a cloak that the underlying dynamics sot ohers what we do from this game we look at that we say if that is our split andrew five three to one the five to to one five five ton or two i'd love to be able but three in relationships just because but they w need eleven out of a'm right hereis the fun game we play your currentlly at this and you do not get the ad to eleven you have to stay at ten there your ten is different than my ten may be right but ten is ten lerist what ove them ack ton you can actually do it is you if we went back to our training gol whatever that goal was for you and we went back to our defenders we would look at this score now and say is three out of ten fitness was tree right fitness tos issu it is five to to our one is too out of ten sufficient to hit that training gol in that time frame you described and li say you said i want a hit a new p ar in my mile six months from now yet for it for simplicity's sake and also becaus it is largely tou i en to put myself in in i would i refer to his been a earlier great light a my bife a percentage is is o k it is it is in the rans good that i would what i would a to bring down a littl bit i ganala bit muscle here and there keep keep regain some endurance and certainly certainly my immediate long tern health or extremely important to mac grat then the question in the may answer may be yes that this is a the optimal split for you if it is not then we have to make a choice we either alter the goal or the time line to make it realistic or we alter our quadron and then if we are going to alter our quadran the next up is critleching import we need a list a very specific life actions that we are going to take that alows that split to happen if you said for example i want to put three in to relationships great what specific life actions are you going to take to pull one from fitness you cannot polmy from recovery or one from business and in it we do not have to actually answer this is youe think personal am i know you do not making the things about you cas rigt that is the other reason to do it and im it is at a diabolical trick to make e to insist of these behold into jeurs cause i would have done a four point five for gorsiness and a two point five for relationships but i you see you write thre rules on this not me you oud just walk that lests o cand unless could be something a i promise to not work after seven p m a thursday through sunday whatever the thing ins right i promise i im gon a make sure that i do not start work before a i m or you wa ba bu what ever right no more trips just make those things specific and measurable not us imin a work less that is never gong what is the very specific life action you are going to take this goingto be alarmed that goes off tuesday night at for five p m and no matter what we at barbl shruggd we used to have little shirt that was t three an see which is drop everything in train which mens that three p m the afternoon no matter what is happening we dropped everything in train because that was when you start a business in you are going thing just run away from you right iis ti sort man it is not my company but those gettue we are a strengthiistion ing company and we are not training we had to just make this hard rule in i jus a little thing that came up and it was easyes thay drop everythng in train three ofclock very goo i this a drop d a e everything a and and blank you co be drop everything and correct picture favo ntotally drop everything at read pick the relevant read ye absolute u no really miss reading for pleasure i would has under recovery and put dopt everything an breathe and wihat out and breathe you are getng o and breathe i'll sayng read i that too ye becuse for me reading is actually is both recovery and relationship im because it often times in in my relationships a insist not insistn i sernly did not sans ah ah we have had a form at of reading the same book in parallel all gray ye not shally side by side but the same book in parallel than discussing it is a wonderful practise for listening to the same audiobot yet u it works whele you can do droper thing in play you just goin goo to something conre can pyvidgames you gingto go play with de kid you are going to do what play e your dog you some does not have toe acton be played but play to you could signify personal time right it does not really matter im yet that is a i relate this drop everything and blank ium catid that you proly should not have more than what two or three of those over all pretty much one is the one the to maybe grace where you want to go after that the ideas then to redistribute the numbers on this list but through a very concrete action and i i this drop everything and blank because it speaks to the non negotiable haspect of it hascibe you it is life will get push n it is not a fine time to right correct it is not in next year i'm going to correct i love it yet yet when you make when you when you put those things those things you might as well just do not enpet on you lis rect is not n happen yet you are talking is somebody who loves rules because when they are not negotiable rules they provide this incredible organizing force for the brain yet it it is really a norrou science thing in my mind the hooi e and ashar we did an episode on happiness where you find that once people make a decision if they eliminate the possibility of other decisions li literally the hatches clothes that is it arn the boat that the thee the rates of subjective happiness immediate lontrom hapiness of r time go way way out yet and i'm convinced of the nervous system does not to keep the vawels on these dopenin circuits open i shaly thing it diminishes from the reward component there actually some date on this anyway i do not wan to take us off track but the last part of is what we do then is we take that quadron and we take that list and hen you aregoing to print it physically andyou'r gong to put it in to places i'm discact ion be on your phone you after prent you can screech in on be the backgron your phones every time you click on your phone you immediately see that quadron it is a very clear minder what er my priorities today write jus a simple little picture im i also to put it in your place of failure for lot people that is on their lap top ere right above their work sation ris the thing that is going to lose and bet your fitness is your job typically right or it is on your teevy it is on your net plict control not sarry neflects no fance but you are to me it is whatever the thing is t you fail for i play to many veou against great there i work too much look get grea and you put it there and you put it also the last componies it has to also be in the hands of somebody who can hold you accountable right wife training partner business partner whatever is sis hay andrew you promise you were going to do axt yourself why you still here you committed to this you got agan atic your some one whoill be none o it is drop everything in read it is eight ofclock youre supposed we reading you got a go m you get in a check bik in on that checkbank an every week check beck and it does not mattevery month and then you can adjust it is fined you canno eschange system but that has be now change you got a print ted new one and now it is a whole new promise you have made yourself you have got o be able to hold yourself accountable to those things it is got to bead flexible enough to where it is realistic it cannot be i'm nock in a work after six ofclock every day maybe it is just three days a weekmaybe it is on saturdays i promise to work for the first two hours i do not work saturdy night oh whate or the invers i'm not to work saturen you get you can come op a million examples here i'm thast the system we use to make sure that weave now a propery identified were we are going we have found a road map to that and now we know exactly how we are going to stay on track i have to take this opportunity to add one more thing to oure a drop everything list and you gave the example of dear which is may be drop everything and read or drop everything at blaxs or another example im i have to add a deal what tas drop everything and this is for you lacs love i shue one of the advantages of having a dog or having children is that im the drop everything and love is a often enforced by the faces of of the of those that you love they just show up in whatever space you happen to be is fest if you work from home i'd to take a brief break to acknowledge our spamser inside tracker inside trackers of personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood endy an e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors tha impact your immediate and long turm health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tastinty and ate us out there however is that you get information back about verious levels of lippids and hormones a metabolic factors et cetera but you do not know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what yoursippess ic numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behaviour old dews and donts what sorts of nutrisional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimol for you if you to try insade trackor you can visit inside trackor dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackors plans again that is inside tracker dot clm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off let us move on o the next one shal we noer three here is going to be what i call calender or sort of time frame it is going back a little bit in saying you have decided on the school and you have to identified the defenders now we need to come up with a realistic time frame for how long it is going to take to accomplish that col and when you do that you need to look at your life schedrul and what i mean by that is dou have important dead lines coming up do you have holiday you have a trip you ave travel do your children have something coming a a you need to take all tat in formation and i literally lay out a calender nd i write all those dates in a physical calender first and the reason i'm suggesting this is you want a work your training backwards or round that as we have been disgussing life will win if you try a plan a training programm that is five days a week ninety minutes to day and all the sudde you look two weeks from now and you realize you have got a grant dead line and then you have got a take two days to go to host it is just foolish you are going to fail and thn you' get a quit and your geto ak man again my training programme fail you need to figure out what a the non negotiables are in that business quadron and just not be foolish iright let us imagine you are gon to plot out say a twelve week training fayse and you wougt a you have decided on this gool and ten you look and and you realize in the middle of this twelve weeks spand we five is really hectic and chaotic or you realize that this is a quarter in which something important is due may be well on a either adjust the goal or what we really do in this dup is going on to actually stepnumber four which is choose the number of days per week you can exercise and the length in terms of amount of time you can truly afford to train i would rather you under estimate that then over estimated you gain you look at the calenter you put all these non negotiables the dead lines you cannot move in the calender and then you say look based on this realistically i can conservatively train three days a week for sixty minutes total and that includes the time i walk into the gem my warm up my down regulation breathing at the end and then me getting back either in the shower and back as really now it is may be ninety minutes by the time you travelled you transition you picked back up on work you showered you a et cetera that time just runs away from yo n i'll sai it as a two and half hour thing youven nowws a forty five minute work out you really need figue that thing out if you are a few weeks in and you realize who actialy hav little more time than thought you can i s train more you do another thing you can add it but whit you do not want to do is set up a program that is requiring you to do certain exercises on one days or certain styles of training on another and then you constly miss one of those days i thought i could do fortiys a week but one day a weks uptons and pulled out that is just going to keep you offsceduls can i make you feel a failure and you get a run into problems with your training scedrl three if you are sure you can get three and if there is an extrday we can always do other fon stop that is really stup three and four figure out your life events over the course of this time how many days a week can you train and how long in terms of minutes por work out notice we have not selected a single act ercise yet we have not worried about how heavy rest inrals all tas modifiable variables you do not need to pick those later first where are we going second how are we going to get there which is the quadron and t identifying of defenders and that the third is what are the restrictions i need to place on myself an terms of prorgram as ign based on how often and how long i can work out that is going to allow you to go back to some of the previous upo to sods and go man you gave us all kinds of ideas how do i know ich wen to choose this is your answer you are going to choose spaced upon the limitations of time and frequency if you have alredy said wherein let us imagine wherein bucket e or bucket see it does not matter and you go look the most i can afford with where i'm at with what is going on an my life is three days a week wll we automatically know where can have to start training choosing a training style that is limited to three days week do not you worry about the four or five days ut those are off the table and now wer out we we have placed restrictions at conti goes back to that concept of i think it is one of your podcast gu's jocko rightis s a structure gives a sactory some freedom by creating some restrictions here where a little more free to go i only act you have to choose between ayand be rather than saing down agon man there is all i'm twenty hours into this exercise po catingn thos only options wieh twing to pick well you create a little bitt restriction and now it is easier to go y only option is ar by and there we go that is number four that is three an four at that point once were good there now which you want to do as go to step number five which is actually select you'r exercises or your movements and this can be a simple as select thing a you now a kettle bell swing or running or swimming it could be your entire exercise mote which you want to do with exercise selection here is make sure that your balanceing those exercises across the whole week not what then necessarily every work out if you have four days a week five days a week you want to look at the exercise selection in soke i need to have somewhat of a reasonable balance between movement patterns or mustll groobs or front an backside o side however you thinking of it just to cross that week again say where on a three day programm and were in either of the buckets any the bucket's realy and we say o cak great and maybe s not ideal if all i select is cycling every day that is not a lot of balance i do not noticing there is no upper body work there there is no torso work there is no other position maybe onmen a really folks son cycling saw i will do only cycling two days a week but that third day i need to pick something for the other movement areas and askingto make sure you say in a reasonable balance if you have an exercise tat you great if you have exercise you av access to again maybe the gim is a giant pain in the ass and weu can say look as too far away the closest one is forty five minutes there back maybe omin a restrict myself to only kettle bell and bands and running ause i can do those in my house asson we have actually created some freedom because we give ourself some restriction and now we jus have to figure out how my going to give some movement patterns somewhat balance across my three days really when it comes to exercise choice it is selecting the patterns that how to execute giving yourself against some one of a balans between the muscles in the joins and the movement patterns making sure that you are specifically targeting any muscle group or movement that you want making sure you you wantin improve muscle sise and your gloots you better make sure somebo thy exercises your doing at least one day a week youre feel it in your actual gloots you can check that box it does not have to be every exercise it probably should not it does not even have to be every single tday but make sure its checked off somewhere on that list an the last one is is there a strategy in which you can progress it if you are i'mdiscin to do body waight exercises oll get great or how areyou n a progress those in the case body waig is its really hard to add load maybeu can put aweight vest on or something but then maybe do not have that i that is an exterthing or that coing go sofar what is my progression strategyu gan to be wele this case maybe you just increase the complexity by going from two legs say a body way squat to a single leg squat or you distinctly st re petitions are you increase time rou an ho what my point is your progression stratagyo will be based upon the restrictions that you place i based on afailability and an things that the last thing i was recommend here in terms of exercise progression to make sure that you can continue to do these things while lowering your risk of injury both in the short term and long term is to progress your exercised complexity in the this fashion make sure number on you can do the exrcise properly with assistance let us imagine is an area where we are going to try to squat i give yourself put your hands on a bench or something that now can you execute that squat perfectly with assistance you are holding on to something ol get great if you cannot then do not progress pass that do not go now do a barble back squat if you cannot do it correctly when you hav assistance but let us u sto most people can do that o get great now you can move on o the next step which is can you do it well without assistance this would be body waight only check coolk for good there ok now you can go a head move on can you do it well with an added ecentric load in this particular case if i youe fore leaning toe squat we can do it well when i hold on to something that is great olkat now i can do it well wit its my body weight now if i put a little wit o weight on whether it is o kettlebell in the front a gobles squad or dunbills the side or whatever you o toto can i lower and go all the way down and stay in perfect position if you can do that great you are allowed to go the nextup which is can you hold i symmetrically can you go all the way down and then hold that bottom position what you do not want to do a start adding load or speeg or fatigue if you are going down to the bottom position of the movement and you are out of control we really want avoid it i want you to show me you can go down and you can lower the waighe under control you can hold it in that position under control if we are clear there now we can add the concentric portion right you can now go ahead you can lower it you can hold that position of most danger ad i can move up at whatever speet we want we are all good there once you can show me those things you can add the last two steps which are now speed if you choose to and i'l ast one which is fatigue right i would really discourage people from doing exercises to fatigue especially with a moderate or high load unless you can promise me you can do these first six steps if you can you can base could go hog hild with your training and your chances of injury are ar very low again both acute injury as well as long turm ingery which is just sort of my joints ache and i'll send my shoulder herds and no things that un that is realy what i'm looking for and once your clear there you can train pretty hard ireally this because recently i was showing somebody how to use say in this case it was a hack squat machine i knoice that they were a very timid of getting a into a deep squat position and they cited a previous nee injury which is long since heeled right but even with proper footplacemen and everything you just tell the they were getting a ginger about it as thay they approache that bottom position a but over time with pauseis at the bottom they become very comfortable and now act ieare going well below ninety degrees at angle between a a femeran and a lower it was clear that it was not it something range omotion limited or it was just it was a mental thing but a logical one for them now after what you just said i can ga better strategy a that i could have used would have been to have them get into that position just no weight at all they be nothing on the sled and then slowly working up from there i supposed to u'm doing what a we did in our case which was to i just convinced them that they were much stronger than they they thought they were itwe eventually got there but i realizing that there was far too much a mental anguish involved in that process yet this whole progression by the way this cannot all happen in one session if you can check the boxes in that example you may been find a jump there it may have just been a hay your fine here get get through t ok this whole progression might take two yours mit this really depends on your back ground yi f you actuall have injury history youre comfort your confidence ac all the sing you do not need to worry about rushing through that progression you donly need to get allay the end if you do not wat especially with ospeedthings that but again it cannot happen it does not have to be wellse ta month of this monthenogh if they feel great and you can go through one to seven and five minutes than you'r god to go number six number six now is just order how many days per weeker can a work out how long they are going to take you have selected all the exercises you need to get done you have balance that across the week now e as neen to put them in order and the easy answer here is generally do what is most important first in the work out there is some miner interference of fact of some nother things there but reat the reality of it is if you do the priority first you are probably going to be o key whether this priority is a mustele group in the example you want to make sure your glutes get train maybe do it first if you are trying to maximise your back squat you may not want to do a bunch of glud exercises to fatigue first but that is not the priority we picked we picke the differn on which is bucket's abein see o ket great by doing at first you told me the priority was to make sure i do something for my glutes and then i would also to get my back squato let a bit stronger or whatever e fine the same thing could be done for your endurance train you could do your endurance training before you are lifting if you understand that means you might be compromising you are lifting quality of the work out a little bit but you might be fine of that if you see the endurance work is more important now amazing you do not know the answer to that though if you had not gone through steps one through for and that is why those things are critical it makes what we call chaos management which is things happen in a moment i do not now what to do what should i choose that decision becomes really clear because you can always go back to beginning go my priority was this then therefore that is my choice to day it provides a very simple set of instructions for when the work out gets cut surt when your work at has to be the hotel and any number of things at pop up in real life whether again you are an athlet or non athly either way life will get in the way at some point you need to have rules and a sistem that says when this happens i go right back to this and that is my choice done i'm moving on no decision to make here it is already been determined a week ago five weeks go we are often rolling the order again is pretty simple just put the one that is most important first now i know you to do legs on monday that is great i actually love that too i i do the same thing generally because to me that is almost always the most important thing if i miss o bice a work out i'm probably fine but i really do not missing the big movement patteron i make surethat those happen on a day that ten to be more stable for me mondays are generally pretty staye things get chaotic as the week moves along for me others might be the opposite right others might want t go hay i'm actually gon to keep monday is my flexible day or off day because i to get a lot of my work done get that cleared i cannow oh ho sure iwork around you some people loved to train on saturdays causissor most free some people hateit sore you tell me what is the biggest prirty and wendy you the most fresh monday tuesday it does not matter depends on your work schedul may be y worked tha week ands idonno ayou decide what day of the week are you generally the most consistent the most consistent schedul and te most consistent energy and do the thing that is most important on that day it does not matter monday tuesday day oneday three am we are sort of talking about the earlier but you actualy only in have to do a week schedul our brains tend a to go year month week but a lot of folks will even just run this thing in turms of a seven or nine nay scheth on fact we ran on nine day training schedule for one of my major te basemell players and he is eight or years in his career and he is hitting all time pars and velocity he is very very good and it was a nine day training psyche i ran that for the entire i season it does not have to be a sevenas but but it ten s ta work for lot of people cause most people have a fairly consists of schedul across the sevendays pick the thing tht is most important do at first and do it on the day of the week that is most consistent for you from schedul and energy i really what you are describing i should just say that one of the readons i put legs on monday is because i tend to get enough sleep on the weekends i generally get enough sleep during the middle of the week but often times things will come up i can be pretty sure however that i've quitin c caught up on my sleep on the weekens the snosion of catching up on sleep is liottle diay scientifically but ten to be pretty rested by monday morning an and ishal my week begins on sunday and sundays are when i get my long form cardio those two are really non negotiable and the reason that long form cardio is on sunday is that it can take many different forms he can take a heiht with ha awaited vest it can take a the form of a jog it can be done with other people it can be family time it can be time with friends and on and that is pretty hard to do during the middle of the week or pretty hard to insure at least for me i also find that by book ending the week with some non negotiable days of training on sunday monday then if the week gets busy tuesday wednesday or even sometimes thursday with traveling things that one can sort of catch up toward the week and it is not ideal the me niaculte spaced out but really this is not about what i do this is realy just to underscare the principle you described which is i have a very clear sense now over youn three decades or of training and three decades or of o being involved in academics an science and work o when i tend to be most rested when i tend to have some flexibility my schedul and also when i'm trying to combine fitnests with some of my be social engagement which is icually quite fond i whon thing i not is that an the four boxes that you mention before work relationships fitness and recovery some of them you have some cross over they all do we kno with family or friends is both relationship and fitness and on ah but i love the principal ah because anything that can add consistency as you pointed out is going to greatly increase the probability of reaching one chools that sort of an obvious one but in an earlier episode you also set something i wrote down and is really still bringing in my mind especially now which is that consistency always beats intensity correct ye absolutely we used to do a thing ah when i was training anda fell players for the combne many years ago were saturdays we are supposed to be they day they came in and we did the most regeneration this is when they get body worked on and we do hot cold contrasts and sert of all these things and our ten din soas one percent nobody showed up re massage a nobody showed ut well seems right but remember love a good missage of course but remember youre eighteen years old you are likely to be getting millions of dollars handed to you in the next few weeks or months and e's ot refering to me by the way a i'm actuly quite a bit older than eighty a and a'm not getting handed billings of dollars itree rrect i would think that but those folks they recover superfasc if never they had that and also friday night e kind of entice ting and nothing was there and the stratagy then was what if we instead of having a important hard training down saturday we transition and it is only things they wanted o would we base identified what e the things an training you love the most and less yo those saturdays and it turns out for those folks no surprise here it was what we call the gun show they would come in t the jum and we would literaly do nothing but biceps and triceps they would just get a pomp and in the deal was though you come an an literly would come in as we would pic three guides say you you and you you pict your favorite bycep exercise you pict youre favort hon you pict your favor on you three over there you pict youre favourite tricup tric up riep and we just run a big circuit likes just ulike how many reps i i do not care how may tht i do not care jislike pomp away li conninon care right we shows small mussle groups not reing nt interfere with much were training them for the na fell cambine which is it is not a it is legs perform spacecy rint sos if they smashed their bycep and trceps on a saturday it is nock an influence what we did on on monday recovery was nota issue once we finishd the gun show theug now you have to go do your regenstav if you need cara work you yu'd phiscotherepet whatever you ging to do we would get them in the building with the low hanging frough and then we would actually get them to do their work you can do the same thing and i honest to do the same thing i tend to do either a if im wan to doin up er lower slit i'm gon i do that stuff or either friday night ore saturday because it is very difficult for me to do a hard long work out friday night i or even friday morning for that motterthe same thing saturday i wake up and snon whit is it is family mod as kid things i want to do stuff iman but i can usually convince myself to be i just goin there go twenty minutes and get your upper body stuff time i i can i could walk myself into that mentally it is harder to walk yourself into your five sents of five dodlived its sort it is wo i are not get that o me right now my high intensity intervals the max av i do not have that right now i'll either go for my long steady stay stuff which is i'm in i'm gong on the bike an rine down on the beach or coming back naisa only i can get myself to go fer by cried that whnt what i pick the thing that i im likely to do on the days where i'm probably going to be my weakest conqi not physically but motivation wise i i free for a long time i friday it just got stocking away where my harder stuff was friday nights and i'm just whate why mi doing this i was having a fifty per cent successorat just we are having a no percent successorat with the nof valgis on saturday you have to be a little bit toug you have to grine sometimes you have to you do not get some motifation go after but you allso have to be ll this is just stupid planning ri why put yourself in position where you are just failing over and over and over when i could move it and go look those sessions or going to be things that are easier i they do not require as much got stow to get up and get them done i get those things done ninety per cent of the time jaus the worst case i can be our when i go to a family than give me twenty minutes i'm jus can run a ther smash oper body and you do not need i need a twenty men t warm up i's i can just gon to jump into those things if i had to if i feel great then i can still go to something else or i coul do more i do longer session but you ha youre your sort of immune to any situations ii would book in those as i guess as what i'm saying what is the day you can have the best day and what is the day you generally have the worst and and put the programes around those situations ouill of the idea of identifying the friction points the high friction in low friction days iction meaning anything that impudes you from training consistently or well and there are many factors that ratched into that sleep other social engagements to work you kno friday ni i also find it tough i to do any kind of training i do a cartivascular training i do interval tipe training on on fridays tipically but there is a lot of a cumulative fatigue an strass that happens across the week t an usually for a long time i cush more than a decade now i've been telling myself that saturday is the day that i tried to a reduce my court is all as much as possible for ther there hav en sundays the day that enjoy that low court is all state and that tis actuary what opened up into the long slow run i she to think of myself as a bit of a mule during those yn runs actually have a shirt hat has a slough on it that i wear to re mind myself to go slowly on those runs not that i ever run that fast but is the whole mind set around it is to be a bit of a of a mule just kind of moving through it and the fatigue factor is more one of at first is 's a lobit abord im but then i've noticedthere is a whole different set of mental scapes that open up under different training types and this is may be something get into libit in a future episode or discussion ou when you train really intenselee for short periods of time one way your mind goes into a particular state when you do long duration training your thinking and and indeed even the way it affect sleep patterns is also very different i think one of the great futures for narrow science and exercise sience in collaboration is to identify how different patterns of physical movement relate to different patterns of thinking and vice fir sa anywet tha something may be just a youre mark for a future conversation but there is clearly a relationship there yet yet wel when we certainly know of a pretty clear relationship between a even what will u classifi is own five exercines and deep sleep as own five again being a your breathing a lot through your mouth because you have toing order to bring u in enough oxygen to offset the cidity created by the c exactly yet this is the high heart rate sight a i ma if you get a look at it n and hit a number a looking for something la thirty pluss minutes a week being in a the top ten per cent of your heart rate that impacts sdeep sleep is gon in positively inpack deep sleep as long as it is done very far away from deep sleep see do not want to do that at night you want inindian terms of time a if you hit those numbers earlier in the day often time sevle on hand seep sleep i was looking at some papers recently and the number that that a kind of emerge from those papers was that unless it is low intensity exercise trying to exercise about six hours or more away from your sleep time would be ideal now that said for those of you that have to hit the gem or go for run in the evening and then are trying to fallsleep for to six hours later i would not want that statement to impede your a regular your regular exerciseing yet thos is there is an easy trick that just finish it with down regulation breathing it it that is sort of one of our things if you cause tat is a realistic situation i finish wore gat five or even six and then by time you are your training or running or whatever you one o call it yet it is a seven thirty eight your home at nine you are eating and then you cant eat two hours before bed pretty soon you run into a number of different collision points yet thit make you wonder whether not you are doing everything wrong or if it is really worth training it all hont i would argue it is better to train the notto train yot it provided that you can still get o sleep honor per cent you have to walk a littlebotof the game we run o this issue ath an bea players rit you'r playing games at six ofclock an ni a start maye ti baseballs seven or five seven ten pit right and also by the way or changing times ons every five day right you have see fiders and a such were usually training twice to day there is no option train wer i mean we are training twice o day i always we have to come up a strategies for thatn there is other nown out thes canarios of course worse there is no other optioner cool what we do is a couple of things thaner one that farther away you can make it from sleep the better if possible we do need to train though around the same time you are going to be plying that has to happen the harder and longer we go in the training session the harder and longer we go in our down regulation post exercise and that is in my estimation the number one lever you can pull that can help right now if it really does start crushing sleep you aregon a have to make a critical decision there in general it is not a good reason to not exercise but maybe you restricted a to only a couple of days a week you go all the way up and intensity and the rest te days maybe seventy per sent you staing this kind of a workings on also am maybe it is a longer down regulation maybe thise other strategies you can do but yet you want to be careful of aand we have had the situation a number of times where it sort of dislike sleep complaint sleep complains sleep complains we run full sleep studies on them in their house we do the whole thing with absolute rest we come man we do the whole thing i tracking by le markers the whole thing and it is oh you dis need a stop doing intervals at eight pm ight ten not would add to that u another intentive for being able to train with or without kaffine is that is very clear that even if you can fall asleep after jafsting affne in the preceding hours that kaffine consumed in the gash even twelve but really you not eit to ten hours for hours prior to bedtime really distrups the architecture of sleep if you critically rely on kaffine in order to train whatever your training might be and that sleep is important for covery well than its pretty ovies for i am going with this he aso having that flexibility is vitally important yet you have probably also cover this but a you can actually measure that directly by i tracking patterns you can aching identify the effects that kaffin has on sleep independent of a sleep time or not ight there never positive effects correct a that is said i am of proponinive kaffine early in the day a and kaffine does have it lot of u mut antid narro degenerative of an as longs you are not getting anxiety it it is pro performance both mental on physical performance of course if you do not need kaffine if you are one of these mutints at do not need affine in order to go about your daily living ah with focus an intensity than by all means a do not startticking kaffine i'm not the hug ust fand i am scientifically honter pers on a board personling it does i do not do well on it will you seem to ride a little bit more what we will call ou a sympathetic tone a kind of shifted towards more alert i tend to be a naturally a bit more my bulldock costella was a lil bet more on the mellow sleep beside and kafin just puts me right at that alert but calm non place and i can get away drinking it a i wouldt say ridiculous but fair amount of kafin and remain there but i do restrict it until the time right up about two p m at the latest is wen when i'v trying drink hafi number seven great never seven ond eight or pretty simple this is now choose the intensity and the volume we have discuss those at length in the previous episods we probably do not have the time to go back over all those details remember the adaptation you are training for and pick the propriate rep rang total amount of cents as well as the intensity then get the corresponding adaptation i all you have to do is select those things in terms of progression thor a week the rule them we say for intensity is something around three per cent per week right for volume it will depend on what you are doing a little bit but any time you cross more than ten per cent per week you are going to start running into problems i five per cent better it does not need to be as low as three you can jump up much more than that five to seven per cent us better if you are doing a say running is because the numbers make it easy and you are doing ten miles per week total if you were to go up to eleven miles the next week you great you are ret around ten per cent but what you would not want to do is say am running ten miles this week and i did may be for monday three whensday three friday four three and three get your ten then you would not want an ad a mile every day monday instead of doing four i did five wednesday instead of doing three i did four friday is are doing threated for you would jactly it is youwent from ten to thirteen which is a much higher per cent jump than the ten per cen perscripe the same thing would be true for lefting waights the same thing is ectually true for calories tryin to ad them et cetera the body tends to not handle those things as well jumping more than ten per cen pr week keeping with this idea of increasing progressive overload bein ten per cent more over some period of time am i correct in assuming that i want to identify one may be to meaning for variables and progressing that were those variables progressive overload can come in the form of any of the modifiable variables you could increase the complexity of the movement you could increase the intensity or the load you can increase the volume by either more cents more repts or more total exercises in a day whut about time under tention you could also manipulate how that the temple of each repetition you cold also manipulate how many times per day you train you can manipulate frequency you can also manipulate restinables you can progressive you load any of these things increase intensity a run a littl bit faster complete the same amount ol work slightly faster i'm put five per cent more on the bar bell or the load or the handle or everyging to that is a simple way if you want to think about volume in the case of endurance work is simple milige time whatever and he case of lifting all you have to do is take the amountof repetitions you are oing per set multiply it by the sets add that all up if you are doing three sets a ten that is thirty repetitions if you did three exercises you to sted ninety repetitions put that number down for monday put that number down for wednesday put that number down for friday add that total up say you did ninety ninety ninety you would look and say mind total a number of repetitions this week is two hundred and seventy if i want to go up five per cent then i need to go up another fifteen ore total repetitions great that is all we have to do that is the increase you may keep the load exactly the same keep the exercises same chan nothing else but you one add fifteen more total reps for your week and you may choose to do that by adding one more repetition per set close enoug last week i did three such a ten this week i'm going to three sets of eleven it can be as simple as that a can it can be complex i walked you through it can be any the modifiable variablest but the progression i just laid out is fairly simple and it is honestly the one i recommend for most people just because it will avoid confusion and it will avoid people taking massive leeps an volume the typical strategy i would recommend here is increasing load or intensity or a little bit of accommonation slowly fer about six or weeks and then taking what we generaly call a deeload back down may be seventy per sent whatever that number is you have been doing you did three such a ten and you work yourself all the way up to three sets of fifteen back that down and maybe will do two sets o eight for the week and then will come back the following week and go back and do the highest we have done now all the sod n we are gong to do for sets a twever or something that if you get these little deeloads every the pending what your oing for to eight weeks or you should be in a spot where you can continually progress for very long time without either burning out or overloading in an over stressing an injry paterent the simple way pick intensity or volume and jist go up slightly evry week for a short span of time genrally around six weeks and then you come back in an change your strategy if you because you mention sets and repetitions here sone to remind folks thet in the episode that we did on strength and hypertrophy and thet also included speed there was a description of a terrific programm for strength which is the three by five program or three two five programme as it is called which is to select three to five exercises performed for three to five repetitions three to five times per week with three to five minutes rest in between those exercises for three to five sets and if i recall correctly the proto call for generating hypertraphy muscel growth is to perform a minimum of ten and probably more fifteen to twenty sets per muscele group per week and that can be done in a single session per muscele per week one could train for instans a quatersets one day per week as long as you are getting that volume of sets per week or to be divided up cross two or three different sections for that individual muscele group of course people are going to target all ther major muscel groups in hopully some of them minor muscele groups as well and as i recall the number of repetitions that can generate hypertrophy is quite broad anywhere from six repetitions al theway up the thirty repetitions but by the end of the set it should be two failure or close to failure with good form is that correct yet then we would say close to failure i is probably most appropriate you can actually reac failure maybe on a few of the sets may be the end and probably best to chose that with the exercises that are of safer not that any exercises particularly unsafe if you do t appropratly but you may not want to go to true failure on every set for the more complex larger riskier exercise a hedgepretty clops to failue r non all the way and i realise i forgot to mention rest intervals between sets it follows that if a large range of repetitions are performed that a large range of a rest intervals are allowed meaning the there could be rest intervals between sets of as low as thirty seconds between sets or as high o two or three minutes depending on the loads that one is using and that of course ou will scale with the number of repetitions it excellent in fact that sort o leads me into a step number nine of designing oun training program which is you have decided our goal we have worked our calender out we figured out how many days per week and how long were to work out in those sestions we then went to selected our exercises we balanced them across the movement patterns in the muscele groups we need er not causing excess of stress on the same exact joint or muscele group over time we then ordered our exercises based on priority i because of that we have identified our goal we went back and we selected the volume which is the repetitions per set the total amount o sets and the load per set that matched the goal that we wanted to get or the adaptation now all we have to do is fill in the rest intervals which reflect back again the goal generally higher rest intervals which means time that you rest between your sets higher some where to between two to five minutes for things spee ed power and strength perhaps a little bet lower although as you mention it could also say high fripertrophe and and for endurance you follow the rest interful that reflects the type of endurance straining that you to get that is walked us through one through nine we are almost on we have put together a pretty nice little protocall it should be well rounded it should be effect if we have also talked about how to progress it from week to week keeping it within again four or six weeks maybe up to age before we then take a back off the very last thing we have to do to make sure this training programme is costomise to you your goal and your situation which is then going to anhandsrou likelihood of adherents and consistency as well as increase the likelihood of effectiveness is we just have to do a little bit of what we call caasmanser we just take a quick moment to think through this programme looks great but if i had to nit pick yet where are the possible chances of failure and you just want a sort of think about where or where would i predict things would go wrong and if you anything pops out to you try to come up with our solution at the beginning and this could be a number of things maybe you have picked an exercise and yu realized man ar really actually to that exercise or maybe look at the scedl now that is lay on front of you you look at your workscendal on your ah maybe thats a bit agressi do not no could be any a number of things but it is a useful exercise to just think through everything realistically i typically just it is the atage i teach my gradual students an before we hit submit organ a sleep it is there s tready werecan to take twelve hours an wake up the next day and look at it again and go are we sure we are good here yet make adjustments if you need if not if youe a confident then hit san and cross your fingers ye we were forind o submitting the manuscript ah it is interesting you say i have a a statement that i always make to people my lab they yit submit now i say that you realize your going a wake up to morrow morning there is going to be an emal in your in box that something was form added in correctly in your going to spend to morrow reform adding and submitting again i ave also learned that ther that every project is i y o proi to not di o the truly to no not times you have done this a many dozens of times and then there is also another a truism of a science which is that there is the project there is a sign of ra question and then the paper is yet another project and i ushur think this is analogy that carries over other other domains of life i think that any time we take on something if we want to write a book ore we want to get a degree or we one at a on fitness pregram i think it is worth thinking about those decisions as i sh two ticking on two major things because one is the planning an organization around that thing in the others the actual performance of the thing and i see that yecaus here what you just described this yon ten steps to to consider in designing a programme thin some people or real list makers in love an the precision in the thoroughness at and i'm one of these people thinking this is great i just one to check off each one of these things on the list and figure out the ideal programme for me ar given priod of time et cetera d then other folks might be thinking wet that is a lot that is just a lot to do but what i know with certainty is that performing those sorts of lat's just call them what they are those tasks of a figuring out what is what where the defenders are et cetera without question makes everything go much more smoothly once you are into the actual a performace the action of doing the exercise programme or the book or the podcast or whatever it is that you happen to do im u'm grateful that you a brought up a both the things that act as condu its for getting good worked on and this notion of defenders and a en bottle necks because if we do not consider those i would argue that is a very low probability that any one will succeed but when one does consider those even just a few of them i think the probability of success goes wayway up immediately that is actually a very good point a that is a lot of work for a lot of people and i know when i'm consuming information it is helpful to hear structure and systems and design it is also helpful to hear actual realife example maybe the next a thing we can do here is i can just walk you through an entire set up in in a programm am considering folks titter in bucket a beincy and maybe al'll save a litle to the explanation and will liminate mesto backr nd i'll just walk you through what this could look right i created a programme which should run about a year and the idea here is that this could be an ever green system one could check off all the boxes that we have talked about in general we hwant to have three primary gals with exercise we want a look a certain way whatever that means to you we want to be able to perform a certain way whet ther that is for life goals hiking and energy or sportgoals or whatever and the we want to be able to do that across our life span o ke a programme that gives you all the goals we talked about and i programme that covers that health combine that we referred to wray back in some of our earlhier discussions which as a little bit of ree cap is what are the physical fitness perameters that we know are critical to maintaining both life span and wellnesspan and as a bit of reminder those are things your grip strength your leg strength you'r total amout o muscle mass you are actual speed in power tha you can catch yourself from a fall your veal to macts and your physical fitness i wnt a programe tat thist little bit of all that ats similar actually n we are cot a crossing barriers between our three buckets i need to be blic control my fat i nee you be able to have enough muscle that muscle needs to have anoug function and i need to be able to maintain range o motion that i do not lose flecibility and get heard and then i need to have a good feal to macs as well as to be able to sustain energy over time that was the goal o my progress now a couple of other things that we have not chattered about which are very important you have mentioned i think on a previous podcast about the importance of seeing light is this something you have covered at one point another tat i'll be agoing into the grave and they will be shoveling tir on to me and i'll be telling people what ill tell you again now which is to get five to thirty minutes of sunlight viewing as early in the day is possible i dealy from sunlight that is what i's call sunlight were from bright lights of another kind if you cannot get sunlight and a'lso get that in the evening and then avoid bright lights between the hours of ten piam an for him unless you do shift work in which case teck out our upe sad o shift ore mazing we have got a little bit of ajuxa position where people i need to work out into o the straining but that a'm also supposed to be outside how do i blend those two things in my training programme cool i check that box as well i built that in the last thing here is we have talked about structured exercise and just in this episode we have really opened up into nonstructured exercise hiking sports things that well one thing that is incredibly clear and a my colleague and friend tommy wood at the university washing in published a fantastic paper very recently on the importance of proprioception in maintaining and staving off late onset dimensio and aporcanses maybe just remind you what proprioception wiye absolutely there' structured exercise and that is very important but then there is also things balance and cordination and properoception meaning you are adjusting to stimulie coming in from the outside world this stimulie could be sound could be light could be smell or in the physical case the body it is where you are at in space i'm feeling i'm falling to left therefor youg to correct and move back to the right you do not get this with doing things a hack squat on a machine you get this typically from being outside now you are smelling in seeing things and you are also not landing with your foot in exact same position on an even platform we get this from things sport now not only exercising but i'm reacting to the outside world the balls going over here my opponents going over there it is very important in my opinion yo have at least one session per week of exercise in which you are doing something that challenges proprioception right how do i fold all of these best practices an to one train programm that is not two hundred hours a week seven days a week that is what i've laid out tyo make sense coo let me walk you through it and then maybe we will come back into each individual category and you can ask questions ab them the way that i think its best is two have a goal and have that goal be a round eight to ten weeks long wick we have been talking about what i gaye you is let start off with quarter number one of the year perhaps january through march or and it does not have to be this one but just as an example you decide your goal is going to be to put some muscle mass on we are gin a prior of ties adding muscle kay now with in that you are gingto be bolking up ading some muscle but we are also going to be sleeping more we know we need extra recovery in this session and we need to go up in callories now this happens to work nice for a couple of reasons but in that protocall maybe werging o do seven days for seven sessions a week o physical activity does it mean seven days but maybe those sessions or something i well do one indoor sport ah this could be baskable could be any number of things right i got my sport chicked off in its indoors why i'm im january to march the weather's probably not great for most of the world i'm not going to o do as much outside activity i'm n to do weights may be three or four times a week and then maybe two days a week i'll go for a long walk ga again we will come back andi'lexplain you why i made all these individuals paces it you run that for the first quarter at the end of this quarter an i take a dee load week now this could be fully off maybe this is when you scen to a vacation maybe this is backing off maybe you just keep your walks in and you spend the extra time when your family or worker whatever else you we have bolked up a little bit we spent twelve weeks adding some mass now were gon a transition into quart er two which is where we start to actually get lean this is actually a pretty spandard a body bilding temblet which as you put on some mass first and then you get lean after that now we are gon to get lean from april to june we are in a bring calories down a little bits an hour actually in a play in a highblcloric state somewhat the days tend to get longer wore ganto have more time to spend in the sun ore gan a shift a little bit from an indoor sport activity example ie aid early ast baskable to maybe stand ap palaboarding or some other thing where you are actually getting your sport done you are reacting use in prop reception but now you are getting that sun and their as well because you have a greater opportunity actually do and the weather probably is ging a co operate with you more often than it would and say february you then may begin to pick a fitness are an exercise glass a yoany number of of routines where yu're with multiple people and then two days a week in addition to that you are get a maybe lif some weights rih now weve that as some muscle now we have got lean and all the sudden we are actually looking pretty good for the summer time interesting ri quarter three july to september will transition and we will try it to g get into great carty f ascolar shape we will transition more into some high intents the intervall type of stuff mor frequently i wergn a maybe stap matenan's galleries now we spend a little bit o time hyper and w when hyball an hourng to go back the maintnancs and and keep it long wergin an continue to choose some outdoor sports but maybe you change it up maybe you keep the same one i maybe maybe now we switch it out in gall or nowwe pick a pickaball or we pabaskbaba now we just do it outside any number of things you do right i'mso maybe even we do a couple change it up you do that twice a week you spending more time in the sun now i you looking outside nd you'r seeing this great weather and you are not cooped up in a gem but you aregetting your physical fitness in that is also going to be aiding your high intensity or your inevall your conditionin culd you'r doing more stuff that rather than lifting intogem and then maybe your action in to do some track work outs maybe we will do this on a bake or we will do some hill sprence outside any number of things and then we will do that may be twice a week and hen we will still lift i waits twice a week in ourgem the last quarter then is gon to be october to december and we are git a transition there in do mor pure cardy ofascular fitness ok because we are doing that we are gan be working harder and remember cardy ofascular training is generally expelling much more callories then lifting eregan act you go up in calories we are n re turn to that and that works out kinde well because i do not know if or not but people tend to eat a little more callories from the months of sa november through december you holidays and at least in northern emmis here colder temperature toto maybe even we play with two work outs to day here we are trying to get really in shape or try a inprove improve our conditioning in our endurance and multiplareas we'rg an act you transition back into an indoor sport maybe we are ging to do some kickboxing or a gugitzi class or something that wergin a aybe hit the cardin machine once or twice now we are hopping on a star master o vers oclimber or maybe getting a salt by going something that maybe hits tome machines and do oure lifting there maybe we would spent the rest the earlier part of the year on barbells and dumbells will transition to some machines and then we will still try to get outside and walk twice a week ok and wek that gets us our outside activity but if's not necessary a structure programs ye i we got o fifteen minutes where the weather's breaking a little bit es walk get outside get a walking an riht that is the over alstructure of everything i would to act youl go back to the beginning now and can a walk through each wentes things in detail and explain why i chose certain things i ave kind to given some hente already but i think it be helpeful to to walk back to the beginning and start there great i love the over all structure i have just a couple of questions the idea of training mostly for hypertrophy january through march n make sense followed by period from april through june focusing primarily on frat loss and then from july to september speed and interval typework and then october to december you put to emphasize endurance type training i fought for a moment that when we got to october december you were going to emphasize strength and i'm wondering whether or not there is any incent it or training for strangth october december that hen one arrives at the hyperturifry training january through march wer that much stronger ah the idea being then there is more muscle to hold on to as one than tries to lose fat from april through june and then july through september is the speed work or is july through september the speed slash power phase of the programm the july through september would be more your higher heart rate learning to get all the way up maximum exertion and in recoveryg and october to december is long form endurance moderate to longfarm right it is closer o that a robe a capatity stuff it is closer to longer duration and moving through that spectrum i'm you are a stute in pointing out that i did not have pyour strength really in there you certainly coud folded in but quite quite literally if you spent tas three months bulking up in january march that is going to bring some strength along the way you should be fine there but you absolutely could alter any of these veriables imif you wantedto emphasize something more than say you actually felt you rant the fitness tusting and you identified actualy your enduranceis pretty good but your struggling may be with a little be strength and may be a little bit of lor musslemass you could substitute quarter three or quarter for and say one of those quarters will be strength and then i'll do all of my conditioning in another quarter and what you have really done is the programming still fairly simple you have just alter the priories a little bit and therefore you have altered the adaptation across the year and why this is really port this templet is meant to be something you can just run back year after year after year and you make a subtle change that and now over the course of five ten twenty years you are going to be in a fantastic spot at the end you can make easy adjustments along the way as priority's pop up as gols pop up but you are going to be in a position where everything is that there is nonething that is can be lagging behind you' bein a good spot most of your basis are covered to be prettylean have a good amount a muscle and to be in great shape two other questions one just a quick question forsake of a genering propraceptive fee back ah during the endurance phase is trail running at a good e good option absolutely crit i'm thinking back to the days running cross country is october december your trail running totally train for endurance oget the ground is not supersolid which is even better in this case right you are making more choices and trying to not fall on your face absolutely and then you mention bulking up and i just a wanted to a high light that im there are some folks myself included while i'd to add a litle bit a muscle herer there i'm not interested in overeating to the point where i lay down a lot of body fat stores along with than i think ther a lot of people out there are not nesurely intereted in quenni bulking up i also a my understanding of the the literature an tell me if i'm wrong is that well there does mee to be some sort of cloric cirplus mabove what is required to maintain bodyweight in order to build muscle that many people who tryind cuotin bulk up basically just and up expanding the size of their their cheeks and face im a long with their limbs and you ore a i'm not trying to poke fon it but the idea of deliberately over eating to the point where a lot of body fat stores come along i would imagine tht would just make the april through june face that much harder crand i'm not sure it is ever been study directly but i cannot imagine it is all that ha t seuse me all that healthy to bring a long a lot of atopos tissue im in one's pursuit of of hyperture yet you are absolute crect a we have not gotten into the nutricional details there but yet thank you good clarification by a couple of things you are not going to be doing this very long it is twelve weeks iit were not going to be sixoterunmies yo a number to just since were here declarify the literature is on going in this area and there is actually a handful of studies that i i knowr coming soon but in general when i say hyper cloric here i'm referring to increasing coloric in take above base line by something ten to fifteen per cent if you normally eat twenty five hundred calories hroughout the day you might add another two hundred fifty to four hundred i'm not doubling calories i do not want you to be stuffing your phase hating food filling owful all day and then putting on half of your weightis fat and half your weight is is muscle it is just tachnically hyper cloric becase you are eating more which is an absolute requirement for most people to add muscle i am some folks who have a high percentage of body fat and a low level of itness traying can actually get away with just being either isycloric technically or even little belowver and still adding te muscle wil ers in fat but for most folks that is going to be challenging you aregon to want to be in a hyperocloricstay another reason i put it in here it is because remember people ten to make these extra calory choices during thi s part of the year annuays and your sort of playing into life is why chose that right is hay you cannot restrict calories all the time it is really really hard maybe if we can put it calory restriction during the fases of the year that sluiteas here and give you the freedom to have a lit obore calories derin the pase the year when you are problic and want to o that anyways just make sure you are doing a style of training thats supports that you ging to be trying to add muscle when you are going to be adding more calories we are ging t be trying to really push the pace on our conditioning when we know we are going to be eating more calories sanis and that is actually in fact exactly why chose those gulls for those times of the year it is because were we are now playing into life a little bit more but we agan certainly do not want to be eating to an excess were were it is a causing some of the promis you mighth we just need to be eating a little bit more the last point here is the next phacse april at june we know we are going hypocloric it is always kind of nice to go yet we are gong to going a little bit of a calory defisit here but it is really just these few months and it is ka because iave spent the last six months where i was not restricting that much and then one actually where i got to yeeld atla bt more and now cool not hard for me to convince somebody to go we are to bring calories downright now a're ing a months and two months and and is sis can be just twelve or sixey wee frase r what every one i being in there those who are some of the rational a that i was thinking of what i decided do that but thank you that is a very important point and terms of the hypoclarkates it is not the dirty book it is it is not the excess hat that lot of folks will do an and on just a final point for folks a in the southern hemisphere australl and wer in e south americans we i shud have a a large listenership in the southern hemisphere of course adjust accordingly even the the holiday months are still in i eneovember december there of course holidays all your of gon sf for mi any of the major holidays are around november december but it is summer down there a it just adjust accordingly hat there is nothing wholly about trying to achieve certain adaptations at certain times of year it is more about trying to eliminate bottle nects a defenders as you mention and it is really about the sequence if we go back to that first quarter we aren a try o ad some mass for the reasons i just described right a it is also tends to be pretty motivating you are a start the year off you can want a train and get all excited because of you new years resolution and your gunnisy results immediately we have talked about this in some f the previous upsois the nice part about hypertre training as you see your muscles growing right now we are the endurance stoff tends to have a little more of a delayd gratification min to give you a win early e now we are also going t be sleeping more because we know and maybe we will get ints in a future episode that sleep its absolutely critical to recovery and critical to growing musclemous you aregoing to emphasize sleep more during this part of the year also because the sun is very low it is harder to sleep for lot of folks longer when the sun is out for longer especialif you do not have a perfect black outkard and you just trying to play with the restriction's life gives you an otimis your cenario the sun's probably not ou t very often and especially depending on where you live if you are anywhere where i grow up in the pacific north west it is going to be dark and gray and gloomy most the day it is not hard to convince you to go to sleep a little but more often well do that that is also again why i chose an indoor sport that activity e yyou can not shoot yourself in the foot a being in the jim when it is cold and crafpy outside is is not thought hard to convince yourself to do you can be lifting your weights safe for times a week and then again getting some outside time in the form of a wak that you can do it the mddle of work if you half to are are catching twenty minutes here there whatever it needs to be a the chances of you missing that walk are little and you will still get some outside time you can you have talk about the importance of getting sunlight in even if it is overcasts o you can still nail all those blocxes in being a pretty good spot at the into that quarter oh e moving on to cart or two than april to june a lot of people ant o look good during the summer months you are more likely to be outside you are more likely to have your shirt off because it is hot because you are in ar on vacation are going t beach let us play in to that a little bit let us let people look a little it better if that is what they determined to be looking better during the months when they are more likely to habit you are also more likely to have things weddings aover the summer time people do not get merried often in the winter and people want to look good for these events let us play into what a lot of people already want and let us help you get leaner not a lot of holidays tha involve eating during that phase and you are not an if you your missing out on a ton a life outside of maybe if a few smaller holidays in that face the days are getting longer and wre gni choose to get in the sun more off than we can start getting a tan better we can stare getting ready for som er and that is is why we exchange our indoor sport for an out door sport surfing i ging a cycling outside whatever the thing is you want to do there is tons of em kite boarding thats atscafe boarding there you go you ovts are scating a little bit whatever it nees to be wu do that once a week or and then actually threwin a fitness class here and there is a couple of reasons one now it is sort of nice to take the pressure of programming off it is also nice to if you have been lifting by yourself to get in there and lift of somebody else it is also nice to now have some social in or action a the game offication the group the scoring stuff that happens to fitness classes is very very powerful it tends to be somewhat fleeting it will not last for a long time for some people others it does and if you pepper the ting in and you can you join this activity class even if it is not great and the program design is not perfect it is fine for ten weeks in fact you may may really really enjoy it and also again gives you us it gives you something new to think about music is on you are out o your house if you are lifting at your house you arean a different part of the gem the scendals little tighter se you cannot disgo work out when ever you want you got a sort of show up when the class is going you probably find that you just love it you also get some social in ter action right which is something that is also very important that we have ourwe discussed yet if you are out playing baskeby by yourself or what not this is just another thing i'm trying to fold in that still allows you to check off moultifl boxes of things that are healthy for you you have had episodes on the importance of social connection or action we talked about that in the quad break down of making sure you have relationship time an things that throwing into fitness glass and just doing honestly something quite different it is pretty fine but then still keeping two days a week where you are doing at traditional strangth training thing you have some coquality control there lastly you can also then make sure you are hitting any specific movements or mussle groups that are very important to you do not get to control that in your fitness class but now you can least do the gem and make sure you hit that mussle grou that thay yo have interest in it now we are we are feeling pretty good rolling into the sumber we are pretty lean we are getting out the son a lot we are bringing catalries down a liv it and we probably or feeling pretty happy were also not burnt out we have done a lot of fun things and we have checked a lot of the boxes off for for long turn development we had a commination of specificity with exercise selection but we also e folded in just a little bit of variation we do not have to worry about over you sendry of doing the same machines the same lift months and months and months after months an and slowly wearing down something if our technique is not perfect gape now we are go going to our quarter three which is the summer months basely up here at least julyto september we will transition it spen a while since we have done some conditioning i we may have lost a little carty a respiratory fitness we may have ou not feeling greatly more i may be energy throughut the days of o starting lake down were gon to get tin shape we are to push our heart ragt high and were ge to bring the the calories back up the summer time i forth o july other holidays this were eating is involved maybe you are going to sporting events and in things that are our sport choice is is o often going to be a out doors but in fact what yofll notice yereis is i've ramped the sport choice up to twice a week and in fact i'l encourage you to do too different tipes of exercise and one of the primary reasons for that is to spend more time outside a challenge we often see with people with exercises gone man it is nice outside i cannot go sent the gim for forty five minutes i do not have that much free time and the he remains over here taling me i need to get direct sunlight morng howm i get if it descent we will do you exercise outside enjoy it e you lived o n here us you take sonshine for granted but a lot of people i noits it is only nice for two and half months the year get outside let us push more of our fitness training to outdoor activities these sports cannot be intents or not right it could be go out there and swim hard gin the ocean you can do open ocean swimming instead of swimming in the pool indoors or whatever the case may be we aregoing to give ourselves more of a priorty of being outside looking we have look pretty good or little tan and we are enjoying all the benefits of training outside and the lack of structure still we have structure but not sole specific the machines in the the weights giv us maybe even now we are doing some track work out now we can do something sprent the straightaways walk the corners and we do not have to gan do our conditioning on the same stare master er machine or or whatever we are on wor gong en joy someself that we are gon to be athletic we are got a run eregin to move we have not talked about that yet right everything has really been abouch sort of structured exercise we will now we are ging o do some sprint work we are gon to get out and see thatwich is of really important human quality that i think is important to not lose is actuiability tos friend we will do that and then we will still make sure we lift twice a week for the same reasons i talked about in the previous phase we make sure we have some quality control there we maintain some of the muscle that we built in the quarter before we do not lose too much strength there is very good literature to suggest strength maintenance can be done and as little as five sets per week for a very long time really up to eight plus weeks iif you do littlebit you you are touching in enoughtere ye not can it get really really week but we wat you would not want to do is go twelve or sixteen weeks we are you lifted no waigts and maybe that in great shape at you gingto feel very week after that maybe that number c come nown to one time a week if you really wanted it to but one to two days a week where you are lifting the big exercises the muscle groups ind movements of interest and you are good to go then lastly we role int our final quarter which is october december and we are going to really get in great shape the sunas starting to come down we are rolling into the holidays weatheris getting worse we may have other out door activities we want to do and my case a're going on a hunting trip we have some travel conferenceis whatever the case may be and we are going two choos an indoorsport and i yi love combat sports ad the example your earlyofis you git to or you maybe just transition youre baskall t inside or you'r pickaball comes inside or whatever it happens to be and you are stil gan to have that twice a week then maybe instead of the track work out outside you do that same work out indoors now back on some sort of machine or something that our weights or action now down to once a week becase we are really pushin the pace on cardy of asker we are doing once a week to maintain it an not lose and get too far behind but we are really want o drink bring up our viel two max we want to bring up our ishency our cartyac output and everying that and we are still gin an out walk twice a week we get something outside and i talked about lyag in it is nice to have that flexibility of not having to train outside cas no get warm up and do all the things just get ot get get a walk in you sti get the out door experience we runto that entire thing and then you to start back the next year idealy again at the end of every quarter you take a week off whether that is a true ful week off which i am fully in support of i mean friends were only talking about four off weeks a year that is absolutely fine i'm or could e be a slight deeload week if you wanted to be we should not run into two many issues of over use we have a lot of variety we get a lot of movement patterns in cause we are mixing in sport with machines and dumb belve we are mixing in social in oraction will mixing in the sun we are mixing in enjoyment we are mixing in fant lost strength i pertrife some carty of asker endurance were mixing in calories in i we are mixing a little bit a cawlries low and we are trying to hit as many these nose as possible if you also wanted to cut each one of these a little bit short and repeat your fitness testing at the end of every quarter you could i would probably recommend doing it at least once a year perhaps doing it may be the third week of december or you run that testing that is your last week a tranning than you get to go on your vacation brak you come back the beginning the year you have got new goals new targets an you go if you wante to repeat it twice a year do the same sort of thing at te end of june it is fine i know i lad these out as quarters which is generally twelve weeks with one back of week but if you wanted to make it nine weeks in a testing week in thn a back off for ten weeks it it is fine its it is close enough the last little thing i want to say is lets assoon you are doing the twelve weeks and you are going to have a back off week at the end of the twelve weeks i would actually still then recommend having at least one back off week half way through you oe look this five weeks hard where you'r progressing you going up up up up up every week yofr either increasing volume in tensy we talked about you manuce ago then week six deeload go down to seventy per cent volume intensity come back go hard for five more weeks and now we twelve is your true off week where you again take the whold thing of if you do that you now have four weeks a year ere you are totally off you have four weeks a year were you are really backing down and you just have five week sagments all your round where yu're jistcing to push at hard for five weeks you ge made a break you gan a resat eager transition a little bit now as i started this conversation off with the there are many weegs you could structure your training programme throughout the year and hit those primary goas we talked about of looking fantastic feeling amazing and being able to do that your entire life all i can tell you though is i know this model works because weve done this a lot with are clients in our rapid health optimization programme and this spans everything from twenty five year old folks who are competing in the boston marithon to a lot of individuals who have never exercise before who maywe have done a little bit of exercise in fact its quite literally all three the buckets you laid out we have had cliens in all those areas both men and women young and old and we have had a tremendous amount of success transforming our lives using a very similar model to what i just light out i find that over all structure to be immensely in formative and i'll tell you y in the context of a number of examples myself although that is the least important of them francly a but examples of family members of mine and friends of mine who undertaken consistent exercise training programmes but that have not varied the program much and here again i of the person who really loves to swim they have a low barrier of entry to the pooler to the ocean they they love beng in the water i am not one such person i being in the water but i do not motivate to drive to the pool when a bite to the pooler to get into the ocean that often once i do it i enjoy it but for me it is running and lifting waigts and it has been for a very long time i've a family member closerman member who does not really quitical exercise but loves dance and dancing going out dancing yes but dance classes amaze particular really enjoys it loves to be distracted from the fact that she is doing exercise and just really enjoys it in actually is very good dancer despite the fact that she is am related to me and on and on they are many examples i think of of folks that fall into the different bens that we talked about earlier but that also tend to default towards a given structure of training one way and doing that throughout the year i can tell you riht now that i'm personaly going to modify my scatual according to this a four quarters per year it actualy works because i've mostly been on the quarter system in academics for a very long time i was at a universily had a som aster system once but this quarter system is ashy the one that we follow academically that is one reason why it is a a natural fit for me i confess that i typically do not vary out the a proportions of endurance to resistance training i tend to keep those about three in three across the week three resistance training sessions three let us call them cardio sessions but each one desine to achieve a different adaptation and iv now alter those even further based on yeur a recommendations in this episode in previous episodes but what i have not done is to really think about deload and to really stick to the structure that i set out to accomplish across the year on the topic of deload for me the deload has been when i get overwhelmed with work or i've gotin sick i do not tend to get sick that often but every's once son whi'll get nock back with a cold or a flew once every three or four years i seem to really get hammered with a fever inducing something or other and then i'm bedroon for a couple days and then i'm back at it and i tend to come back rather slowly and that tense to be my week off a but i'm beginning to wonder whether not part of the reason i hit those streaks of being overwhelmed by sickness or my stress is that i have not done a deload peritso one of the the things that i'm going to immediately implement is a periodic deload according to the the programe that you described and i'm also going to start matching my specific goals for each quarter with time of year i do not think i've done that and it is not because i live in california id by the wayfolks there are temperature variations and amount of light per across the day variations an californias well although they are not as dramatic as they would be under the north pretty harderinsense right of course someone listeners are at the equator they have the opposite in any event i'm i'm defily going to do that i'm going to startin corporating regular deload a periods and i am going to be very a dedicated very disciplined about sticking to a programm for three months devoted mainly to hypertrophy then a three month programm devoted to fat lost then a programm ta to i'm a robic output and then one devoted to endurance although i i must say it is very tempting for me to do a very specific strength dedicated portion er because i i do not tend to be particularly strong i'm not week but i'm not particularly strong i might i might a consult with you as to how i could a very endurance and strength in any event i love the idea of a mackro structure and i love the idea of deloads in anticipation of being able to go further the long running terms of results i'm hoping this next year cause we are just on the on the cosp of a new year will be the first year in which i do not find myself getting am some bugger virser whatever happens to be im from time to time an having to a back off on training for that reason and that promps a question and it is something that i want to get into n more detail with you when you describe recovery no coming eposode but couple of quick questions may be there some short or shortish answers you could provide if i'm not feeling well a really had a poor night' sleep maybe just two to four hours of sleep for whatever reason trainer do not train that is the first question second question is if i'm starting to feel little bit of a throat tickle im and i'm in that phase of denial ik i do not get sick i'm not getting sick and i would i be better off bundling up some hot liquids getting into bed sleeping lo a bit more i'm at sete r a and protecting myself against that or would i be better off training and if i and then the third question is if i've already sucome to a bug but it is not a severe bug i'm i do not have elevated body temperature no fever i'm not hacking up not not productive caf for anything that but i'm feeling jos rind of not well head coldish i innu sort of thing comes to mine and it is not seasonable alagies train or do not train leaving aside the point of weather or not i'm in a position it get anyone else sic cold i besee that is about idea o gan a lack of sleep an i would say a thirty to forty per cent of one's typical sleep the previous night train or no train starting to feel one might be getting ill a and then the third category is a coming back from from young sec thanks and sorry for the extended question but i want to make sure there was enough detail there rexciting these are three commens inarias we are going to cover that in the recovery conversation that is nex in detail and i will give you very specific guide lines and will have a plenty of time to to going to that the quick answer is it comes back to what phase of training your in now to walk through each cynario if it is a chrommy night of sleep and i am in a phase of train in which we are trying to cause adaptation i have a lot of space in my scadual and i'm really using this time to make progress because i know coming up soon my schedulll change and my time to train will go down i am still training i might use a bunch of tricks that we have for feeling better instantaneously we te call these little hax these are acute hax these are not chronic hax i'm into push the pace if it is really close to a deeload week say it is wednesday andi start my delo next week or this is not one bad night of sleep this has been four bad nights o sleep inthe last five days this has been six kind of crommy nights over the course of last nine in your starting to see larger pattern and that is a different answer the question we are going to ask ourself is is this acute or is this a tenensy or actually chronic thing if it is acute and we are close we are gon a train through it if it is acute and we this is not a fase of training or trying o really push then maybe we we back off a little it if it is the opposite though we need to probably make some changes and give ourselfes some recovery this may include anything from a moderate training session maybe i'm a o go in the son a and sit through that and indue some breathing drills in some mobility stuff oh it great maybe i'm goin again go to the gem and and ride the bike at fifty per cent aret right something restored if my thac give you lit tle bit nergy of a doezen't beat you down that is probably where were learning i'm if you'r feeling sick and you think it is it is coming i'm probably going to do option to as well which is some sort of restored if trainings saginness tends to be moderate could be waights could be any of the stuff may be you can go out for your swim or we are not going to push past probably about seventy percent we can absolutely induce am you no suppresson with excessive training and you may want a walk out of that i'm the last case which was i think a phase number three you said there which is sare i i got a pretty narly cold right now am i gan train im most the time for most people i'm disconn say to shut it down get out of thet right iif you have nokin we all to get productivity done there you may be better off either going and sleeping catching up on work doing other stuff that the next time weu go to train you do not feel behind and we can give a good solitifor for ut i know other people who will trin right through it i'm i tend to not to be totally frank i if i'm feeling kind of junk yam i'm really nock in a train i may actuall probably a do some hot hot water imersion bath jacoosy things that i i ieshly those better than i sona if one is ill or you dislike them better than sonit o a both actually oh my yesh person ever it a ever met or unon the spodcast e say you basin jacusy more than sana ye absolutely i'm i may endue tome mice prbably not a tumna cause you g ger to be careful there that is a big stresser and if you are already over the line you may be adding passer i'm or i may i may go sleep if i'm if i'm feeling very very very sleepy and sometimes depinding on what kon of of bug you get that can happen i will just sleep i might be the best choice you have if that means you kick the cold half a day earlier then that then you just one in the aggregate im that those are probably it is a little bit of insidt of the ouber than that i'm running with those things those are highly informative answers thank you and i look forward to our discussion about recovery that we can go into even more depth and how to recover the last thing i do on a say here is kind of going back to our quarter system the examples i gave with the bulking up losing fat and getting into better fitness and carn of askravatis ogan those were jussamples friends please do not take that literally if you want emphasized strength more put in some more strength if you anto emphasize a different one of our nine adaptations great do that too if if you are somebody who is has a lot of body fat to lose then may be put that for two consecutive sessions or every other you can modify them im we have talked about nine very specific training aptations as well as in fatloss i only gave you for which is just meant to be a sample that you can roll in or out but use those prior ties to adjust that system according to what is important for you now five years and then forty five years down a line for whatever that may be fo you are absolutely free to modify the order you'r absoly free to modify the primary outcome and then adjust the specifics within each quarter based upon what is needed to do to optimize that outcome i think maybe one more tool we can offer people is maybe giving the individual week a littltle more structure the system i laid out of sort of month by month an maybe we can lay out say a threeday week work out programm an a for day a week programme that would still it some of the same well rounded adaptation that probably covers maybe not individualized perbucket that we talked about abian see but its con ot cover seventy five eighty per cent of what would need to curn all three buckets and ten you can use ot last twenty fy per cent for your individual goal or specialization maybe we can jump it that next great lit is erit the first one i want to give you is just a basic three days split that again same i dea is a well rounded exercise programme i act you wrote this all in an article that is on expeteesewebsites perhaps we can lake directly that i will just jump you straight to the answer you can read more about why in details in that article if you but did this is day one day two day three you could do these days where you split them up actually having say twenty four hours and between all you could do these back to back it does not necessarily matter in this particular case say day one you would start off and do a little bit of speed in power andthen you may finish that with a little bit of hypertrophy now if you want ta gain more speed in power you just do more of it if you want a maybe just to a little bit to touch it and you really want a gainst the muscle you would do more otan insist there the templet can stay the same and you would just increase the amount of either adaptation the speed in power stuff or the hypertret based on how high it is in your priortalist those were combine together because as we talked about earlier they do not necessarily interfere with each other you would do the speed an power stuff first because it would not hamper thy perchfe if you did the high perchfe first in that work out it would probably compromise your speed in power in that case you would actuly not be getting you aut optation e day one you do that and that could be a twenty menute work out total or at two and half hower up to you then you would come back maybe the next day or two days later whatever you to do an your second day of exercise you would start off with a a pure strength a protocall and you would finish that with when i'm calling just a higher heart rate this could be something our anteroba capacity stuff it could be the a robe of capacity something where you are getting up to close to high heart rate it could be those twenty second birst at could be a ninety second brist five minute mo rebeat anything you you culd distorde plog could play this and you are getting to a spot now where you have had a little bit o speed a little bit of strank little bit i pertriphe and you have touched a high heart rate weu've checked off most the boxes already intosessions our last session then would be more than a steady state long duration in durance and a three day weeks but that i's going to be a pretty nice set up for the average person this coulbyamunday wency friday tuesday thirsday saturday what is happening on the intervening days totally off if you wanted to be i set this up as and the best i can give you andies three days o gake rat if you have more we ced certainly improve it but this was my worst case an aire you i've got other things in my life the most i can do for exercises three nexst week and given that its three days for how approximately how long or each of these work outs going to last i would do whole body exercises for almost all that i would do your full body parts and i think you could certainly finish that in forty five minutes of worktime little bit of time to warm up some down regulation at the end you could be in and out of that gim and certainly under sixty minutes the realliitiys you culd probably be out of their under fifty minutes the total work time coul be thirty thirty five once you get gone a'm it is three days as you twenty out tham probably more work for week is going to be better in terms of am maximising goals of etetic goals and a performance in hancing goals and a lunch havity goals for it imng the the numbers that i've heard that is that we should all try to get somewhere between a hundred fiften probably more a hundred eighty to two hundred minutes of zown to cardio per week minimum but as i recall you consideris own to cardio low intensity that a just walking around in is you no qualifis as zon as really iszon one's own too cardio yed not to take us too far off track but if i gets actually useful to differintiate what i concern to be exercise and physical activity physical activity is out for a walk iit is yusing a walking tread mill and why you are at work it is you parking farther in the parking ot and taking more steps these are all importantand what is clear you are not going to reach likely optible health by only exercising hard and tin sitting around the other twenty threean half hours to day it is very very important whether you want to do that in the form of zon wanter's own too and hit thirty minutes a day avarious organizations will say things that you need to have thirty minutes day of moderate lointensity exercise i'd only cre youyou can combine it that if you want what you do not want to do is just physical activity only which is almost always going to be zon one the maybe's own to you also do not want to go the other in inspectrum which is again i left hard three days a week and t e what do you the rest of time nothing that is not optimle either and i guess the system i've i walke you through here ear the example rather i walked you through his you would need to maybe supplant that with being physically active if you work yes say you are nurse and you are on your feet you are moving up and down you youe probably actually covering a decent amount if youre physical activity cause you might be at fifteen thousand steps a day if you were sitting in front of your computer and you do this same three days but you would probably need to goody or a to make sure your adding a munch more steps and you might need to add several hours of walking to hit that hundred and fifty hundred and eighty minutes a week of physical activity because the program i layd out is you no if you are doing really forty five minutes treetis a week maybe sixty minutes at best you have hit one eity turming on sixty menutes times three hundredy week you might actually need to then throw and maybe some more specific walks you could do that a number of ways could be again actual structured exercise it could be simply onmine to do attenment walk three times ta day it could be the exercise snacks that we talked about in a previous sepso there is lots of ways to engage in more physical activity but to me those a different oftentimes instructured exercise i think many people will appreciate that you put out there for us a three day a week protocall because many people simply do not have more time to exercise they are putting emphasis on these other on bens in the quadron and you'n frankly those other bens are very important as well a wonderful that out people can a checkoff some critical boxes for esthetics and performance and longevity wit three days of work were work outs per week i should say what are some other schedrils that people can follow if they are willing to dedicate a bit more time toward their fitness sir if you wanted to do another sample of maybe a forty week and again to clarify this is omerly happy you said that this is this a fourday week of structured exercise this would not account your physical activity moving om which everybody should be absolutely maybe this is something day one you are going to do a straing thraining session and you will stay in the five to ten or repetition range a little bit of strength a little bit of hypertrophe you have checked off a couple of boxes probably whole body you get all the body parts covered or close we are looking at generally multi join exercises could be commination of barbells free wats bands machines anything that would be sor a day one you could come back the very next day or you could wait twenty four hours but the second day of your exercise would be maybe your long duration and this is actually sort of similar to how you set it up it is you dolitbe the invers but wut you'r cind of thing as i'm probably goig to be a little bit sore from day one and i do not have any free body parts that are not sor instead of trying to do another lift or something i'm disgin a put in some restorative lo ng good duration sof same exact principles frong duration we just talked about could be a swim could be any number of things could be your sport could be you'r out and write the bike and go for a jog in the sun what whatever you would to do a if you are feeling better maybe that is little harder longer if you are feeling pretty be that from the day before it maybe that is a little bit shorter and slower you can modify it then maybe you take the next day off or that is open your third day of exercise is now instead of being that five to ten re petition range for your lifts you do something eleven to thirty reps range also this could be exchanged for something more body weight more muscular endurance type posff this is a great day maybe asioga maybe it is a gymnastics thing you are working on or anything many other styles of training that are not you quon't co lifting weights but they are not just wocking in hiking a could be a polodies or a cuivalent anything this were youget to gets the muscular burning there but's probably not any additional weight outside a bodyweight or if it is it is fairly minimal you five ten sort of fifteen pounds something that would be nice could also be done in a circuit we could hit our high heart reight and we could hit is the muscular endurance and there crup activity class might be nice here youven maybe something a spin class or a dance class all these things could be great and then maybe you even finish that with ten minutes of some lite weights to hit is the body part you say did not get maybe did the dance class and then you finishind you do ten minutes of upper body set's a thirty to may sure you get yon ice pomp there becuse your legs probably got some work during the dance class but yourperbody did not see a balances sis tem out a little bit all body parts got a little but a musca endurance your heart rate got really high came back down and you sort of checked both of those boxes now it is important to remember the hypertrophy tepisode doing sets of say fifteen pluss re petitions per set is as effective as doing sets of five to ten or twelve for i pertrapy gaining muscle it is not effective though for strength gains you would not want to do this only because youd really be doing nothing to improve your muscle strength and you want to make sure that that box is ticked at least a little bit then again you could take the day off after this or you could roll right into your fourth exercise to day which would be your lass exercise cession of the week and you would do something more a medium intensity this is a little bit higher intensity than our second day and this could be something you non shadow boxing your hitting a heavy bag it could be little bit of higher intensity intervals but not all the way up maybe this is you ging to do a one minute on one minut off on the bike but you'r only o to go to eighty five ninety per cent heart ray and then instead of going off during that one minute you drop it down to fifty per cent we ould actually look thirty minutes of straight work but you would have a libit o rolling intensity i suppose to staying really nice and recort restoretive it is goin to be some work there and yu would finish it with something five to six minutes total of maxhart ratstop which lines up perfectly with that number you actually a created in our or en durance episode of hitting six minutes total per week of maxim heart rate or close you could rap that all up kind of into one session you could do those in the inverse order thorough warm up a few minutes whether you want to do thirty second birts or a minute burst or straight five minutes this is a a protocal i to use a ton on the assault bike you simply a good warm up ten minutes solid warm up recover and then i ing to go five minutes and cover as much distace as i can in five minutes brutal it is rudal in its amazing and you ti you get a lot done in five minutes ten minutes on the back of that is a very gradule bring back to earth there i actually in that case i do not need you do down regulation breathing cause i'f tents i've spent ten minutes actually coming way back town and the last two minutes or of that is very deliberate five second inhail through the nose five second axtaile of the nos while i'm berely just moving and you may not being a brigo spot that again time wises could easily be done in thirty minutes and you be rounded off there the nice part about this forty a week split as well as to three day we explatd is it does give you little bit of flexibility and what i mean is maybe monday your plan is to do the day one left and then any number of things popped up in life you shipped it back to tuesday rather than saying monday is day and then i'll send something happen you miss day it is just you doing these things in order and you would to get all four done and a seventay span but if it does not happen fine the next day you get to work out you just go right back into the next work on and it does not matter what day they land on exactly i for the three day routine that works very nice because he is sumption there is you really only have time for three work outs a week and that sort of implicit is there is probably some chaos happening in the schedual little bit and you do not you do not really have the ability to lock in three days for wee get that is not the case you can go but we are trying to listen to the pain points that people have with exorcise and see if we can give them some solutions for those several things about this programmer attractive to me a one of them you just mentioned which is that by not rigidly attaching individual workouse tis two specific days of the week h on in theory could say o k was i din't get them much sleep last night i do not feel i know that lovyou will say what what is feel but i do not feel recovered or mingto get that much out of the the work out to morrow i'm or to day i'magist cannto push it forward a day the the abilityous lide work outs forward or back by day think i's incredibly valuable if at for the consiscencys sake i also really this idea of some of the long duration wore coming a day after hitting the strength and bit of hypertruphe work this would be the the day too one thing that i've experience over and over is that if i'm very sore in a given muscle group especially my legs doing some low intensity cardio whether not i's a jog or on the bike a typically for me it is a jog or even even skipping rope and then walking skipping ro n walking does seem to dissipate the soreness i'm sure there is ha mechanism for the hasis mcansm get everything frankly but i i that arrangement and then i also this idea of making sure that there is a a work out for muscular endurance because i feelike unless i've been stuck without a good gim or i'e decided to specifically train body weight exercise which i did a few years ago i got really excited about some of povlsutsolan here work greate is a mal the naked warrior which does not involve training naked although i suppose you could if you want im it was really about no waigts and involved building up to pistol squats in one arm push ups and things of that sort even doing pull ops on doors and i've discover that some door frames are much stronger than others haha in the hotels i accidentally i cause some damage there but in any case i muscular endurance i think is a really interesting one that i plann to incorporate into my scadual but that is a i think i's one that is often overlooked unless people really have an aversion to waits and anto machines you are right it should not be because it is pretty lowing and fruit you do not need a lot of equipment for it typically it does not hurt that bad you do not often get tats or out of it and you are gon to feel a nice wonderful pomp afterard it is a great mut and as we discussed many times now it is quite effective at hypert ye i also i do not know if they fit specifically with musculendurance but if you look at the the physiques for example on rock climbers i'mea they have to me of course theyave been a i usually a the experience climbers have a pretty a remarkable u body compositions they ten to be lean and lithe and fluxible ll those things that many people spired you the other thing is theire development always looks exceedingly balance you do not really tend to see climbers i over developed in the tor an under developed in the arms or over developed in the arms despite all the climbing and under developed an a relatively in the other lim of them that is true for women and men i it is not a a sport that i participate in but u i seems what they are doin g is assentially muscular endurance tracly if yes sir there' there isreally something there to be valued am a that is a forday a weeks cadual with off days were rest days inserted am as needed and then just in continuing for those that are a bit more committed to their fitness and want to do a o five or six day a week programm would you recommend just am collapsing some of the off days paying more attention to recovery and encycling through more quickly ye absolutey you could combine that and just run that either one o those programms you could run that three day week programme back aback do hit get that down six days day one speed power hypercify da to strength a work with elevate hartrate ineroic capacity in de three endurance and than just and then jor cycle through aget you take day for off of the weekin and then you go back again you' be having in six days of exercise one day off and you be getting every one of those adaptations and multal times week that is almost exactly how it s set up a six day week programm great i love the the elegance an the simpliscity of that and the thoroughness of it because it checks off many if not all of the made nine major adaptations to exercise that we have been talking about these episodes and i suppose the one thing that i want to high light and impose this also as a question is that early in our discussions in a previous episode you mention that much of what people think of and apply as it relates to resistance training is borrowed from body building in hypertropry training specifically which typically involves getting close to failure o failure sometimes even involving rest paws where you hit failure than sat the waiy down for you secons that repeat these high intensity techniques accentuating the negative o called etcentric om et cetera in hearing about these protocals of three day a week or forday a week six day a week it is very clear to me that if one is not careful to omit that kind of thinking and suddenly is taking their strength work and speed work to failure or is pushing too hard on muscular endurance o the point were just grinding out that very last push up on every set that the amount of soreness and the amount of recovery that results from these a work outs might start to cause progress issues one thing that is in the back of my mind is as you have described these programms is that even though some of them are very brief for involve a minimum of time commitment in prticul or three day a week but also the forday week's cedual that there is a a discipline involved in making sure that ustick to the work out that you are spose to do that day and not am go ham as they say and just throw in a couple extra sets of a visep curls and trisep pushes cause you you want to do than you thought you could maybe you could get away with that but you have to come back pretty quickly into some serious a meaning devoted speed and power work and ere strength work and if you have not been disciplined about not doing certain forms of exercise i could see how the whole thing could kind of crash quickly and one could think all this is just too much work or its it is it is not for me yet i desidswas s now where the question comes which is am what what are some of to keep points that people need to keep in mine when they i embrace a programme how rigidly do they need to stay attached to a i to days an dureant say i'm just doing endurance to dhay strength they i'm just doing strength work i'm not going to take things to absolute failure b yon fitlier i am absolutely happy with any one modifying any the sample programmes however they would to my only recommendation for the question you just posed would be set your programme and then if you are going to make a change fine but that is they change to your programe in other words do not just make decisions every single day can make changes if you are doing that you might as will not have a programme and as we described earlier there is clear evidence that having a programme it is better than not regardless of the effectness of the programme and my general comment to that is o cay fine a day or two you made some modifications no problem we are in a situation nours you are basecay changing the work out every day as you go then wed just need to read a rihte a new programme we need reacess we grat because we need to have some structure look throughaul ive it is i change the programming i'm going to do the day of often because of any number of such iciton't feel it i way over estimated to day im we talked little bit an previous ap sot about aut or regulation which is a style of of purtization a program sign which you are adjusting based on high ractory feeling that day but with some specific structures yun it take some measurements that day an a just autoregulation is a very very effective tool you just need to maketure to that auto was dialed an othe words is it because your body actually needed something different ors because you are now just getting a little bit lazy now you just not feeling it to day there is a little bit of an impossible line to draw there bolsan arials are real great area a lot is real in the moment and you jusnt need to be little bit aware of having some reality check listening to your body but than also being hey no i'm talking to you i'm telling you this is the plan we are going to do this in staying within it it is going to be challenging to progressive thy overload and therefore get a hiwher likely od of success ayour training programme if you are just making decisions and changing the rogramme right before you work out you are probably not you are probably going for most people you are probably going to choose less we are off more than you choose more now having said that there are more than a few clints that have come through our programmes where they choose more always they hadd a set they hadd an exercise they add anothe r work out and that can be oq but workgin a track various markers on them and if we see these things consistently going down we are going to identify whether they are which phas of this overtraining thing will talk about next thei're actually in some faces on moq some of em i'm not in fore seeing certain things happen physiologically were gon to make a conversation were also then going to really think carefully about why are you making this choice do you feel the training is not enough o kt great let us modify it then are you not making progress or are there some other reasons why you are doing this i vas saam not a psychologis at therapist but there are clearly situations in which folks adose themselves with far too much exercise for reasons that are not because it is productive to their training our goals and if such case a we would probably bring in somebody n specializes in those areas to clear that out and just make surets were not doing this for anxiety shees sir energy things if it is i just tomkif the programms enough o c gret let us go back lets look an our matrics let us a value at our testsan and go there but if there is other reasons and ni we may bring in somebody to have that conversation usually when i've seen people deviate from program is because they tend to revert to something that they have done for a long time it just feels really comfortable to them and it worked it and it was giving them decent result there' sceptical to try something else or there is a a pena type a kind of haphazardness sometimes specially e will get really catheny before work out just wont throw something and then there is a third category and this is one that i've had to contend with a lot in my life which is that i really enjoy training with other people when i have the opportunity ye and it a certain day rolls around where ours was to do something and not do other things and people say hey you want to go for a long oceans way n or you want a train and you end up doing some a can he cain this onces for you some ridiculous twenty wallball aa cross fit type work out and i'm not am acclamated for that sort of thing and then it does tend to throw things off not because i no one intended i canyy because there is no thre's nothing wrong with a twenty sets of wallballs if your that is part of your conditioning ye but if it is not appropriate for where you are in your scadual it really can disrupt what you are trying to do ye even as i as a non competitive athlete myself a the earsment since i've competed in any athletic programme but the as a non competive athlete i think there is it a beauty to and a really strong incentive to being disciplined about the programm that one follows a as a mentorn professor that i worked with youars ago used to say come ing to his office all these ideas and things o one to doingneed si a let us constrain this walk and then you the question you always ant arrive at in a discussion with your students ays is what is the experiment exactly and then you go in you do that spiz a big experiment i think i i view will work out the same way thathey are multible wit adaptations goals and thingsthat people are trying to achieve really knowing why you are there each time and really sticking to that even if it means not training with other people or i was say will you can train with me but i'm not in a train e yri that is one way to do it im but really sticking to a scadual is really what allows the progress to emerge but that does not necessarily you being empty social you can invite people along but the jelys i telling people to be the host not the guest i have a little bit of a rule here maybe i mee bit shuld answer your question this way i actually doing things totally different occasionally i'll do when i'm traveling i tend to do hotel work out what i mea wthat is i will go down to the work ot room and i will do a set of ten to fifteen wraps of every single machine in the exact order in which they are laid out well just for the sake of fun just for the sake of ty i e terril card version of yes whatever comes up imon to make sense of it an yo just move and those are typicaly things if i just want to move a little bit for jallag and other sort of purpse is right i'm that is often i was not gotn to get to work out to day a nomina to do some thing the feel gret i do not travel that much tho it is not really throwing my my things off i'm i also i do not get a lot of free time and if i im traveling and i'm seeing some one i haven' seen in many years or for the first time i'm we got to train to get er this week the the first time i'm not in a burn than opportunity my rule is this to i'm not going to do somethingthas can a cost me more than three days i'm absoluly happy i to get out there and maybe to morrow morning or to nigh we we we go do some fun that is off my schadul i'm i'm in i mean a hundred per cent i'm justgoing a down regulate a little bit i'm not and maybe do as much as you are as hard as you or whatever i'll do more than i should but if it cost me to morrow i it was worth the exchange i do not have a world wrecord i'm setting any time soon i do not have i got many years i'm happy to give up a couple of days of exercise to be little sore than i need to be for the exchange of a lifetime memory and this stuff is important to me this stuff lance is true lifetime memories i can look back many of my fond memories from my life are our training sessions with friends whatever it is doing you gis sy with somebody whos a world champion just a to tot whatever the thing is raingyoug that was relrealy cook absoluly worth missing to days if it is goingto be more than three days o er i'm going to be wrecked i cannot work out for five or six days then i'm probly a right that is that is kind nonsense unless this is an oprtrany where my i absolute cannot pass o i'm to that that is kind ow i think about it that does not happen too often with me though may be once month and my oo cannot fine lost the day realit of it is it is probing whene i wonce a quarter but that happen italrelly care you do want a

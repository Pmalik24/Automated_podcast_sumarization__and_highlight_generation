voices apparently and then he was sedphoras once again we have situation with a massshooting where presumaly lawbiting guners will now be blame that will be an attempt widespread tim by members the media by members for political class to take guns away from the law abiding be cause they did not take a gun away from some dy who liteer literally was notsupost to have a gun apparently accpording to the ucadellymnal this person grappled with mental health issues recently reported hearing voices and threatening to shoot up the military base where he served he was committed to a mental health facility over the summer for a couple of weeks he also hadcriminal background check in two thousand set in to thousand seven he was charge with a mist menorofens for d u i he is found guilty of that as well he was forse to pay five hundredollar fin spent forty eght hours in a cell it is not cleer where exactly he is politic ally at this point and in people are gin to try in linket to his his politics because in march he liked to social mediopost from donals from junior and dom he he posted some means fror march talking about how the how gun ownership was not the problem he to pose to by the nextto sos at one voint the talks about howabanning assault weapons was a bad idea this obvious lose a person with mental illness and i amnatang that because it serves of predictor logenda but

two separate locations killing at least twenty two people and injuring over sixty soll bring ou the latest on that as it continues to develop and meanwhile big question has arrived in american politics ot this plan that is why is it that on campas there is such a thing as queers for palistine where is that coming from they hate america and they hate the west that is the common thread uniting radical college students with terrorist members of comoss it is why we see marches by queers for palistine despite the fact that queers would be summarily murdered in any palistine thei'r difference is do not matter they are in the words of radical revolutionary outhor fhronsfinon the wretched of the earth rising up to smite the hierarchies of power in nineteen sixty one fronzsfant on a black radical member of the aljeurian national abration front put forth a shockingly violent treatis calling for the revolution of the colonized pointing out the evils of colonial ad ministration phanonton merely called for an end two colonialism la gondy instead he called for violens which he sized purifying in all of its varied forms his book the wretched of the earth posited that revolutionary violence would usher in the new man free of the evils of the west decolonization he wrote is always a violent omend de colonization he wrote which sets out to change the order of the world is cletrly in agenda for total disorder in its bereality fenonwrote de colonization reeks of red hot cannonballs and bloody knives violence disorder bloody knive that is the essense a finon's decolonization the colonize must take everything from the colonizers in the name of restoring himself as a human being final rights quote the gaze that the colonized subject casts at the colonists sector is a look of lust a look of envy dreams of possession every type of possession of sitting at the colonist's table and sleeping in his bed preferably with his wife the colonized man is an envious man colonialism he says justifie any respons in fact it requires any response the west must be destroyed for the west has colonize quote when the colonized your speech on western culture they draw the michettis or at lease checked to see they are close at hand fanon says sachater of colonial power was at leaset somewhat understandbl ind algeria but fenon was not making the case for revolutionary violence merely in algeria he is action making the case for revolutionary violence pretty much everywhere the person who made that clear was existentialist and markist john pulsartr the frenchint electual srtar's introductions o finons wretched of the earth makes the case not only that the colonize have an ultimate rights violence but that the entire west must be collapsed from within for its great sins violence says sartra quote is man reconstructing himself killing a european is killing two birds with one stone eliminating in one go oppresser and opprest leaving one man dead and the other man free the only honorable thing for the west to do is droin in on its cultural suicide quote you who are liberal human who take the love of culture to the point of affectation you pretend to forget that you have colonies where massacres are committed in your name sartra wrights finon reveals to his comrades especially to those who remain a little too westernized the solidarity of the metropolitans with theire colonial ations sartra says that he has carried fanons quote dialectic through to its conclusion we too peoples of europe we are being decolonized meaning the colonist inside every one of us is surgically extracted in a bloody operation we must all recognize that we are complicit in quote a one thousand year old opression our beloved values are losing their features if you take a closer look thereis not one that is in tainted with blood how do we recover by joining in on the violence against our own civilization violence says sartra a khillee's spear can heal the wounds it has inflicten who can we tell who are enemies are well we simply attack the powerful the colonizers are the powerful the colonize are the powerless therefore the powerful must be colonizers and the powerless their victims this is sartra's logic this is for example how israel the ultimate case of decolonization a cross human history after the turn of a native population to its homeland and it is battle to throw off the shackals of the british mandate be came today's hottesed quote decolonization cause sartra's radical call has been taken up speraticaly both at home and abroad as critical therists home baba points out in his forward to fnal's book the black panthers found inspiration in fenon did th arronian revolutionaries who ended with the rise of the mullas those revolutionaries transmuted finolds distinction between oppresser and opprest into a distinction between the arrogant and the weaken translating finonce marksist tinged radicalism into radical islamism but the coalition of finolds wretcherd of the earth could not materialize until the generation of sartra came to ful maturity until the institutions of the west poisoned themselves slowly with the imbacilic toicidality of weakness the west remain strong enough to fend off the radicao lines when it face down t sovia union but then it could not stnd up for itself and i began to fall fast ford sixty years from sartra and sartar's radicalism has now become a mass movement a movement uniting cammas and campus radicals the far left and the terroris cornal west the black marksis radical calls finoncualt the greatest revolutionary intellectual of the mid twentieth century according to west he compels us to acknowledge colonialism is a sustained barbaric war waged against colonized people sanctioned by western values what is more colonialism sus west is not a far from home problem it means the west must be demolished for finon west says revolutionary internationalism antiimperialism anti capitalism anti colonialism anti patriaricalism antiweteto premisy yields a new humanism that puts a premium on the sychic social and political needs of poor and working peoples a solidarity in universality from below west explains quote in our present ay moments of imperial decay and capitalist do prepitude the spirit of finon is most manifest in any american imperialist contect in the revolutionary internationalist wings of the black lives matter movement and the palistinialize matter movement a line with the boycos divestment and sanctions effort the coalition is now complete the alliance of the supposedly marginalized march together armanarm toward the destruction of the west and in particular the united states after all the united states even according to finola i nineteen sixty one had become the chief colonizer thanks to its power quote two centuries ago a former european colony decided to catch up with europe it succeeded well that the united states become a monster in which the tains the sickness inhumanity of europe have grown to uphauling dimentions un quote the alliance to destroy the west spans the globe and its right curat home to threatening everything we stand for ifty colonization is merely a codeward for attacking ve powerful and the systems that supposedly sustain them then queers for palistine begins to make a lot of cens that is why the same

islamac gehadan palsinan authority the river o the sey would be the georden river and the mediterranean see that means the extermination every jew in that region this was projected on the alls over george at washington an just in case they worn clear enough they also projected these slogan glory to our martyrs the martyrs would be uknow members of comass who are raping children hard tat they broke their palvices that is from medical reports on the ground over there an thee these are these are the genious students who either oure onstune veza which means whe shuld expell them if you have a

all you should leave and should leave forthwith heu shoud go hang out with your terrors bodies elsewhere hit is it is absolutly insane they universities have have become this the a the george the george washington university administration i they put out a statements in the after math of this studens for justice in palistine and group that has now been band in the state of florda for supporting terrorism soons fr just in palstine claimed credit for all of this they also put ot a statement saying quote these events have only reafirmed what every palising yon knows deeply we will see a liberate palistine within our lifetime the settler colony wi'll fall our land will be liberated we will return to our homes again palistine will be free from the river toe see again there you see that language of fanon the settler colony the settler colony theand again everybody sort of understands why radical is lamas one destroy is ral ing kill the gews the queshing has always been why queers for palistine why the why thy fellow travellers in the anser is when you build a coalition that is explicitly design tor tear away at the west and israel is an element of that coalition the alliance rides again that is why the demonstration by the way also attack the university administration and then none the university put out a pretty weak statements suggesting that they they were unhappy with all of this but the statements have quote on tuesday evening universially became aware of several unauthorized projections on a capis building the projections on the university's library violate university palicy leadership in tervene to ensure these projections were moved the statements made by thse individuals and noway reflect the views of the university wereviewing this incident

when it is also the administration and faculty at many of these universities the you see ethnic studyes faculty council rere a letter to all of the university of california board of regions first of all professionally useless people ethnic studies to partments ar garbage full scaleful stop their garbage but they were a letter and em they am say in the strongest possible terms the ou see aethnic studies faculty council as he receive california and averse state wie body representing over three hundred faculty system wide rejrects recint u see administrate of communications that distort and mis represent the unfolding genicide of palisinians and gaza and hereby contributed to the racists and dehumanizing e retiure of palistinian daily reality in light of the histry an statements by the usu regions demanizing the boycots vestmen and sanctions movement and other forms of palistinian solidarity we have no confidents thu se administration comprehends or respects it is obligations it is deeply distressing the u see and other higher institutions ad ministrative statements in last week an a half that irresponsibly weeld charges of terrorism and unprovoked aggression have contributed to a climat tht is made palicinans udents and community members on safe get th this the the big lie i'm not merely enjoying the big live that the people who really feel on safe on campison these days are obviously the procomas protestors are marching on mass through campusses and threatening people by t eway how pathetic are oure university students there pathetic the tobrandized university which was founded by the american jewish community etbrandi's university student leaders voted ten to six not to condemn comoss not to condemcomoss yo only con a senior at th university said that he stands with palisinians but this is still about condemning extremist organization but he was that in the minority amazing stuffed there from brandas again this is a group of young highly educated usually upper class students who are fully in lee with the ideology of terrorism because commossageus part of the violent colition to tear down i civilizations they have to stand by the ruddies and and what that means is that also there is a sense of tremendous antitlement from these folks they are entitled to a job from you theyre entitled to your tax pared outs they are entitled to your support prolubest example this that i've seen over the past few years is a personamed rhinut workmen rhina workmean is a a member of the and why you student council in fact a rhina workman is the m student the the and why you lawschools student bar association presidents she is caught on camera to facing posters of cannaptis railies i this is this something that has become unbelievably comment and and pretty shocking because these are just postrs of people who are literally being held hostage by terroris group and pro comass people you cannot call these pro palcinian people because this has nothing to do with with being propalistinian people i mean if it does then i think you are getting the issuewrong they are literally tearing down posters of of kidnap children or to face them here is rhina workmen doing just that a teie thats at it os wi thi a ma ase e re e te i ita to co i ther rte doing to i prian very i what a sociatin si ho a ut to everythin er sintli thi whet r te doing to the over is hoses it is t o dois i and tum and of course she had nothing to say shes just standing ther of corst he is not giving her name while she had her her job at a law form wrecinded becase it turns out the law froms do not to employ terror sympathizers it is not is note their biggest thing what is that mean one means it is time for the media to jump in and finally talk about freespeech on college camps as wol that is amazing when speakers me get band from sade to paul university that is not national news it is definitely national news when you do not get a job being a terror sympathizer that is really the issue here is a b c news covering rhina workmen i mean the the sense of absolute intitlement from these privileged patty pathetic left wingers who again are in league with the cuonno quot wretched of the earthacorn fina it is it is really it is quite discusting and people should realize how revolutionary the implications are here is rhina workmen declaring that not only is she entitle to tear down posters of cannap children she is intitle to a job from you and you do not give it to herr it is because your discriminitory if you wern to rea to the latter avisly with the benefit of hind sight anything you wouldhave done differentway i think i ill continue to speak up for paleson in human rihtes and use whatever platform i have available to me to call for istys fire and in this occupation that is harming the palesinians i ma just try one more time woen't you change anything even the timing of it because some people thought it was too soon because your letter came the for israil even launch any kind of retaliation i think it is important to note that the genicide happening right now did not start on october sevenh its started over seventy five years ago and that was what my message was intended to get across was that we are seeing violence happening that is part of a much larger a structural violence a system that is happening ind palestine right now do you condamnstructural violence on that is is thas tay havns a settler clo knos ma ati what i use my platform for and who i condemn was pretty clear by my message and i think that i will continue to condemnapartide and military occupation and that in this moment i'm foc know that is not calling for an intigenicide and calling for an immediatesy fire do you think in the space that were in right now there is room to have ampathy for the israilies who lost their lives who were brutalized were raped and also ampathy for the palestinians who are similarly losing their lives yet i think right now if you turn on any mainstreame channel you will see the stories of this ralies on every screen you look to and i think for me i will continue t use my platform to uplift the voices of palestinians and the struggles there going through because byt now we have me a thisiss is the whole thing in one you lost the holthing the rhina workmen mean poss of their rina workmen useis tha them pronouns rhina workmen considers herself obviously woman considers herself to be a member of queers for a liberated palestine and that is what this is that is hat this is she put out a statement be for is rael actually did anything condemning israel for the dead juws that is what sheu did why begus agan it is part of the broader rubric of marginalized of the earth unite and terr down at the cornqual colonizes but colonizers they just mean anybody who has power whe the power is is gotten usefully or not whether the powerful ar moral or other night does not matter it dis not matter as long as you are a member of quoin qhat marginalized community it is the coalition to destroy the systems thet really matters a mad should scare everybody because that is a lot of your kids that is a lot of people that your your kids are going to school with a college campasses that is a rising movement on the left and it is very strong it is not a tiny minority on college campasses there is a reason why you can barily get fifty per cent of young people in the united states to say the commosse terris group there is reason for that and that is not that that is on israel issue that is a west issue west as a serious serious probon ietans the get's o more of this momentarily first the october fifteenth tax dedline has just passed i know manue f you might be dretting at the stress of filing your taxes fing

western civilization it is bled up is nh't it is started the universay level with sudo intellectuals promoting it people ake edward sied promoting it people ake angela dav is promoting it but it but t's bled up in to all aspect of american siety most obviously including ar media to the extend that the new york times at this point is literally defending re hiring a free lands writer who praise titler not kittig you according to juwish new service palsinian fill makear sully mon hesi who has posted on social media of being in a state of harmony as hitler was during the holicost and wrote how great you are hitler has been re hired by the ew york times he free lands forthen your times from twenty eighteen until twenty twenty one and since october twelfth he is had nine bylines he is he' writing forthan your times again amazing the new york times they said we receive we reof you problematic social mediapost by hesi when they first cans laten twenty twenty two and tok a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could not hure to our standards oh you mean the standards of not being a hitler supporter or the tandards of being a hitler supporter or silands on genicide in your times was the first time around and there is blod up int the mediu and then the way that the media do this in a soft or fastion is they just set up this this full scale moral equivalents they pretend that you do not taxually have a moral obligation to take sides in a battle between genicitle terrorist and legitimate states the your times put oun entire opinion vidio pies saying you do not have to take sides there is nothing there is nothing that suggest yuevt to take sides against terror groups that that burn babyes alive there is nothing that suggest that there is then your times putting out o full scale opinion vidio it quating e's reaely advocates with commoss advocates to mazing stuff your humamin you lon a it wii no quivi an your ilent daan youe got i de e are you can sit ter a i do support ieer side what is your opinion on the worn itle east i'm afraid i'm can acto insist on an answer there are wors rating all across our small planet but to day there only required to take a stand on on compassion for humanity is a good thing what about the mor than three hundred thousand people o diedin i yearuptly sixty thousand who disappeared in n t the rock think about the ran what has just been bewere doing to tall the crises in a rety to tat stand on the or by the way there there there bunch of these conflicts that people do have opinions about by ga lot of them thed that that the sutler grows ther'e groswe suddenly suddenlyeven your time to send your neft have a moral opinion on the stuff in your times spends its days asking every single republican if a publican makes a bad comment anywhere ever republican must now have an opinion on that thing they apparently's only one issune where you do not have to have an opinion according to the yar times and that happens to be where muslims are murdering chows on massin clling for their extermination when that happens suddenly than your times goes full on well there are other things happening in the world agein many of the conflicts of they mention right there you should have an opinion on you should have an opinion on the chinese government keeping muslims in concentration camps in trinum must have express that opinion many many time by the way t the idead in your time senenc to you have to have an opinion on you prain vorsis russias in saying than your times been pushing that for years of this point but again the moral equivocation is just cover for terrorism that is all it is it is its piar cover for terrism give you latest on the ground right now in israel right now the is rayley's last night performd thei'r largest ground assault since the beginning of this particular round a conflict since octomber seventh they sent sim thanks in to arreas in the northern gssisstrip they m it was a limited raid ahead of any sort of potential ground offensive there are lot of rumors thet bidon has been trying to convince these releas tos delay the ground offensive israel for its own part is still kind of deciding when it wishes to go what it wishes to do and all the rest the the suggestion was that bidon wanted a delays that the united states could get more tofensive weapon rein place to protect our troops abroad which by the way we should have had originally axcept thet jobidon was too busy playing nice and playing footsy with the molas to actually defend our troops that happens to be the case even now but here is jobine yesterdy saying that he did not call for i delay on a ground invasion have you sought assurances from him that he will hold off on the ground advation in te caus a intill the safe relief relese of the hostages can be assured of course there is included a ten on calit for americans no wut i hav to e citin is i that is possible tto get thes forks ha safely thats tadition thoug is thir decision but i did not demand i e out im if it is reel it should you done now to his credit bidon was asked about the the numbers from the gossis tripping said you nont weregettim all those numbers from commoss i take themwith the grand assault which you non't good for him fr ac ually saying this since the administration has far not really done that if i may very quickly in the eighteen days in tama hamma killed fourteen hundre it is railiy the hammt controlled god tat helth ministry says his raily foris hav killed oger six thousand palitani ins including twenty seven hundred chille chilldren you previously ask nantinahodin minami sivilliing casual teens do you these number sati you that he is ignoring that message e e saye me that no notion os u cubot homenei'm sure in cenmencu and is reson wasin war i thin we su e ceene cur i in not we tur o cee cur to be sure e co i o coing a ter o sea u properee or a ister and e and is agains ter te maa mat but i have no coson noean ehows to a get inbedded in that is is jobin's usual garbage abat how is ral has to be careful abouts villincashels you really have to warn the asrailays what we talk to ut yesterday on the sho meanwhile bidin is trying to figur u exactly what' to do wit the fact that a ron is etting very very spicy with regard to americans in the region according to the washington pose president bidon fiy s mounting pressure to strike aron in proxies that ave re peatedly an antact and injured you ust troops in a rock and syria this month but he is waying any desision for ataliat against has broughter concern that the warn gosic culd be on the precipice of erupting into a region why tempest what lif the truth is the thing tht will keep it from erupting into a region by tempest is if the united states makes clear that if ydou injure our troops we will stump on you a fly ik that that historically has been the american way of doing business in these places and that has in fact worked when when american troops are attackd the only way to push people off of doing that is to make it very clar to them that if they do that thay in their bodyse die andhat there is a reason that donal trump to this exactly right when he was the president of the united states if there wareatacks on american troups onl from responded in kind and he did with alacrity it was was down trumble pull the trigger on cossemsolly mn and who ise totally correct to do that concerning the telling monhy help plan the death of thousands of american troups in a rock bydintown wednesday that he warn't i ttola alicamany the ron supreme leader that if teron continues to move against you us force in the mat least we will respond but far there really has been note response yet and it is that sort of lack of clarity that is leading to an ascalation obviously now it it makes some sense that if there is going to be a base of attack aron in insergen group that it is using a a a basefattac morger attack americans droning them to dath wul would probably be a proper solution for all of that meanwhile by thewy the by ddministration just let in the aronium foreign minister to the united states you meat with commas five seconds ago to cheer with them i n't understand why the united states is granting temporary vesays to to terroris an in terror saports was make a lot of sent to me by las whole thing of course has been pretty embarrassing for the bide ad ministration even more embarrassing sende jak sullivan who is the national securityvizer to to jobidon he wrote an essay in foregn afair's magazime befo or the october sevent tha tax in which he braggeds about a bunch of supposd form policie successes they had o eded it because there was a passage in it about how they done in amazing job in the gotistrip quote the is really palstidian situation is tens particularly inthe west bank butin the face of serious frictions we have desculated crascies in goson and restored direct diplomacy betwen the parties after years wor dabsons as which jake sullivan rote five minutes before comoss launch the dedly attack on jues since world war too quote the region is quieter than it has been for deckades the progress is fragil to be sure but is also not in accident it bidn's approach returns discipline toyou us policyed emphasises deturring aggression d

apparently re publicans last night they decided you stop kicking themself directly in the nads and instead they decided to actually vote in favor of make johnson to make johnson somebody that i woud take most of america had not heard of ever he was only elected to congress fairly recently hes a mean in congress all that long he is a a congressman from louisiana according to politico his e ananimity in washington was the driving force in his election as speaker because he had not made any enemies yet he became the unlikely leader of an unruly group of house re publicans will now rely on him to run their side o the capital he was next to no ones first pick but again everybody else had a high profile and that men that he was the guy who can a sneakin under the ratar now johnson must figur how to cheeve ut mc carthy could not compromise that does not prompt mutiny now he is ganhaven easier time with that the reasong's can aven ease your time with that than mc carthy did is because he is not name cove mc carthy seriously that it is that simple matgates and a few of his crew decided they hate hi mc carthy and that ment is that any compromised the c carthy couht was going to be seen as treason by gates an company and used as an excuse to get rid of mc carthy well now johnson is gin a comin he is goin to do kind of exactly what mc carthy did because the incentive structure is precisely the same to takein example mc carthy just cut a continuing resolution he cout it with sime democrats the reason he had to do that is because heget a better contining resolution deal tere was scuttle by gates in company ten after mc carthy actually did the continuing resolution to fun the government that is when he was alsted by gates in company well now ma johnsons goin t comein an yor he is proposing continuing resolutions the same sort of stuff now he can pass a bunch of single issue bills supposedly passed the appropriations bills do the process an all that but democratsigon a rejected an 's given come back to doing contuning resolution now the thing is that because gates outstid mc carthy and because johnson is the new speaker he has an incentive gates does in making johnson appeared to be better than mc carthy which means ththe is not going to yellin scream about any deal that johnson cuts inherently johnson has more lee way to cut deals and make deals than mc carthy did mainly because all the people who would be incentivise to get rid of somebody for the publicity already did that as they cannot do it again they have to play this as though they theye chiefsoms for mass of win by substituting johnsan for mc carthy andnagain the policy is in a come out almost exactly the same it is can be very very very similar now the fact is that johnson has a lotless experienc the mc carthy in the space t again is not a rip on johnson johnson's great i'm to go through his opening speech in a second when he when he won thespeakership an it is excellent is really really realy good i i happen ta resonate to an enormous amount of what johnson says as a speaker i think he is way mord appealing then then cem mc carthy was however the speakerof the house is job he is not just to be a a a person who speaks well and a person who communicates while the speaker o the house essentially has several jobs one is to ya speak well and and maintain policy positions but the can a bigger aspects are vote counting vote whipping rewarding allies and punishing animies getting together our colish an actually do things and mou cuires a lot of back scratching requires a lot of maneuvering requires the can a mockyv allean stuff that mc carthy was actual pretty good at i do not now if johnson has a lot of experience that maybeis great at it we do not know he is never done it before the speaker also isppose to fund rays for pretty much all the re publicans across the board mc carthy over the course of his time in house leadership raised almost half a billion dollars for various house re publican candidates including many of the same people who then ouseed him mike johnson in last election cycle youan expect him arays tens millionsof dollars he is brought one guy running in an uncontested districts in lisiana mike johnson in his last election cycle raised one point three million dollars can he trans late that over in's raiseing hundreds of millions of dollars for fellow candidates mc carthy when recruited a bunch of candidates in purple districts johnson has not realy done that yet again he is enough to prove that he can do all of the hard nosed things the mc carthy could do and there is a lot of parliamentary procecuer being speaker o the house is telling anybody can just walk in the front door and suddenly transform the place if you do not file a bilid to proper time dhe mc crats could sneak in tht culd flip the billice it they are really are a lot of procedral complexies don johnson made very well beable to handle it we just do not know hit the the notion that that things are gin ta ratically change in th house now that its johnson as opposed to mc carthy is really silly nit again none of that is a rip on johnson it is a rip on gatesontim the idea that the catesons he machieves some sort of massive material victory by throwing the houson to full on chaos for three weeks in demonstrating the fractuousness an idiocy of of part oftheir publican caukus i do not buy it i do not see it and tat that is without reference to what happens going ford with with johnson in here are a few things about mike johnson that are ar kind of ausum mike johnson very very socially conservative his a ninety per cent lifetime rating from heritage action ninety two per cent from the american conservative union he is very much in favor of cutting spending which is something by the way lot of magnatype are not really big in favor of the count dispenning depending on who they are heis very strong on abortion extremely prolike has an aplus rating from the susan b anthony prolife america group he is to work as the senior legal counsil fror the alliance defense fund and a he is anti same sex marriage for example he has been historically which by the way is he historically correct his ition of the re publican party and a man and a woman our marriage and that any other form of human relationship is not the same u morally or sociologically he he was involved in the attempts to tos stall sortification of the election post twenty twenty and this is being used as a club by democrats already he devised in argument does ectualy the only good argument thatwas made in the aftfromath of november seventh which is a sentury the lot of states pennsylvania had unalaterally shifted their voting laws as to benefit democrats in ways that were legal that was the only good legal argument that was made during that entire spectacle johnson was one making those arguments and he send some stuff during that time that frankly is ridiculous are he he called in to question the voting systems incide edven is whayland wld os siny powell kind of stuff but he is now moving away from that i assum tha he is going to ignore all of that thas mean democrats arcan jump on which willget to a moment but johnson gave a really quite beautiful speech last night on becoming speaker of the house he opend by thanking kep mc arthy i want i want to a express my great thanks for our speaker ameritus caven mc cart ceaven has dedicated over two dekage of his life to selplice public service sixteen of those years in this house and you would be hard pressed to fided anybody who loves this institution more or is contributed more to it he is the reason we are in this majority to day he started off with that he then moved on to the fact that it is time to get back to work which of course is true is is not been a good moment for the republican party they look clowns restoring some sort of semblance of dignity to the republican calkas would certainly be applause i want to say to the american people on behalf of all of us here we hear you we know the challengeis your face in we we know that to that there is a lot going on in our country domestically and abroad and we are ready to get to work again to solve those props and we will our mission here is to serve you well to restore the people's faith in this house in this great and essensial institution an he continued along these lines he said the deprive the institution is in jeopardinas time to restored that pride that of course is true as well and and i think all of our parents are proud of what we are called to do here i think all the american people at one time a great pride in this institution but right now a that is in jeoparty and we have a challege before us right now to rebuild and restore that trust heis of course right about that as well now on principle he is a very strong tranitional conservative he is pretty hawkish on form policy he voted against some of the acrane appropriations bilse that probly the biggest distinction between him and mc carthy is the mc carthy was pro funding for you crane and in the initial responds might johnson was pro funding of you crane and then after we gave them a hundrbillian dollars then he started to tet skiddish about it and he suggest that he is not in favor of that but that is also where the republican cawcasis the possibility of passing large skale you crane funding on a stantalon basis was an on starter inside the cawcas anyway that is obviously direction at the re publican party has moved will get to more from mike johnson in just at one second the new speaker of the house first we do things very differently here at dailywire we host a lot of huge pod cas of course we wanch a chocolate

his speech lasin was excellent when he got to his principles thi particularly good mike johnson ticked off a lot of left last night when before he assumed his speakership position heactually nelt in prayer with bunch o ther members the republican cawcas and this of course is very bad not'spos to this is superoffensive to pay tribute to god after you achieve something wif te magnutud becoming speaker of the house in the united states to america that of course is is deeply ffens if deeply problematic clearly amin being recheuted to leave in being nactural terra supporter o ca according to democrats knewing for prayer on the floor of the house that of course the huge problem you are latanneel in centa cloth for george floid you are just not allowed to do it for god i without the contin clothan ncis mae johnson he said last night that it is time to reject eightheism and marxism nineteen sixtyx two an nineteen sixty two that that ar national mato thin god we trust was it the adorned above this rostrum and if you look at the little a gui that they give the turist and constituent wo comon in an visit the house if you turn in there to about page fourteen in the middle tet guid it tells you the history of this nit says very simply these words were place here above us this mato was placed here as a rebuke of the cold war erof philosophy of the soviet union that philosophy was marxism and communis obviously heis slapping at some members hof t e left then he listed what he called to seven cor principles of conservatism i these a pretritional i thin it is really quen essentially the cor principles of our nation i bull them down th individual freedom limited government the rule of law piece their strength this corresponsibility free markets and human dignity those those are the foundations that made us the extraordinary nyshow that we are and you and i to day or the stewards of those principls a that him's pretritionally conservative to me man it in there i heard you kno piece through strength which is something a lot ofpeople are not big fands of these days i heard fiscal responsibility something a lot o people on the ight r not big fans of these days again the idea tat hesom servlic wyld departure from traditional conservatism is ridiculous it is radiculous he is a traditional conservative which is good a tritionally conservative speaker ofthe house would be a very good thing i hope that he pulls the levers in a more conservative direction than house leadership has been able to do i also understand as i'v said the incensive structure and the incensive structure means he has a democrat sennate is a democrat president of the united states and he has an extremely thin majority in the house and all takes a few grand standers to make it that he has to con to deal with democrats again in the initial run i expecthed h's goingto get the support of manyof peoplewho housed in mc carthy those aren'kon o by people who buck him but as time progressis he will have the exact same incent of structure as everyone alsso was this a big giant wind for therepublican party again really my getlicget in a ton of ways love my johnson wev mon forn policy lavan mata lic again a crossbort excellent excellent choice for speaker of te house can he pull the levers in a sophisticat away we have yet to see that was this overall in a mazing move for republicans a much needed ye what let us let us hold our fire on that one was mackates a strategic genius for throwing the house in a complete couse for month to do this aht no no he was not in any attempts to ret con that yet are are ar pretty ridiculous wel goadless what the democrats are saying johnson's first move was a good move he announced last night that the very first move that he was going to make as speaker of the house was to push a resolution to support israel than a bill to support israel in his war against commasse here is what he had to say the first bill that i'm going to bring to this floor and just a little while we will be exsip portof er di dear frin to israel and we are over do and giting a we are going to show not only israel but the entire world that the barberism of hummas that we have all seen cloy out on artilif is in screane screans is wretched and wrong and we are goin to stand for the good in that conflict a good for johnson he is very strong on that particular issue that resolution did pass last night four hundred and twelve to ten the nay votes were except for thomas massy who baselys does not governments penting on anything which oka the other nine navots were exactly who youwould think they were fremall bomancory bush on recarson al green summer lee ao ce el han omar dell a remeras resheted to leav and there r six present votes as well again more raticals i oun opressly gra case are of taxas walking castro chwe garsea promilajyapol meedy of valaskas exactly who you would assume it to be again i think that don it is good to get the house back in working order a good for good for my johnson and a it is time for the house to get back to or meanwhile the democrats ar reving it up as they would with pretty much any conservative who ha ns it up as house speaker when theyare they areging to try and now demonize mik johnson as a radical taid they can fund rase off tit is what they 're going to do according to politico whell mi johnson miht hav been an obscure fort from congress member before wednesday but if democrats have their way he will soon be well known by every american as an election in ire and antiabortin extremest o slasher of social security an medicar democrats are determined to find johnson in the public iye before he has a chance to efind himself democrats set on wednesdate they were hurriedly digging into johnson's record there ire sixty nine episodes of his podcast on spotify which nson cohost with his wife many of which totch on hot button political topics one democratic operative was quick to spotliht odne such episode as indicative of the gold mine they believes about to be discovered a june fifth showin which to the johnsons spot lighted in initiative sto turn pride monthinto fideliny month micchot sowns can of grate ashelate please go after him on that one the d c c c sentimemo to housdemocratsing house re publicans may be breathing a short sighted si oe relief now they have elected new speaker but there decision to elevate in antiabortion extremest to as pushed to got social security an medicar and whoas one of the main architect of the legal attempt to overtune the twenty twenty lection we will lose them the majority and twenty twenty for he can see them already activating the strategy here is a keme jeffreys yesterday he is the house minority leader bashing johnson right off to that to start with on a consman johnson giving the fact that there apears at least pace on that sound that there is no ment tom behind him is this somebody you believe democrats can work with ha cross the isle te monning ray to be with you i do not know i migh johnson well mase on thes track record he place hes to be an thextreme right win i dealog i mi johnson once the cimalies to wocon car and imose the nason wy man i mi johnson was one of the cheef archi tects tof jine to weill the turn the results of the twenty twenty res an anso letson migh johnson also once that in sosecurity an medi car as we know it those are extreme views and hows demo crats will push back tha ressesibly against than se yet they aregetting ready to a run against johnson again this is what they think theyre gin to be able to dubit yi thins to be a hard sell lobet because johnson does not a pure offensive johnson is very conservative and you can heare him s peaking and he seems reasonable he h c an even jk taper on sianan last nigt who is no friend of the republicans even he was yad johnson is is a very articulate got jeffreys also is trying to ramp up the redrock round january six agan i think it is tired on thinkiton a work i think it was for for lot of americans they want to put in the rearif fu mirror and heir tired of us here is jeoffreys introducing johnson by comparing january six to world wore two they are are many throughout this contry fo underanderly along at the turbbulencs of the moment at the caos to this function and the extreme itim that has been on lef in thi chamber from the very beginning of this congress but this two ha we faith tadversity as a tember eleven two thousand in one when the towers and the pent te gon wat unexpectedly struck killing thousands alive in instant we faith tadversity right here in the house of representatives we on janyeree si two thousand in twenty one a violent mob of instereciives in sited by som in ti tamber over man the hou or a at of an a er the hal the ti o tan ar of power again and this is gong to be the line of attack again seges cn keep going back to this wele over and over and over again again all publicans have to do show some baseline competents here and that that ats hack line goes away these nobody's folking on genuary sex they are focing in on the things happening right now by the way some those things happening right now to the u s g t p grid four point nine per cent annual clip in the third quarter thot was better than expected but in some ways really really problematic because the entire purpose of jacking up the interest rats which you get people two stop spending as much money becaue that is inflating the currency and it is also t it is the price inflation we nowtho wage price fidral people are not saving their money there spending their money according to c and b c the sharp increase came from contributions from consumer spending increase in men toward s exsport to residential investment and government spending the air it is the sumer spending increase four per cent for the quarter after rising just zero point eight per cent ink ku to one f the resons people ar spending much as becaue they believe thatheir dollar s goin to be worth less tomorrow than it is two days shou may as well buy that product they ware goin to put off for six monts you might as well buy right now before it doubles in price government spending an investment jumped four point six per cent as well the stock market did not jump on this news which means that everybody's still understands that there is another shue o drop the othr hue to drop is going to be the inflation staffs which continue to come in hot and a the federal reserve is going to have to raise those interest rates again they are gong to have to do it they do not really have a huge a huge debate over this really according to the waltry journal to combat higin flation the fend is lifted it is pench mark federal funs rate to a range between five poing two five per cent in five point five percenting twenty two year high but the m the possibility of the the econnomy running t this hot is going to probably spur out imagin some talk about the need to raise those interest rates again the the notion again that we are out of the economic woods here i think that that we are wag to early for anything

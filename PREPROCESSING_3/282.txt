when we were weak we told ourselves we were strong sometimes we were very weak we tood ourselves we were very very strong i meanun questionably i was by father must lothed member of my class i think an being a a pasty anathletic kid who was wer'd looking and probby seemed overly eager o and i had friends that would come over on the weak ends for to play but than a school they would ignore me and pretend they did not know me and whe ne was little cris wear the got he redisering spent a lout of time thinging about super powers he drew super heroes over and over trying to get them right he ways wondered where somebody could find o rer you active animal the one tho bit peter parker turned him into the amazing spider man a coupleof times chris thought that e might be developing his own super powers real a there was one morning wher i was standing under the under the shower and coursewhn you get in immediately cause you are cold the water is extremely hot by contrast you have the the cold water turned up and as youe standing thetr you get used to it you turned the cold water down and i wasn there for a very long time an i remember turning the cold and it would not go any farther and i thought that is where it must be stuck and i turned it more and it would not go any farther and dia i realized i was standing under completely hot water but i i was it felt fine to me at actually felt warm almost cool and the longer i stood there it felt cooler and cooler and i the only explanation i could come up with as that i had developed the the ability to withstand extraordinary heat wan of course wed just tron not a hot water but at that time i did not know that that happened i thought hot water was was an endless commodity even did his own superhero called the hurricane we could choot blasts of wind from his hands it was drawin with huge man we muscles e made a hurricant costume that he could were himself wred tea shirt wit a black circle with an ach on it an a mass that his mom made for him and yellow cape hou know somegoid's really gopher cape there were a few times are actually came to school with bits of te superhero costume secreted under my school uni for him i guess i do not exactly know why i guess i thought it was it was it was going to give me some sense of power something thut a corsan i a gimic lass af to change your clothes oi was thinking there is one time i actually this is an tis a sirto for for a superhero but i had actually drawn circuit boards on pieces of paper by ani mans explained other man and i had actually i'd actually taped o them on my legs to look real circuit try exposed as if i had mechanical legs or something that i guess i vaguely thought that somebodye would catch a glimpse of it and think wo lucky's pyoni some of us we spent a long long time hoping that e more than what the world thinks of us and of course we would draw in to these stories these mild bannerd guyes who underneath your closes were a costume in secret the powers nobody suspects and when we gould older it all seemes ridiculous of course it seemed really really dob it is embarrass chris wear though wont on't to draw cartunes for his living but the coartunes that he draws are novels the graphic novels about real people any time a superman type shows up in one of his cartoons he is always somebody trying to carm kids but the costume and cape it is always a disappointment i's just more interesting that way i think he is more a real dad that way i guess the more i draw im the fattery gats ta in the morebaldi guess i guess i if you wore supermanteriou what o you care what you look he would not be all handsome and you just cannot i yout eat whatever you fell you take whatever you wanted any eat and up looking really terrible after a

john hodgman has been conducting an unscientific survey posing for people a very simple choice flit verse is in visibility this question is only for you whichever you pick you will be the only person in the world to have that particular superpower you cannot have both which do you choose i started wondering about this a few years ago i'd bring it up at parties dinners wetting receptions it as more interesting to ask them where people worked or where they went to school and clearly more fun to answer a magic word cozam flyiht vers's invisibility would instantly change an evening's character opening passionate conversation and debate but what surprised me more was how quickly everyone would choose as thog theyhave been thinking about it for a long time every one knew exactly which superpower they wanted and what they would do with it the plans were not always flash your herrelic in fact they almost never were if i could fy the first ing o dous fly into fly into the bar check

walk out leaving her to wonder why there is a tag hanging from the door that says five and no person inside you would become a thief pretty quickly immediately ittill i had all the sweaters that i

the pretty much no one ever says i would use my power to fiht crime no one seems to care about crime hatdoft think i would want o spend alofe time you san my parer for good i mean if i do not have

as necessarily why an not as you a as superstry i might still be weak when i got there i guess o i do not fight crime now and and people without superpowers do sor in theory yes but you nom not and what can i do at is i may either one of those i see you need a whole package is not much you can do with any one i'd go to paris thi supose at's not being superios well they may i could be e going paris man that sort of a superhero going to paris man is not a superere and i have to say the strove me crazy little bit we are after all talking about superpowers why not take down organized crime bring hope to the hopeless swear vengeance on the underworld if only a little pit i proposed a variety of sample cenarios along these lines such as how would you handle a mad genius taking over the

or flying man and i had to lay down some rules in visibility means the power to become transparent a will including your clothing but anything you may pick up is visible flight means the power to fly at any altitude within the earth's atmosphere at speeds up to one thousand miles pr hower but even then they start looking for loopholes hidden catches superpower fine print they start negotiating

flight who chooseis invisibility and who chooses fly in my experience though therr lots of exceptions mendling toward flying womento invisibility and many brewd anxiously over their choice switching from one to the other and back again and that is because more than the ability say to burst into flame or shoot arrows with uncanny accuracy flighten in visibility touch an nerve actually they touched too different nerves speak to very different primal desires and unconscious fears my friend cristine chosein visibility what if ta power is about something that is obvious n the other is about something that is hidden an indicates your levelop shame how do you mean a present hiches is to fly has tothing to hide a personage is o be invisible wants clearly to hide themselves do you feel

invisibility the vilain almost every one i talk to called invisibility the sneakier power flying as for people l you want to let it all ing at in it isability is for fearful crouching master bers first of all i think that a lot of people are get to tell you that they would choose flight and i think theyre lying to you i think they'r saying that because they try to sound all mythic and heroic because the better angels of our nature would tell us that the real thing that we should strive for is flight and that that is noble an all that can stuff but i think actually if everybody were being perfectly on us with thou they would tell ou the truth which is that they all want to be invisible that they can shop lift get nto molies for free go to excotic places on air place without paying for air line tickets and watch celebrities have sex at any one face with this choice in their heart of hearts wut choosein visibility yes or they have the a sort of inflated heroic mythical concept of themselves and da that infect they are not really giving during which brehe tot n you mhend is not ic question of what kind of person flies and what kind of person fates we all do both perhaps that is why when i put the choice to myself an hopelessly completely stuff the heart of this decision the question i really do not one of things is this who d you want to be person you hope to be the person

was going out for one of my first bierres back in the states not long into the first one i notice this amazon of a woman with huge blond and red street hair and frosty lips wearing a short red tank dress and at least fifty bracelets she six feet tall and showing a lot of lag people at the bar swibele their heads to watch her every move she stands next to me to order a drink and in this throaty voice says what are those ponting to my cigaretts i tell her their cambodian her eyes light up and she shoots out a long tan arm and points at a table in the corner she orders me there before i can say now a'm following her to my seat she tells me she is ich international private investing hre a bounty hunter and o mail bonds is foreser and that her name is zora i sit there for ours was man to ner within a week she takes me to lost fagus we drive there in her red mustang as alwayse there is a colt three eighty under the drivers seat and of forty five magastar in the trunk in vagest we tip thic asinos and had straights for the male strip clubs where zora drops at least two hundred dollars on lap dances from buff scies with names wromanc her get up is the same as before tease hair jewelry and the ubiquitos tank dress which i realize is the best way to show off her tatoos ont is this big circle with blue and white swirls in it kind of a bowling ball on her left shoulder every guy she meets asks her about it and when they hear her answer they sometimes proposed marriage turns out the tattoo is a magic globe she holds in her dreams and in these dreams it gives her superpowers ever since i remember i've had the dreams and they are very vivid but it veries it usually involves fighting sometimes with guns sometimes a with super her powers lighting from my fist in all that and i usually have have superstrenthan i can fly and i have all those things and it is my most commonstead of dreams in it baries is sometimes as neval sometimes as ficturistic sometimes s a gorilla wor in lat america can you describe that zora to me the zora in dreams very powerful athletically a but beyond the rules of nature that this world alows the six foot five and long almost impossibly long silver hair the sort of other worldly quality to er where her voice sound did not sound normal i sounded almost musical it became something thats i aspire to be a spire to be this sort of superhero this sort of person who would fight for a cause that was my motivation in life ever since i was ten or eleven i desounded that that was my gol zora took the dream seriously zo seriously that at the age of twelve she sat down and composed a list of some thirty skilles she needed to learn if she wanted to become as close to a superhero as any mortal could be she even gave herself a dead line to master these skills by the time she was twenty thre thts a nes zora pulls out the old spiral notebook that was her diary at the age of thirteen and turns to the inside back cover there is list she uld red t mok the list i included marcelarts electronics chemistry metaphysics and gliding helecoter an airoplaing plying perestruting mountain climbing survival threw out her teams in onies each time she started in e diary she would elptate the list and write it in the back of the book eri each one with the same foremat each one titled a the list weponry rafting scubidiving erbology yes i studied that sepiarforsat in mountain a emergency kind of medicine the list also in cludes body building archerying demolitions and explosive she wanted to learn how to hunt animalls and track men i have major physical conditionin and the most incredible thing about all this is that zora accomplished nearly every item on the list throwing stars an compound bows and thrawing knives and yes it was a very interesting pastime to keep up with the goals set by the list she sped through school starting in the seventh grade she began completing entire school years during the summer term and finished high school by the time she was fifteen she got her b a at eighteen a masters at twenty and completed the corse work for a p h d and gopolitics by the time she was twenty one she wanted to live

kid you have these romantic visions of what you will be when you grow up but how many people are diligent they commit their dreams to paper and make it their life's work to achieve them how many keep a list amending adding to it taking things off as they go along well into their adult live after finishing the course work for her p h d re r decided to quit school disappointed at the lack of cliff hanging adventure and her doctral programme and since super heroes who live in the real world need jobs she decided to seek employment at the only place that would allow her to put all the skills from the list to use zora wanted to become an agent in the c i a and began a rigorous application processt interviews psychic ams a three day lie detect her test after that than the the sent investigators out to iinterview me interview my neighbors interview exploy friends interview friends ex friends former colleagues people at work with you pleaase to work with they threwh a question out in the middle of an interview what would you do in the situation if a if you were driving down the road and you had a whone if youre nad iv agents with you some one whos going to give you some information and you were in ha third wold country somewhere and yu you were driving a car and you iccidently ran into oa dog and people hade been outplaying the street children in the street they see ther dog et killed and they get upset they rush towards the car what you do in that situation you do not want to draw attention to the person whois with you what i said was that i was a sow agent to get down lower in the car and i would get out of the car and a draw the attention myself and try to appease them in som wives either by giving them money more am but but and that was in axceptual ans wit ud antion at the time when i was going through the crocess it felt everything was coming together and i had not felt much joy shalle ever you tell hem about your dreams absolutely not i woul tell them that i had a sense that i could combine the whole street smars intellectual the education was the sort of adventurs personality and i was actually told that i had to perfose personality for it and that and that i would do really well it was the fruition of my life that it was going to be the step into the next whereit where i would be using all that list in preparation for the next phas which would be to actually put it into practice about eight months into the interviews zora got a letter saying she would been rejected she appealed over the next year and a half partly to find out why theyd turned her down but the best they could do was to tell her to try again in a few more years in the end the c aa would not take her and they would not even tell her why parly it took me more two years to recover i was a basket case i i was not i was not i was just down i would have to work i could not concentrate throg slump down staring at the wall i i put my whole life into examination all the years of preparation an n nmost of us give up our dreams of superhero adventure when were adolescons zora was only getting to it at the age of twenty seven here she knew how to fly at helicoppd er and survive in the wilderness but for what she devoted a lot of time to thinking about why she might have been rejected by the c aa maybe it was all those months she spent with right wing militias doing her doctor on reserge maybe she should not have told the c ae how she ended up in a clandeston i ra club one night while on vacation an irelan maybe the c ae did not the fact that her father a professor at the university of minesoda is an outspoken surbian nationalist or maybe it was simply her own fault that she could not turn herself into a superhero i had violated the agreement of the list violated the agreements of of that i made with myself that i had not become what what that the archetype was that iad become something lacking the point being thats at that my methology should have guided me better and it felt such a final thing zora we made herself she had been virtually isolated from other people since she was fifteen when she started actively pursuing the goals on the list her parents were happy she was busy cause she had no time ways but now she started working for a woman private investigator one day when she went to cort she wore her first pair of pantios because she was told it would help her look more feminine soon after she was schooled in the sheer power of lips a short skirt and a supermodel runway walk to control the minds of others these days sh

is known as a reverse scam the agency was hired by the family of a young woman who would recently traveled there and fallen in love with a man she plan to marry after knowing im for only ten days the family suspected some sort of con zora contacted him pretending she was looking for a girl friend who used to work with him in the travel industry she took a photo of a classmate with her to begin the scam i sort of playe the distressd american student going to the spanish school and he invited me on a couple of dates and ask me to i come back for the bullfight what did you where no i wor a little

within he never mention that there was ever a woman am and he i found him to be pretty emotionally open and very romantic gui but i honestly felt that he probably was not in love with her that he was taking is as an opportunity live in the united states and that was the report i gave before zora set out for mexico i wrode with her to the air porit we relate in hurrying through the terminal just ten minutes to spare when she did the strangest thing she sat down in a chair far from the gate and would not move i told her she was going to miss her flight but she did not budge i sat down next to her she said she was scaired about the case about which disguise she might wear about being found out no she said she said she was afraid that when she got to mexico people would not her the next time i was at her house i had not nnotice before but i realized her bookshelf was packed with advice on how to build confidence tidles princhessa mockyavelit for women books that are not really far from the idea of keeping a list having an on going plan for self improvement believing that if he just put something on paper and stick to it you can change zora still has her list but while the old list was all about being perfect and saving the world the new list is very different i need to learn how to play tennison gall an my new list is when serfing ten is gulf am i need ded develop some kind of

superheroes created by the comic book companies it is rare for any of them to lask more than a few wishes the websight gone and forgotten is as far as we can tell the authoritative arcive of these failed supersouls the got whe runs the sight under the title your humble editor isjonathan maris he says that the few great superheroes have some common sense things going for them one they have powersthat make in toit of sense too they have a reason for fighting crome three this stories have a human touch to them you can relate to them he agreed to come into the studio with a stack of some of the comics that do not quite measure up to those superstandards i'm trentifind a very good one a catonicomics with me i let us see we have got ta captain marvell is one of the character's feature on the webside his amazing powers that he can split by which we meen his limbs fall off and then flail around i'm hopefully i imagine widing up the criminal i'm not getting he says split his arms legs and head fall off and he screams yow i popped apart and with the word zam he re turns to a returns te normal that is i atlying into action i do not even know why that is one of the most disturbing things ive ever heard this this company has a had a a number of characters who shared their names with preexisting characters they had a plastic man i who appearanest very issue in fact but he was nothing a the the famous plastic man which ereis always an embarrassment and he' be ordering he be ordering on line or he gets his mal all the time a igt you make a reservation an a restaurant that he show up and noi talwe thought you were the other plaspera and tere's there is even a point where he hears people youll plastir man on the street and he is not he is long past the point wes think an maybe they mean me know he knows they ant im to bring all the preses with me and ras pres the te first tean president of the united states im a rather earnest young man name press ricard becoms and with a name that how could he not he becomes the first teen age president of he nited states there this is a this is the issue right before he has to fight vampires to which i is not acos inlyy ias where the president had but apparently it is rather important au now what is his superpower whtwhat on a president does he make well he is he kind of fits him that dock savage that man mould where he is mostly a very well trained human and thinks to his indian companion eagle frees menagerie of animals he learns the learn several animal skills helping teach pres reckord how to be fastes a an antalod swing a monkee fight a baringis i've always thought that that the united states presidents he would be much more effective if the president had the powers to communicate in controul the animals wy this one thing that press proves it is that tha there is nothing that the president consolved with two fifts and anyin companion and a small army of birds and el if you were to explain to people the characteristics of a bad comic book superhereout there are a yather obviously a lot of ways you can screw up im one of the ways is to just overdo it and and cram the the elements the character down the reader's throats a one o the the characters was b mn and everything about him was bees his full name was bery e ems a he was attacked by mutint bees which were sent to earth by space alien b people and he himself became a mutint b person who had be powers and lived in a hive and eat honey and stole gold because gold looked honey and he could sting you there is nothing be related this man refused to do it is if you you you meet somebody at a bar you start talking to m you realize he only has one interest in live that is exactly would beverything would have gotten back to bees you strark time by whic yo watch on telliwich on last nihtill say you nott sun interesting yo one bes a aa a a ahe serim comic superhere as come out of particular a moments in the nation's history positively i that is another thing that that really works against a characters when their tied in too tightly to a fad or a tiht in too tigely to something that is identifying an aira there is a character created in the seventies but who is supposed to be retro character from the fifties name of three d man to help hook up on the threedy movies there were a craze in the fifties terrible flat character nothing going on and when you say three deeman what was his power h a ad a a matrical pair of glasses and i have the strength of three man and that is it he was as strong as three people fast as three people whatever that means proly three times faster that human bing i they always destrabe is as something as much as three men but i do not see he can be three times as be the have the agility of three men t they this three gies were asual as make any sense hii have little trouble of threeding part of the problem with the with just naming off the superheroes are goingtrough their powers is that on the face value there is not a superhee who does not seem silly a because he have to dd to a point where the man's wearing a costruum and he is driving round fighting crime and then where it ies the line comway they rise above that do you have ae theory on this about what makes a good one in a bad one i have sort of a half formed theory i know that one of the things that really a helps the superpower to get over with the audience get over with the readers is a if it' something they can apply to their normal lives perhaps by way of fantasy and that is i think why superstrength superspeed a if voner ability urges general toughness are often common youan get on the court with it get that superaccuracy and get a slamm dog from mid courts and and really just school over somebody thand that is harily a superpawer you want a but when you start getting into powers am one carac to who had magnetic eyes of superpower which is a little too eceteric to youven understand the i do not even undersyellit what does it mean magnetic eyes of superpower but yand his first appearance he announced that he had magnetic eyes of super power they would they would

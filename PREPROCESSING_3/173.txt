depend on me a little lesce ors trid to move in that direction i try to help him at the kitchen table i surround us with posted notes and colorful markers ready to brain storm if you can have anything what do you wanted to be i'm defintly morn to this future planning than he is he is closing his eyes and starting to fall sleep dead o s how he hav to that queston i do not know to make a goal my dad once told me before i go to bed i should in vision the things i want a accomplice that he used to do that nd that is how he came to a merica and that is always worked for me but i cannot convince him to make any goals i pick up a marker and stoard doing it for him you anto be come into pendit i'm blinded by my own determination to move him forward maybe he does need to sleep but that is now what i'm thinking right now i'm afraid i write down a few more goals walk without my walker change clothes by myself how about cookin for myself an't my daughter about that as on wat's in dat dead e there his eyes are close he is tapped out and am i no one ever told me my father would become in te pennin again no nurse told me he would or would not walk without his walker no doctors told me he would or would not drives i do not kno what is realistic which means i'm in my own ideal world and i'm just winging its i'm making up these goals im want to imagine a better life for him and he is improving little by little day by day he is able to sit down and stand up on his own but i notice he is not making his bed he is able to walk more confidently but he is not going outside he is able to stay awake longer but he is not being social he spends hours in the middle of the day lying in his bed doing nothing that is when i'm the most frustrated with him i storm into his room or i cry to myself in a corner exhausted by my own emotions i call up a budthist friend who just encourages me to just let him be and to love him exactly as he is to re spect his life if he leaves his bedroom or not i start writing that phrase down every day for myself i will respect my father's life i will love him exactly as he is something i've never written down before and this becomes my new goal to hold my tongue to say less it is hard i slip up all the time i specially when it comes to his medication dad did you take your medication yet i's ten ofclock you waresppoth to taket at nine thirty sometimes i catch myself you are doing that thing again you are making it sound he is messing up buts some days i cannot stop did you drink your water to day i interrogate him are you sure your waterbottle looks full i'm starting to realize it is the small stuff i say every day the little things that can ship away at him the most because that is what he did to me when he gets all as i focas on how he did not do the dishes it takes me a while i ventually i do get better when it is two in the afternoon and i notice that my dad has been lying in bed for the past three hours i go into his room and i ask if he

r glass to day's programm youere it stories of the people whos step up and say i will take care of this i've got this and the very very unexpected places that can lead them we have rive to dact two of our show at two game of phones sever the last fo years tat one of our producers hon te cuffey wald has been checking him with somebody who decided that they were going to be it forever ago and where is the mantal will she is school principle likes being a charge thes grate about the whole thing of the buck stopping with her she is very consistent about it except for one choic she made thepon i did not understand he sheis a school principle is a pretty classic yer it job it is all you when the school needs new math books a new crickulem a new budget you are it a pipe broke and now the science class from is fletted you are it students got into affied at lunch seven teachers called in sic today and now there are fourteen minutes to rearrange the entire scedule and communicated to every one involved all you because of this the jok tends to attract a certain type of person a person who believes they can or shoud or needs to be the one called on in any given moment often that not always this is also a person who as quick to color code has contingency plans for everything and loves a system you will find variations you have got your brilliant visionary types and the parking rules people the person whose taskless are alphabetical and the person who is more playing it by ear and talks about wholding space doctor theresa hell is somehow a little bit of all of these people the perstime i tried to describe her to some one else i found myself saying she is just such a principle when i first talked to her doctor hill had recently become arizona principle of the year i heard of teacher of there i didnt no principle of the ras a thing but it is and in twenty twenty one doctor hell was the one who as picked yet knows it was just a phone call i was in my office it was tha summer there was in the lot going on and a received the calf congratulations you are the arizona principal the year why do you think you on ah who knows i do that is a fake out question i know doctor hill's assistant principle nominated her you are actually suppose to apply yourself that the assistant princple new doctor hall would not actually do it she got the ball rolling writing quote doctor hill has built the culture at walden grove high school from the ground up it is one of the schools that is friendly and warm people feel excited about what they do a few months aftor doctor hale is elevated to principle of the year that is when she made a choice that seemed unlike her the opposite of everything she is that story begins in august twenty twenty one and you remember this time coved then schools reopening their teacher shortages parents angry about masks and having to keep their kits home and when i sauit doctor hale facing vachaos and vitriol of that miserable period of time i thought ow just watch this women on this mast we are about to see all the wizardry of principalness brought to bear on the situation she is gen a raness right in here is a things lot lik at doc tor hill school the county had mandated that students had ta quarrentine if they were exposed to covit at school and were not fascinated doctor hale enforced this mandat parents pushed back won group of parents came to her school and refuse to weave the lobby after one of their kits at to quarrntine they were there for hours they were arrested they found themselves being arrested posteted on mine and the vidiars made headlines and after that doctor hale's office administrator said there were angry voice mell messages on the school phone and i went to her and said haan i need you to send me those messages and she just shook her head at she had tears in her eyes and she was you do not want to hear these messages i told her it is o ke i just said i in i understand i know i know they are not good i just i need them just send em to me it is oket why did you need them well e everything that i did always was from a perspective of i'm not going to make you do something that i'm not going to do myself and i was not going to put that on her to have to sort through 't i mean and tha't kind of the way that i i dealt with anything is a principal its i'm the leader of the school and i need to make sure that i'm taking care of things principal hale assumed the voie males were about the vidios that were circulating on mine blaming her for enforcing the county quarrentine rules angry messages on the schoolvoice mal went straight to the bottom of her to do wist and i wnt about my day and did all the normal things of what i would do where i'm out supervising for lunch and supervising before school between classes going into classes whatever just doing my normal seeing and in it was not until the end of the day when once the buss is have left and kid and teachers are kind of leaving then i started listening to em hop your principl your yo ric your hi l orere wantin bok waon yet you in you a bliviin that was the first one iwhon i say if your sensitive to provanity this does not let up principal hell kept listening yyou are metting wor cring begin to peopl a united day beer shepl gectin bil epl youu better ceck your helt but wore right shan on yugod youbidout yout buk a now in the first for you i'm not really affected personally i guess you knon'tly mean i can hear people or mad i can hear that there tenting whatever i can deal with all that i'm a high school principal i deal with all kinds of conflict right it is is something of the world an not here to make everybody love me no big deal but definitely when the forth one comes om thend things get real yo wit yo wat y yo hall at on i to rea te hell l o wall te e li wil now tat ter a wakiner an she di you everybody can our faver an do yer maybe ten i i than i we dildou may beu on backward you con you am maye yet you into ta shoken ayo tin o ye u ble yo e yo beta walkou it doctor hell paused she was sitting alone in her office door closed listening on speaker fone and she would been clicking through the messages next message next message until this one i'd never received anything that as a principal as a teacher i mean wo what the hack oya ya ye eat the end of a shokgun maybeyou should eat the end of a shockgun she slowly repeated the words of the messages to herself and then she got back to work o k i think i neen i nee to save these they were telling me that they were going a su me and i thought what i want to make sure that i have this on record and as i was listening to the first to them for the first time i was also transcribing them am you started transcribing word for word what people were saying ye your boy howard an te denir her freedom she typed cowards deniars of freedom there are forty messages these a a she was playing them on speakerfon and her assistant principle overheard came in to help doctor hell transcribed in case she needed these messages for something in the future maybe is evidence she thought obl weand up o go you do how ould ot can approtat wo we would direct re you what walking home blety facking homes doctor hell types as a person who has transcribed a lot of idia because of my jab he takes a really long time and if you were trying to get at wrd for word you have to go back over and over again ye i mean the were times wh i was i we would look at each onels did they say this sor to they that and she would say i heard this anlow all i heard this will let us played again and weud layed again to be did he say you definitely ar sick ass or you sock ass right oh ya mo my gad ye i was typing away i would stop i would go back type again and unfortunately i could not just go back a little bit i literally when i went to restart i would have to listen to the message from the very beginning all the way through again i mean men it was brutal but she kept going all the way through the end she could get this under control she could create a useful document and i'm not talking about a simple transcript tell me about the foremat but why did you this is a spread she why did you choose to do it this way i guess on a mast he ter re she ans forth an i word it has coums you say tha massage number the time the day the fo number of the person ye it feels to me a ut when i sauht i was lok of course she is a principl shas organize clear n ormation did feel you were interacting with it in the way that you might a school be et or ye i mean i even am high lighted you could see this is a direct threat this is an implied threat i just felt it was a lot more organize this way and i think that is part of of why i did it something i can control getting the full number writing down what is exactly said i think that transcribing actually it helped me detach myself from what was being said and make it more a job i do not o somi any sense that makes much sense that makes much sense yeh principal hell sent her sprege to the superintendent noting the threats that mades tonin investigating by police helpfully color coted by degree of danger same way she may have shared say a color chart that allows you to assass and visualize student a she meant it is not an obvious choice to respond this way but everything she did in responsity's messages feut inline with who she is and how she operat she managed it she contained the problem and shielded everyone else from unnecessary distress she did not share the messages with any one else her collagues her husband she told her family she would got in some threats and to be on alert for strange cars and she began parking in the back of the school and entering that way she told me she imagine if some one was waiting to snipe or out when she arrived for work in the morning thed be sitting by the front door she said this casually not a person who was panic or scared but a person who was taking appropriate steps to deal with the problem it was handle and then we get to the choice that i did not understand principal hell quik in the middle of the school year just six months after she was named principl of the year she left her job she did not leave immediately after the harassment she kept going to work for a couple months but the voice mells started to get to her the think about listening to something over and over is that it stays with you that was the accidental side effect of transcribing these messages principal hell says the words becamin grained in her head and she would find herself in immeding or supervising lunch outside and they pop back ub i find my self in the courtyard not talking anybody just in my own little world sitting there by myself not interacting with kids and and doing the things that i to do i am a pretty positive person an i to keep things liht and move forward and and this was heavy on me you could not you could not move forward at the time i could not no and i i had a hard time because deep down how you feel you do not feel good and yet it is not helthy for any one in your organization to know how you feel se i mii know you put you put on a happy face and what is that don some principal thing that people cannot know how you feel yehi guess i mean people want leaders who are strong but who are not emotional and an i do not i do not ever want a put my own burdens and my own challengees on my people doctor hell is good at keeping what she feels to herself that even after we tacked about this for hours i still did not understand why she had to leave why this was the thing that she could not shake off but then months after she left her job doctor hell gave testimony in court and she spoke candidly in public about her experience aball this for the first time the parents who would not weave her school were charged with trespassing therewas a whole trial they were found guilty and then the judge asked doctor hell if she wanted to say anything did she want a share the effect this had on her and she did she talked about her fear and this time she was not all casual in describing avoiding the front entrance of the school i goin o school in i ii i shooting an i a o official i in you ein i natin or eier an aer aere i here or iii here di yo on hon tii nai ei ain me is not we a hl oen n n hatin me matme an worle te ei en hat aan yo aol nowr in mi wha n yer i here win o me o ool i e here she said to the judge you have to understand what i had to listen to o on a inni i oo ton here is i n oin a al i i a o oe ha the judge gives permission to cuss and doctor hale who had prepared nothing has nothing written down begins repeating the messages forbad em it is she is been waiting to let them out i al on on s olten thi i e oe oni or oon i a i in her ias oi i an n foon o o o o i o weare o honn school were coming to yor an i ern in here o wor o a friend of mine and assistant principle for decades now told me she still remembers his mentor explaining early on that the job of he school leader is never inflict pain on an institution the job is to absorb pain for the institution it must be confusing to be any kind of public official right now trying to absorb the pain of the last few years how many principls or election officials or public health officials were pry ministers of countries have scrambled to respond to a public that is rageful by doing what they know how to do by throwing power points of people by holding public hearings printing out colored charts only to finally understand that all the victial and misinformation was always going to be too enormous for any one person to absorb principal hell sheelded everyone else from distress and till it was only hers but it was not just the words om it was the isolation that i felt wit it i felt i was all alone in dealing with the situation that is what made me say i cannot do this any more many of these voice mills are asking for you to resign yet then when you did did it feel ike ah i do not want a give them what they wanted of course of course but i had to really dig deep and do what was best for me what was best for her was the one choice that was completely out of character something far from her principlness and all her familiar moves she decided not to be it any more udge of roald is

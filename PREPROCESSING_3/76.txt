the menshvarsh responsor by expressivepian protect your on mine privacy today at express vepiantacams flashmen less than a month ago we saw the worst attack on jews since the halocost since then we have also seen the worst globalsbik in antisemitism since the halocost according to royders quote in contries where figures are available from police or civil society groups including te united states briton france germany and south africa the pattern is clear the number of anti semetic incidents as gone up since october seventh by several hundred per cent compared with the same period last year such incidence range from verbal abuse to thrats to property attacks to actual assaults some are happening on our nation's camises this one happened at harvard where the editor of the harvard larovyou ubrakim batamo joined in ha oundyour student presin your studen around again one an people is som the editor of the harvard arovia as ire semitism also extends into the administrative hauls of our universities georgetown just hired the ratical antisemite anisa johnson as new assistants rector of academic affairs here are some of her posts sis july seventh quot ever since going to annuwive a deep seeted hatred for zyo bleaps they bring out the worst in me why i calld them zyobleaps because their dogs this is the kind of person who apparently gets hired at george temeanwhile iliaschipero a law professor was thrown out of his job for the crime of suggesting that jobidon was picking judicial nominese based on rase which he said himself meanwhile some jewish businesses are being boycotted for the crime of being jewish businesses according to the washington post more than thirty jewish eteries in markets in philadelphia are now being hit with boycott organize by a procamas group because they are quote owned by sionists even some shops that are not even own by jews are being boycotted because they serve has rali food because according to the phily palistine coalition such a food is quote a means of eracing palistinian existence on quote but there something peculiar about all the medureports about the extravagant spike an antisemitism every single story also carry's notes about supposedly concommitent rise in his lamaphobia this is odd to say the least what bhehell does lamaphobia have to do with antisemitism the anser is precisely nothing precisely nothing that is unless you wish to suggest the response to antisemitism is linked with his lamaphobia that if you wish to oppose ratical moslamantisemitism that in fact is in aspect of his lamaphobia which of course is precisely what antisemites are suggesting these days take for example quorrisailor of the council on american islamic relations care is most frequently cited group in america on quote rising is lamaphobia car is also group that by the way was an unindited coconspirator in the trial of chomas front charity the holy land foundation sailor himself refuses to cantem bocotts on jewish businesses he told the washington postquote it is one hundred per cent on the table to criticise supporters of is ralia partie caritself accuses israel of quotetextbook athnic clensing and war crime for defending itself trots out antisomic extrordinary landus are sore and promotes the hamasli that israo bom to hospital of course it was palcinian is lomicy hod on october seventh the date of the comas masker car national tweeto quote we join the american muslem community in reaffirming our support for the palistinian people's right to freedom and calling for an end to the s really occupation which sparks the deadly violencs that we see again and again including today on october seventh before any is raily response at all care also called for an end to americand eight to israel and the abrahamicords the group has not offered a single word condeming comas in other words careis antismetic good thing the bide administration infamously invited care to partisipate in its national antisemitism strategy back in may care is by any stretch of the imagination a giant pomenter of antisemitism but that of course is the point of pocusing on supposeit is lamaphobia the goal is to treat response to antisemitism as a form of is lamaphobia for example sailor claims it is his lamaphobia to publicized the names of students who signed petitions siding with cmas while simultaniously claming its not antisemitism to bikit jewish business is because their jewish fascinating columbia university is playing the same game the president of columbia university sent out a letter yesterday prising the quotepersistente and perseverance of students who have signed letters supporting comas after their names and faces have ben shown publicly opposing comas means is lamaphobia apparently the legacy media fill the same way too that is precisely wy sin toctober seventh the media have rushed to link antisemitism and is lamahobia tas though the two phenomena are part of a sycle of hatred that the disgusting wrong tate that excuses antisemaitism through false charges of his lamaphobia buts an extrordinarly commontake on the left these days one variation on the theme comes from alexandera o coso cuortes wh as now emerged as on of the nations leading antisemics she now accuses the american israel public affairs comittee of quo being an extremest group at tempting to undermine american democracy antarganing members of color yes those wily jews and their dirty sheckles are clearaly the problem as antisematism around the nation spikes they must be stopped according to ao se the bide administration itself is falling into the trap of linking antisematism andis lamaphobia a link that has the purposeful goal of demonizing opposition to comas fearful of their own base the bide administration announced yesterday a white house national strategy to combat is lamaphobia again in the midle of the worst spike an antisemaitism of my lifetime or my parents lifetime coresion parics plan quote for too long muslims in america an those perceived to be muslem such as arabs and seeks have en jured disproportionate number of hate fueld attacks tand other discriminatory incidents in actuality seeks aur targeted far more often than muslems according to the afbiai despite representing just a few hundred thousand people in the united states jews represents round sixty per cent of all victims of federally moniter hate crime despite representing about two per cents of the american population but is lamaphobia is the real issue here is vice president comala heris announcing the new initiative yesterday as e result of the homateraitacanatria anhumanitan hisisencasa we have seen an atic in antihatenin anti er antisemeti anislamaphobi ansiden acras america including the rudalataof hatenen american lin lismaslam and the killing of six yer old ta sensless at avaent thet the department is justice is investigating as hey ha ha posomany people an ornation the past few days and weeks hv brought about all to familiar fears fears at they wion't be tarteted profils or tat simply because of who they are how they wors or how they look again linking these two things is ridiculous the case that she sites by the way which is a horrifying crime against a palistinian american at mom and her chil horrifying more fine crime condemned by literally everyone you cannot find a jew in america who will not condemn it however you can find care national that will not condemn comos why is the white house playing this scame because theire a tempting to buy back the support of radical muslems ofcross the united states hore in rage that the white house has cided with israel instead of comass the latest pulse show that nearly six and ten american muslems agree that commoss was justified in attacking israel thas part of their struggle for a palisinian state the white house is trying to buy off the comos fans by jabbering about the supposed victimhood to which those comas fans are subjected it is perverse it continues to drive a false narrative that opposition to comass and opposition to comas fans is opposition to muslems more broadly a proposition that muslems themselves should reject although we are still waiting for a lot people to do the moder muslems have been conspicuously silent if the bide administration feels the necessity to keep radical muslems in teir electoral colision by pandring at's tha something prity nasty about their moral statur infiting anti semitism as they claim they actually want to do in just one second wi'll get the situation in britan which is going to become a lot worse ove thecourse of the next few weeks first i tell you it' been very strustful period an traveling a lot it is hard for me to get my fruits and veggies ondo

and get the healthy nutrans that you require to get you through the day balance of nature dot com promocode should puro o caso over in britan a lot of this is gen a com to a head because apparently there is a planned pro comas rally a million strong march in favor of comass and of course against those horrible jews who are defending themselves in israel theye can do it on remem bran stay according to the uk exprest an m p is now called for the military to be drafted in to keep the peace in london tafter emerge that he is protestors are organizing the march on remembrance sday thapplan ta of the protest november eleventh will clash directly with these years remembrance stay it comes a day before the annual senis ave memorial for emembrance sunday despite the head of the met sir mark rally telling the london assembly the protesters quat will not be allowed to near the official events or to destruct them they are serious concerns about how such a large protest can take place whele maintaining law and order a tory m p has told the express that the metropoliton police and tity con who is the mayor of london must ask for military assistans crawley m p hanry smith's ad quote after consecutive weeks of demonstrations where the senataf another national monumentshave been grossly disrespected it is completely in appropriate for further protest to be held over remembrance we ken i' that i enough confidence the mare of london or them at police under him to properly handle the situation given thei'r past poor record and that of course is exactly right mean the fact is that the west imported a huge number o radical muslims who hate jews and hate the west and whohave ben taking advantage of the great material benefpicins of the west to live there thet's not every muslem they are many muslins who are happy to live in a place briton or the united states and who are happy to engage with lestern countries and imbibed from the well of lestern values they are many of those people the're just not the people whe're marching in favor of commoss and those people at they are a lad of those people and trying to pretend that what traing pretend that is not happening in the face of images they are extraordinary from places london or from a meris merica's colge camptus that is absolutely foolhardy now what is amazing about all this is that because the media have basically taken the side of commssinis conflict which was the most predictable thing they swivel directly from we cannot believe the catrocity the cmmoss created to israel is comitting atrocities every single day its absolute terribles the occupation to stateso that paroting every commostolking point because of that your starnency wavering inside the bidan administration and and it is it is only coming from a ratical few by the way it does show the power ofthe legacy media and for all the talk about a legsy media has been challenged or overthrown at's true them min completely overthrown they sewl than enormous amount of weight with members for example of the bid dministration all it takes is a radical few people to apparently move the democratic coalition tuart placating commoss in some way yesterday the jobidon was at a fund razor and at this fund razor he was yelldat by a a a person calling himself a female rabbi on this person again has about as much to do with judiism as a buttered lobster here is a here is quoteon quote rabbi justa cot rosenburg who is neither a rabbi nor apparently a woman a calling for a sease fire jobidon then answered quote i think we need a pause appause

america democratic young voters our gainst israel but everybody else in the united states is very much in favor of israel whiping away homos in fact pulling dater from eshelan insights quote who do

twenty two percents on shore i mean that is strong supports that is very very strong support four israel in the battle ground states this a popular position in fact even among demographic groups that the bid administration is gon just proportionately rely upon save for example black voters black voters support israel over comoss in who ise responsible for the the svilling cashalties they sa homoss fourty four percent two twenty per cent in fact even among young voters quart supposedly bidins quordemographic thirty per cent of people aged eighteen twenty nine say homos twenty four per cent say

atfar o they teo in te i case that is mikey green bland he is going up people people express support for the conuat oppressed without thinking about what are the oppressed are actually oppressed or actually good and that is one of the reasons why you see young people constantly resinating to the wrong side of conflicts they constantly do this they look at any conflict and because they have been taught to think in a deconstructionist way because they think of all relationships as relationships of power and his what the have been taught in their schools what them ben taught in their universities because when they the first thing tey do is they say whose powerful and who has less power and whoever is powerful must be bad an whoever is power liss must be exploited oppressed and they arefore good and of course that is lie but theydo not think about any of that stuff an to they sign onsto these movements until it is too late obviously now the thing about this is that the democrats should know better but apparently they do not now you are hearing rumblings that the bidin administration is going to try to put pressure on israel for some sort of humanitarian sees fire or to ship fuel in to the gosastrip let men explain somethng bout this fuel situation come oss pas hundreds of thousands of gallans of fuel they are using it to maintain their presents in these tunnels because when the fuel goes out all their generators go out when t generators glike count if underground they would have to come up and actily fight the srailies men instead of rats but instead what they are doing is they are staying down in the tunnels and they are hiding their civilians on top said if israel has to strike the tunnel civilians get killed and thn they can go to the compliant press the complacent press the procom oss press and then get those people to minic their line that israels attempting to kill civilians when israel is the only party in this conflict attempting to minimize the killing of civillians i should point out at this point the commoss is the governing power he gos astrip any governing powers first responsibility es to protect its citizens that is the first responsibility in hi nots because israel for it for example right now cause belos threatening on the northern border is rel oo thirty thousand of its own citizens and move them inland from the northernport known talks about that of course that is a population movement of jews do not cares about that by thewaysbeing of other population movements packastan is now expelling one point seven million aff gans from pack stand back into have canistan now on carrskos mslemy muslin the matter becaue when muslims do horrible thingsto muslims no one cares at all in fact thats the turns out whn muslens do horrible things to juse lod people do not seem to care very much it is only when choos defend themselves that people really seem to start carrying alot in any case gaza is filled with fuel it just all contral by commoss when you ship in more fuel it is not going to power the hospitals it is going to power commoss in fact there is a reason why commoss apparently has station virtually all its fuel sources under all shef a hospital not's power the hospital they ben clanning they'l shove a hospitals running out of fuel and literally a few yards underground is the fuel why beause t v fuell is not going to the hospital that is the whole point s when you have people jo bidin telling israel to ship fuel in that is immediately an be stole by comas to power their tunnels all you ar doing is prolonging at this conflict all you r doing is making the situation worse meanwhile yoave tony blinkin trying to tell israel that maybe maybe maybe there should be some seize firers they do not to stragy let me make the s la israel on a time line has been engaged in the ground conflict part of this war for less than a week for less than a week and and already the west is starting to lose its nerve again no shock from some of the usual sauspects in of course prompted by the procomas media t's already ye's starting to see the wavering members of the democratic colition they were gon to be that is all the the most left wing members of the democratic colition it is senteredic durban from illinoi that is an erdic durban is the same guie who once compared american soldiers in a rock to poll pot and now this moral genius he is suggesting that he want a sease fire by the way a seas fire helps only one party in this conflict come oss the reason tht they are begging screaming pleading for s he is fair annows because israel taxically speaking is now surrounding gosa city a huge percentage of comass's leadership is in goss a city the reasontht want a sese fire right now is to restop to re supplied to maybe smuggle people out that is the whole reason for the sease fire by the way there was a seas firing place betwe israel comass until october sixth than on october sevent that isease fire was violated by the worst antismetic killings presence the holicos all the is moral dimentia patient dic durban calling for a seas fire on tbo have a comas truly truly vile curygo it this this fire neaded now i think it is that le a under a in the conclicts o osides agreen for example the remy of thos an con asioul art o s immediate remes othat is to de egiia o whatefer could be mad can gaion caersation between the isralelysan the poistonans es fasen thi is gon on for tatcas o whatever the rationoon beginins no re on towerable wevel o we meed to have a raslation an the tetlas that give some promise o future what it is it is reachient intolerable level which parwas the intolerable pare te parwer thy slauhtered fifteen hundred jews and took another two hundred prisoner till munch forein people is well is it what our holdin american citizen's killed wonch of american sas at which parr thaut which is how what was the level at which it reached in tolerable for dicturban was it when there are some ugly pictures on to because wars ugly and herrific especially when your enemy is propping up winning in children in front of bonbs to try to protect their terrorists in i gen of that the insane laceck of people who are now suggesting that itis up to israel to stop killing terrorists becas those terroris have chosen to hide themselves among civilians that is insane that is literally saying to terrorists the best thing you can do to protect yourself as hided with civilians that is what you are saying you are saying these smartest thng you can do is murder civilians on the other side and then run and hide behind civilians on your own side the more another its the more of lass of war you violate the more we can call on the other side to not kill you which is totally reverse of the incent of structure you want set up if the whole point of the rules of war is to get people into uniform on a battlefield away from civilians then you cannot reward them for hiding behind civilians which is exactly what dic durban wants to do same than with christ murphy chris mrphy of course is the ridiculous senator from connecticut he is always been he is always been really soft when it comes to israel he says as i've said consistently israel has a right an an obligation to defendits people from terror attacks the herrific events october seven the comass terras who plane and executed those attacks must be held accountable and the ability of comss to carry out similar attacks in the future must be eliminated it is time for israel's friends to recognize the currents operational approaches causing an unacceptable level of civilian harm and does not not appear likely to achieve the goal of permanently ending the threat from comas fet from chris murphy o getlik military advice from christ murphy i'm jus wondering who knows more about military battle in the iddle east chris murphy or the entire ideaf i mean let us be fair he did get his jdee from university of connecticut lawschool i mean that is that is pretty impressive in terms of his military credentials to talk about what i's going to be successful militarily and what is not when he says this is not dedicated tord eliminating commass ors unlikely to liminet then whyis comass standing for the sea's fire why is comass want the sea's fire why is cmass on christ murphy side presumably tif learn the best interests of israel to prisueas he is fire who be comass not wanting a sease firing israel wanting a seas fire trying to pretend that he is a friend of israel law under cutting israel's military policy is ridiculously stupid or corrupt or both he says thas we have learned from america's own count ar terrors om campaigns just proportionately large number of civillian casualties come with a moral cost but also as str teach a cost as terras crups feed off of grievance is cause by civilian harm israel is doing its best to distinguish between civilian and terrorist in the gosa trip commass is attempting to obscure that and he is now declaring the comss should effectively have him immunity he is ishare israels that desire to destroy the threat from komass now you dont is tha kno israel cares about the impact of this waran innostan palstinians even as they track commas's hide outs incside hin below masss epartment buildings in schools but the way in which the current campaign is being wage suggest they have not struck the right balance between military nhecessidary and military necessity and proportionality he says he urges israel to shift to a more deliberate and proportionate counter taroris am campaign surgicatlly targ and comassin as lommaty ho leaders and terrors infor structure while more highly prioritizing the safety of civilians i'm gim just wondering what exactly is outlike i sim what he means he wants more jewish soldiers to die in gaza going house to house i presume lout that' we mats whe should just say that out loud that he thinks that the the jewish army has an obligation to get many many many of its soldiers murdered on the streets of gaza by terroris and some civilian quasi civilian supporters i mean by the way the distinctioning civilian and and non civlian is very real but it is very difficult when people blur the line therere many ci vilians people who are not formal members of comassy took part in the actual attacks of october sevent there is film of them doing byt of course cristmurphy it is not about principal here trying to argue with people christ murphy it is very difficult because frankly cristmurphy does not care about the truth an he does not care about the reality he cars about the outcome and the outcome for him is that he wants pressure on israel the media want that to which presumably is why they are constantly blasting out but truly blasting out come oss propagandis just couple days ago i played on this sho a vidio report from the washington post that featured some social media influencers from gaza one of them was a woman named plestia alicod what turns out that a lot of these quotenquote social media in fluencers from gaza it turns out a huge number of those people ar actual propagan o front for comas shocker according to the jerusalem post plestya alicott has more than a million followers and calls herself an independent journalist but spread the lie on instagram and in an interview with british t v that israel bomd the all ochly hospital and killed more than a thousand people she told briton's gb news quottagenacide literal age en aside an not a massacre in her post she has not provided any explanation for the commencement ofthe air strikeson gaza namely te october son of massacre another influential figure is bson udda who presents herself as a fill maker hailing from gazap halistine wit the substantial following numbering in the hundreds of thousands her posts have received indorsemens from well known figures associated with anticemitism and conspiracy theories following thoctoberseventh massacre she posted a note in arabic on social media for every action the is a reaction this means whole is expected after seveny five years of occupation and seventeen years of siege what was expected of us she is ben quoted as a quot ambassador of good will on ab c news and legitimized on the b b c and this is very common me again they are still using the councel on american is lomic relations which was once labelled an unindited co conspirator in a conspiracy to funnel money from e false charity call the holy land foundation to comas and they are being quoted by the media as a source on is lamaphobia i search the entire caranational feed yesterday they have not once condemned comas not once ever literally ever and yet they are there scene is some sort of moderate force the mediare perfectly willing to overlook the actual extreme antesmetic raticalism of many of the sources they re using an orderate bisrael that is their favorite thing to do and again this is the game the media ignore context the ignore realities of war the ignore who exactly is hiding civilians in front of their boms cailing colins on sian intoing a herrific job on this here she us yesterday asking an inviser to benjamin at tnahu how many palsing ins were killed in a strike on a refugi cam and he says well we we do not know the answer to that by the way comosaesn'tknow either the're just lyings the american media but heres cailing contasunlic six times why did is real strike again here an dou know how many cavilian had been killed in theteria as a result of the strike yesterday to day te we taking at sena unless command tano wis te main bo in e massi tin to te san as you wuldnt co they wa mak tha wu be any to they wer people ben tha lad an a san tany we and to the an we gon had not tany badys tat we cand an makin nae they have a te distasses and anyone who as in bol this tis a commander of the oration we havena deedy to find then and to bing in te destis i cant that you are not acknowledging how many i sin israel du have an estimate of how many civilians or celt i sing you have an estimate of how many civilans ar there when you make a calculis on went to strie tellme if that throng but when you defied on striking target thing you say a military targetes but are also where civilions are andin how many sivilian deat ti israel believe are acceptable and an air strike if it is a military tary get soowas to be grote e any cothato tan to a emen as en a uss the an ane o is eticulan tation is that i thing tanty not haly ben la e tat ate because we wan tain people ther to we go non a te te idebac wat a again see an that putting the pressure on and this is the goal of the media put the pressure on is rail whyis an israel taken care of the civilians that are wis not isral to a better job wit shis villians theire reports that during that jobal ye strike that they are women and children who literally marched out by comass bitterally march up by comss in order to get them killed this is not a surprise they say this crap openly again whoud be one thing of our lodging it it is another thing for commas o just say it and they constantly say it ad thn ever by just ignores it it is unreal it is unreal this is why you can hear theis frustration in my voice has been frustration my voice for month why because usually am in the business of trying to provide what i thing our reasonable arguments to generally tpeople i think our reasonable and are able to here reasonable arguments an if i'm wrong i'm wrong but we can make reasonable arguments an we can disagran these things when commas says a thing and then i repeat that they have said the thing and then people say i do not care other oma ai the thing done matter it is israel's fault or sure com sai that thng that they do not really mean deep down or sure coma said it and they really mean it but the real reason is that it is iit is the jews afrop you are no longer engaged in anything remotely resembling a rational con versation youare engage in a propagantistic effort to propabat genisidal jue hating group that openly declares its desire to extorminate jus and then you expect people to have arguments with that there is noway to have an argument with that position e's that is not that is not a rational position and it is not a position that is capable of being breached by rational thought that is the part that is extremely hard but you sing it all over the media from supposedly rational people you got esra cline who is declaring what is going on a gossits four hundred nine elevens what i'm sure the statistically that is true you now gould stop that commas tomorrow why do not any of you people to call for commass to surrender it is amazing you cannot get a single one of the people whoard to crine the horrors happening in goza to say the commas just surrender itw'll end literally tomorrow of comas surrenders they are holding two hundred and forty two hostages right now including dozens of small children babies nine month olds and they murdered fifteen hundred people in their beds in peaceful civilian villages and your isdea is israel's fault and all worse fos to look out or th casual tea numbers they are created by commas specifically you will do this is just commas achet prop out of the mouth of mainstrmedia reporters golstineant health official say that more than eight thousand thoustinnians aen gosa have been killed since october seventh and i want a note here that there is a fog of war it is possibly's numbers are wrong it is also of course possible thet preculy by the end of this these numbers wuld be much higher but if you take something the eight thousand numbers right well than one way the hor of october seventh was driven hole one way it is scale was driven home to americanths was to put it in terms of nine levenths i just think for population jobiitin said it was fifteen nine elevenths if iu thake got same math than gosas experience far around four hundred nime elevenths yen destripptive contects just give casual tye numbers without noting whose responsible for the thing gen as i've sad i said the sat oxford sad thits at cambridge now if all you look at is just proportion in casual ty numbers then every american war every western war of prety much all time the west was wrong because it turns out that during world war to who died the most germans if you look the british and theamericans first of the germans lots more germans dide then british and americans because that sort of the point of the war is to win the war you do not ten to win the war by losing more people literally the olianation on earth that tends to lose more people and whin wars is russia because they just throw endless masses of bodies at every single war historically speaking but jgenerally speaking when you win a war that does it involve a lot of death on the other side and that is even when the other side is not hiding in civilian areas how much worse it when the other hige aside is deliberatlly hiding in civilianareas and yet the medea strip it all of contect in meanwhi got the teyou en in the disgusting mostize leve the u en saying that all this might be a war crime than when confronted with the actual realities of of of war then they how well then i know actually what and want o talk about that what is amazingabout the zelsha un a second is that the legacy media just mirror the perspectives are indistinguishable from the perspectives of people who stand for commass from perspective people creti

amazing things about our disgusting leggacy media is that the is supposed objective arboters of truth ind reality they just mirror the perspectives of the most ratical members of the de colonize coalition s i've talked on the show over the past couple of weeks about the philosophy that links for extemple black lives matter with the from the river to the sa people what those people havein common why are their queers for palsan why ar all these people marching the same collition and the answer is beaue they hate the wess anything the west he is truly truly a horrifyingly bad place the leader of that coalition in the united states for a long time was tonahossi coats and hofs treated with the sort of bizar reverence and respect dospicte the fact that hes a garbage writer i'm sorry i'm just gon put it out there he is not a good writer he is incredibly purple he is been wildly overrited i i wont tn't say thes a poor man's james baldwin he is lake a dead mans james baldwin he it he does not have any of the skill he is not a good dobater he is not he is not a good thinker he is not a good writer there is literally nothing appealing about him other then he uses purple language also dud really really stands for commoss why because again a presservice is appressed colonize services colonized and all the rest of this yesterday and n as i've said before the broader philosophy that is worth noting here the broader philosophy is hatred of the west you will notice that replete throughout what what this tonahossy coats person says not a shock again he wrote in his own book a book celebrated by our leggacy media woare on the same side he wrote in his own book that on nine eleve an he sat at the top of his pirmant building and watch the towers burn and smoked t blunt and felt nothing he literally writes tat in his own book becasethat is how much he hates the country and yet this person his seen is some sort of bizar moral exem plar because he writes garbage between the world and me all between the wordi or real intellectual in any case here is suto intellectual tonahossy coats and again that the stuff that he spouts is almost indistinguishable from our will not objective media we ave this thing or pren o boy tif om a late come it to th calls thing an cas om also a late comea to cause of no violents what i'm hen now ynow a n knowing what that is a men to our history sarring him tasof thet rs a can kno he is a late comers the cause of non violins he is literally standing for the most violent terror group on the planets in come oss right now en literally every governing bodry of the palicinians e's a violent teragroup the palsing an authority is lomachy hod fato which is military wing withe p he is oure all vil but do not whre he is an avocave non violencs hest it is beyond paroty yetould be beyond paroty except that pople are stupid people are fo malonic that they have no clue the what he is saying is garbage and yet shallhave to know a few things to know how dum he is but it does matter people do not know things he gets away with it there is no way in the world that we can liverinto the memory doctr maton he cang is no wan to whare we can lave rit o the wait the ancestry of our movement indefense of a war indefense of indiscriminate baminks or refuge you get we gins di scriminat cannot do that we cannot do that we would be a discrace toto to our ansestis etories an o in look out and i would see roads that palistinians ca use and roads that only israeily jus can usu taid i know this is caposifer a secon pasit for second ha sa he says that he went to he went to israel which he calls palistine is that i saw only roads that israelies could use in only roads the palston uns can us actually that is not true ther're roads that both palsonians and israelies can use those wof the ones own by israel yo you have to get though a check point israel can make sure that you are not a terrist and then youare free to use it as hiy palsonian ors and then ther're only roads the palsonians cn use in fact there is no road that only is railies can use there are roads that is railies and palsnians can use if yofre ot a terrist and then there roads that only palson uns can use why because there are no jews living inside the palcin an authority none hat will be murdered there are none living under commass cause they would be murdered he is lying rght off the bad is i thow different colored license plates for different classo people tat i know this is yes but stop it there diffrent collor liceneplace because palistnian authority people deople living under the auspecies the palsinour authority live under a different government of course that is saying you saw canadian license plates and ounited states license plates da yes that is correct why would thy have is raily license plate thy are not his raily citizens is i sow communities that i can only describe as as secretate and what a fout was a tremendis wait i thought th oves thing i thing all of us feel that our tactoas insectivly subsedizing apar time us subsadizing a secregationis water a gim croesine cake he went on tou say that israeds a democracy america is the world's oldest democracy and that was the kee point because again he hates america he hates the west he thinks that tey are bad he benefits from them he plays on suckers in the west to pay him woodles of money to right his absolute dumpstor firebooks and and they came tons of money to give stupid speeches and the he rits on the west eis the west has a suicide wish that 'is the only reason why the wst has ever tolerated people who spend all day just ripping on them and i say tolerate i mean people who they have imported becase obviously citizens in the united states have frey speech i will say however that making those people rich is at insane thing ton hossey coats is respect the decy comic had e dulton hosicots that human was writing the super ho se actually until a erago writing a superman movy for j j abrums that gy that is how deeply imbedded in or culture thes garbages if you only its a threat to america you got a totally wrong the threat does not have to come directly rom comase can come from the entire decolonize coalition which jist perfectly fine with violence do not be fol by is garbage about non vilent he is literally supporting people who do terrorius violence that is what he does and the media their view is almost indistinguishable gand meanwhile israel's defence minister ovgallant he says that commass has one choice here you can u the surrender or you can die which by the way is the proper answer to wen people slaughter an mas civilian citizens tbecause their evil shere is yof gallan tes the defense minister of israel saying thus yesterday o we ot going to stup cure we seine poe oevels of can inothe enemy has to poptionsoite to di or to give a soe te without anycodation g that isright meanwhile hassanasralla who is the head of cusbala hos supposed to make his first sort of wive in person appearance inlebanon in years because 's been hiding in a in a bunker somewhere why watch is people get killed on the norther on the northern bord of israel for very long time he did not he gave his speeches a recorded speech from a suer somewhere and in his speech he of course called the attacks on israel herelic shul just reminder his balizes and aronian back tarrogroup armed with a hundred fifty thousand rockets minimom pointed into the north of israel which is why their ccurrently thirty thousand israelies for not living their homes in northern israel the big question of the day was goingto be whether hossan and osrala led off a new husbalaled war my prediction had always been that that would not happen because cusballa understands that especialy with two american air craft carrier stationed off the coast if they start a war in israel's north they just will not exist it will be bloodyan horrible for israel and also lebinon will be destroyed because israe will be stretched and israe will have to dowhatever it hase to do to maintain the safety of tone citizens son israla is basicaly mouthing off from what i can tell this poin he is gin to continue to try to draw forceis north away from the gosis trip tbut it seems unlikely that he is going to push to hard to im the that he is been pushd to hard to go directly into war that is the that is the situation in terms of israel and the palcinians and hesballa and all the rastall see how it develops over the week and meanwhile in the house of the united states government there has been a a vast disagreements about how to fund israel you ave the bin adinistration whch is trying to on together a bunch of things he're trying to one together you crane athe on sixty billion more dolars in yu cranade some fourteen billion dollars in aight to israel a few billion dollars fr bord security and seven billion dollars four ti on n th're tying to lump all that together in a hundred an five billion dollar package well mit johnson new speaker of the house he push forward and then passed and israel only bill and the israel only adbill is just ais israel and he does it by taking money away from the iaras now the democrats are claimming of course tat this is a poison pill this house proposal is going note basily we have now game of chicken the game of chicken is that the democrats oure hoping to wrong foot the republicans by getting them not to fun to israel in favor of not funding you crane and the republicans are trying to wrong po demi craft by saying guys why cannot joust give a directly to israel obviously i'm on the right wingside of that argument iren't understand by these issues are the same they are not the battle in you crane i'm fully in favor by the way off continuing to pride you crane the aid to maintain it is on security inside of the post twenty fourteen borders i se post twenty fourteen because right now you crane is trying to push into t donbass and crimea i be fully in favor of them doing that if there is an nactural possibility of the winning they have shown over the course of last year that that probably is not a possibility and th in fact that is extraordinary landlikely in fact you cranei and ministers are now sayng that is extraordinarily unlikely to the question becomes what the end of that word looks that does not mean theyou are in favor of undermining you cranan security you crane shold be funded to the point where it can certainly prevent you rush up from from doing this tagain pluss i'm very much in favor of degrading the russian military capacity since their aggressive on every front they can find including the mdelist drawing russian resources into battle in don bass ar crimea is fine with me in' have a generalized problem with that but sixty billiong out alon money i that is not to furnis you and says slightly more complex issume then the issue of funning israel and attempting to exterminate a in actual terror group commoss which you can do and is achievable very achievable he is ta separating off the two causes makes a lot of sense bhut pothsides ar now accusing each other of putting poison pills in their bills to wrong foot the other the poison pill for the republicans is apparently that they'e trying to dfon the iresson or to do this a democrats ar mat about that here was chuckshumer saying that the democatic majoriteter is aready declare his ver the house to h proposal is not going anywhere it is it is it it is going that it is t efort even is goded gat he says that is going nowhere but the question is going t be whether the reverse is true whether the senate proposal which is the giant one hured fie billion dollar proposal we that get's rejected by the house and basically be now have a game of chicken as i say i thin the next step for my johnson is probably to disconnect the israel aid from the irs dfunding and i think that that again would wrong for democrats and if they go ifin you do not want us that you love your ires much findal jus take that out and om and here is the israelate just passit no poson pils nothing a clean israel aidbill thet be very hard for democras rejecti sone that is the next step that johnson is gointo take if in fact the senate and present inbidin deside to veto biding his threaten to veto this particular proposal it will be interestingto see whether he does veuto that particular proposal in favor of we need to cramd down eaid for you crane in the middle of all this no cam in other non middle east related news apparently sam bankmen freet you aremember him he was the af tx founder who basically builked people of billions and billions of dollars ic robd peter to pay pauls essentially time pyramid skeme la jury has now found sam bankmen freed guilty ond all seven criminal accounts against him the f tex founder faces de maximum senes of a hundred and fifteen years in prison a turning general maricarlan sand tha statements em bankmen free thoughthe was above the lots day's vertict proves that he was wrong he was ay he was a person who believed that his political connections we are going to allow him to get off scot free he was the biggest single democrat doner in the last election cychl other members f eftax gave some money to republicans as well the government flip a bunch of people against him including his ex girl frend caroline ellison and the former head of alamata and ft x cofounder garry wan who is bankman freed's child to frun from maf camp both pled guilty in december and then cooperated his witnesses for the prosecution to get off easier as t an b c says the central question for juris to considerate was weather bankmen free to acted with criminal intents in taking customer fons from ftiac and using that money to pay for real estate venture investment's corporate sponsorship's political donations and a cover losses at alimata after cripto prices plunge last year there is ten billion dollar in customer money that when missing bankman freed now awaits sentencing we will see how long he has of going to jail mo one of the things that funey about to hold sambankmen free situation as he talked about when the story fors broke is that ten bankman freed had built his entire persona around cuon quo effective alterism and the idea was if you give me a lot of money if you give me tons of money and i spend a lot i'll spend a lot ofthat money on posics i'll spend a ot of that money on the clauses that you love most i'll be really rich and s now the basic idea which is that one of the great aspects of capitalism is that when people become rich thing give a lot mor charity that is true i give a lot mor charity now when i make a lotmer money then i did fifteen years ago and made a lot less money however the basic hiding behind alteruism in order to justify his own business mal practice and his political pay offs an all the rest was one of bankman freed's favorite things and he was made a year old for this who is put on the cover of magazine to jim crammer praising him to the skies and he briefly held the title of the world's richest thirty year old he had an estimated notworth of twenty billion dollars in one ways he distinguished himself from his competitors was how i'lteruistic an magical he was going to be he was going to he was going to spend money on the things that mattered most and he took a bunch people in according to a colomnist at cuoin dusk despite the reckage he cause and the accompanying failure to do good there may numerous voices sympathetic taspiaf chief among them is ole on author mi cellewis throughout his new book on askb fan ftax going infinite he pains a portrait of askde his a misunderstood genius whose intentions were pure on his booktoer luse continues to say things quote i think of him as a creature of modern finance and almost any period in history e's a a high school physics teacher well if leuis is rights as this colonist he should be inviting modern finance wholesale after all as b f by s kipping the effort of honestly earning the money he gave away never actiol performed a genuinely altruistic eed see this is one of the things the people shuldalso notice about altrism when it comes to the business world we ten to think of business and alterism as in opposition to one another or as though business is not a form of alterism if business is done right it is in fact the best form of alterism mi monedy's one of the great jewish thinkers of all time my mone's suggested the highest form of charity was giving somebody a job thare's the highest form of charity not giving the money givin him a job why he is turns out that the most goo that you do for the world is a sustainable method for generating things that are good for other people you n't we usually call those markets an markets are usually where you generate as sustainable repeatable method of doing god thing for another person if i give charity eventually if i do not earn more money the charity runs out if i give you a job and that means that you can earn a living and meanwhile you are providing with good or services that i can use to generate more goods and services and then i can pay other people ndi can buy other things i've helped many many more people that way that i would have i just gave away the money just giving away te money in some cases obviously justify their people who cannot work they are people children orphans what this is why the bible focussis when it talks about the sort of class of people who require charity on widows and orphans why because the ideas that widows ar gn to have a hard time ot earning a living and orphans do not hav anybody take care of them what it does not focuss on are people whoare capable of working and somehow you shoul give them charity be cause they they will not work or the idea that that charity is supposed to be specifically designed at at causes that could be better done in a sustain blewhat youn tolet sustainability markets create sustainability charity is generally nonsustainable is interesting for example socialism and capitalism socialism is how do i redistribute everybody else's money capitalism is how do i create entired and entirely new lines of business thus to support money earning by millions more people which is why when capitalism is tried it succeeds am i when socialism the best you can tolg about it with socialism is redistributing the gains that is all youcan talk about that is whi the quotn clod social democratic nations in northern europe are very capitalistic in the way they pursue business an then they just have thery very strong welfare structures on top of that but if the entire system obviously where nationalized systems the entire thing woul collapse who look t you us us ar which is why it is always been alide to suggests that countries in northern europe are predominantly characterized by their socialism they are not they areprodominantly characterized but their capitalists business structures the had's of of the the government of dunmark have set as much when you call thm socialis tho get annoyed it what are you what you talking bout as o nationalization of resources here there is redistribution of some resources at the top level in the same way that they have a mixed economy in other words the same as the united states its just that the're mixed economy happens to be significantly smaller they'r theyre population has to be significantly morhmoginis and thei're redistributive waight tends to be greater but the the sort of point of sambakemen freed is that when you when you place alterism in differentiation from business you and up being a bad business person oin re treating business as though business is the dirty part natrism is the good part when that is wrong i've said this beforeinal thin agan bill gates did more for the world by creating microsoff than he has in giving way his billiongs of dollars to charity why because he is led to the employment of probably hundreds of thousands of people not just directly microsop but indirectly though his soft ware that ts a massovf good to the world and we we wetend to think of the only that we judge people based on their intent and the intent iif you are intense is purer that means that your action is more beneficent and that is wrong that jus not true if i intend with this one dollar donation to do something good it just out of my pocket no benefit to me here is one dollar iave done significantly less good than we do at this company which is employed three hundred people already folks therest tos show continues right now yourenoc cononymoss it will get into the

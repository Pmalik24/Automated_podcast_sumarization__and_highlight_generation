what a lot of tea neagers in my town dead evans older brother had done at years earlier and had arranged to job for evan handing out darts ta patsy's eager to pop balloons on the board walk and i was supposed to get a job too but on our fourth night there still without work i sat on the edge of my bed and felt that sense of being a failure this feeling would aventually become a staple in my life something i'd grow comfortable with in bars jims offices and bedrooms but just then the feeling was strange and new and i did not quite know what to do with it we lived in a coed boarding house run by a woman with a face a clenched fist named missus deed i spent my days hanging out at evan's balloon stand where his boss finally became tired of having me around that he pulled some strings to get me a job working as a change boy at an arcade if you walked down the board walk there was a point where it looked the fun had come to an end my arcade was just a few yards past that do you rever ware r wor im thinking im fin lik i think i mean i anything nabe that ill shacrat o there wit the are crade where there is tat rollacoast are going over it now its teter the little house that tat i'll be singer growup in an in any hall you have still got peats of parlors games with unwintable crizes and the vague threat of violence about to a rock in other words wildwood had not changed much back then everything looked nineteen eighty six now nineteen eighty seven though as it turns out the arcadei worked at his long bon even at the time all the other arcades were carpeted an air condition but mine was an outhouse with all the oldest ad scankiest games while their joysticks having had the joy jerked right out of them years earlier on the fourth of july i remember watching the fireworks through a little crack in the wall right above the donkey cong machine i felt a young tony montana just having come to america except the only person i wantin to gill was myself oh oh oh o oh being a human change machine is just one of the jobs that seems only to exist on the board walk the guy whose page to dance in front of the teacher shob to draw customers wore the girl who blows bubbles all day outside a suvenear store ad that man to i i think my new from ther your wole job is just blowing bubbles o and silent tas ta final lazer in people's eyes o ar the buble girle tells me she is from

he has some one the talk to some one with whom to share of the secre week palks on his armor back when i live there wildwood had this reputation for being a big party town people were supposed to be scoring nots on the board walk every night and actually they were the only real action i got that summer though was in the form of a single kiss i later referred to it as the kiss that run my summer it happened while i was out walking on the board walk late one night i saw a group of older girls maybe in their early twenties coming toward me one of them a little ahead of the others was sort of spinning with her arm stuck out and her long blond hair all over the place just as she got right up close to me she grabbed the back of my neck and put her lips right on mine i remember as she pulled back i spastically grabbed on to her wriss i did not wand er to leave her friends had to pry my fingers off one at a time and she stood there smiling at me all stoned and airy that night back at the boarding house in our room i spent the rest of the evening obsessing as n might have been the last one i'd receive until i got married that kiss pretty much felt my swinging bachlone lut in yusheva i'd be the mysterious one with the pass for the rest of the summer i could not pass a woman on the board walk without thinking that we should somehow be meeting in a kiss bout that is how should really be it turned walking along the board walk into a rementless drizsl if small but horrible disappointments i did not know it then but that summer was prove the best one i have as a che nager even though i was work an indentured servant to giving every penny of my earnings to missus dee even though i made no friends and even though i only made it to the beach but wonce where i sat on a mildomy boarding house washcloth exhausted and pale that whole summer felt some big fat vacation just because i was sixteen and away fror my parents for the first time when i got back home i did not end op going to sheva i did not bring home any pen pous money or happy romantic memories but i did bring back a pair of black pands covered in small white skulls they were really baggy and i had to wear them

lemiges begin todays show by pointing out the last night the first of the jeffrey epstin paperis dropped thot'd be the corpaper surrounding jeffrey epstin notorious under age sex trafficker who is connected with just about every famous person in the west everybody's been very curious as to who exactly went to epstein rape island most far the papers canvadad most ovot we saw yesterday has already been seen bolt clinton being mentioned in the contact of coting p liking young girls prince andrew grabbing an under age breast alegations ofbat ellendershuits all the rest of this kennistuff more is going to drop over the coming days and we will cover at ont at dos because not much is dropped far oke now onso the actual news the twenty twenty four election is coming and right now it is advantage donald trump trump is leading by two point two per cent in the real clair politics pulling average it does not sound a lot until you realized that trump trailed jobiden in that same average onelectionday twoint twenty by seven point two per cent he only lost the popular vote by four point five per cent a difference of two point seven per cent ore that hillerd clinton was leading in that same average by three point two per cent on elections eight twenty sixteen and only whon the popular vote by two point one per cent a miss about one point one per cent another wards donald trump almost always out draws his real cleair politics polling average number he is up two point two that means is actually up more what is more jobidon is totally stuff as political scientist roit to sherif was not a right winger wrightes to day in the washington post quote in his twenty twenty campaign for the nomination the long time former senator had a better sends than other democratic candidates of the normal sity that voters were looking for after more than six monthsof a pandemic accompanied by lock downs an economic crash but there was a catch after jobidon clinched the nomination says to sheriff he felt it was necessary to incorporate the views of the party's left into his campagn's policy stances and outlook now with the next campaign abouts begin bidon and his party are struggling in other words jobidon wy to his voters he campaignd is moderate the primaries he capitalized on that moderate image in the general and then he push steadily to he left and then he governed frum the left now says to sheru bidon is pulling behind from nationally and in every swing state withthe possible exception of wisconsin trump is prerferred to bidon by wide margins on voters most important issue the economy and in flation as well as their second most important issue emigration and voters security and on crime and public safety bind's approval rating at this point this presidence he says to share is the lowest of any preceden going back to the nineteen forties when the era of modern pulling began what could jobidon do to turn that around will bidin things that bashion trump is gan a save him that is presumably why he is going to go on a trump bashing tour beginning this week labelling donal trump a racist and a fashist according to the associate a press quote presiden jobidon is starting the campaign year by voking the revolutionary war tso mark the third anniversary of the deadly insurrection at t us capital and visiting the south carolina church where white gunman massacre black parissioners seeking to per cent in the starkest possible terms in election he argues could determine the fate of american democracy is basily gon o turn january sixth into a national holiday that everybody hastrum m mber how horible january six day after day after because that is what america must fight an trump cannot be present because of january sex than eh son saturday jobine is goin to travel n their valley forge pennsylvania whor george washington and the continental army spenty bleak winter nearly two hndred fifty years ago presumably to talk about spending a bleak winter this year but it will swing in to a wondrous summer under a second jobian term there he is apparently going to to cry donald trump for the riot by a mob of his supporters who overran the capital says the associated press an attempt to overturn the twenty twenty presidential election valley forge speech to talk about january sekes i hear what george waserington the going going a on a trumpinsre ai two days later the president is going to visit mother a manual amy church in charleston ore nine people ore shott an kildin an june twenty fifteen white who premisis attacknam ma note the dan on that june twenty fifteen berokamomal wis still president of the united stakes and the idea he is going to suggest here is that donald trumps followers are the kinds of people who murder black people going to church that is what he is goin to do is can to be disgusting and it is not con to be anything quite shocking from jobin given the facts that is the same goy who ong suggested at mit romny was a vicious racous to one ed to reinslave black people jobidon's kicking off twenty twenty four says the associate pressed by delding into some of the countries darkest momens rather than an up beat affirmation of his record is meant to clarify for voters what his teen sees us the stakes of novmember selection during both events he will characterize his predecessor as a serious threats to the nation's founding principles arguing that trump who is built a commanding early lead in the republican presidential primary will seek to undermine you us democracy should he win a second term this is not going to work at all it is not con to work because here is the thing everybody knows trum everything is baked into that cake everything the egg shells howit sirs baby put everything is in the cake already everyone knows what they think of the cake some people ove the cake some people hate the cake nobody has no opinion on the cake everyone notes that trumps twenty twenty post election activities even if they despise them and think they are really bad did not actually change the outcom of the uction jobidon after all is they presdent and has been the president since januar of twenty twenty one what is more the pitch that trump is more racist than byn than he soms fomscripto white su premisist that pitch does not work just does not jobidon is the de e i president he talks about equity infuseing all f his policies he talks about it all the tme this idea that trump is more racially polerizing than bidon e that is o the polls are showing the pitch that trump is a fachist is not on work either because ha's even george will a trump opponent of hig arder points out quot jo bidon is trump an authoritarian recitivist mostly stim ead by cards that is from a person who really really really dislikes onal trump jgeorge will says quot instances of trumps anty constitutional behavior have been amply reported in plored bidons less although they for example the eviction more torium the bacene mandate the cansilation of student debt anjudicial repromands of them have been freque in and then jeorge well points out that jobiden has been attempting to overrun the federal vacancies reform act by basically a temepting toa point tommody that person being rejected by the centite wand then im waiting for some sort of brak in the action to reapoint that same exact person most of all jobiden's hope that hatred for trump will sun how save him that is predicated on another false idea and that idea is that donald trump will jog republican turn out but he will really really really jog at democratic turn out and that is no an arguable proposition the truth is that in every election since twenty sixteen democratic turn out has been up because of trump but here is the problem trump was not on the ballat in any of those except for twenty twenty what if the normal presidential election politics look more lik twenty sixteen and twenty twenty what if the actual mor is that trump does not t actually drive turn out in a presidential year in the way the jobidin hopes in twenty sixteen after all turn out was well within historical mormsstwen trump ran against tillery when it comes to turn out as a per centage eligible voters here are the numbers by elections this is the per centage turn out of eligible voters soen two thousand i fifty four point three per cent very very low two thousand four sixty point one per cent two thousand eight sixty two point five per cent two thousand twelve fifty eight per cent twenty sixteen fifty nine point two per cent it is a since two thousand four somewhare in the ball park of between fifty eight and sixty two per cent twenty twenty sixty six point nine per cent that is a massive increase and also a massive outlier and jobidn one incredibly narrowly based on that massive outlaying increase in voter turn out twenty twenty saw a voter turn out increase of twenty three million voters to a hundred and sixty million total vea total voters that is a posed to one hundredand thirty seven million in twenty sixteen and a hundred and twenty nine million in twenty twelve do we really think t at that numbers can replicates we think wengin a hundred sixty million total voters again in twenty twenty four is i can look more a hundredand forty million voters and if there is a twenty million vote gap between say twenty twenty and twenty twenty four in the negative direction twenty million fur people vote in twenty twenty four thand twenty twenty who do we think that is going to hurt if those voters disappear those marginal voters we think those marginal voters were trum voters or bidon voters the answer and twenty twenty was almost certainly bidon voters because the democratic turn out machine was extremely heavy because jobidon relied heavily on an on the ground operation ments in advance of the election to get people vote absenty ballat the changing rules becaus of covid ment that jobiden's entire turn out operation was predicated on not voting n election day that is why you saw that blue shift happen over the course of electionnite because all of the inperson votes got counted and don al trumpted really well the in person votes and then all the maland ballats are to be count it and then jobidon overtook trump ind all f these vary es states but what happens when the number of mailand ballats is way way way lower because people arn't staying home becaus o covet or voting from home because of covit what happens if the republican party does not shoot itself directly in the leg by suggesting the people should not vote from home what happens when the math changes in other words none of these frens are good for jobidon which means the bidon if you wants to when re election is going to actually hafs o you kno do a good job the only thing that could save him would be good things happening in america but here is the problem the biggest prom for jobide his policies prevent exactly that he has not made the country a better place very few people feel tat the country is better run now thn it was in two thousand nineteen and tat's an easy pitch for trum to make if he can stand pitch if from jus says over and over and over is your life better now or was a better in twenty nineteen virtually every one things that life was better less chaotic less insane in twenty nineteen ys even including the tweets and just one second we will talk about jobidons being held hostage by his own left and why this is absolutely crushing his reelect chance is first hever hard of

most obvious policy failure of this ad ministration aside from inflationwhich will get to in just one second is emigration the emigration issue is front page it is it is hot button news and it should be hot buttnews because illegal imigration is at all time highs and meu all time higes three hundred thousand border en counters in december alone that is the highest monthly total ever that is a huge total and by theway tat does not include get aways meanwhile the d o jas who mention yesterday is suing texas to stop texas from enforcing emigration law and meanwhile the united states is about to reopen four legal u us mexical bordan cross crossings to day according to roiders as highlevels of illegal iemigration have receeded and freed up personalbut how of they how they receited exactly apparently the usigon resume operation and an international bridge negle pasttexas two crossings in arizona another near sandy ego california that is according to customs and border protection you ust border authority struggled in desember to proscess migrans is apprehensions reach nearly olevin thousin in a single day which several currents and former official said was near or ad a record hig nair member when they say that these border apprehenstions are happening that' does not necessarily mean that these are people who are crossing between crossings and then seeb pece picking them up very often in apprehention is somebedy who asctury shows up at a boarder crossing and thn its coin what apprehended a waiting further review for a sylum or refuge status but we know that the vast majority people whore claiming that statis are not actualy eligible for that status and then th administration basically catches thin releases those people they say ocae here is a date thollout tis form come back in six months and will get in cort and then some people shop and some people dont in the spasically the end of the story and that is how you and up a twhenty millionew leglemigrants in th middle of the country nel whitehouse knows thes za political looser democrats on the border are fighting mad is not sto re publican issue democrats and texas fighting mad in earizona fighting mad and now hilariously in chicago in new york fighting mabbics it turns out the when the chickens come home to roost whn you back really bad bore policy and call your self a sanctuary city and then all the sudden oh know it is the consequences of my own actions people start arriving on mass in new york and chicago straining your social services and sleeping on the streets you get tic to the sy boiling issue for the white house what is the whitehouse doing about it are the trying to fix it of course not of course not cording to politico the bide administration is a tempting to flip the blame for the migran crisis at the southern border ont republicans good luck with that one seriously good luck with that ther publicns are let us build a wall let us toport every one let us be as harsh on the legal emigration is shumanly possible and then emocrats are let us leave an open border and then when the borders open and people arrivlic this is this is republican's fault this the who killed hannibal mem thefor for those who are not familiar with this meam from the internets is they mean in which one character shoot another character in the chasts and then turns to camera ns says who could have done this that is the democratic party when it comes to illegal imigration taccording to politica an anticipation of speaker my choncs and headingsto bou as southern borderon wednesday the white house issue to statement accusing house cho peers of ducking the chance to ddress the issue they ben attacking actions speak louder than words said whitehouse bokes person andrew bates house re publicans antiborder security record antiborer security record bu f is to fined by a tempting to cut customs and border protection personel no what republicans did not want to do was increase the amount of processing power they wanted to increasethe amounts of enforcement power meaning turn people away at the border they did not simply want to increase these size and scope of the processing apparatus in order twi alow in more people ilegally which is what your bide wants to do but your bide wants basically what you have here is you have a hose it with the piget thi s piget right now is very narrow and it is happening is that thi huge backlog of he legal emigrants who have not yet been process therre two waystos solve his problem one is to turn off the hose s that you actually do not have a giant pipe line of people trying get across the border legally the other way is to open up the spigot which is to say alow we leglumbrans to porn o the country tis whit is latly alahandro mayorcas the department of homelan security had which is such an or wellian notion that he is the ead of departmen phomeland security what homeland security has alahan dhro marcas been providing at all cury las yesterday explaining the have a backlog of three millian cases vak backlog is a powerful example of how broken or imigration system is and for how long it has been broken becaus thatk backlog existed when i was in the department of homelan securityon to thousan nine it preceded me then and it preced me now win my tenure as ta secretariy of homelan security that three million case backloc has been building three years in yearsiin years it got much much worse when you as citizen ship in imigration system us a if services the agenceded in the department of homelan security that ad ministers oure legal imigration system was find the antially gutted during the prior administration again what he wants to do is increase the prociting power he does not actua one to cut off the floe if you want ilegal migration could stop in ea to cut off the floe but tht's exactly what they by an iministration is unwilling to do accoring o politico sendant negotiators are trying to land by partizan agreement on policy to help stem the flow of migration and house republicans are now considering in peaching maorcus as they should because he is not doing his job mn you do not have to be guilty of any sort of crime to be corncuote impeach we found that outwhen democrat's impeachedonal trum twice while lleging no actual criminal activity durelection of duty would be a big one for alhander maorcas who has not secured the border in any way shape or form it is hilarius that mayorcas was asked why exactly d you think that there is been this massive outbreak of ilegaamigrationally way higher than it was during trump wayhirer than was during a boma whyse that happening he blames climate change in poverty which ore systemac problems in the northern tringle and latin america generally he he blames that which is weard since climate change according to lefts has been taking place for decades and poverty has been in demac to this region for again decades why now the answer by the way is that eulegal migrans will tellyou themselves jobidnous president the is lots of idio of people chancing jobidon's nae as they had for the border here is alahan der marcas trying to blame this on systemac factors by let when politicians tend to blancornuotes astomac factors thus usually that is a way of them avoiding accountability in responsibility because how exactly is anyone supposed to solve climate change or poverty to blaming the moon a man the moon keeps making this happen how to we stop it we cannot he gampblo up the moon when poltitions do tat reteen what their really saying is we are not going to do the thing we we know we should do instedrages canno blame these indemic factors here wegop we are seeing the greatest number of thisplace people not only at our suthenborder not only in the western hemisphere but a cross the globe you kno im involved in bi lateral and multy lateral meetings with my counterparts from foreign countries in europe i in asia inthe indepacific all old the world in my gration the challenge of displaced people is the subject that comes up in every single conversation we have the effects of climante chage poverty increasing level of theritarianism the very many challenges that are at the rute cause of the displacement of people around the world question why does the chared for legal migration look this ka why is its spike when jobiden becomes president no one the by adminstrations wiln't answer that question in the answers perficatly obvious it is because jobidon is soft on i legal migration and his party is soft on i legal migration and again there in hocto left wing ecaus there is no reason for this democrats on the border understand that weaving the bor wide open is totally insane its settilys this tas to be an ideological thing truly because the reality is that even leber first democrats people har for unions for example it used to be there are very much opposed to legal migration migral labor generally becase they believe you was undercuttng the wage base in the united states but now the democratic party has been captured by college educated white liberals that they seem to believe that leaving the border openist some sort of moral requirement ber no follow that all the way in to jo bidon losing the presidency as what is going to happen here and just one secon wil etsto the continuing democratic attempt to blame republicans for what is in fact a democratic problem first as we know twenty twenty four its can be a wild ride thou alredy seeing the impacts of inflation the gaspump at the grocery store economic stagnation is will discuss momentarily is going to come next it is the next shoot to drop well it might be a good time to diversify your savings it might be because it turns out that weaving your

good good luck seriously good luck here is alehon der morchas agan he is the head of the departmet of home an security refusing to enforce border law and here he is blaming taxas is governor gragabbot for actually attempting to enforce border law we have taken action on the border and we have taken action with respect to the challenges that cities across the country are facing leme lime identify one as now there is anmicial problem here and that is the fact that we have one governor in the state of texas who is refusing to co operate with over other governors and other local officials and courttat efforts to address o challenge that our country which this country should stand united to address that our country isfacing and it is a remarkable failure of governents to refuse to co operat with one's fellow local an state officials what in the world again it is the federl government curent we suling gregabot to stop him from inforcing federal emigration law meanwhile careen john pierre worlds worth pre secretary over the wigh ous she says that jobidon still has confidence in his deach a secretary they are gong to run this play book right into the ground it is it is political malpracticse we must happening here tos from any objective point of view tyou are an alien from out or space and you arrived in the united states and you saw i crisis at the southern border ar president in the low forty's high thorities approval rating in a reelect fight where the border is going to be major issue shouting that his opponents our responsible and going to basically leave things in place you get what in the world is even happening here but that is with e my administration is doing mes milie e e e eteetr ere eer e re e e i e eeone al oas te ar i e tis te pret o oee ace ar oan on the secretary i thinan an ive said this moments ago i seided at the top as well we believe that top what theyre doing the house republicans are doing wit thisn'n pinpeachment incurious baselert i we believe that ii to political stont and we believe there is not there is no time for that ranynow there things that the american people wantes to get done is it what why ren't you doing any of them then jobion fr his partye says is all about republicans refusing him money to do emigration now we all know what is actually happening here that the money he wants for emigration is not to actually reject e legal emigrants at the border he does not want or remain in mexical policy he tryed to walk that back he does not want to simply change emigration law to make it harder for people to falsely clemasile his not wanted to any of that the money he wants is to open the spiget that is why republican's oppose it here 's jobin claiming this about a lack of money mean dued madod you spend seven reallyan dollars a year i've a feeling can fined some money somewhere if what you actually want to do i stop the flovililimigration merely how much money do these people will not is toltally crazy an te the federal government has only a couple of actual original purposes than has a bunch of crap that it does that literally has nothing to do with its constitutional duties the size and scope o the federal government is insanely beyond anything the founding fathers ever wouldhave comprehendit that it is absolutely maddening the founding father's legitimantely fought a revolution be ston the size and scope of government and lack of representation with in that government if if they could see the federal governments a currently stands what do you think they would think of this meu i got you bin walkin around him spending seven sthrillyan dollars a year and he is lik it're no re knew more money were's the monen here we go then gi in nasone mor i the morcan do anthingabout it e not is otthing not to givin the money iny to protect the boarder nhow to give me the money i need to protect the border e're right we were not spending enough money our national that is thirty forer shrilly in dollars they t shrilli in dollars he is spending more money than any president has ever spent ever but the problem is short falls of cash apparently according to jobiton nailed it but except that we kow that that is hantrue because right now jobin is requesting another giant supplemental bill that gin supplemental bill includes sixty billion dollars in aids you crane fourteen billion dollars in aid to israel some billions dollars in aid to tiwan and re publican seterl cen work gan to atsombor security here because heu know what as long as we are hlping to securer foreign allies perhaps you should secure a sothern border al oll bit and jobins nope and chucshumeris nope her is chukshumer the senate minor the senate majority leader yesterday talking about they's and saying well if republicans want eh or twone will discuss what ach or two is in a second attach to thi spill the answer is no when the house ca or as the olly solution which eve we gera ote ga we o ou send sen certaly every senator o every gar seno ithen every ea an sos oowuld note ty ay he says by the way that there is agreement among democrats an republicans afout need to fix the boarder but they will not actually propose anything that systemically changes the problem on the border they refuse to do it sener christmurphy of connecticut is the lea democrat in the border talks he says i think of the sentat get something done in o by partisan way it'l put enormous pressure on the house to get something done as well well far they have not one a very good job of it we will get to h or two what the republicans have proposed in the house in just t one second first balance of nature fruits an vegues it is a great way to make ure tht you are getting essential lutritional ingredients every single day balance of nature uses an advance call back in process that in capslates fruits in vegues into wholefloud supplements that sacrificing their natural antiocidents the capsils are completely

and wholl foods people down here at the studio have intanget producer's act makes it appoing to bring his balance of nature fruit and vetu capsiles when we are on the road because the road is very stressful time forzac hs require to do many things in very short periods of time anso yestoli chug those things nobody's business there is never been an easier way to make sure that your getin your daily doses of fruies and vagues experience balance of nature for yourself to day go to balance of natured ot come use prom icla tho pero get thirty fi percent of your first order as a preferred customer plus et a free bottle of fiber and spices that is bounds of natured ar compromo cochuperol for thirty fi percent off your first preferred order plus a free bottle of fiber and spices ocase what exactly is it the chuctumer its rejecting here what exactly is it that that is terrible 's some in alle the secure the border act of twenty twenty three these secure the border act which is h ar too is som a fairly conservata bill itd proposes the following things thes according to emigration forum dot or which is actually a rather pro emigration outlet and here is what they say it would reestablish trump ireborder policy including restarting construction on the border wall iou rein force the definition of operational control as the provession of all unlawful entries into the united states including entries by terras other unlawful aliens instruments of terrors an ar cots and other contraband all lawful entries that would be now the goal of operational control it wuld require that the ca cipraterry to en corporate physical barriers in for structures and tecnologies to chieve situational awareness an operational control of the us mexical border it uld increase the number of full time border potrol agents to at least twenty two thousand bilart that gives the lie to the idea that the republicans do not want to increase bord patrol agents they do they just do not want to increase the number of people whoare going to be involved in processing illegal immigration forms as opposed to the number of people who are on the border catching the godaways it would prohibit the use of you us customs and border protection eran marine operations resources to transport non citizens who ill not be detains into the country's interior in others wo should be spending federal dollars to bust people all around the country the c b p it wuld require the us bore potrol to put together a stracegic plan bay send in formation provided by border communitye state holders hospitals farmers ranchers property owners victims of crimes and other negatively impacted by legal imigration lin all the sounds absolutely reasonable it would also restrict access for asylum i wuld raise the initial screening standard non citizen would have to prove they were more likely than not ultimately qualify for asylum to continued prursuing their protection clam and not be just kicked out which again why is that wild should you be able to come to the border and jursatlessan i ned asylum and the why isa irno i just do ik well maybe isical one pressant chans this personeeds asylum problish houl release them into the interior of the united states or should by what we call it preponderance of the evinencs fifty one prcent shot yatrigan get asi lum now we say o kafin ou on't come in make or sylum claim will let yan because the chance are petty good oare gin to receive asylum that is a smart policy the democrats oppose it would ban the vast majority of asylum seekers from requesting protection at yusborder if they travel trough a third country on rout to the united states and had not already been denied asylum there by the ay the is the same palisin mexico holds to the basic idea here would be that if you come up to the usborder and you did not request asylum in mexico first you ned to go back to mexico and request asylum there and then if they deny that then you can come to the united states in request asylum but e should not be able to pickanchos of the best contry just because it is the best country if you are truly requesting asylum meanig you are trying to avoid the worst possible cenarea that does not give you automatic access to the united states it would restrict asylum claims generally to migring to a rive in the u us and official port of entry see cantlic go between the border crossings cross the railground run in to the united states an inclemasylum yes at should go to a border crossing in orderf us to process you normally i none of this seems wildly crazy it would also explicitly and the existing presumption against dattaining a non citizen child the company by family making it easier for familis with minor children to be held in detention because right now they big prob one big probems is that you are not allowed to hold th e e child indetention facilities with family which leads to separations at the borer between children and parents which has then been used is a lever to release the parents to now it saying ocewell you knowt howbatleys keep the families together which agen makes some sends itd required te ach ust to actually reestablish family detention requiring parents and kid to enter together without authorization to be held together inemogration detention and then say that thisatisfies the flora setlement agreement that flora settlement was an agreement come to by the clentn administration and the and the federal judiciary with regard to snon separation of children from families again all of this is perfectly normal and actr a visit the stuff the your bion isopposing this stuff chuck sumer sopposing much opposing by the way that they would rather kill you cranay than passit the bill would criminalize overstaying a legal vesis if you stave for you overstate o visa that makes their criminal penalty then noft wantt you that they will not yo be able to just an i'll pay fine or something ht wone to read a fine what it means for paroll to be granted on a case by case basis see cannot catigoricaly just declare the people are parole daca and all of this and it woud add e verifies to employers buld actually have to check the emigration status of the people the employ why is any of this remotely controversial if you polld each one of those propositions i guarantyou those are seventy percent propositions seventy present of americans probably agree with every single thing that i just said who disagrees mean it is it is an but but democrats our ideologically committed to this for example representof roconam by the way i roconies ben on the show andthng us an honest person even if we disagree on a lot oe policy issues democrat from californ he says i'm not rid i'm not in favor of changing parol and asylum in favor of ou crane aid ime first plye shuld be in favor of it jus with value granade but the fact that democrats are willing to take what they sayis the topnational security priority not allowing you graing to be eaten by russia in subject yet an subjugate that subsume that get rid of that sublimate that to the open border policyis totally crazy here is rokon a how crucial is that ad for nou cran right now it is absolutely gushalin we should have a stand along upwar down long on the a to you gran and i strongly support the ad to you grad but what i do not support heis getting rad of athe americas commitment to asylum or por all just to giv ad to you grang hen wher were not con a compromized tharin tire values is a nation over that n values a nation idn't realize the value is ternation was allowing people to make spurious claims of refuge he status mel all this place directly inanotrum's hands i say the radical left capturing bydn it has been the downfall of his administration ju donal trump has a has a peace in the to mone register bahd of the iococasis talking about jo bion's border is taster and he says o course he heden write this but this will be the policy he implements ee this this is the thing betrum this the thing that conservatives me understand donl trumps says lotocrap when he is sweeting his actual policy gets made by the people round him the people whon can vince donal trum of their policy and up getting their policy actually passed made law implemented this is why you have three conservdive supreme cortjustices and not randos the donal trum piced out of oinam socas donal trump has deep engagement with the issue of supreme corturous prudence it is whis leanard weo wis telling him yere is a list of justices who will probably be good in this is just how trump works and everybody who is can vote for trum basically understands this trum has some very good political instincts and he has some very bad habits on twitter and then if he surrounds himself of thrie people he tenstinplents some prety good policy which is why again he is leading in the pulsewill get to donal trumps propose worter policy again he is skunking by dnonhs issue it is amazing me the bytomale compromise of the publicans and attempt to at least neutralize the issue it is totally wild egets that in a second first a now is the perfect

emigration policy jobidn is blowing it nd it is playing ritens down from's hands his ood piece of a demoin register obviously not written bidonal trump does not matter it is the policy trump will implement he says under the trumpadministration we hve the most secure border in yous shistory we ended catchin release and removed over one milliony legal aliens my firus term i negotiated on precedented agreements of central american nations and broker remain in mexico to stop the flot of migrans to our border i got the mexican governments to play tens of thousands of soldiers to the border free of charge every step o the way we fought obstructionis left ling judges and radical democrats to try to stop us and we won and he says now you are witnes witnessing th disastrous results of jobidon bidon came in cancil the border while end remain a mexico ripped up my asylum bands ended title forty two and began resettling millions of migrants into american communities at tax pair expense and now youre witnessing the disastrous results we ave the highest number of i legal border crossings in history by far on my first sday back in office i will terminate every open bordersf policy of the bide administration and immediately restored the full set of strong trump border policies then we will be in a record setting a deportation operation jobidon is given us no choice the millions of the legal alien hohave invaded underbidn require a record number of removals this is just common sense to achieve the skull i'll make clear to every department anto state an local governments we must use all res sources and authorities vailable we will shift massive portions of federal lawn forcemen to emigration in forcemen including parts of the d e a eight f f b i and d ch us i will use the alien enemy's act re move known or suspected gang members drugdeulers or cartell members from the united states and we will use title forty two to end the child trafficin crisis at last again this is trumskon went on the sissiue its issue matters to americans and jobidon is walking sleep walking directly into his own defeat it is not just with th rid am grets remember jobidon needs good news before the election he is not going to win this race on the basis of people him better than trump as a person it is not going to work this time it is simply not the preception of jobidon is too bad it is been stagnant and terrible since the f ganniston with dr all people wo not perceive him as the kindly elderly gentlemen any more that is what he ran nas in twenty twenty and no one thinks fhim that way they think of him as somewhat venal somewhat corrupt crochudy somewhat see nile and fairly ratical on policy that is the actual perception of jobidon soys gin and eat a significant economic recovery is that going to happen this yeure wle the fedscan do its bast the federal reserve obviously as historically been i the business of trying to jog the economy just before presidential elections as cous alway backto the nixin administration well according s the ballstry journal federal reserve officials thought there were done raising in trestrateswhen they decided last month told them study the minutes o the meetings idn't reveal a meaning full debate about when to start lowering rates whell nearly all officials anticipated policy rates toreventually belowerd before the end of this year the written account of their december twelvth tan thirteenth meeting released on wednesday unders scord heightened un certainty over how to navigate the next interval of monitary policy after the most rapid increase in intrest rates in four decades 's there really not sure how much theyare going to reduce the rates a guaran you ther gont try to reduce the rates this year because if they do not the economy is going to start to stagnate in fact we are already seeing that according to axios steady job postings cool er hiring and less quitting after a record shattering stretch americ as once remarkable labor market has settled into a more normal groove the result is sufficiently cool deman in will not stok in flation but a stilro bust enough for workers who want a job to find one other tines point to a continued cool down as the year came to a close hiring eased slightly to five point five million that is three udred sixty three thousand fure hires than in october the number of quits which is hemmany people are quitting their job to find another jop is down three point felt down to three point fivemillion the sount a hudred fifty seven thousand this is back down to below de sember twenty nineteen this this is just the eginning ecause again what goes up must come down at the very bestryn to get a slow recovery from here on it as can a look oboma numbers this is why then your times reports that auto sales are expected to slow after twenty twenty three edmons expects the industry to sell fifteen point seven at million vehicles this year thot amount to only a modest increase from the fifteen point five at millions sold last year that is when sales jumped twelve per cent the credit situation is not grate for people because all of the intrestrateser up and that means that people are going to be buying less for years people tok advantage it zero percent lones to buy vehicles even as the prices clime but such deals offered by automaceersto move inventory have nearly tisappeared in the wake of the feds rate heighes and the fourth quarter of twenty twenty three new vehicle sailes with zeri per cent financing eccount if for just two point three per cent of all sales according to edmon's monthly payments are now at near record hives and again you have a national debt that is completely out of control are we likely to get a booming economy this year you might avoid a technical recession wht you are going to have s an imbedded inflation that continues to be wayhigher than when jobine took office again even if inflation stopped to day pretty much everything you buy isabout twenty per cent more expensive than it was when jobion took office a dollar in january of twenty twenty one now what you buy for dollar now cost you one eighteen according to government statistic that is a bad number for jobinde aind as the economy cools jobinas en fill the brunt of that a again he is been defying economic gravity but not really inflation was the economic gravity when the intrestrates go up the economy cools down everyines expecting it its normal wha you' expect is that jerome powel before the election probably drops the antrestrates to try to job the economy a little bit is that con be too little to late probably given the effect that given the fact that again all the stuff is inbedded tit is not as though when we sate in flation goes down the actual amount of money that you are paying goes down deflation has not yet set in deflation would be things are less expensive to day than they were yesterday even best case in aryor talking about it continued in flation rate of two per cent which wit the fuddelers are aims for that is on top of the alrea e embedded seventeen to twenty per cent increase that you seen over the course of the bide administration meanwhile the possibility of more shocks to the global economic system are very very real shipping in the red sea continues to be a complete disaster area and what the point is having a multi multi tens billions of dollar military if you are not going to be able to stop hoo the pirates from stopping shipping through the red sea jobidons international policies can have some dramatic impacks on the american economyg one o the big factors in price inflation over the course of last several years has been supply chanbottle nect left over from cove that has been a very real phenomenon in the economic world what that wa's driven by globa pandemic and shut down son particular countries labor shortiches andall the rest what happens when you have again a bunch of ragtag pirates or shutting down in entire shipping methodology that lowers cast for the entire globe on protducts ranging from oil to clothing an enormous amount of shipping goes through the red sea and yet here we are to day with the u s and its alies having give the hoothes warnings tay that could not prevented by the united states taking a very anti eron position from the getgo under jobide donald trump had basically ostercized eron from te international community the hoothies were listed as a ou s a ou us labeled terrast group jobidon delisted them jobdon decided to go hard on the souties hard on the israilies easy on the aranians and the result is this the results is cass in th mideleast tos the turns out the cass actor in te mdeleast is eron it has always been eron it is not saly arabia it is not israel sic's very bazar t te bidadministration is now having to back fill all of that and the probalem is that when you make those sorts of mistakes it is very hard to contain the problem on the other end when you open that can the canas now open i's only one way to clothes that can and that is yu enhave to blow up some crap among the hoothies at the very least we now that the canas ben opend against israel by aran with or gort to commas ancisbala there is the possibility tat the only way t to close that can is gofter cusballaw which is another major issue for the bi administration jobin's reelect that fort requires there to be some level of calm in the middle east re establish what they are hoping it is to condain the israel commas issue two israel and commas that isballad does not come in the only way that is going to happen as if the united states makes very very clear docusballaw that if cus bala gets involve te united states finishes cusbaw that is actually what would be in jobitons political interest because if that war opens up that is very bavragobiton politically speaking is bad for the world by the way you do not want this broadening into a large war israel does not want that probably aron does not want that beause it starts ta broader into a larger war then the arony an mosr probably not in leadership at the end of that day but with that sed a little but a strength right now would go a long way according to the walstreturnal vhe us britaning keyallies issue but officials described as a final warthing to the hoothe yeminy rebel group lend states to ceases its attacks on international shipping in the red seor bear the consequences the stipments issue by more than does nations quot inm going hothe attacks in th red se are you legal unacceptable and profoundly destablizing the hoothies were better the responsibility of the cons equences should they continue to threaten lives the globel economy and the free fll of commers in the regions critical waterways the us military has prepared options to strike the hoo these going to us officials should the us brittin and other nations use force potential targets could include the launchers for antoship missiles and drones targeting infor structure such as coastall raite oure insullations and storge facilities four munitions wone o the challenges that a lot of weapon systems are mobil thetrelse very cheap the bine administrationhas been cautious about using force seeking to protect tho prospects for diplomatic resolution of the emin conflict get yet good luck wat that one whoothe fighters overthrew the eminy government in twenty fourteen there is been on going very bloody war between the hoothies and the souty government and other arubnations attempting to ouse the hoo these who again are narranian bact terror group with a slogan talking about death to america death to israel glory tala and all the rest john curby sas the president has made clear the united states is not seek conflict of any nation or actor in the midalise but neither will we shrink from thetask of defending ourselves are interests are cortners or the free flow of international commerce as of tuesday the woothies of arty carried out twenty four attacks on commercial ships since mid november and of course is not just the hoothies the everanian back terror proxies in a rock that are striking at american forces the have ces bella which wegan is warming up on israel's northern front what is going to push aron off the ball ise going to be the west actually doing something warnings are not goingto do it oue gan to have to killsim hoothies mean its just that simple he raing that to kills some hothy terras if you want to free the shipping in this in this area meanwhile in aran it seems things are heating up two boms exploded and killd the least eighty four people at a commemoration for cussemsolemani solemani of course was the terror general whoas killed in aroch at the behast of the trump administration nowone immediately claimed responsibility for this blast that kille th eighty four people at the funeral arons leaders vowed to punish those responsible for the blasts which wounded at least two hundred and eighty four people the vervise to the the death tol at this point theyd 'd been over a hundred nouncs down in the eighdies the gathering markd bou fort th anniversary of the killing of sulymani the explosions accurred near his gravesite as long linest people gathered four the event now of course the aranians are blaming the united states an israel this does not meet with any of the sort of preticettes thatu suggest that itwas in is raili or american action it does not make any sense it does not achieve any geo political goal it dinactually kill any one important that there is nothing there that suggest that this was some sort of american is raily operation either together or alone it is it is estion much more likely in in fact that it was some the some form of uranian rebel group attempting to generate ir at the arani ad ministration aron supreme leader itella alecamani s toa the attacks will face a harsh response he did not name any possible suspect probably because the aranians kno that if they tried to turn this into an american is raily thing that it actually increase o the chance of or again aron once wars using its proxies it does not want ware directly eron oes not want whate bethewi united states does not either israel does not either no one wone 's that as the mean ont happen fhury of world wars but gay here is a quick theory of world wars world wards begin when you have a series of popping popcorn colonels and no one actually turns down the heat when those series of popping popcorn colonels start to increase when the heat increases slike a pop her in a pop hern a pop hern than all of the sudden everything's poping all at once at tht's wore our staring a s enthe a eleast it' start off at this commoss attack those one pocorn colonel then he sar to see kisballah attack that was another popcorn colonel hes aw the hoothy attacks that is another popcorn colonel he saw attacks in seria attacks in a rock hese ar more popcorn colonels an eventually eventually if this continues some one in the araniun government is going to authorize a strike against an american target and sink in american ship or something and then america is going to pummel them there is one way to stop that which is stop the popcorn colonels from popping an you cannot stop them from popping simply by appealing to them to stop you are going to have to actually quash them where they are youf t let his reall finish off conasse you have to threaten kisbla tha f it gets involves than a merica will finish off ks ballo directly that is the reason we have aircrafts carrier station the mediterranean it is not because i or any one else want america at war with ron it is because i want amrica not at war with oron that threats are useful credible threat of force is a very significant torrent it always has been it is why the united states can have to blow away the hoothies becaue if they continue two a chief quornqote victories against international shipping in the red sea do you think that insentivize more ataxks or is a distant sentivise more attacks again soones are probably responsible for what just happened in er on according to the a p son extremest groups including the icis group havel conducted large skallattaks in the pass that killed civilians inshape majority aron that is probably what is happening here okane just one second we will get to the latest on harvard we are cloudying gay now how is a piece out talking bout how hard it is to be cloudin gah she is

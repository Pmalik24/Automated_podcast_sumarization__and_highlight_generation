from w s chicago it is e special christmas edition of this american life we have a bunch of things for you to day including later in the program christmas on fire but let just get things off right now with a song recorded an event we did on stage a little while back on the twelve day of christmasmatuloa to me ttottintin inini antato tertl does t i have always hated that song i have always shad of that song i thought i that song is symbog of everything that is bad about christmas i sust say i have no bad feelings about christmas i am a non combatant when it comes to christmas as on stage talking bout the song cause we had this idea that we thought might make a really fun thing to try for christmas and that is we organized a night of improph comedy and i know ou saing or ge how as hi go together why improph comedy in christmas oke well this con ticlod swanning stay with me this british writer and performer name daniel kitsen i saw him say this thing about christmas that seems true he says that when youare kid and you wake up christmas morning what makes christmas feel magical is this fling of oll my got is can be amazing the world is full of possibility anything can happen the fact that senticles even exist this literally magical being who ken to your home and kitson says this thrilled feeling that anything can happen that is the thing that is hard to hold on to once wiv become adults and if fact he says that many adults at christmas they trid to we create the same christmas year after year with the same everything over and over and over it is they lock in christmas becomes the opposite of anything can happen that is why it never feels this magical to adults but it is possible to get back to that feeling and a canback to the plan for to day show one place that adults embrace that feeling that anything can happen and it is going to happen hn than they make it happen is improph comedy were they walk on stage with no idea what anybody's going to say and then one person tries something they say something and then somebody else phitches in with the line of their own and that somebody else pitctures in before you knowhat they have made a whole seen a whole world really and with than in mind we got these incredible improp commedians and we got a club to perform in and we did a show and we did the show in this particular style of improv were the people on stage they tell true stories about their lives and then those stories of true stries become the basis of the improphescenes that they then invent and those seenes lead them to other true stories that then we theem into other improphscenes and on and son and on and i was there i ccthings off with tha story about that song about the song to twelve days of christmas whwhich is the song that i noticed even though just to say it again christmas is not my day i am not somebody who celebrates christmas at all ofm a jew and i'm not that kind of jew whose parents celebrated christmas anhonica we were purer conic of people and we look down on the christmas honica jews and if act i grow up in a suburb of baltimore that was jewish i did not understand that we were in the minoridy and christmas i do nothing it means nothing to me the day means nothing and most years i go to vagus on christmas but i do really love christmas music iave always loved christmasmusic an nd and at some point in my twenties as tae to make a collection of christmas sedis and records and the worst song of all is the song the twelve days of christmes and whenever it comes on i just think wy is this still in circulation first of all the words refer to a wife and a world that none of us can relate to or careaba twolved words a weeping we what is what experience is that even referring toand then swans are swimming geese are laying are we in a worm cimate of cold cim it just raises many questions but also the form of the song is intensely boring and you gi o talking about what you do the first one and then you go back and yu do all the ones before which you already did you nowany means to you do two turtle doves an a partes na picture han three french hans two turtle doves ind partinitures in then four calling birds three friench hans two turtle doves in a parth of the five golden rings for coing borths an jus what is going to happen it is repetitious in the most boring way and then it is always sung very slowly which is annoying and i do not know why it is survive hundreds of years to still be around and and my only thought is five golden rings five golden rings is the hook of the song and you song the song right when you get to five golden rings everybody frees a sivrys as f oring and just fo yyou only man it is the trums that is the hook of the saw and without five golden rings this song would be nothing igisa at this point this me back in the strudio tugging it this mont if i culd jut describe the stage sitting on stools in a row there are six in prov commedians and we got some of the best people around for this kind of thing seriously we felt lucky they agreed to be in the show eigty byantons ti sheers an made of ther both on saturday night live scott adds it he was on thirty rock and before that he was in second city as tammy sager chris gathered in mike bobiglia they bot been o readia prok on before mike many many times they both have deep in prove backgrounds six of thm are sittng on the stage on thse stools and they listened to that first story that i told to kicking sow and myt was the first wene to stand up and speak or first of all i will not a a disagree withir about that song i thing in some sense it sort of the fifteen bottles of beer in the wall of christmas carols it sen themac it is repettedif i i think were the disconnect happens is that it is just british things fa wha kind of american things which you put in that i abaldil abaldy gali aoaktre yalde goin in an oak tree yer we just gep a dee british the whole thing aing that is the probledy hav a squile yes we have been courting now for going on ten months and yo iv pan playing in my mind with what to get you for christmas lot mayva mants i am sure that whatever you bring me on christmas will bringin much whi may i give it you now oh yes but soon before a christmans i've excited i think i did well all right here you are five golden rings o i gould mes but i've also brought you twenty three birds twenty three individual birds and fifty human people would you say a group les where e crises misen do you it i lavit a lod me the munch and if we could just go back for a moment to the five golden ring ah yes sho to question question abot wat what is the difference between a gold ring and a golden ring i begaus one seems to imply that it merely has the color yet none of the value wher you cot me then o i am afraid to say be peretry call o rote mole than i expect lod me the munch it had a squan do you remember when you first came cuetting yes my memory is in tact wha's it beause i jistinglyry ee talling you i do not o a tentl dov i find roses played outtten and quite frankly as lordi leaping i've seen enogh in yet that is all you seem to ave

christmas carols two things that i remember very well from a christmas qhuir was a one was i got a solo that i got to do a yet o an i screwed up and that was horrifying the other thing that just occurred to me now is is on the south side of chicago and sos pretty racially diverse meaning i was usually was the minority not just as a jew but as a white person i'm as an quir and we also did a lot of gospels which is where i discovered that i cannot clap a and a it became something that i would practise at home cit have carification just as i ha ader you would practice capping yet to what

producers stephany fo recently discovered to christmast tradition that still pretty new in our country that no kitding brought her joy no kitting made the world seem a bigger more wonderful place to her jas this report i do not remember how we stumbled on my very first turkey explosin vidio but i do remember everything else about it the vidio is called why you should never deep fry a frizen turkey two fire fighters are standing at the ready in front of a fire track on a long somewhere in front of them stands a large pot full of hot ail on a propane burner another fire fighter in full heere comes out with a rawpink turkey hanging from the end of a long steck he lowers the turkey into the pot it is totally submerged an wale ndan the oil bubble and over flows spilling everywher and a couple of fireballs even first out of the pot in gust and then just when you think ets over here comes the mest fi suddenly an enormous twenty foot colum a fire blasts out of the pot sauron himself has been conjured by way of poultry sacrifice i watchd it again and again then i pulled in my coarger chat me wel shohn coll twatch with me another time naa gray is jus pleasureal i saw in up next column and you to that ther were more vidios this turkey frire fire safety piesees put out by fire departments across the country we stopped counting at a hundred and fifty fodeas they come from toosan depends e cola to danville california all made to demonstrate the dangers of deep frying a lot of the vidios were clearly done as segments for local tea vse stations but some departments employ different theatrical methods to amp up the drama on the piasses some you slow ml somd play epic music as you watch close ups of the pot of oil some spray water in the pot obviously something you should never do with the greese fire as it doubles the size of the flames william shatner even stars in one vidio titled eat fry lovee crated by state farm in it he is playing the inet cheff om one o moisterteaseo ti wa to a to reg and there is a dub stupre max aataat amazingly this was also released by state farms as iiairaatier then there are the jack asked fidios a where regular people without safety gear lower turkeys into deep fires sometimes from alarming heights underneath trees and baskeball hoops of course thereis a subjon r here of people who actually wind up catching their decks on fire and fly into a panic just saying youre average turkey fire incident injures four people for because it is a spectator sports which is why fire departments do these fitias ever hear but after my seventh time watching why you should never deep frire turkey it occurred to me that thereis another reason why they do them i notice one of the firefighters standing in the back he was barely suppressing a grin assumed in on ham watchd it again definitely agrant i called him to ask about it his name is lieutenant daniel acramen of the scanby county fire rescue that in one of the higlig to bein in te ofis when you acy drot a hurk your not a n sasur how can come out here is some f the guides from the fargo fire department they have one of my favor at vidios hi hi do all of you guides

quick signcs lesson these fors and turkeys are filled with ice i s of course is water and water his nartments with oil when the turkey hit the oil that ice turns to water turns to steem which wushes the oil out of the pot and when that hits the flame underneath bo your basic turkey fying do nots are as follows on do not put in a fos an turkey you should taw your turkey twenty four hours for every five pounds that is threvil days for fifteen pounder to do not put in a wet turkey or a too big turkey three do not overfill the pot with oil or over heat the oil for do not do this inside and lastly most fire departments would tell you the most important do not is just please do not deep fry a turkey at all fargo double did all the donts while some far figters hee their demonstration pots to three fifty fargo took theirs to seven hundred the pot of oil is obviously already in flames and overflowing befor the turkey gets anywhere near it an active bulcanal ani manage to find the first

before i get the big news of the day i want to give you the up date on the number one song in america facts we ove one day to put this thing at the top of the billboard charte billboard itself is now basically acknowledging the facts which is my rap song with tom mc donalds or more accurately tom mc donald's rapstot rasong featuring me billboard is now acknowledging that it is likely to make number one on the billboard charts which is hysterically funny and they are freaking out about it they put out a piece yesterday over at billboard at dot tom titled next weeks hop one hundred magon these stallion verses nicki manauge verses ben chipiro and they are freaking out now let us be clear the hot one hundred is not actually the list that we are seeking to be number one on the onethat we want to be number one on is the digital song sales which is whi should head on over to ietunes does the only sailes that are currently being counted in terms of the billboard digital song sails list hat onortituns right now if ye have nalready bought the song and go do that over there but billboard is freaking out about this and the freeding out about this for very simple reason which is they have attempted to basically bar people tom mc donald from the charts the hippop industry is very much infused with left wing thinking on everything from social politics to drog politics to all the rest of him we all know what hiphop has brought to the world in terms of ser its moral compass that is to say in large part not much and a song facts which is very much directed the other way or as tom mc donald' raps in the song were not gon to turn your sons into thogs your daughters an to hose that is something that the industry simply cannot take they do not it at all bilboard is freking out about this bilboard put out this piece yesterday sing yes really after right when punnet ben chipiro help propell multiple songs to nmber one this decade including magan these stallions on wap back in twenty twenty with either his indorsement or his disavawel he is now in pursuit of a hot one hundred toper of his own even admits as much on facts is collab with antiwoke rapper tom mc donald as he directs audiences during his own rapvers again yes really all my people delmo this let us get a billboard number one as they point out we have had no radio suppoart we are not a big corporation that is dedicated to music and and manipulating the chartes fechy go look hate the charts over t ituns what you will see is that main thse stallions hiss which is the top competitor for that number one slop right now alongside nicki mannashas big foot both of those tracts have now been separated into about eight different versions of the tract as to aggregate sales to have a bunch of versions of te same song over and over and over being pumped by these massive corporations in an attempt to prevent tom song with me from hitting number one onthe bilboard chart gill make it happen right now folks us get that billboard number one this sort of your last opportunity to day to get in under the wirs id on over to ietons and get the song it is also again amazing how the media are deliberately and militantly attempting to not get the joke ithey cannot allow the joke to happen the joke is the funniest joke in the history of pophulter i'm sorry it is me at the top of the rapcharts is indeed be funniest joke in the history of pop culture in th united states i do not think there is a a big competitor to be frank with you and they really do not wanto get the jokes o washington post has an entire piece to day title benschippirofs new song number one on itunes how did that happen and here is what they write humorlessly absoluly humorlessly hei's democrasy dies in darkness and the washington posties in facthe darkness quote benchipiro a right when political commentator known for his insendiary takes just made his rapdabiew with a spit fire song called facts it is sorts on number one spot on the itune's store sittin bove recent pop and hippop hits from the lightes of magan these stallian just in timber lake an jack harlo the song a collaboration between chippero and canadian rap artist tom mc donald to be fair tom is the chifartist yan igan i'm keen mentioning this betom is the one we's actually good at this again tom's being overlooked by some of the media because of the hysterically fonny hadline that i'm a rap artist now tom atually is in any case the song is pat of lyrics that tame take amat critics the culture words the rapjoner in general and call out rap artist nicky manash and lezo by the wik side trak ratyer hatip to nicky manog who is whos really i think enjoying this whle controversy nickmanash actually tweeted out this morning quote wait till they wake up and listen to what benshipero is saying in facts the outrage on this one will be a tad bit delayed the the i i'm enjoying it nickiprichet in any case there is the washington post not understanding things quote being number one appears to be a big deal forshippero who founds in the daily wire in twenty fifteen and culonelly hosts his own political podcast an radio sho he recently changed his byo on acts formerly twitter to read worlds nmber one wrapper he is hiddled one of his recent ue to podcasvidos i am america's number one wrapper in which he played the entire fact music vit while praising the success of his hot wait yumc wait it is a big deal to me number one as opposed to all the other people in the music industry who are a tempting to be number three mayly i love the washer it appears to be a big deals to ve numer yes that is why you are writing about it i notice tht's why your pang it tension to it a golwalle ohik he seems to care about being number what a my you you losers truly you losers hrefused to get the joke i's it the song success mures that of other songs that aveties to america's politics but jason ou deans try that in a small town and olver anthony's rich men north of richmon from last summer and then this thing goes on for hundreds of words talking in very serious terms about what happened here wat chippero has an noted histry of criticizing rat music and explicit lyrics ins twenty nineteen he set on his his sho the rap was not a real joner of music igniting a baplash on social media well i mean i said that because i maye classically trained musician and let me just explain what that means for foks i on atial anderstand thae iference between say rap and hippop and classical music to be a classically traine musician means you will spend in your life tens of thousands of hours practicing at an instrument see can plays fom the greatest music over written to be it number one charting bill board rap artist means being featured and a tom mc donald song where i rap forlike thirty seconds and my lifelong preparation for that was talking that is not the same thing remotely in kin but again the media are militantly refusing to to get the joke and to that maces the joke even funnier of course and we can only hope that at the gramies you will receive some sort of recognition for the fact that we are in fact the number one song in america and we need your help to day to make sure just a again bilbart's basely acnowledging we wi'll be nuber one on the digutal downmod chart which is the one that raming

actual mis in actualness there is a vidio that is now gone virel and it is indicative of the chief issue in the two thousand twenty four campaign and s can remain the chief issue in the twenty twenty four campaign until some other issue takes precedente and there is a long time to now in the election but right now the big issue of this campaign an the big issue of our time is human migration human migration is the big issue of our time it is causing a vast turmoil in european politics it is causing vast turmoil and africa it is causing vast turmoil in the united states is turnes out that large swaves of human beings crossing borders willy nilly causis conflict and to what we are seeing in the united states are the results of that conflict here is a vidio this came out day before yesterday it is a it is a migrant mob in yo legal immigrant mob pounding a pair of cobs near time square over the week en here is what that vidio looks o my goodness oh my goodness say you can see these of tese gysards jumping these two cobps ik a bunch of them tere's jumping yese who cops the beating them down on the streets tht this has to be what ten twelve i legal imigrants apparently police initially busted for of the asylum seeking dots now remember there sing the silum what ave i've ben saying four weeks ra may the s documentary about southern borishgo checket out it daily wired ot comic is to fantastic documentary talking about exactly wht is happening to understand what is happening you have to understan the chief signal thing the bide administration did is the said you now have a magic word to get into the united states to america you walk up to the boarder ifindaborpetral agent you shout i feare to go back to by home country this amounts to a legal asylum claim at that point you are not held in mexico pending a hearing on whether you in fact have the right to seek asylum you are not actually held in the tention they proces yo in they release you to the interior where you go to new york n beat the living shot out of cops that apparently is is the the way that emigration is working in the unites hisef course the vast majority people hor crossing the were are not doing this but why should any of this be happening literally this sould not be happening these these people were seeking asylum and what they really are our criminals par seeking to participating criminality according to the yeropost the footage showsin and wipety officer an lieutenant initially telling the migrants to move along around eight thirty pm saturday on west forty second street in manhatton which cours the heart of manhatton that is before things quickly got routy as a scuffle broke out between the cops and assuspects was wrestled to the ground and then the rest of the illegalimigrans converged on the officers and star being the hellout of them the vidio shows the wo officers left on the ground as the pack runs east on forty second street toward seventh avenue and gets away but not for long pollece initially busted four of the asylum seeking dogs identified as garuan on thais gomes iscayo nineteen kelvan sedvatarocha nineteen wadas wilson twenty one and yorman raveran twenty four adding to the rich diversity of the united states all four were charged with tha sault and released without bal according to sources perfect new york story ileglemigrans on thestreets beting the haloticops released without bale a fifth suspect yon baladat twenty two was arrsted monday night and charged with the tempted assault of the police officer the manhattens the asofficay they ar still investigating the incident in reviewing additional vidio of the allege asault one of the men has two open cases in manhatten for assault and robbery sees been arrested twice before is anileglemigran has not been deported got arrested again for assaulting a cop and then got released from jail immediately without bail in november he allegedly put pushed punched and bit a norge from rack employ who caught him lifting one hundred thirty dollar itum from the union square stores display rack according to law in forcement sources also last month reveron also punched with a closed fist a loss prevention officer at the herald square bmasies after trying t pulloff arobbery with two other suspects that is gets just a career criminal in the united states pretending he has an asylum claim this is jo biden's america this is jo bidesemigration policy is is jo biden's choice to let people this into the country he has the law on the books that would allow him to stop all this this would not a happend is it i under donald trumps emigration policy people this would be turned back at the border thet whad been remaining in mexico awaiting their asylum hearing the shocking incident is just the latest example of a sylum seekers running a foul of the law in the big applum according to the norkpost again this is you should not be shocked by thingsthat are perfectly predictable in fact as yon balda who is the last one who cus cotarested was leaving manhattent criminal cor without bale he flipped off the press therelly walks out flashes two middal fingers at the press as he walks out and why peuty chief of patrol jon cheltshold reports you saw the vityo reprehensible their cowards houove eight people attacking lieutenant a cop running up to them t kick them in the face atly meanwhile this du to jist walking out free flipping off the press why our people this in our country why there is no right to be in our country if youare a criminal there is no right to be in our country if you are i a citizen of another country and you are not legally claiming asylum if your asido not claim is bull crap and yet the the wild left as captured the democratic party to the extent that they are refusing to say the obvies which is these people should not be in our country they should not be in our country wet's more on this 'n just one second first it is a struggle findtesty healthy food of the grocery store these days everything seems to have more labels than calaries fortunately for you my friends an good ranchers are extending their new year new meat offer but only for my listeners you are not conto find thi steal anywhere else here is what have to do go to good ranchersdot com subscribe to any of their boxes use cod ship pero a checkot theough out over two pounds of chicken bress it is a hundred eighty nine dolar vallu to every order you receive for the next year that is over twenty five pounds of pree trimmed better than organic chicken for free i actually've had a cosherstake from good ranshers one cosherstake they made it was amazing and everything from good ranchers is that good my people tellin me they sent me sammon from their wild cot sefebox that was also

've had on the shell ri over the young turks she made the signal error the other day i've actually saying on the eir the people this should be deported and people went nuts on her how could she do this here is a clip of anna hes there not people you neet to provide cover for thes our people who are in the country claiming a sylum they do not have a right to be here it is a privilege to be able to take advantage of our asylum program for this she is been receiving extraordinary bloback because the somewhat rational left is being completely expelled by the actual radical left that is the current state of things and you can see that this battle inside the emocratic party now i know everybody is sort of giving up the ghosts for the moderate democrass an thin gou little early for that there is a battle that still has to be fought inside the democratic party because the impact of ae legal migration in blue centers is finally starting shold be felt here for example is the massachusetts governor mor hely crying as she announces she is convertig a recreation center into a housing facility for legal imogrants bloso ie co ommitted to this little kits need to be able o breathe clean air they need to be able to access slaming pulls they need tet life ars there who can teach him has swim and they need to have activities i do not now what were going to do for a couple three months o collin universitys to color their places oka now here is the problem this s going to be used as an emergency shelter for people who are sleeping literally at lognairport they are literally sleeping in elegolimigrans at logan international airport the cas recreation center is the center that is going to be used as sort of the overflow center that is going to accommonate four hundred people are about one hundred families but local members the communal what the hell ex seresy what to help why do we have a a an extraordinary nmber of legal emigrants whov now taken over the rect censer the we pay our tax is force that we can use what what what why is this happening and meanwhile you have this radical governor masstrs its crying over it wha good luck good luck if if you can get to winning message good luck to you meanwhile here is democratic den for mayor my johnson pointing out that the city of denver is completely filled up that every hotel in the city of denver has been taken over by legalimigrants we have always hav a lan tay policy here wi genery in dividual ou t thiy forto wa i thy ter sev ewe pas ta er about for tix wek ter very very or o ever sever everyeve we hav tae forr o ot r ot er av bor ev eerya i think our civy is very close to s porcing point out is it is that is right that is right and and many democrates are starting to see it an people ranging from john federman to the democratic mayor of denver a they they do see it in these other cities by theway eiric adam sees it new york brannan johnson sees it in chicago i meanthat they are all seeing and there just pretending they do not see it and you can only pretend that reality does not exist for long before even your typical voters stark to turn on you and that is what is happening with regard to emigration and jobidon which again he is losing that issue by leaps and bounds his only response to this is going to be abortion by the way he is not going to even deal with emigration issue the emigration issues sjust in a simmer the entire year he is instead going to redirect ed abortion and try to get suburban women to vot against onald trump based on there suppose it need for an abortion despite the fact that suburban women arenactually having that many abortions in the united states at this point an time but the emigration issue for a huge numbe of americans is going to continue to grow insides as well it should by the way all it would take is god forbid one serious terrorist attack bynin legalimigrant crossing america southern border which there are countries that areattempting to funnel terrorist across america southern border given that it is wide open at this point all it would take is a serious attacked completely shift the nature of american politics perhaps for a generation because it turns out that we have america that the great promise of americo is free markets and security just in terms of what the governmen is supposed to provide you property rights and security those of the things that america historically has done incredibly well o feels both of those things are in danger that something that americans are not going to react well to according to the new bloomburg swing states pole the question was how responsible if at all is present imbidon for the increase in migrans crossing the ose mexical border sixty one per cents ay responsible only twenty nine per cent say not responsible that by the way includes thirty eight percent of democrats who say the jobidon is responsible for the huge increase any leglemigrations border that include fifty nine per cents of his pannics forty seven per cent o blacks as suppose o thirty six percent who say that he is not responsible for all of that fifty to per cent of americans trust donald trumpin emigration compared to thirty per cent of americans trusting jobidon by the way on the economy the umbers are fairly similar ondthe economy trumpeits trusted by fifty one percent is in the swing states first thirty three percent for jobidon seraint now your seing some national polling data that suggesting tha bidon has open up a lead in in a head to head quinipiac university put out a pole yesterday they put out this pole and they show a lead of bidna significant lead a fifty to forty four per cent lead among registered voters and a hypothetical general election mactro nout there is a difference to registered voters and likely voters likely voterpoles ten to be better register voterpoles ten to be wors the reason is because again a thet a lot register voters ware simply not going to vote the up coming election tis th big probem for jobidon he one when you have the biggest spike in election votes in american history when the number of votes in a presidential election shifts by extraordinary per centages in twenty sixteen thereare proximatly a hundred fifty seven million voters and thereabout a hundred and thirty six million votes cast in twenty twenty a hundred and fifty seven a hundred d fifty five million people shut up to voting twenty twenty a hundred fifty five millin people that is an increase of again eighteen twenty million people in one election cycle that is not onreplicate this time it is going to turn out is con be down in twenty twenty four it will mainly because all of the voting wolls re in a shift back to normal and a lotof people can be expected to god to a polling place in actually vote you are not going to get people voting five months in advance of the election by mail something sixty per cents ovall democratic voters in t e last election ycal voted by ma that is not going to replicate this time while your seeing a lot of poles that are starting to emerge nationally in the states donal trump dos in fact retan a lead donald and that lead is going to be durable long as jobiton continues to destroy the situation on the border and he is doing that single handedly by the way this is one reason the border deal is on life support if republicans actually thought that there was a a chance that jobidon was going to shut down the borter if jobi nactully just to day cammountiusiliscem wer don'g remain a mexico and we are also going to make sure the iffou have an asylum application they you have to stay into tention until that is judicated if jobide made those two changes to day the chance of a border deal would go up significantly not just because republicans might then belead that they had something a credible partner in shutting the border and maintaining a border at all but also because the political in centives which would witch then who id move from if there is a compromise on the border that bales jobiten out to if there is a compromise on the border that shifts the law in a direction that we that is a sementing of actions that jobidnes are ty taken what re publicans are are afraid of is that they are going to sign on to a border deal and jobidon is then one tho absolutely screw them in terms of the executive implementation of that deal and they are right to be prirticlarly frightened of that when he seell these republicans on ears who are out there right now saying thingsabout the bill bil great in this we have not yet seen the text of the bill i cannot ajudicate whether i think the bill is good or tell you whether i think the bill is good un tillive actually

course that the bill is gann go nowhere house speaker mike johnson has used rumors of the bill's contents to pronounce it d o a sernjams langford voklahoma said he is bee meeding with republicans one on one s claru in formation about the bill sener crston senima she says the rumors swirling about what this dosan does not to are wrong the question is why not just release what the deal is wont one once we know what the dealis than we can decide whether or not it to give the deal bottom line though is that the is only one person who can bail jobit an out of the situation and is in fact jobidon meanwhile jobiton quickly trying to backfill many of his problems with his own domestic bas particularly among blue collar white voters that is the the constituents he believe or not that jobi nectioul cut into against donal trumpen twenty twenty donal trump over performed with minorities donal trump over performeds in urban areas donal trump under performs with blue collar white workers in two thousand twenty statistically theactually under performdwhat ye done in twenty sixteen in twenty twenty anot's we are to set up that actuall is the statistical truth whelt a lot of those voters are now turning again back tu donal trump and a way from jobiton which presumably is wy jobitden is now pretending he cares byt east palistine ohio thourecall that he is palcin ohio was a place whre there is a major trains a railmenters toxic spill anda and jobinston go the fer a year and peep buto jedge did not go there and peep buto jedge was on t v talking about why it was necessary for hi m to take paternialy to car for his a his husband who obviously was egregiously physically wounded during the birth of their of their child in any case aceren johmpierre is exs plaining why jobidon is visiting his palcing the anser is the jobidon is trying to shore up that sor rush belt base that he thinks he has here hotin why o whitemen trthe te a ig coa and s no on ur otn pardn go the mayor and a community leaderis invited the president to meet with is palistan a resident an also ee o the recovery a progress tats been going on for some time now you all know and the president had always a that he would go when it is most helpful to the community and with this invitation obviously a very recent and the current fatis of therecovery we felt that the time was rigt again we got an invitation from the marin communiators to to come and very very recently and we are working a with tom to figure ou the best time to do that in february oh is it is that when you received the invitation very recently by very recently yu meani year ago because that is not usually how he keep time in the real world is very recently as a yiragof my ef if if i say that i took my wife out to dinner recently what i mean by that is in two thousand twenty two that is not recently that is not how it works again jobidn has to shore up that martinal base because he is just campagniin cratibly week his pull numbers are really bad and because they are bad he is trying prtymuch everything in the book which is presumably also why jobidon is now a tempting to buy off michigan muslin voters that is effectively what he is doing right now with all his idiot talk about the iddilies i got to say his middliston polisy has been a complete crapsho since he took office whether it is rea orienting away from salyorabia reorienting away from israel orienting toward eron being incredibly conciliotory toward the iatol was declaring the who the is a non terror group trying to undermine the sauty regime what jobidon has made nothing but missteps in the middlies over and over and over and now they are looking it may be doing ther biggest mis step of all n the reason tha they are doing that is of course because jobidon's radical bas is procomass there is a radical part of the democratic cate not the whole democratic party there is a ratical part of the democratic party that actually's kind of warm torcomoss ho o to sea israel disappear tand that radical base does existin places ranging from chicago to michigan last night the chicago city council thereis a twenty three to twenty three ti at the city council and was broken by the more on mayor of chicago brandon johnson who is presided over the continuing collapse of one of america's great cities and om chicago voted for a ceasefire in gasa which at this plaint i should note there should be thet they should actually vote for a ceasfire in chicago that be more appropriate considering that there were six hundred and seventeen murders in chic hago last your alone and thet in twenty twenty three there are two thousand four hundred fifty two shootings in chicago may be the sould work on the sease firing chicago before they work on these cease fire in gaza but of course this how you please your ratical left base in brandon johnson is in facto radical leftis idiot you you a oere for yeive we did it we di it we we we got a sease fire and you got nothing you got nothing i'm tired there is no sease firing gosan nor will there be asease firing gaza but you have a much of procomas terror supporters for extremely excited about chicago voting for a seas fire and gaza well good news folks i have singularly to clared world piece it is all your promies are solved i've also declared universal prosperity i voted for it i set it therefore it exists or alternatively yall or bunch of morons we get to more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes or unfiled returns this year the ires is ascalating collections they have added twenty thousand new agents no in these challenging times your best defence is to use tax network ou ssay along with hiring thousands of new agents in field officers the ires is kicked off twenty twenty four by sending over five million pay up letters to those who have unfiled taxirturns or ballance is ote he is gisn not your friends do not wave your rights and speak

guidance call one eight hundred two forfisix fhousan or visit t and yu s adok com slashchipiro again turn to tax not work you ussay find your path to financiral pece of mind that t n you ss ado com slashshipiro that radical left base does matter to jobidon which is why he keeps missashing the sholdiers of people protesting him and shouting about how much they love radical terra groups that murder jews and rape women in killbabies in fact howhow radical ar certin parts the democraticparty last night in the house of representatives there is a votes the vote was a bill to bar from the united states alvl comos members and any one involved with thease lomist terra group october seven the tack on is ro that' smly a pretty obvious one right wike you on't got to come to the united states if you are a member of the terrorous group comas seems ration all right or if you ere involved in' a direct terror assault that killed twelve hundred people and took two hundred forty people into hostage situations into tunnels if you 're involved in that it seems a poision enter the united sit is a base line stuffright there were in fact there is near unanimity in the house for this for this very very easy notion there ware two voters who said no ou said no if you are member of comase should be allowed to come into the united states if you are ou're involved in in actual terror attack on october seventh you should also be alowed into the united states who er these a truly evil human beings wait for it it is coming representative quarry bush who when she is not expending allegedly tax perr dollars to pay off her various relations isa is voting in favor of comass and rusheda to leav your democrat from terror island over here it it is amazing in a statement to leab said the bill incited hatred against people her what you mean terrorists im im am confused i do not thing wereshe a to leave is a terris to she declaring herself in total solidarity with comass terrist because she saying the quipart a loud if she denounced the bill as another geope messaging bill being used to incite anti arab anti palstonian antimuslem hatred that makes communities ours unsafe i should point out at this point that she says the geope messaging bill it literally passed four hundred and twelve too two siry four hudred twenty two two two was the actual vote four hunder twenty two to two was the actual vote here yet that is hat that is a geope messaging bill in which four hundred twenty to people vo one way and she and quary bush wit the other i again your sort of saying the quipart out loud if you say we cannot discriminate against terrorist because people might think the terroris are muslims or that it is inciting anti arab anti palstonian antimuslem hatred to discriminate against comass what are you saying exactly the argument that if you if you pass a crime bill that this going to incite anti black visolance am i'm not the one saying that crime is black and i'm not saying that terror is muslem i'm saying terror is terror in comassus comass but richititoly these people to hold sway in this administration they do which is why and the washington post an the media are fully in the scamp the washington post is truly a despicable publication truly despicable they te pease bite personhime yes mean abutaleb in the washington post called michigans arabs and muslims pushed to de feet bidon in critical state and this entire article is about how terrible jobidon is for supporting israel in its war against comass ania many arab american nd muslim voters in deerborn where arab americans make up majority the population you remember them doing a palistonian march early olic before even is railly retaligation for the terror attack in which there were actual terriflaxh bing flon is resolved not only t with hold his vote from bidon but to actively campaign against him some michigan arabs and muslems have launche in abanton bidin campaign part of a broader national movements still gettng off the ground to insure those in their communityship to cast their vote but not for bidon then i con vofer nonal trump obvious lake his trump is waymore prois rol then jobidon by every available metric but they are going to yellow jobidon jobdon is very scared of the yelling and he has decided apparently he and his statespartment are trying to icide on a new strategy a new stratgy for the middle east this stratege involves full scale surrender two terror organizations full scale no stops surrender will get to that momentarily first sup yell do mean to

barach ravide reporting for actios the state department is now being asked by the secreterstate tonty blancan to con duct a review and present policy options on possible youess an international recognition of a palistinian state after the war in gaza according to two es officials briefed on the issue that is insang i' m explain why that is insang there is no government the palsin an authority does not even govern the wesbank it has the aproval of zero per cent of the palsnian population by pollingtdad is non zero but it is very close to zero which is why machmood bas the eighty eight year old cleptocrat who is stolen billions of dollars from his own people same thng with thismilhonea over in comasland as living at five star hotels and cuttar while the rest of his people are living in rubble but the palsinian authority it does not have the approval oftone people bachmoodbas is currently in the if my mouth is correct nineteenth year of a for year term the last election tha was held tht was i believe two thousand six in the westbank and it was rigged in favor of machmoodbas that commas wuld nout win and heu still serving as quonquote president he also hapisto be a halicosto nying juhator who is walked way from the table on multiplications when presented with a piecial most recently by a hood olmar most generous pieciol ever offered to the palsonians yhou simply walked away from the table mo counter offer that is one parity in be governing structure of the palistinian outh of t palstinian areas other governing structures is lomatyhot a fullon terragroup come oss a fillon terragroup there is no government there is no government not only that there is no teratorial border no borer has been decided upon if you take a look at the westbank it looks in andy warhall painting it is all over the place the reason it is all over the places cause youhave inter mixed populations because there had never been any sort of stati settlement after the sixty seven war now member between nineteen forty and nineteen sixty seven the arab's controlled the west bank and the gasastrip jorn control belus bank the gastrip was control by egypt at no point id egypt tried to crae to palistinian state in the gose strip and at no point to jorgan try to prat to palistonian state in the west bank the arabs do not care about a palistonian state any of these areas in fact they kno ful well that if a palistonian state were to be created these areas it wold immediately be a terror state directed at them the jordanians are not really in favor of a paten independent palistonian state governed by the palistonian authority o commas tht is a direct threat to the hash mighte regime in jordan the egyptians do not want a palistonian state in the gosistrip that is why they have a border wall that makes israel's border will look nothing that called rafa gate down the bore between egypt and the gasastrip in other words a palistnian state nomber one is in no one's interest in the region literally no one a paw including the palistonins because there governing structure would not exist it would be garbage and it would foment terrorism and lead to fullscale war if a palistnian state were actually to exist and then they were to attack israel isra would have no humanitarian obligations at all because now you are at war directly with another sovereign state at that point all bets are off but the worst thing for the palistonians would be to have a palistonian state govern by either of the p a or commass there is no governing structure saying that you are going to preremptively to clara palistonian state with no borders no government representative of the people no power powerful enough to even governd the areas that are supposedly governed and no rational for wyd this state would somehow make the world a better place more solid why this place would be governed in allegiance to anything fundamentally decent principles as suppose you just becoming a horrifying cherea law state which is what commoss wants for example what the hell is jobidan thinking what the hallis he thinking and mean it is crazy not only is it stupid and morally benighted it also happens to be utterly unrealistic i may as well declare a state of chi perostand somewhere in salthy stasia i're nomany territoria holdings there i do not the borders are ther's no government that is prove by the people there but sure i'men i whysh why not mansure well just aclare a state ofship perostand it has all of the same qualities as a quonn what state o palistin no government no government capable of holding territory no government capable of governing people and no rational for existing persay but sure it will be great it will be ret by the way notice the prioritye sere from the by dmenstration met ie ean independent curtestand i noticed not are toman independent somali land i notice not on on the list of p a of peoples who deserve a state right now in the sense that the state wlashing notbea threat to western interests an will not be a full on fomenting terror state the palistonian state idea comes dead last it is really low on that prioritialist why exactly is jobin doing all this and theyre wo reasons one again is to please his left wing domestic bate and the other reason is because the the state department is filled with moreons and the is moreons have a peculiar belief that if you simply give terrorus what they want than they will be nice to you and that somehow this will foment peace in the region reading the way among these morons as tom is freed en thomas freedment is truly the stupidest person to write on forein policy in my lifetime it is not particularly close thomas freedmens entire bag is what if i travel around get lind and dined by randem regimes an the right rosy rose colored glassis views of these awful rechimed he is done with a rindit with china i'll go all over the place i'l be wine and dine by these verious recimes and that is whak ataxy drivers and those tay drivers will will bestow their wisdom upon me and then i will go and meet with jobidoan helpe to find hits form policy she has a pieace today tidle a bidon doctrine for the middleast is forming and it is big what exactly with this bidan doctrine being he says on one track would be a strong and resolute stand on aron including a robust military retaliation against orons proxies and agents in the region in response to the killing of three ou us soldiers at a basin jordan by a drone apparently launch by a prooronian militia in arock ecase that has not materialized at all there has been no harsh response by the by diministration to the murder of three american soldiers in jordan none zero there saying there is stroing drone alets ahh now we believe you you have high levels of credibility i'm sure that you have just yet i'm sure i'm sure not ustating a camel in the ass or blowing up an empty building i'm sure jobidon is is taking harsh meatur on the second track says thomas rymen would be an unprecedented you us diplomatic innitiative to promote a palistonian state now it would involve some form of yuse recognition of a demilitorized palistonian state in the westbank an gosestrip that woul come in to being only once palistonians have developed a set of define credible institutions and security capabilities to insure that the state was viable and that it culd never threaten israel oh well i mean under those conditions i'm sure palistonian staping pursued right now is definitely going to happen when unicorns are farding energy sure that tat'seumgs that is right aroun the corn by the way the the message that jobidon an th sates parmen our senning right now but just look at the time line here jobdon in the states partmel were not pushing the immediate recognition of a palistonian state because its idiocy then october seventh happenes twelve hundred jews get murdered and now the bi dministrations what if we jus give them what they want what what is that say what s the message the messages if you kill enough jews jobidon will give you a state that is the actual message the actual messageis if ou murder enough jews jobidon wi'll consiliate to your position how dis that strength in the west exactly seriously how is that good four america how is a good ilec because the same logicol applie to americans presumably that if he kill enough americans jobidoenwil jus give you what you want is is the most appeasemen orient to palis have ever even remotely herd of come oss murders twelve hundred jews the palisonian authority has on its books laws that paid people who murder jews and the bidministrations what if we uphold the you and aur dble you ite which the comoss front group what if we actually give the palistonian authority a state what if we do all of those things that'l be great according to thomas freedmen bide administration officials have been consulting experts inside an outside you us government about different forms ut this recognition of palistonian statehood might take haso again no expert can simply wishcast a palistonian state that is moderate and not a threat to its neighbors into existence they tried to wish c asted into existence during the oslow cords that was literally the oslow cords and for thirty years we have we have operated in the middle east under this delusion and it is a stupid ascinine foolish nincompoopish idea ridiculous on the third track according to thomas reman would be a vastly expanded you us securitia lines with soutyarabia which oare also involve souty normalization of relations with israel if the is really government is prepared to embrace a diplomatic process leading to it militrized palisonian state wled by a transform palistonian authority well oka again when the rainbows far when when the unicorns far rainbows i guess that were there if the administration can pull this together a huge iff a biding doctrine could become the biggestrategic realinement in the region since the ninety seven nineteen seventy nine camp day v treaty well and and if i could and if i could somehow solve the problem cold fusian energy would be free what but by the way what is amazing about thomas reeman's idiot plan which is now being embraced again by the idiot by d administratio of yuse lord t idiot herolopic truly these people are are mentally deficient the what what funny about this is that pursued two of these three tracts and was successful donal trump lashe took harsh antironian action donal trump he killed custam solemoni the had of the alkoods forcehe put the harshest sanctions in american history on aron a no did it contained aron he made clear that if a ron crossed lines they would get clocked in the face a noderondid they shot up meanwhile youre call the trum aministration made warm overtures toward the souties and toward the ua eon bahrain an dor moroco a yot they did theyll may piece oft itzrel and sowd he was goin to do it too in other words the scentrality of the palistinians to anything remotely piece in the idle east is not only a ly it is a pernicious and counter productive y but that is exactly do bide administration is now embracing why because they are wetted to their own stupid form policy they cannot separate themselves from a number one and number two they are geting black mail by their own voting bas in they do not have the strength of character to recognize that actually not supporting terror regimes in the establishment of state might be good policy meanwhile et yelan musk has come under fire because elan musk is not of the left a elan musk is the most creative ontropernor of our time by far which dviced the richest man in the world he start a multiplicity of unbelievably interesting companies ranging from tessla which is a great company to spasacs which is in my opinion even a greater company a e hes is simply a singular figure in modern western wife is is an incredible figure which is why peopleare coming after him they are all fine with him he was he was the ontropanore who is interesting and fascinating and qirky an all of the stuff until the point he bought acts as soon as he started making sounds that he liked free speech and wanted to open up the auspicies of of social media two various all turn of opinions the world came down around his ears and what we are watching right now is a political bice against elon musk turned into a legal bice against elaon musk the legal system when we talk by the legal system being perverted i mean this is a natural perversion of te legal system according to fox business a delaware judge ruled in favor of tessla in vestors who sued to challenge a fifty six billion dollar paypackage for ela mus the decision dares to boldly go where no man has gone before or least where no delaware court has tread the opinion states the collection of feature's characterizing musk's relationship with tessland its directors gave him enormous influence over tessla in her ruling the judge said quhat the plaintiveis entitled to recision meaning that the shareholders testla sued to bastely cawl back a fifty six billion dollar paypackage to muskell get into the paypckg in a seconds of sis bigges paypackage anybod's ever heard of why did that happen al get ino then a second shoe directed the two parties to confer on a final form of order to implement her decision and submit a joint letter identi fying all issures including fees that need to be addressed to bring the matter to conclusion at the trial level she added that tessell was put unable to prove that the stockhold or vote was fullyin formm because the proxy statement inaccurately detae described key directors is independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process now the problem is that the paypackage that musk negotiated with tessla was widely teride it at the time as basically empty verbiage that would never materialize because effectively speaking musk deferred all compensation to a future pay package tied to the increase in the stock valuation of tessla plus earnings that is what happened and everybody knew about it because it was h most widely remarked upon c e o this is is most widely remarked upon c e o pay package literally in human history tessel's agreement with musk is the largest compensation ever provided to an executive to major factor and making one o the world's wealthiest individuals what happened is that he was not guarantee any salary this is commented upon by andrew ro sork and back in twenty eighteen and here is what hero just to make clear what the judge is doing judgeis tates muskin as decided to scrub but here is wat at what actually happen here quote testla's elan musk may hve the boldest pay plantin corpert history for the last several years there is been speculation about elan musk's future at tessla and whether he would step down as chief executive in the next year or too mister muss stoke to that speculation as far back as five years ago when he said he wanted to staye through the introduction of the model three and then in twenty fourteen he said i'll have to se how things are going at that point with the success of musk vario souther endeavors spasects whos only natural that investors would expect at the model for rober down anjunior's tony stock might move on to a different role a tessela four years later and musk has now decided to stay friend for a deckate by the way was a decaed long contract this is twenty eighteen what exactly was the compensation plan again the zandrosorkan quote mister musk will be paid only if he reaches a series of draw dropping milestones based on the company's market value and operations otherwise he will be paid nothing in other words the compensation package o tha musk is receiving was solely infentive base it is not as though he sind a contract with tessl with all his friends weth he just gave him fifty six billion dollars at the time that all this happened the valuation of tessla total was sixty billion dollars twenty buxe share thare's the valution of testl when the sime the steal ir's a prove by eighty per cent of testl shareholders the plan required him to grow market cap by fifty billion dollar increments with the first milestone starting at a hundred billion dollar valluation the final milestone wath six hundred fifty billion dollars elon musk at a time when the company was valuated in public markets at sixty billion dollars signed a contract saying i only get my pay package if i hit ten if i if i hat eleven acs basically if i take the current value of testla and multiply by eleven then i get this pay package now if you are a shareholder that is a great deal because if we hit that i'm hapit pay him andif we do not hit that then we do not pay him great deal right would you make that deal with your bloss to day or woith your company would you make thet yeall you'l take any pay tit at yu youd defer all your wages no no payment of anything but if your company increases by eleven times in dollu then you get a big bonas eleven notuite not three times eleven times in dolly would you take that youl very few people would musk is a rerisk seekin dolly and tessla shereholders the again what is the problem here this is a great deal testlas sait a doezen targets each fifty billion dollars more than next starting at a hundred billion than a hudred fifty than two hundred all the way on to six hundred fifty billion dollars also the company thai he dozn revenue and adjusted profitgoles musklel receive one point secate million shares or about one per cent of the company only after he reaches milestones for both but as anverostore can wrote of the time this is twenty eighteen to put these numbers in perspective testla is only worth about fifty nine billion dollars to day if mustler somehow able to increase the value of testlet a six hundred fifty billion dollars a figure many experts would content is laughably impossible and would make testal oneof the five largest companies in the u s based on curn valuations histocka word could be worth as much as fifty five billion dollars musk's critics actually at the time complained that it was a publicity stuns that there is no way he would reach any of these numbers unti the whole point of the exercise was to suggest the testl is bigger then it was it is impossible for him to manipulate the systems sait ande ross orkan by trying to prop up the stock price for its temporary period because even once his shares vest yest a hold them for five years before he can sell them swe cannot actually gat the shares that were fifty six billion and then immediately turn round and sell them and under cut the value ofte company cannot do that the judge struck down what is again one of the most risk laden pay packages in american history becaus musk et his marks that is insane its atually quite evil if you take a risk a new benefit from that rist by benefiting all the shareholders to the extent that everybodywho bought in it twenty this a person who on not the person wo start f this owned nine shares of tessla nine those shares of tessla at the time tha musk signe this pay package those shares of tessla were the price at twenty dollars testla shares to day oure tradetongat one hundred and eighty eight dollars youron't get to wine about that i'm sorry you do nots that is an absurd contention and just demonstrates once again there are members of the judiciary who do not give any raps about property rights or the rule of law ok katn just one second we will get to social media hearings on the hill which again it is fascinating to see the sort of coalition that is built against big tac from the right the cretiqe make sense

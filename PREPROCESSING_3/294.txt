i'm i anyand ma bani aaa a aa a aaa aaaaaaa eae ait is his american life in our glass et you that a pregram of course we choose a theme and brng ou a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day show during this period of greatest poultry consumption in our nation the weeks between thanksgiving in christmas we bring your stories of chickens turkey's ducks fal of all kind real and imagine we have din this poultry sho many times year after year in november that to day show is basically a greatest hits af chicken stories for many many years pass we have arrived at at three of our programm at three chicken deva chickens are what we make of them in a lot aways i you could possibly need further evidence of that ifter this first yo acts we just heard we have this story from jackett odly enough it was not susan who was obsessed with chickens it was kenny a bowl who work back stage at the niny second street why in new york his house was filled with chicken cops chicken masks he got the whole staff on to chickens including susan for a time there in the eighties poultry related jokes an references became the fast way to get a laugh at the why i guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens but susan firchuci saw something else theyre potential greatness theyre hidden beauty there grandeur one day she glew together some finger puppets for a ten minute randition of the chicken little story for her nephew that was fourteen years ago to day it is a fullength opera enjoyned by a cull following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe our small theatre it still performed with finger puppets but now it has a complete score written by noted composer henry creger who did dream girls the chicken little opera he wrote with susan for tuci is called love's fowl needless to say that is f o w l well werestore towith theopenin siamodetiato rpetoriodeemaeteia eclose reptor theatr and we have a special sigin guest for you which o dosusan and i ar sitting at henry's baby gran piano henry's guest is is maltys terrier at ename toby perhaps tobe wit we cind anyounl as 't nare which hou sood on your laugt an tat the piano ia and see what we can oke locate lit some carefully because once to be gets going canctually harmonize us with eanses os yo yoyou may have notice that this labretto is an italian just a real opera twe far was just a bunch of papa's in a box ye now with a good idea and then suddenly sis went into a telling it became something bigger than what it had been and it is because when it is in englas w we all can know wat and it is really not that interesting as a gaaya as soon as it is an italian it gives us anough distance that we can come in makes us he is the the lover who does not want you you do not want anybody more than you want the one who does not want you ria's a at sort of the same thing oaononemyety oo todea nnodyou may recall that whn you last heard of little back in kin the garden she was just an average barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on her head which she mistakenly understood to be the skyfalling her alarms excited her friends goosy lusy turkey larkey an ducky lucky and they join her for a journey to the king to tell him the important news on the way they meed up with sly fox little's pawls eagerly accept his invitation for dinner literally as it turns out fortunately for little hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission and she tracks on when she meets the king he tells her that the sky is not falling sjust an acorn the enlightened chicken little returns to her coop and that is where the story ends what are we to take away from littles expearience i to think it is that little is rewarded with life precisely because she went off on this quixsotic mission totally in the grip of a wrong idea tegetea eaythiea nd anamete and an a angan agan the children's fable barely figures into the story it is just one small episode in the life of chicken little now known as lapuchena pucula after the acorn incident she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure an almost every field imaginable a diva politics i cadeen theatr art dearing due venus she arrives from some of the world transported on a scallop shell but the triumphs of her life began after youthful of affair with ha fighting cock ands bitterly and she consoles herself as we all do it some poin n her lives by plunging into shakespeare she becomes an overnight sensation as an actress celebrated all over the world for one roll juliet cleopotra ophelia the company then performs a an accerpt a recreation of the persignature all which is richard there ogomit is ourpbarn heart to halet what is a great tradition of women playing the men's rolls and shakespeare but i think richard e third father rmore rare rolls to be played by a woman that is how a thats ar tom an actress this chicken ras in assure you there is nothing watching a four inch tall finger pup and crying out a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse in italian not to mention that that puppet is a chicken surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry and other avian supernumeraries susan says that artistically theres something special about chickens therare clean slave there are you can put anything on them you can project anything under them because it is not they have to me at least a very strong personality except for lopl chena and the opera she moves into the field of ourchaeology masters it needless to say and makes a great discovery the last tume of galopatra but not before she sails the seven sees shipwrecked it is rescued but is by pirates and then she mites the pirate king as he soon as he meets hervasa lonter because of her sweet spirit caus she comes in and she says here you see a little chicken on who although im dripping wet i'm proud and yellow let me repeat that leric for you and a pure translation although i stand before you a chicken who was dripping wet i am proud and i am yellow oke practises and although iv a loved an i have lost i have learned to follow the call of adventures let us sail on an e a aaa a eer keep in mind the all of the action everything that occurs in every susan fitucu production ever since the first one for her nephew and continuing to this day a curs among characters created by sticking a small painted starphone ball on to a larger painted starphone bal poking in two maptacks for eyes glooming on a tiny felt beak and then impaling the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothespins that forty's cartoon figure would clamp to his nose around a chunk of limburger cheese oo o e ooa aoaaaeo oo a a pann and i could go on susan has written er she puts it translated lopwool chena pucilas diaries which detail the other adventures that happen imbetween those in the opera there sixty pages far excepts of which have appeareing clohes lines the official fan club news letter the opera love's fowl has hi strange effect on people i did not understand it until susan lon me of idiotape of one performance to be honest i thought i would be annoyed at the intentinal irony and hokiness of the popite but there i was with my three year old daughter who loved the show watching a plastic bird pantomime one of the simplest human moments but also one of the most perfound the confession of a great lave ind this case with a cock robin the song that she sings as she entures goes i am a chicken and ready for love my heart is as fragile as the egg fro which i was born cheat me cgently and will i tre you together from earthly levewy will reach for the divine and then she saings i'm a chicken and i cannot fly without love my heart my heart it as strong as the the egg from which i was born and forth and is it only with cock robin that she flies od ode ot o oo gle leooo oe o and after they have agreed to fly together and they are soaring in the air cock robin is shot killed murdered by a jellous sparrow i could not believe it but i was getting choked up specially when cock robin appeared on the stage i styrphone body spray painted black for the loment his little magic marker eyes drawn his exes i gathered my daughter my arms and held on tight as i was helplessly drawn into an expression of the grief and suffering of this little sad bird in this ear of slespecial effects therewas something unexpectedly liberating and the marriage of this crude medium painted styrefom balls bobbing up and down behind a cardboard box and the high

down with this background and at not standard of perfection are you even these perfectly dred cornishes could not achieve standard of perfection to day and even in this goofy unbird situation an hour of watching them makes clear just how hard it is to everyget birds to hit the standard which is to say not only d we can pictly downanate every aspect of the lives of chickens ther birst their feeither eggs or sauter not only have we bread them to human specificatiencs to ma human needs an we have creator a standard of what it means to be a chicken that most chickens hand never o that is with the standard neans we judge them as chickens and we find them ocking if they had the brains to understand thus they would be right to feel indignant but of course this is a city person's perspective and that means that he is completely wrong headed from the point of yeu are any ready actually raeis birds standing in the cold feed rohim i had a long long talk with george about this george is eighty years old ster mason birds seensteed hi is the calpal coolage administration an he is the whole fun of rasing birds is rasing nto thes standard well pirdsin youif your birds a lack

takes for five years to gradually get it up and by that time ther em britten baden you need new one george tells me that when he is greetin a newbach of birds who had sixty five of them and only one

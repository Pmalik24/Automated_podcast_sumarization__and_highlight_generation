a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped into day's episode of the shou if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websigt this american life dotoork from w b asy chicago it is this american life i'm shon coal sitting in for ira glass and our show today is about rules and when it might be oceed a break them when it is even right to break them about a year ago summer two thousand nineteen my friend benjamin walker was in night roby and canya working on this project with some folks from the london school of ecanomics and about four days into his trip he found himself down town idily walking past this big huge recreation area called uhuru park and boom there was the protesters how many of them werethy they three hundred thit is wha three hundred jus a mass of t all men and the thing thy were pro testing was uber here were uber drivers on strike i said two thousand nineteen you might remember at there were lot of ber strikes all over the world round this time uber had been in kenya for about four years and these drivers had the same complaint that fall owed the company wherever its gine uber makes too much off the rides they make too little they wante more of the pie and tey were mad benjamin waited into the crowd of strikers with the micropong because thass what he does he hoses of podcast her might have heard of called benjamin walkers theory of everything and this story was right up his alley he ston lots of stories about the gigg economy and it is dhis contents this one driver jefar said one thing that would get them more money his rules more rues e is jus abot egulasions no one noba do regulations nobaere regulations we neede regulatios for the gevivil be gos en y aregulatit you gon not come ofa hea make money what do you me yo stogi stats floa to yo floa to ya whatever i beyo a inves a be yoias come and tik ye and when ye have regulations you live us the a dava wakin eighteen hours a di i dogether how haw you win that is iaw you wen de dat it that was another driver there he solidarity means every one participating in the workstopige except from what benjamin saw that week there were plenty of other uber drivers still out working in fact even as they were all standing there three hundred strong protesting against ubr a a in ati a a na see that is ga her a there is a road that gos through this part of the park and tha some ki uber driver the sides go through the protest throug the crou test ye y and they know he the nuber driver howies the little uber sin in his windowe yt ye ye ye and the swarm is car ten they lekt the er o the tires that is aothe adeli ga at a at thi do a that is alwe do a us and what did the gi do a hou e seem pretty uset a he can a at there shock for whil and the stayed in his car he got out vbenshall even some of the protesters helped them ove thout of the way wat no aa ei o aaa a wu do ma hes we ot tat at we we we faighted i i we had im i di him ta yes this was one of two uber drivers that tried to drive through the middle of the protest while benjamin was there and one of the protesters said o the reason there still driving is that with all of us on strike the surge pricing kicktan she onces who kee bat ed make more money which is to say it is hard to beat uber an this game house always win but then as theyill stood around discussing ti one of the drivers told benjamin about a kind of work around they had up their sleev a cheat coat si o queston fi a the last two days i took the ubers i told you en i ye i'm herese thursday i'm not ging to take anothe uver how mi any get wha do i do to find a facte driver at the oteli is i re you even tosco carur arays day is ther we oma quati it teaaladwic cau you doa e get t ri a i you look at the estimate you swees of thup you go thes te mitste wich yo mes e boo get we lot get the comisa such as to be clear a magin you request to ride and it automatically shows you how much it is gon a cost and when the drivers shows ap you say to them how but i hit cancel on the ap and just t give you the estimate in cash cutting out the middle man that is what you gal ca o i was to say ou to a driver i wan a go care with at ta hi would thes yes yes can you go ca i de i they do a we want to wha i can you gocada you a a tha to in yesi gn you omo myi ay sir this ride i was married my ride is three hundred eighty ci want to give you four hundred and we go carura i cans i cor i can'seit yet how did it feel once you once you did that o rat on the one hand it' salve all my promis for the rest of this trip but also i almost feel i've gotn the answer to my question i wanted to know how you win and there is something about going corura which is basically using the tools against the company is it is great and it subversive one of the protesters re ferred to it as economic sabatage i e until we get more rules governing uber we are gn a breaks i asked tuber if i could talk to a company rapan canya about going carura the spokes person for all of subsaherin africa rote back saying in carried repeat canceling by either a driver or rider could be flagged by our fraud tecnology which will then result in an investigation she also said it is not safe to go off ap for the passengers or the drivers which for the record some of the drivers will tell you to that they do not to do i because having a record of the trip is safer for them course going under the rader this is not really anything that novel cab drivers in new york will sometimes say he howbuty turn off the meter an you pay me in ash but they do not have a name for it benjamin and i both wondered my carura it is the name of a forestin my ruby carura forest but none of the drivers benjamin redit could early explain it beyond that a cante mo ga we ta mamma ba ta an when i started calling around to drivers and a transport officials in my ruby this funny thing happen ara ye that is e te coit all of them giggled when i said it lik o that you want to know about that how do about that and one of the drivers said oh you can go corura yes uo y arti i ara ther caa one of them told me before uber came to town those informal taxis that you haggel with a lot of them stationed themselves around corura forest now i was a kind of catchall phrase for paying any sort of driver under the table that is the most rational explanation but there was this other explanation that came from a driver who i'm calling rodger carua yes i think i'v a clue is thirty years old as one your old son been driving since uber first came to canan he is also a graphic designer as a degree in business an i tea becaus wont in the hotel indistery he is done a lot of thing cauy the forest yon we seme desanrus that we just got fom the forest soits quot an pot jangu gengoro inme coit gangla you sang jungle law yes jengalo hesits it is something not alod and a gain something wut inday the constitition o uba something not in the laws of uber yes am genga lo you fom osef i say if uber are the authorities then corura is sort of skirting the authorities yes difinitly aseu and how does thata how does that feel when you are going aa horses using the camp you see it is a i feeling let me see that because yoavin a nexcha coin exstrac coin and di you just fe la you va for it and you don an nobodies disav to get a chat of it i can seeit au seampod in tumso e

company an gohome intanded right it is up to you at that point you have to make yes it is up to an independent decision yes but it is breaking a rule yes yes yes it is i mean i guess i wonder if that factors into the decision making of slikewell i know it is a rules should i break this rule i prispose to follow rules ind everything cosn you see a thend of the day tison get up an de say to o geti

des you fu de say that yo goin to be strikto day it to the latter that you ging toful o thel believing me o famis me tosipai it is not just empowering to break the rules sometimes sometimes it is necessary to break the rules for anyway it feels it is and to day on our show we have stories of people defying regulations violating the social contract to make a point and in one case to strike out against the inequities of a six great class please stay with us tanoooback one time bandat there is a moment this yere when i watch some one break the rules right in front of me the most dramatic way dramatic is the operative word because it was during a performance it was not just in front of me there were hundreds of people in the audience this was during an event that i go to every year if i can make at on new years day it is a ten hour long marathon of performance says i call it a marathon at the saint mark's poetry project in a two hundred year old church in lower manhattan imagine a soring caverna sanctuary with a podium on the altar up fron mostly the marathon is set up as a kind of churn there are more than a hundred fifty people on the program and it is not just poetry readings but ban's play in their coiographeris and commiteans i've seen paddy smith perform there and phillip glass and a everybody only gets two to three minutes each to read or play or whatever the time limit is a big deel as they need to fit everybody an occasionally some one gets on stagion between acts and tells everybody o keep it short an wi the sort of rules shattering moment that happened was not one of the famous is on stage i was somebody i'd never heard of jeroma is is a compos a comformeran writer is reason word jerom alas icomposer musician but he did not have an instrument with him or even anything to read off of he just real climbed up on stage stood in front of the my and i had to admat i was learly just looking down a my o man a not an tan an when he started talking the brazilian state of tmot the grosu tho su has a law mandating that selfon companies offer of fifty per cent and then he stopped talking for a while and i think it was at this point that i looked ap and saw him sort of staring wide eyed may be trembling a bit i'm playing this in real time by the way normally i'd edd it these silences down but i wanted to give you a sense of how confusing this was at first and uncomfortable fifty per cent i had no idea what was going on far he had said the brazilian state of mato groso dosul has a law mandating that selphon companies offer a fifty per cent discount to nd then you can hear he is during these kind of little breathy clicks and pops and i was o it some performance ar thing self on companies spotty coverage in brazil to the customers with fifty per cent discount to their customers with and then he breaks into portuguese which you stubious not timprsaso enoug fluacia the fal customers with braks in the timing influency of speech that is the cussomer su have speecian penments myself that is what was going on they have to the customer has to present jerome has a stutter a signed statement from a speech language a significant one speech language speech language cathologists to prove their pathology i first encounted this la in a book about strange laws from around the world the author of the book was mocking the law but i see in the law and attempt to address the issue of temporal accessibility temporal accessibility when it comes to when it comes when it comes when it comes to ti sabled speech i was first invited to participate in this magnificent event i was struck by the two minutes time limit which later became a two to three minute timemet and i understood intuitively that the purpose of this time when it was to create as non hierarchicle with space as possible but in removing one hierachy the time limites introduces another a time limit assumes thit all people have relatively equaaccess to time through this speech which is not true studdering is very unpredictable i can rehearse something as many times as i want but i do not actually know how on will take to say anything unti i have to say it what you just heard us about half of jeram's performance as he performed it that night my commentary not withstanding the clocks in it about five minutes practically twice the length permitted itself i'll play you the second half in a bid but in just those five minutes i'd gone from barely paying attention to being totally rappd everybody was the paus is continued some of them longer than what you just heard and in an enormous room packed with people there was barely any other sound i do not remember hearing a cough or paper rustle we are all just kind of spellbound partly i think because as jerum said himself what was happening on stage seemed very unpredictable that is what it felt in the audienc e and in the weeks and mon since then i realized i just had all these questions for jerom the way you wish you could call up the person who made the weird obscure movy you just saw that you cannot get out of your head or who wrote the book you just read i just wanted to know how he thought of what he did how it felt to do that jeroms chon iar ou im doing well i called him you onski o i friendly his face and had not had a hair cut an a while everybody o thing i jerum told me he got the idea after the director of the poet yyu project sent him an email inviting hom to perform and mentione the time lamet just reading that gave him this tange of stress and i was ias lke i noted the stress nos i think it i'm intersted going towards that stress an exploined that he says that confusion i felt at first that is what he was going for because it' common for people to have that feeling upon meeting him they doftkow what is going on until he tells them it is not easy to bring hundreds of people simultaneously in to an experience you live every day but he managed it i also wondered if he had kind of improvised what he was going to say but he says he wrote it all out ahead of time re hearsetet reading it off his phone while walking down the street which was way easier than reciding it on stage he says what was the shortest amount of time that it took when you were prepareng when you were rehearsing it i was sat a it' you in a half minutes soon half mines yet and i was important to him he says to write something that some one who did not stutter could recite within the time limet shen that way he was simultaneously athering to the rules and breaking them at the same time and sinces tuttering some predictable jerum says there was a chance the whole thing could have taken him only forminee and it was a funny situation were stuttering less might have made it harder for people to understand the point he was trying to make i figured simply being on stage would make him more ikely to studter but jerome'sas know it is in fact quite soothing to be on stage cosn't si it is sike i actly feel that that im that i have the time i'm an i andan into some ways the stage the stage audience lationship is a more tomporly accessible environments then othere environments of vebl vel vebl vebl e communication that i engage wits when he worked at the columbia law library just to give you some background of his life off stage jerome worked at the circulation desk and not only did he have to take in calls but he had to transfer calls to other people answering the phone that is one temporal expectation and then having to explain to some one else whose calling while the first persons on hold now he is squashed between two temporal expectations it was trestful also this show and radio in general is not usually an accessible environment for differently abled speakers a'm leaving in a lot of jerome stutters in the interview part of thi story but i'm still cutting out some of his pauses and repeats and mind for that matter as a group of professionals were by us toward more fluid talkers and became acutely aware of that while editing our conversation and just to let i tried to quotum quote clean up his answers as little as possible cause i want to bring you into jerome's daily experienced too anyway i think jerome studtered less than usual on the call with me because i know he studters he says it helps to disclose at relaxes him and then there are other subtler ways that he is able to tayment sometimes when he is talking to people sometimes arefer to it is my suder but sometimes i referred to it as these studer these studder becaus to me suddering is not bound to my body that it is a phenomenon that occurs between me and weve m seeking tyou i to think of it it is something that we share and when jerome's in a conversation with some one he studders partly cause the burden to talk smoothly is only on him exactly exactly one way a say that is he is studdere but hit is notherway that is there is a sudder happening and we are both contending with it s eexactly and his talk at the poetry project was that on a gran scale that is what he wanted for each of us to shoulder a little of the wait of the stutter that was happening the reason for those long silences on stage is something that i did not know either jerome's particular kind of studter is sometimes called a glottled lock the way he explains that when your vocal pords are at rest ther're are part and then when you go to talk they come together and vibrary but sometimes jerome's vocal quards gets stuck in the middle between being at rest and touching he can still make little silence with his teeth and tongue and lips but not his voice and stalking to him on skipe the same thing would happen as when he was on stage when the glottle block came he got this look kind of frozen wide eyed stare he was stunned except on stage it was more dramatic his face would turn upward and remember thinking myself is that just effort is it fear ye and ia nother look yer ou'se steaking about ya it is lik some sdters woo there their body will willi't fact move alout whil the studding there face wooe we will move a certain ways which which ich idu sometimes but in general my my body responses actsyt is a freezing i an am i and i saw breathing often too just if yus everything stops for a second or five second longer im part of it is that is that in freezing part of it feels my body goes into a kind of supplication or prayer almost im i've a friend who who once referred to it as watching watching me ask for the word and wait and ait fr it to come waik for to come ye and embianic as i often look up it is a very specific state is a this there is some ways in which i wotally leave the room and i i thing that speaks to the the looking upward and i then just a a'll come back once the word arrives and it was not fear he says he does have a lot of fers in his daily life thinking too much of some one's time not being able to order a shake shack when there is a line behind him but this was not that if he was afraid of anything e was falling back on the tactics he usually uses to get around to stutter synonyms for example swapping out a word he is blocked on for one that is easier to say he wanted do that on thestage and iim im ni dinrulis that until now that i think that was the primary and i did do that two or three times and i regretted it afterwards im do you remember which words you did id on by any cham yes tru the customers with there is the portugues word with i he stubi which ou scubiou my pimpreso which i had literally translated to in my text i translated it translated it translated it translated it translated it translatsit tos tru disturbance and as as you just saw that word is still as is very hard for me to say that i did it the performance was customers with i said breaks breaks breaks in the time and influence in the timeing influency of speech and that was one that i i did not that i did that i what i wanted to do was what i i jut sit with wit with you is just wait wait for the wate but i but it was especially especially dees het can be really painful i well i as mi avoided that one and as freshy as myself a sus at happen i breaks to me to does not capture what i wanted to capture are names particularly difficult yes ye yes because as a syndoms for them jeron blocks on his own name haw since he was four years old when has stutter started now trying to say his name or any name he says it is hes for again i even i even in some situations for a few years i would say im john tons my middle name but very interestingly i an begins setting on john and then i and then i was suc saint shohn and because some sometimes the shur sound as e the just sound as i has a harder attack and also it obviously shon is just in and inan incredibly beautiful name and ti was bealy i me now as my dol as my main reasoning for josis i well if i'm n it i man to choose the new name while i just goti to the top just go for the top ans oyuno and thas i setthing on that i mean i just find that that is beautiful its lke it is always out pasing me in in a way you find that beautiful that it is out pacing you ye ye i man i find it painful to but i but a i find it a deep deauty in that i what is the beauty bet for me it is the quality that it is the sudder it feels the shing that it is deeply and twime with my body my mind my emotions everything and yet i i cannot figure it out or i cannot grasp it and and and even more when i think i have grasped it lie when i think atbout smart it it even my switching my name im the something about jus i we losive it is the second half of jerome's performance was just one sentence it took im four minutes and nine seconds to get through partly because it had a name at the beganning the black friminis the sentence began the black feminist scholar kimberly crenshaw onces road and then a quote climbing on top of crenchaw's name alone took him about a minute forty five seconds i have not paused the recordig of the performance by the way it is still running underneath thus my chest was heading much sit and whilas doing os cotch i just give up and leave and iwas kno i mean i i've done that somebody a me te many moments and in life where iver i just i just stop speaking that is to one to put in in the labor of finishing my thought or finishing my my sentence sounds kno i do not want to do that here i wanted to show the audience the labour that is of all and this is labor that i often or sometimes will not put in the black frimino scholar but it was around this moment that the feeling in the room started to change again there was no more confusion obviously and than he concern or tension was gone too black frim i scholar by this point the importance of what jerome was saying had landed on us and the marriage between the thing he was saying and the way he was saying at a poem alongated it just took us a little longer to catch up pimberly crenshaw wonce rote i gent stopped the recording for a second in just read you the quote you can sit with it during this last part it goes treating different things the same can generate as much an an equality as treating the same things different ly did you feel kind of ponk rock to be doing that or bad i asked to be ye i mean i i felt i it was an act of resistance and and i'm m as a musician my the first music i study be the deeply was jas and i remember very distinctly when i was middle school that i would be i would have my my jacities at home and oftenthey would be for r tracks because hec track would be nine minutes long and that i member lookin my frenciies of a punkrock for exemple as you mention ind much shorter tracks i member i member it noticing that that agent thinking about what that meant and they would be just refusal to at here tooe the length of a posong for examble you knw an for meter is always a racialize element there too that that there is a black resistance against certain structures of time that now this track is eleven minutes long and i gif you do not do not listen to it than to listen to a belike i'm we are our but what ting to achieve in this music is different in some ways then than whats a three minutes song the strange onch treating treating treating treating treating wtreating treating treating want as a black priston i'm also thinking abouts the way thats time an access to time is racily insect there are there many moments in the world when ha treatig a prison of color is just not given as much time to speak treating a different things the same way may generate as much intequality as treating the same things in different ways you h to learn more about rome alise and his many projects visit jerome eles got cam that is j e r o m e e l l i s got con you can also follow him on instogram in at elisteroum coming out a story that perfectly incalculates what my father always called the golden rule them that is got the gold makes rules s joke as in one

kipped from his bulshi cand tone movdit but then one day a few weeks in to thi coer this thing hopin that changed how ton thought about the jefferson bk sistom and he could not get ed out of his head he was sitting with tem p when he noticed something i may i remember him havin that plassic pencil case that you kow you just see no pencils protractor do coll it you n a ruler an ols had all that you needd he in he was he had much money he is much money what that bag was use fo turned into a whileit i man it was jus whats of jefferson books i remember him taking that o in itwas almost ak a seek et to seting when e by thes but lie you notthrough mak up a dollars and i saw i' how you have that much money that it bloo mo mi and then hearing amy to letter dow to day i'm you made o leven dollars to day to day it an't even two ofclock yet you got more time town in been morking his osof for weeks and only had wit six box whic ers a tiny fraction of what an p hous tone was earning him in my wage and an p was jeff fasos he had they really said with that before he unterstood how this could ben and pe had miss jefferson for home room and fo mat which men pretty saw her for times throughout the mam tone only saw her once for mat of course an e had man more jefferson i ron resee in lie and ad being envious and bein jealous and wondering how i do that and just let me which my energy et i'l study more i'll be politer i will not talk is class an much tone tried all sorts of strategies to make money but now that he saw the faw on the system he could not on see it everything was remind her how much more opportunity the kids in her home room had it was almost the a on for coats sand shed and it and driv a catalags it lmost it made him dress better it was they were in in the capital and we were district twelve we are just poor people try to make it and they ar the ilat and and did that make you mad ow i maybe sofo ca an made me ma is cause you do not know to rules and you no suppose to work but then it does not work but you see work for others to tone having money also meant something really important to him im pressing girls there was one girl in particular ye had a huge croshon we will call her in natasha she did not even know tone existed but he thought about her all the time and the tasshe her name was on the back of my note book in stuff she was active an just long here rounse can just beautiful and her maturity level was was up thee o mer hair was always dos shwas wi cool clothes an she just had the attention and you saw to dos whoild get her attention and ok man to be aus which yo thay just they had money the had jeffson books and what boys by girls things with the jefferson bown yet yet we go tat trickin off yes o yo yet aw you definitely tone is twelve trying to figur out the whole cirlthing for the first time and desperate to impress them luckily here were other ways to make money besides miss jefferson's clas and way more ways to spend it one of tone's class mades explained to me that because miss jefferson's store was only open on friday the kids came up with an underground economy of their own a black market fueled by jefferson boxs that was open every day of the week you could buy anything there if somebody had jello in aa chocolate or their desert wel i hay maggy three books for to haf o you slice of peace on friday i may somebody migh say you a pencil half price when miss jefferson ill sel im ias jeffson might o mis send sellon the pencil a graphic pencil for two dolas and you might be begetter for wonber and now i mit is it became in a legal tender basically throughout six great the kids sid a lot of shady things all under the table la ids o miss jefferson's class would pay kids to miss jellrds ten to twenty jefferson books to do their home work that is how the block market worked if you had money if you did not you got a forgot how o leverge but they need that you can get something at your natgetin which is the jefferson book i may never moments way i remember if you not payin a tenter to your books you might have a tex book stolen and you gon ne five jeffson books to get your book back her by december the lobsideed nits to miss jefferson's system was clear to everyone an missteller's home ram they complained to each other about it it is this shis rade thit something is in n and i do not and remember who was but i remember a lot of us bein lik yew what do we need to do did you ever say that to her yet we brought it up o how to how do we do more of your not seein it i'm try my bessin as i may man now we got it we got have a town all the kid brought it up one day in mouth class and several others in cluding tone immediately jumped on board i was not able to find miss jefferson to get her sidt of this but the way tone remembers it miss jeffersons jut this discussion down if they wantom ore money she said they needed to try harder period and of discussion is ti gat man everybody the same opportunity and is no they do not wull you got a work harder an you got a troharder and then after i'm i'm say once of doing that nothing still nothing and i just had this moment weros i i i got er i got a round the jefferson bank i there is no other way again tone was a rul follower his jod was really strect this mos wildly out of character but is bir told bracksad in a very different contact whois the graighter criminal the man who robs the bank wy the man who founds one tone figure if she can make believe a bank then he coold rob that ma croli bank without any consequenci and and then saur cottages imay i guess i ouns cotostarted case in the miss jefferson's actions and i knew we left a window open and knew we had at this foin we had a right before lunch i i knew where she kept on where the store was

panishmen the worrst possible out come they call is da in tones mine tis ins his last day on earth he gets home gon straight to the frenge gets a boll of ice cream and hads to his rim to watch poring he figures the might as will go il with a bang he is refilling his ball when he notice that something there is tha chair in the middle of the kitchen he is did walks ten jestursh to the chair and says i non non on now no what time it is and i'm fuk yhou know i got a bend over the back of a chair and i'm just takin it and im ma am just breakin down and then and them mo father dislike he stops im cryin everything and then he goes i do not and i look back am a father a takes a poleroid o me crime with the fate i may is pans ron my angles es just i mean faceis o an me took a poleroid and what was the expression on your face the expression pain an defeet tone never got anothers panking he never went roke again an part of that has to do with the pole roid and he time he started acting up his dat would remind him of that photo and tone wit course correct an it i my it was that lolen it was i ming that fotal made me break down tone was ashamed he felt that for robbing the bank that the thing is it actually got a mon he wanted not he expected he did not get jefferson bout is but he got justess miss jefferson changed the rolls no matter how many times a day you sire heu can only earn money during the hour of math class it became a level playing field i flike at do reme people cannot bein disappointed there was peopl in mis jeffer's class ever pist i'm sure but everybody was not mis jeffer's class was yell about time yet but it is intersting ro way our saying rayt now is just the kids in miss jefferson's class are going to be pissed to you because they do not have the privilege they used to have rit but they also i h've no concept of how you have been feeling all school year he not n likein that is exactly you do not know it is differen for me whomin er class you gt take a class en at the same no i know it should be but is tat that is a matter me willn't i has to do i felt a fair for tone this was always just a funny story he told about his dads awkward poleroid but he started talking to me about it a few weeks ago during the height of the recent protest and that made him think about the story differently there is a parallel that i that i've never notice or or look for i guess between how communityes reactlen they do not fee their being treat i fairly will it is it is what it makes me think of his a jesus always talked in prables wrut and i feel your jefferson bucks story is such a perfect parable i te i agree when the rules are the same for every blon an some people throb in some people do not but every one's following them why is not not y why is not not far and in even know if it is can be answer most of the time but the question has to be ask if this is a parable almost everything lines the systematic in equality the unfareness how sometimes you have to break the rules in order for them to change i see what i'm to learn from everyone but the one thing ninther isca figure out is whater we spose to learn from natasha tone

welcome to the huberman aconcans as science science taye tone frli i made douhuberman and our a professor of naurobiology and opthemology at stanford school of medicon to day marchs the second episode in our journal club series with myselfh and doctor peter atea doctor peter atea as many of is a medical doctor who is a world expert in all things health span and life span he is the author of the best selling book outlive as well as the host of his own terrific podcast the drive for to day's episode peter and i each select a different paper to share with you we select tod these papers because we feel they are both extremely interesting and extremely actionable first i present a paper that is about how light exposure during the morning and daytime as well as dark exposure at night each have independent and positive effects on mental health as well as the ability to reduce the symptems of many different mental health disorders i have talked before on this podcast and elsewhere about the key importance of seeing morning sunlight as well as trying to be in dim light at night however the data presented in the paper to day really expands on that by identifying the key importance of noncious morning sunlight but getting bright light in one's eyes as much as is safely possible throughout the entire day and a separate addative effect of being in as much darkness at night as possible i describe the data in a lot of detail although you do not need a background in biology in order to understand that discussion and there is a key take away which is that if you cannot get enough light in your eyes during the daytime you would be well advised to get as much darkness exposure at night in other words light and dark have independent and addative effects on mental health and during to day's discussion you will learn exactly how to apply light exposure and dark exposure in order to get those benefits then peter presents a paper about novel treatments for cancer i must say it is an extremely important conversation that everybody regardless of weather or not you may have had cancer er no somebody was had cancer ought to listen to he highlights the current technology of cancer treatments as well as the future technology of cancer treatments and the key roll that the immune system and the automomune system play in treatments for cancer i assure you that by the end of today's journal club episode you will have learned a ton of new information about light and dark and mental health as well as cancer and the immune system and treatments for curing cancer before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is eight sleep eight sleep makes smart mattress c overs with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity now spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a kee component of getting a great night sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to progrin the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed in energist i've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for almost three years now and it has drammatically improve the quality of my sleep much that when i travel an i mat a hotel or an arabean being i do not have access to my eight sleep i very much look for to getting home because my sleep is always better when i sleep on my eight sleep mattress cover if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep doc calm slash hubermen to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ssa candida ou k select countries in the eu and australia again that is eight sleep doc calm slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by better help better help offers professional therapy with a license thrapis carried out on line i've been going to therapy for well over thirty years initially i did not ave a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon i realize that therapy is extremely valuable in fact i consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise incling cardevascular exercise in resistance training which of course i also do every week the reason i know thrapy is valuable is that if you confined a therapists with whom you can develop a really good report you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can dirive tremendous insights from that therapy insites that can allow you to better not just your emotional life in your relationship life but of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact i see therapy is one of the kee components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focuss and attention toward what really matters if you would to try better help go to better help dot clm slash hubermen to get ten per cent off your first month again that is better help dot calm slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by jew juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices now there is one thing i've consistently emphasize on this podcast is the incredible roll that light can have on our biology of course i'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible forsake of setting circaning rhythm daytime moodfocus an alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and near in pred light has been shown to have possive effects on im proving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health including faster muscle recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acney or that is removal of acney reducing pain and inflammation improving myt a condral function and even improving vision itself what' tats juve apart and why it is my preferred red light therape device is that it has clinically provin wavelings meaning it uses specific wave lengths of red light and ner im fred incombination that trigger the optimal cellar adaptations personally i use the hand hel juve every day the hanhel juvis about the size of a thick piece of toast and i also own a juve panel that allows for full body exposure and i use that one approximately five times per week for about ten to fifteen minutes percession if you would to try juve you can go to juve spelled j o o v v daccom slash huberman again that is juve daccom slash huberman for this month only january twenty twenty four juvis offering exclusive discounts to huberman lablisteners with up to five hundred dollars off select juve products again that is ju spell j o o v v daccom slash huberman to get up to five hundred dollars off select jue products and now for my discussion with doctor peter atia andr great to have you here for journal club number to i'm already confident this is going to become regular for us i'm excited i really enjoy this because i get to pick papers i'm really excited about i get to heare papers that your exsiht about and we get to on sharpen our skills at reading and sharing data and people listening can do that as welth last time i went first i think i'm on a put you on the hot seat first and have have you go first than i'll follow you o k ell i'm really excited about this paper for a number of reasons first of all it at least by my read is a very powerful paper in the sense that it examined light exposure behavior as well as dark exposure behavior and that is going o be an important point in more than eighty five thousand people is part of this cohort in the u k i'll just mention a couple of things to give people background and i'll keep this relatively brief first of all there is a long standing interest in the relationship between light and mental health and physical health and we can throw up some very well agreed upon bullet points ferst of all there is such a thing as seasonal effective disorder it does not just impact people living at really northern locations but basically there is correlation between daylength and mood in mental health such that for many people not all but for many people when days are longer in the spring in summer they feel better they report fewer depressive symptoms and conversely whendays are shorter significantly more people report feeling lower mood in affect o k there is a long standing treatment for seasonal effective disorder which is to give people exposure to very bright light especially in the morning the way that that is normally accomplished is with these sad lamps seasonal effective disorder lamps and those lamps are basically bright meaning more than ten thousand lucks lights that they place on their kitchen counter or t there table in the morning or in their office they gtting a lot of bright light that is proving to be fairly effective for the treatment of seasonal effective disorder what is less understood is how light exposure in the middle of the night can negatively impact mood and health and where were we are headed with this is that there seems to be based on the conclusions of this new study a powerful an independent role of both daytime light exposure and night time dark exposure for mental health ow couple of other key points the biological mechanisms for all this are really well established there is a set of cells in the nurretina tolines the back your eye theire sometimes called intrinsically photo sensitive retinall ganglian cells are sometimes called melinopson retnal ganglin cells well talk about those in the bit of detail in a moment it is well known that those cells are the ones that respond to two different types of light in put not one but two different types of leghtin put and send information to the hypothalmas where your master circatean clock resides and then your master circatean clock sends out secretory signals peptides formones but also noral signals to the brain andbodi ant say hate now it is daytime now it is night time be awake be asleep but it goes away beyond that these melanopsan intrinsically photo sensitive retinall ganglin sells we know also project areas of the brain the habenula which contrigert negative affect negative mood they can trigger the release of dopomine or the suppression of dopomin the release of ceratone in the suppression of doof seretonen and the're not just cells for setting your circatean clock they also have a direct line lateraly one sinnaps away into the structures of the brain that we know powerfully control mood the mechanistic basis for all this is there there is just a couple of other keypoints to understand for people to really be able to digests the daye on this paper fully thereare basically two types of stimule that these cells respond to one is very bright light as we distalked about that is why getting a lot of daytime sunlight it is correlated with elevated mood that is why looking at a ten thousand lucks art ifficial lamp can offset seasonal effective disorder by the war district couple questions on that a how many lucks does the sun provide on a sunny day at noon of ket great question if you are out in the sun with no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover in the middle of the day at noon chances are it is over a hundred thousand lucks on a really bright day could be three hundred thousand lucks oqe most indoor environments even though they might seem very bright i think of your you are kind of of department store with the bright lights believe they are not that is probably only closer to six thousand lucks maximum and probably more four thousand lucks most brightly lit indoor environments are not that bright when it comes down to total photon energy now here is the interesting thing on a cloudy day when you are outside it can be as bright as or an average of a hundred thousand lucks but it will not seem that bright because you do not quotin quote see the sun but it is also because when there is cloud cover a lot of those long wavelength of light such as orange and red light are not coming through however and this is important the circatean clock the supercasmatic nuclius it sums photonts it is a photon summing system basically if you are outside in eight thousand lucks very overcasts you k winter day and you are walking around hopefully without sun lasses because sunglasses are gon to philter lot of those photons out you are circating clock is summing the photons it is an integration mechanism it is not triggered in a moment and actually that the experiments of recording from the cells first done by david burstan at brown were you do not historic in the field of visual norro science when shon broke bright light on these intrinsically phota sensive cells get crank up the intensiy the light and that nu'rons would ramp up there membrane potential and then start spiking firing action becounts or long trains of action potentials that have been shown to go on for hours and that is the signal that is a propagating into the whole brain and body ces the the importanting understand is this is not a quickswitch that is why i suggest on non cloudy days will call them that people get ten minutes or of sunlight in their eyes in the early part of the day another ten minimum in the later part of the day as much sunlight in their eyes as they safely can throughout the day but since you are physician i should just im and you had a guest on talkingabout this recently when the sun is low in the sky losolar angle sunlight tht's really the key time for reasons will talk about in a moment and when the sun is low in the sky you run very very little risk of inducing cataract by looking the general direction of the sun you should still blink as needed to protect the eyes it is when the sun is overhead and there is all those photons coming in quickly in ont in a short period of time that you do have to be concerned about cataract and a macular degeneration if you aregetting too much daytime of sunlight the ideas sun glasses in the middle the day are fine but you really should avoid using them in the early and later part of te day unless you are driving into the sn and needian for safety reasons whanother question ender ye if if the person is indoors but they have large windows there is theyre getting tons of sunlight into their space there do not even need ambient indoor light how much the photons are making it through the glass and how does that compare to this effect yin general unless the light is coming directly through the window most of the relevant wavelints are filtered out and othe wards if you cannot see the sun through the window even if sufficient light is being provided that is insufficient to trigger this phenomena that is right however if you have a windows on your roof which some people do skylights that makes the situation much much better in fact the nurons that in the eye that signal to the circadian clock and these mood centers in the brain reside mainly in the bottom two thirds of the naurl retina and are responsible for looking up basically they are gathering light from above these cells are also very low resolution think of them as big picteles they are not interested in patterns and edges and movement they are interested in how much ambient light there happens to be now keep in mind that this mechanism is perhaps the most well conserve mechanism in cellar organisms there and i'll use as a way to frame up the four types of light that one needs to see every twenty four hours for optimal health and and when i say optonhealth i really mean mental health and physical health but organ tock about mental health mainly to day in this paper there is an absolutely beautiful evolutionary story whereby single cell organisms all the way to humans dogs rabbits and everything in between have at least two conopsins one that responds to short wavelength light a c blue light and another one that respons o longer wavelint light orange and red your dogs have this we have this and it is a comparison mechanism in these cells of the eye these narons of the eye they compare contrast between blues and orange or sometimes blues and reds and pinks which are also all longwavelak light there are two times of day when the sky is enriched with blues oranges pinks and reds and that is lo solarangl sunlight at sunrise and in the evening these cells are uniquely available to trigger the existence of those wavelings of light early in the day and in the evening not in the middle of the day these cells have these two conephota pigments and they say how much blue light is there how much red light is there or orange light and the subtraction between those two triggers the signal for them to fire the signal off to the a circating clock to the brain and that is why i say look at lowsolar angle sunlight early in the day what that does is it what call its fase advances the clock this can get a little technical and we do not wat to get two technical here abut think about pushing your kid on a swing the period of that swing the duration of that swing is a little bit longer than twelve hours mke when you stand closer to the kidsos you'r ket swings back and you give it an a push you'r shortening the period right not allowing the swing to come all the way up that is what happens when you look at morning sunlight you are advancing your circadean clock translate to english or non nerd speak you are making at such that you will want to go to bed a little b earlier and wake up a little bit earlier the next day in the evening when you view losolerange sunlight son the after the afternoon setting sun or evening setting sun you do the exact opposite your pase the laying in the clock it is the equivalent of your cid being at the very top of the of the ark and it is gone ukno may be twelve anda half hour the twelvan less ay twelve and a half hours is the duration of that swing and you run up and you push them from behind and give them a little more push that is the equivalent of making yourself stay up a little later and wake up a little later these two signals average that your clock stays stable you do not drift meaning you'r not waking up earlier every single day or going to sleep later every single day this is why it is important to vyou loso angle sunlight in the morning and again in the evening as often as possible and it is done by that read out of those twophotopigments now midday sun which contains it is bright light but you seed as white light contains all of those wavelints that equal intensity the middle of the day is the called circadean dead zone in the middle of the day bright light triggers the activation of the of the other ops in the melonopson which increases mood increases feelings a well being has some other consequences but you cannot shift your circadean clock by viewing the sun in the middle of the day because it is in the circadean deadzone it is the equivalent of pushing your kid on the swing when they are at the bottom of the ark you can get a little bit more but not muc and in biological terms you get nothing this is why looking at sunlight the mill the day as great but it is not can help anchor your sleep wakecycle and if you think about this is incredible right every organism from single cells to us has this mechanism to know when the sun is rising in t when the sun is setting and it is a color comparison mechanism which tells us that actually color vision involved first not for pattern vision not for seeing beautiful sunsets and recognizing that is beautiful or paintings or things of that sort but rather for setting the circadean clock ow what if you only do one of these enders or what if you have got constan exposure to low morning light but your job prevents you from doing the same in the evening or vice versa ye a great question better to get the morning light because if if you have to pick between losolar angle light earlier later in the day and keep him mind if you miss a day no big deal it is a slow into grat of mechanism averaging across the previous two or three day s but if you miss a day you want to get twice as much light in your eyes that next morning thee reason it is better to do in the morning as opposed to the evening although both would be to do ha best would be to do both scuse me is that most people are getting some artificial light exposure in the evening anyway and here is the diabolical thing youre retina is very insensitive to light early in the day you need a lot of photants to trigger this mechanism early in the day as the day goes on retinal sensitivity increases and it takes very little light to shift your circadian clock late in the day keep in mind also that if you do see afternoon and evening sunlight as a beautiful study published in sign sience reports yes science reports two years ago showing that that can partially offset the negative effects of artificial light exposure at night i think of this as your net flics an oculation the mount of melatone and suppression from night time light exposure is haved by viewing evening setting sun now keep in mind you do not need to see the sun cross the horizond it can just be when it is low solar angle seyou lookin for those yellow blue or blue pink blue red contrast and on cloudy days believe tiere not they are still there just you do not perceive as much of it coming through there really that is three things that we should all strive to do viou losolorangl sunlight early in the day teusularangel sunlight later in the day and get as much bright light in our eyes as we safely can i deally from sunlight throughout the day and if you cannot do that it perhaps invest in one of these a sad light that they can be a bit expensive on theyre couple company's their staring to design sunrise simulators and evening simulators their actually good that actually work am but right now my read is that a side from one company out there which by the way i've no relationship to it is called the twoo light to u o and that light bulb was developed by the biologist of the universy washington who basely discovered these color opponent mechanisms a those lights are not particularly expensive but the're am they do seem to work in fact they theyr the study that is emerging gain unpublished ata seems to indicate that if you look at it for more than five or six minutes it can induce amild uforia that is how powerful this contrast is and what they did there in that light i'll just tell you the mechanism is they figured out that when most people look at low solarangl sunligh in the morning they are getting nineteen reversals of blue orange per second when you look at the light it looks a a barely flashing a white light but it is reversals of orange and blue orange and am and you't a red and blue and it is happens or which is that what as the person looking aut it perceive a well i've used one of these a you just looks a a flickering light and of course his thet always the potential a plicibo effect but wotzot tose is there a way to control for that by having something hat looks the same to the user uut of course is not producing the same photo effect yet they have done tha at with the ten thousand luck sad lamps and you and which most people used to trying induce sunrise simulation in their home but keep in ro in mine that sunrise is gives you this comparison of short and long wave length light just a bright ten thousand lucks light triggers one of the obsens that that but it will not set your circadian clock most of the sad lamps that are out there are activating only one of the mechanisms in these cells that is relevant and not the one that is most relevant some excited about what tuo is doing i think that a and again i have no relation to them except tat i know the biologist who did the work that that provide the mechanistic logic for the that engineering i still think am were in the th really early days of the stuff what should be done is to have the stuff built into your lap top it should be built in here phone and hopefully it will be now i mention this color contrast thing in sunrise in sunset i mention the bright light throughout the day but there is a fourth light stimulus that turns out to be really important and this illprovide the seguay into the paper turns out that dark exposure at night independent of light exposure during the day is important for mental healthop comes now most people think dark exposure how i think about that well it is dart up yabsence of ligfe it is the absence of light but what this paper really drives home is that people who make it a point to get dark exposure at night ach a the absence of light at night actually benefit even if they'are not getting en a sunlight during the day and this is especially true for people with certain mental health issues i do not think we can over state the value of persof accurately timed light exposure to the eyes in the context of mental health i think h there is much data by now i will say however that some people seem more resilient to these light effects than others meaning some people also do not suffer from jet lag too much some people can stay up late get lot of bright light exposure mill the night and during the day there got their sun lasses on all day and there in a great mood all the time other people are more susceptible these sorts of things and we do not know whether not ju at pollymorphisms under lie that i personally in very sensitive to sunlight in the sense that if i do not get enough sunlight i do not feel well after a couple of days am but i'm less sensitive to light exposure at night for instance but i think it is perhaps is a big statement but is perhaps the most fundamental invironmental stimulus for levels of arousal an alertness which correlate with all sorts of nermagelater in hormone outputs and am it none of the should come as any surprise i wil'l mention one last thing there was a study publishd gosh over ten years ago now from chucks isers labit harvard medical school is phenomenal lab exploring circadian human health behavior he is just considered a no pon illuminary in the field bu et there was an a study that was in error where they hat publishion science magazine that light shone behind the knee could shift cir cady an rhythms and that paper was retracted a and allot of people do not know that it was rechacted light exposure to the eyes is what is relevant here as far as we know the color of one's eyes the darkness or lightness of one's eyes bears no relevants on their sensitivity to these types of mechanisms and on andon one question one comment the question again is going back to the morning evening light and i spend a lot of time looking at those types of skies for example just cause of the nature my hobbies great right cause i'm always doing archery in the morning and rucking in the afternoon it is not uncommon that i'm seeing both of those how relevant is it that the sun be above the horison for example a it begins to get light about and thirty minutes before sunrise and then right i's sunrises at seven thirty first light is seven and then sort of seven fifteen to seven a thirty is ectually quite bright i mean you can see anything and everything and the same is true at sunset does does that thirty minutes pree or when sun is beneath the horizon constitute part of that ten minutes it does i mean in an ideal circumstance you would get outside and see the sunrise every day and you would see the sunset every day even on cloudy days some people myself wake up before the sun comes up in which an i get this question all the time well in the absence of powers to make the sunrise faster which i'm not awhere any one has certainly not me i think the best thing to do is simply to turn on as many bright lights as you can in doors to trigger that melonopsin mechanism if you want to be awake if you want to stay a sleep or sleepy than keep them dim and then get outside once the sun is starting to come out somepeople wake up after the sun has rison right in which case get what you can and some people wake up ten na m or noon in which case you can still get the bright light exposure but you will not shift your sir caty in clock now in the evening especially in the winter months it is important to look west and try and get some sunlight in your ise in the evening if you have ever gone into the clinic for instance at two ofclock in the afternoon after lunch and then in the winter and then come out in it is dark when you are walk into your car it is a kind of earie feeling that sort of eirie feeling may carrelate with the fact that you missed a signal your your brain is trying a orient your brain an body in time nd that is what e all this iss right shynot orient in time and again some people are more susceptible to that than other some people might that a feeling of oh i went in when it was brighten i come out when it is dark but the vast majority of people feel better when they are getting this morning in evening sunlight exposure and this is a specially important in kids why this is one of the things that this paper points out in their good data that people are spending approximately ninety per sen of their time indoors nowadays daytime time indoors and those indoor environments are simply not bright enough you think al there is all these bright lights and some people are putting blue blockers on in the mill the day which is the worse thing you could possibly do if you aregen a whare blue blockers and i t do not think they are necessary but if you are going to wear them you' ont it wear them at night and in the evening you do not need to wear blue blockers you just simply should dim the lights and ideally have lights that ar set a a bit lower in your environment which the scandinavians have been doing for a long time you'nl kill the overhead lights and do not obsess about bright light exposure in the mildle the night in fact for a long time i and some other people were saying oh even just a brief flash of light in mill the night can you quasher mell atone ant that is true but the other time in which you are in this quoting what circatian deadzone is in the middle of the night you cannot shift your circatan clock in the middle the night but all of this gets down to into weaving rhythms of light sensitivity temperature hormone out put quarters all it an an there is a whole landscape of circatean biology this paper am which has published in a new journal i'm really excited about called nature mental health this journal was just launched recently a is entitled day and night light exposure are associated with psychatric disorders and objective light studyin more than eighty five thousand people now have to say that i think the title of this paper is terrible sorry folk sat nature mental health because if one just read the title it sounds day and night light exposurere as sociated with psychiatric disorders if this were if this or newspaper a headling yon o my go its well what you sposed to do right but that is not the conclusion the conclusion is that getting a lot of sunlight exposure during the day and getting a lot of dark exposure at night is immensely beneficial for psychiatric health and in a number of ways now i'm not one to bring up a another paper unannounce but i will say that this paper built off a previous study entitled time spent in outdoor light is associated with mood sleep and circatean rhythm related outcomes and that was a cross sectional launchitunal study in four hundred thousand biobank participants this you cay bio bank is an incredibly valuable resource and there now multiple studies istablishing that one's pattern of light exposure is extremely important now the previous study and four hundred thousand participants basically nailed home the idea that the more time you spend outdoors the better your is your mood the better is your sleep the better is the rhythmicity of your sleep wake cycls and on and on something that i think even though people say we have known that for thousands of years needed scientific substantiation this new study essentially looked at the relative contributions of daytime light exposure and night time dark exposure and they did that on a background of looking in particular peopl w had measured pressive disorder generalized anxiety p t st by pollar disorder he ho re's the the basic take away and i'll i'll quote them here and then i'll i'll tell you my interpretation that here i'm quoting avoiding night at light and seeking light during the day and love that werd seeking maybe a simple and effective non pharmicalogic means for broadly improving mental health suts a pretty bold statement right and i love that they say seeking because it implies that people are not reflectsively getting that light exposure that they need that this it needs to be a practice much s own too cardio or resistance training o kess whatso what dod they do in the study basically they gathered up a hundred thousand people or it eventually was pared down to bout eighty six thousand participants cause some just did not qualifior didnt report their day to back they equippe them with excelerometers on their rist and those rist device is also could measure anbient light now that is not a perfect tool cas what you would love to do as measure anbient light at the level the eyes by the way well somebody design and eye lass frame that changes color when you have got in sufficient light from sunlight during the day and then and then at night is a different color and then four getting too much light exposure will go to a different color frame this has to be possible tha you do not have to wonder if you got enough light during the day and of course if it is at the level of the eyes than that is what is landing at the eyes yen it is leta ressos can ask you about that to these risk based deviceis potentually get covered by clothing and tur o tey have your sleeves dai have my sleeves ar they had it on the outside the slee but they askd that people just keep it on their dominant hand it is not perfect but in some ways it is kind of nice that it it is not perfect we could turn that disadvantage into a dvantage by thinking when the person is out and about the're not often looking right at the sun you now you'r talking to a colly under an overhang for instance it is it is not trtrectionaly it is directionally right o k and then they had two hypotheses two primary hypothes one that greater light exposurein the day is associate with lower risk for psychiatric disorders and too second hypotheses greater light exposure at night is associated with higher risk for psychiatric disorders an poorer mood this is oso relevant for the way we live now people on screens and tablets and mill the night o k then they collected information about how much light exposure people were getting as well as their sleep and their activity and on i should mention this was done in males and females it was a slightly older cohort than one is used to seeing people in their fifties and sixties they had psycheatric dignose's information and then they divided people into esencially two groups but they had a lower a cu one in acu to a lower cortile that meant people that were getting less daytime light as opposed to the third and fourth cortile more daytime light they also had a night time light exposure e valuation and they had people were when the low cu on an cuto these people are getting less night time light verses cuthree cu for more night time light nicely they also looked at sleep duration and they looked at photo period meaning how long the days were for those individuals how active they were lok ten hours a day fourteen hours i day because the more active you are the more opportunity for light exposure you have during the day or night for instance ok it they had i would say fairly complete data sets then and i'm just going to can hit the top contour f what they did in and sore a sleep duration sleep efficiency et cetera at was determined off the celerometer that is right as well as self report ye not not ideal right you would leved for people to be wearing a whop bander or or a rain or something of that sort but this was initiated some time ago they either did not have access to that technology or for whatever reason did not select it i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one a g one is a vitemin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptigions i started taking a g one way back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it and the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all f my quotas for vitemens and minerals and it insures that i get enough prebotic and probiotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mune system and for the production of nauro transmitters and aeuromodulators things dopamin and ceratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are number of things in a g one including specific micronutrians that are hard to get from whole foods or at least in sufficient quantities g one allows me to get the vitemens and minerals that i need probiotics prebotics the adaptigens and critical micronutriants any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a g one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot cm slash hubermen and you will get a year supply a vitemen d three k two and five free travel packs of ag one again that is drink a g one dot cam slash hubermen then what they did is they got they have information on who has major depressive disorder who has pt st generalized anxiety by polar pcychosis et cetera and then they ran three models and you can tell me what you think about the power of these models but somebody who thinks about the mechanistic aspect of all this a lot but not somebody who is ever run this type of study i'd be really curious model one examined the unadjusted association between day and night time light exposure and pcychiatric outcomes just basely asking is there relationship between how much light you get it during the day and how much light you get at night and how bad your or your depression is ore anxieteas et cetera looking at just a standard ratio of the probability that you have a certain symptom or sed of symptoms verses you do not given a certain amount of light exposure model to adjusted for the age of the person their sex an ethnicity and photo period they looked at you kow how long the days were in that given persons region of the world and then model three all these people were all in the you car where they were they were all in the as far as i know and the model three adjusted for employment employed verses unemployed which you think about is pretty emportant you say well nonemployed person has lot more time to control these variables but in employed person who is doing shift work does not right and they they incorporated information about employed verses unemployed physical activity which turns out to be very important and then things shift work et cetera and these wtwwe can say very safely is that the outcomes with each of these models the results were very similar we do not want to discard the difference is between those models entirely but in my read is in every figure of the paper it does not seem model one two or three differ from one another in terms of total income ye that is an unusual aspect of this paper these adjustments are very standard right that is this is a aa classic a tool that fused in most epidemiology ibecause you do not have orantimization once oranomization is out the window yulike soforexemple the paper i'm goin to present is based on in ar c t there will be no models it is just here the date yet hear they are asking people what what you do report back to us worg an a measure your light exposure but no one was assigned to any groups are op the the that the whatever can quot in uo controls are there there were rally not there just comparisons between groups what is interesting to me a itis that as it is exactly as you said and we will make all these figures available in addition to the papers but im i mean the're it is very unusual that there is no difference between the unadjusted and the adjusted models and as you say there is probably two places out of thirty when you look at all the different quartile comparisons where you might creep from statistically significant just out of it or just into it but yet you could simplify this figure too completely by just showing one of the models and you would be getting ninety five per cent of the information whiches i mean i think in one way that suggests that there is less dependency on those veriables of course it still does not address probably the greatest question i have here which i'm sure will get to at some point as as you continue yes a mercures what that question is but i'll i'll suppress my curiosity at the moment yes if we look at figure to ot this paper and i realize a lot of people are listening and and the're not able to look at this although we have posted the figures on the utwo versions of this a just on to make clear what is going on just for those they are listening essentialy what they are looking at as but they call the odd's ratio which is the probability of something happening in one group werst divided by the probability of something happening another group i gess it would it by way of examplewll be unowg you can look at the odd's ratio of the probaibly is somebody ging long cancer if they smoke virst is probability somebody getting long cancere if they do not smoke od's ratiows and hazard ratioes are often confused their very similar an odd's ratios generally refer to a lifetime exposure here as a hazard ratio is a to find over a specific period of time but the math is still effectively the same and using the example you gave if you took the odd's ratio of a ou do not death let us talk all cause mortality for smoker for sen on smoker and the answer were one point seven eight i making that up but that is directionally correct one point seven eight as an odd's ratio means there is a seventy eight per cent chance greater of the outcome of interest in this case death by any cause in the effected group which be the smokers odd's rasio of two is a hundred per cent an odd's ratio of three is two hundred per cent the math as take the number subtract one and that is the per cent figure two of this paper is one of the key tak homes they essentially look at the odd's ratio a people who are in the let us see that let us just look at the night time light exposure and just remind me andrcausin and everybody else watching the every one of these is showing second third fourth as your exaxis right meaning they are all being compared to the first quartile that is right ing the first quartile is lowest light exposure or that is ighest light ex bemowist well er well we have to a nig dtaleng it between day and night that is right tit will rea restate it sure if we look at what is your risk of a psychiatric challenge broadly speaking whell panel as is major depressive disorder if you are in the second quartile third quartile or fourth quartile of night time light exposure youso second being the least amount of night time light exposure third being more nightime light exposure and fourth the most night time light exposure relative to the first quartile this is just a stupid thing if i were doing this figure if you were doing this in a lecture y had what you would do to make it easy you would draw arrows on it that say increasing light exposuare at night yet decreasing light exposure in the day yeit is the same information it just makes it easier for the reader to understand absoluteltl ten but and i may be the teaching point i think is four people when they review articles do not be afraid to do that and just kind of wike oh i want lititaover exactlatily i draw the airor that is increasing light that is decreasing rihe and that is how i can pay attention to what is ex woultd happening right and i'mashally in touch with the editorial staff at mature at a nature mental healtltough they do not know that i that covering this paper until after this comes out i think one thing the scientific journals really really need to do is start making the readability of the articles better for non exports i mea chances are if you cannot understand a graf and this is true for everybody chances are there is a problem with the way it is presented put it on them but then of course trine parset because on rarely if ever is it all spelled out clearly but anyway that is what we are trying to do here yet the way i would have done as say second cuortiles low amounts of nightime light exposure to find what that is third cortile is more light exposure and then forth maximum amount of light exposure at night am basically what you see is that the probability of having worse major depressive symptoms lineearly increases as you go from the second a third to forth cortile more night time light exposure worse for you and there is a dose response if you will of the effect now we can march through or discribe figure to pretty quickly by saying the same thing is true now we are just talk about night time light exposure for generalize angiety disorder that is panel see by pollar disorder although the difference betwen the second and third court quartile and by pullar disoder is not as dramatic once you get up to the fourth cuortile by pollar symptoms get much worse when people are a getting night time light exposure i really want to emphasize that point because they go on in the discussion this paper to re emphasize that point several times in fact they say that while light exposure during the day of course we will go into the data is beneficial for mental health for people with by pollar disorder it seems that light exposure at night is especially problematic independent of how much sunlight they are getting during the day you areby pullar a in the person with by pullar disorder whose struggling with either a manic or depressive episode whose making a point to get sunlight during the day who ise also getting light exposure at night is making their symptoms worse and keep hi mind they they could not completely control this but this is largely independent of things sleep duration that does not neserely mean that the person sleeping less although in a bman a manic episode presumably they are it is independent of exercise it is independent of a bunch of other things because any any logical person will hear this in sayok kat will there the game wore light at night because they are doing a bunch of other things but it is largely independent of those other things likewise the symptomology of p t st gets far worse with increasing light exposure at night self harm really takes a a leap from being fairly i don ant say minimal at the psecond and third corts also low and lets a medium amusing some obtaking some liberties here but low in medium amounts of of artificial light exposure at night then for people who get quite a lot of nightime light exposureself harm goes up and probability of psy psycotic episodes goes up or psycotic symptoms now what is nice is that the what is nice about the data is that the exact inversis pasically true for daytime light exposure although not across the board we can generally say that for major depressive disposure generalized anxiety by polar symptoms there its a little more scattered p t sty and self harm the more daytime light exposure idealy from sunlight cause tht's actually what is being measured in most cases we coul talk about how we know that is going to a proximately linearily drop the probability or the severity of these symptoms and we could just explain adam that the odds ray shows now seem to be going down an odds rasure of point seven now refers to a thirty percent reduction in the variable of interest here exactly now the the psychosis a panalagh which the focaes on psycosis i think is also worth mentioning in in a bit more detail there is a fairly dramatic reduction in psycotic symptoms as one gets more daytime light exposure independent of night time light exposure there is a well known phenomenon called iseeu psychosis which is that people come into the hospital for a broken leg or car accent maybe they were getting surgery frome from peter bacuen for something totally independent theire theire housed in the hospital and as anyone has ever been in a hospital as a patient or visitor knows the light in the lighting eviron in the hospital as absoly dreadful for health tis dreadful it mean people often complaine about the food in the capeterias being unhealthy that is often not always true not always true but the lighting invironments and hospitals is absolutely he soun t rea i especially in the intensive curument right ii think the intensivecuriion at hopkins the main one the the main sick you did not have windows people who who go into the hospital with with e brain injury or or with a stroke ar son the i get contact at all the time even though i'm not clanition what should i do for my kid my parent mi i we say get them near a window and start to the best of your abilities controlling their sleep wake cycal now oftentimes there is there nurses coming in and taking blood test and measuring pulses the mill the night that is desruptive the there is bright light not just blue light that is desruptive its noisy that is desruptive i see psychosis is when non psycotic individuals start having psycotic episodes in the hospital because of night time light exposure and in some cases lack of daytime some light we can say that with some degree of confidence because when those people go home even thoug sometimes theire s ymptoms for what th brought them to the hospital in the first place get worse their cychosies goes away now and it is independent of medication let us just be really direct there is a possibility that we are all socially jet lack that we are all desrupting these mood regulation symptoms the systems scuse me by not getting enough daytime light and by getting too much night time light if we want a look at just om in the bullet points of the takeways and and peter thank you highlighted a few of these but can we just go back to this figure to for we ha sures a handful of things that a dont ger as how on it wanted dig in the ea ye i dos it is tem and and again i normally would not make much hay out of this except for the fact that there is tight but the there are a few that really stand out and again i love this figure i would have labeled it a little differently to make it completely use er friendly but nevertheless the increasing light at night in the impact on depression irtan let us only be really technical on when i say and the relationship or correlation to depression is very strong the relationship to light and self harm in the upper cuortile when you take those twenty five per cent of people with the most night time light that relationship to self harm is interesting and completely uncoupled from the other seventy five per cent that is interesting on youba on coupled you mean that at the lower levels af light exposure at night you are not seeing an increasein self harm not what and then once you get to that fourth cuortile it is a big step it is it a thirty per cent greater risk of saron gess it is totally flat the first second third cuortile no different and then forth big jum and then the the the inverse relationship right as light increases during the daytime you see this reduction in self harm interesting the p t st relationship based on night time light and the psychosis relationship based on daytime light those are the ones that really jumped out to me i think anxiety relatively the less impressive here and and by poler disorder did not seem as strong right as well i think those those are the big ones that vagar it that jumped out to me yew i agree there is a ther's a bit more scatter on generalis anxiety in and the degree of the signaf the degree of significant change is not is not as robust in other words getting a lot of daytime light ideally from sunlight is not necessarily going to reduce your levels of anxiety getting a lot of night time light exposure is not increasing night time anxiety that much althoug twenty per cent is is not nothing for nightime light exposure but yet wit the pcychosis major major depression and self harmer are really yon they leap out actually we maybe wen just drill a little bhat deeper on major depression an beasily when you go from the second a third cuortile of night time light exposure some ore night ime li exposure you basely go from no significant increase to almost almost a twenty per cent increase and then as you get up to the fourth quartile the most nightime light exposure youat about twenty five per cent increase in major depressive symptoms no that is no joke am at an not think that i think that we we were to a i mean now we do not have the day towright here but if we are to look at standard essessor i treatment for major depression am people debate this pretty actively but am light is is a very potent stimulus and the timing of light is critical because on the the inverse is all true as you get to the forth cortile of daytime light exposure you get about a twenty per cent reduction in major depressive disorder what i about a study this is that it puts the aror bars easy to see on the data and why is that interesting well am there is there is a there is at there is a belief that bigger is always better in sample size and we often talk about that through the lenes of power analysis rihts how many subjects do we need to am t to reach a conclusion that is powered to this level and that is that is true but what i do not think get's discussed is often is the opposite of that which is what if you overpower a study andother words what if the power analysis says to be a to have a level of power at ninety per cent you need a thousand subjects and you say great were ging to do ten thousand subjects well you are clearly powered for it but you might be overpowered and people might sat well why would that be a bad thing it could be a bad thing because it means you are very likely to reach thetistical significance in things that might not be actually significant and one thing about this study that is just a quick back kund of a quick and dirty way to tell that it is probably not overpowered is that you have varying lengths of air bars and what that tells me is that and again this is not a formal statistical analysis it is just kund of a back of the envelope statistical analysis if you look for example at self harm in the top quartile you cheu have pretty big aer bars infact all the self harm have sort of slightly bigger aer bars and yet when you look at for example the depression even though the aer bars are not all the same size their tighter in fact when you look at the relationsip between depression and daytime light the aer bars are really really small that just gives me confidence that there is variability and this which paradoxically you kind of want to see cause it tells me that this was not just done there is i think you said eight thousand subjects were in this and i realize eighty more than a eighty six thouse eighty six thous or eight yet you realize that it was not that oh this should have been done with a tenth of that or a half of that and we are picking up am signal that is statistically relevant but clinically err levan yet thanks for for that point that i did not pay attention to that a i man paid attention to the aer bars but i did not know that s a thank you i'm learning too and i suppose for people there listing we you justgiv en a cense of what the aera bar ranges are for self harm yit ther running as much as tweny per cent either side of the mean the average and fror mate your depression it looks its more let usly eight to ten per ent if if that aive right ye i see we'r some was when you get a aa very large sample size you goan to have some outliers in their and you cannot mask those outliers just by having many data point's rigt yet because these aeror bars directly tell you whether or not your statistically significant what is really nice about this type of graft and you see these in otheres can be agraph in my paper where you see the same analysis they are always drawing the ninety five per cent confidence interval on the on the data point and if the ninety five per cent confidence interval does not touch the the line of unity which in this case is the the the the hod's ratio of one point zera were the exaxes then it' statistically significant to the confidence interval they have tefine which is almost assuredly ninety five per cent sometimes theyll make it tighter at ninety nine and that is why you can just look right at these an go oh look in depression the second quortile did not reach statistical significance cause the aerer bars are touching the line just as the case for the second and third quartile for self harm but when you look at the fourth quartile you can see that the lower tip of the aerer bars is not anywhere near unity and we know without having to look up the pea value that it is a smaller than either point or five or point one however they have to find it and it is really amazing when you see these over powered studies which are easier to do epitemeologically wear the pea value ends at being microscopic they can they can drive their pe values down to anything low because sample size can be infinite but you can see that it is just the the aeror bar is just skimming above the athe unity line but it is tight one i to take a quick rate to acknowledge our sponsor element elements is an electroelect drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratioes of the electrolite sodium magnesium and petassium and that correct ratio of electrolites is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your nurons relies on electrolites in order to function properly when you are well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolites in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved i drink one packet of element dissolved in about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water when i wake up in the morning as well as while i exercise and if i've swet electuring that exercise i often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about thirty two ou tses of water after i exercise element comes in a variety of differem flavors all of which i find really tasty the citrists i the water melonit the rasberry frankly i camp pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate ment which i find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up i tend to do that in the winter months because of course you do not just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you to try element you can go to drink elements spelled elemente dot come slash hubermen to try a free sample pack again that is drink element not come slash hubermen one thing that i hoe people are taking away from the study is that imagine your somebody who has a very sensitive sircadian mood system well that would mean you need less daytime light exposure to feel good or less bad but it also means that you might need very little light at night in order to negatively impact your mood systems and in fact they make this argument in the discussion as a interesting point that i think is worth matining the wik because hear what again what i about the study is that theye separated day and night time light exposure turns out that many of the drugs that are used to treat by pollar disorder reduce the sense are are effective perhaps in part because they reduce the sensitivity of the light sensing circateian apparati now that is interesting right if if you think about this o case of these are drugs that can ameliorate some of the symptoms of by polar perhaps in part by reducing the extent to which night time light exposure can relieve by polar symptems excuse me can exacerbate by polar symptems conversely there is evidence that people who take certain antitopressencs may suppress the ability for daytime light to positively impact the mood systems of the brain now of course we doft want people halting their medication on the basis of that statement alone please do not youtalk your cyciatrist but if we know one thing for sure it is that if you want o significant outcome and a paper as a scientist give a drug anmy drug and look at the amount of rapid ive movement sleep or the crcadean cycle pretty much any drug alter ci circatean rhythm for better worse but if we start to thing about which medications might adjust are over all sensitivity to light sometimes this coan be a good thing you think less sensitivity light well for people who have by pollar disorder the amount of daytime light exposure is not that important for their over all mood regulation but the amount of nightime light exposure really is in other words darkness for eight hours every night should be viewed in my opinion as a treatment for by polar disorder not the only treatment but it is also clear that we sh hould all be avoiding really bright extensive really bright night time light exposure immean if it if anything migh take away from the study is that darkness at night is the fourth key light stimulus now wha a couple of things very bright moonlight very bright candle light is probably only light gosh three to fifty locks what when you go outsidet on a brbrightly lit full moonnight i encourage people to download this free ap i ave no relationship to it call light meeter and yet it gives you a pretty good read of what the lucks are in thambarn by the way a lopeuple do not realize us that think you just tap the button and then it tells you how many lucks you hold it down it is kind of fun you can scan around the room and see how many locks are on average coming from that location or outside go out on a really bright mooligt night may we we should have a full moon to night yet let us do it you are not goingto get above a hundred lucks that is in roudabl you are sitting at a candle light dinner with you are spouse are with friends and it is clearly bright enough to see them put that lucks me to wright up not too close to the flame fifty to two hundred lcks imy ni ha or had lorksing experience a couple of months ago on an alcunt where it was a full moon which actually makes the hunting not great but it was the first time i've ever noticed my shadow in relation to the moon that is how bright it seemed the light was tha's hallowing appropriate yo coming ot were yering this close to hallowing si remarsibleor interesthink to think it could be that dim camp fire in ire light you thnk o cave gathering around a campfire w then o ke everyone circadian rhythm us have been diserrupted for ages before the development of of electric electricity now now that the those campfires are extremely bright but they are they are they are not there not that bright compared to a very densely overcast day and what is your phone if you do not use any sort of a light mitigating a tack on it well distance matters om butut if the dettants were whold ong it yet with with all the the wave langs cranked ups sand no a there is a nice feature intrinsic to the phone we can eliminate the blues at night or this kind o thing butif you crank it up to maximum light intensy probably something ligkt you five hundred to one thousand lucks now keep in mind though it is addet ive ri it is over time lucks is a measure of ati think it relates back to kendellas as the amount of light am shown and i think it is the the one meter away and there is a squaring in a falling off of distance we can look it up a ou's ae old measurement a old school measurements converred to lucks but keep in mind that you are looking at your fhone or tablet at eight hundred locks or five hundred loucks in the evening you do that for two hours whet you are summing quite a lot of fhotons now it is true and i i i do want to be fairer to the biology a and it be dishonest to say anything different no we we hammered on people about n shifting their circatian rhythm with light at night but we know that the middle of the day in the middle the night are circatian dedzones you cannot shift your circatian rhythm that well in the middle of the day in the middle of the night but you can provide a wake up signal for for your body and brain it is really that sunrise and sunset that are critical that is whyi said they are forthings see sunrise or sun rising heu do not need see across the risin sunset bright light during the day minimize light exposure at night and you kdo not need pitch black in fact pitch black problegious increases the frequency of injury y u no i get up in the mill the night to use the bath rom probably once i thing it is normal and go back to sleep you knowifit were pitch black i probably injure myself yet jus did just dim it down some people use red lights you knar rend ric a revenal friend ye ricr is a etoul funny story about rick ye of course of course this story but just i icase ricks listening he will appreciate the when rick was a here staying last summer im he is up in our guest house in he came down after the first night he was unacceptable you knon't n'm talking ab accept able accommodations what did he do he removed all the lighting that existed in that room and replaced it with red light bulbs which i later used when i stayed here and then later stole ha la ha ha ha ha ha ha the teen age me i took hem i took him that is i derick when he stayed here a lan or anyone else and stayed here contoer anyone else did have as i took him i love them fon jill is light rick changed every light in the hest house to red i'm ye i' know i did not know that but i'm not surprise yet well in his place he has most sly ither kno lighting or red lighting sucturing the day just gos by ambient light im and then red light in the evening and or candle light and it is great and you kn people yor red lights and they think they have to buy these expensif red light units ut that is not whet were talking bout that you can lierally by red party lights or just a red bulb some people say what can i jus use a red film or can i put a tea shirt over the lamp i worry about people putting teashir toe land because of e ire hazard am but i'll be ofside dim the lights in my home at night when i travel sometimes i will bring one of the the stolen from ric rub an red lights the red the rick ribenstaff here is something where i i've sort of soften my tune i used to be count of a hard liner no blue light in the evening gy im had the everything was red light at night as far as my phone using flocks on the computer whatever it was im i suspect that that matters somewhat but i think what matters more is the stimulation that may come from those things and what i've come to realise at least in me which means it probably as true in others as well and at least some others is that what i'm doing on my phone matters more than how bright my phone is in other words if i've got the best blue light felter in the world on my phone but i'm doom scrowling cial media and getting lit up on email that is way worse for me then if i've got my fhone on maximum lite and i'm watching you two vidios of f one cars and driving around having fun ot whotily different experience thet contect to matters and i think i think for that reason would will not people to be mindful of the whole picture you knon't going to bed under a period of intense deress brought on by something that is an equally dangerous component to all of this that is that is distinct from what we are talking about but but you kna sworth i'd whant people to be o think of this in the conticts of everything i it is really important point you one thing i'll say is that if you are going to stay up pass you'r normal bedtime if you can get a lot of light in your eyes i would hope they would be for fun reasons and for reasons you injoint you should defilly spend some nights out you shuld deviling tou some all nighters studying if you really if you if it is gon to help you get the grade that is permanent right i'd certainly've done all night are's studying and grant writing for years there are going to be the inevitable all nighters do to god forbid a hosstrip to the hospital or you heard something on the news that really amp to you offer you just simply cannot sleep that stuff is going to happen i think the goal should be to min my slight exposure at night and i think what you just said is especially true because we do not know frinces people talk about the negative impact of social medias it the fact that people are looking at this little box for many hours per day is it all the things they are not doing is it what they are looking at per say all of those things inter act and are really important i we know based on studies from the stamford sleep lab that if you wake up in the mill the night looking at what time it is can be very disruptive to your ability of fall back to sleep and to your sense the next day it is as a placibo fack but it is a powerful one of how tired you are the next day they have done this where they wake people open the mill the night and then they say it is fore a m versas two a m versa six a m and people's perceived levels of energy during the day in some ways cuarrelte with what they think how much sleep they think they got likewise and this is one the concerns potential concerns with sleep trackers a'lly come talkd about this when she came on our bodcast if people see a poor sleep score they often feel worse than if they see a good sleep score now of course physiology matters you cannot light yourself and say got a great nie sleep simply by virtue a sleep score but i worry more about the the false wel i will not if it is false negative at that we do not put veilance on this seeing a bad sleep score and then deciding that you are can have a terrible day you no thnk a bad sleep scores in indication that you might need to dial some things in a bit better s getting a great sleep scores in indication that you might be doing a number of things right and start looking at these things as avirgous would not you would you agree ye completely iiii do not think it is that different from segm right i think that se giemism a may sing tool to provide insight and you pretty much know the insights after a relative a shortperted time thirty days maybe at the outside ninety for for a really prfurpose withthe very complicated life im and all you need to know about how the inputs effect the output thereafter if you choose to use it it is a behaviour al tool another s you are using this to build in a hathorn effect think the same as largely true would sleep trackers im most people have this profound sense of learning when they first encounter one of these things and then it is again you have hard it all hundered times i got i cannot believe what alcohal does to my sleep ior coloric tracker exactlike i think a lan norton's ap carbon i've no financiral relationship to it i use it or and it is taught me o i consume a lot oc calories in the form of certain things at certain times to day and theres just a lot of good learning in that but's the act of tracking that helps you manage it and similarly i think it is the act of knowing you are goin to be looking at that score that game efies it that can have healps people do the right things oh what i'm not gan have that drink to night or i'm not going to eat that snack but forebed because i've now been condition to see how that impect score that is had i think that am you do not recovery scores and things that are just notoriously poor at predicting performance and i think there is a reason that serious athletes would never use things that they would tend to rely on them more tried an true methods of predicting behavior such as heartwright amaybe hartwrat very bilily but morning resting hartrate probably more predictive than anything else and thend you knon't inwork out things such as heartwright harwraight recovery lack tae threshold things that yet i agree i think we have to and i say this as a guy who ise generally perceive to be the most pro divi sky in the world peope would be surprised how sparingly i use things that i do some tracking a not as much as you a i love things that seem to work the first time and every time in terms of our natural biology abased on couple cratera there is an established mechanism im it is been explored in the contects of pothology mental health disorders as well as pro health in healthy individuals im that it make really good sense at the level of kind of am a wellness a and let yo say ancient health when you' time at getting a los sunlight during the day lot people say wof course get outside and play not getting too much light at night of course ies just good old quoting qu good old fashion advice people spend ninety per cent of their time indoors now there daytime environments are too dim there night time environments are too bright and this anmisleading aspect of artificial light that when you see a bright buld you think i'm getting a lot of photons is part of the problem and the fact that when you are out on a over cast day and it you think there sun cotincle is not out wellt's hidden by cloud cover but just think about how well you can navigate that in vironment without a flashlight e verse is at night where you would require a flashlight we evolved under this trematic difference in day night availability of photons independent whether not you can quo see the sun and it is just very clear that our the all the mechanisms in our brain and body that regulate mood are just powerfully regulated by the stuff i've made it a point to really reduce the amount of night time light that i'm getting but iam less concerned about flipping on the light switch to use the bath room as i used to be it us to think i'm quashing all my melotone an this is terrible i know i cannot shift my circatian clock then i know that that light yes while it is bright if it is brief and i can worry about it too much would it be better to have a a dim light on as post of bright light shore but i'm not oin a stras it in a hotel bath roomersim i can walk around yo shielding my eyes people will sometimes ask me by the way is it different to look at the phone directly verses if you tilt the phone away well it absolutely is i meanthing about a flashlight shone on the ground in front of you very few photons getting in your eyes verse is shown directly in your eyes think about ambiant likt from the sun going everywhere verseis looking in the general direction of the sun east in the morning west in the afternoon of course the directionality the light matters i'm not saying it i that you ould need to bpiqueat your phone as if you are looking a over the edge of a bowl or something into it but my friend a sammerhotar's head of the chronobiology unit at the nashal institutes a mental health we's to room together at meetings we stopped as he is a terrible snore i just could it there ra few times when i considered suffocating him in the mill the night since he was already suffocating himself now we just we do not stay in the roms any more were no longer postoks but i caught him looking at his phone in the middle of the night and he would tilt it a way he is holding a platter for those that are just listening and and con looking over at the screen there y what you doing this is ridiculous ins i'm trying not to get much light of meyes that is a lle extreme but i think it illustrates the point which is how much direct light exposure you get at night matters how much direct sunlight sposur you get spuchally early in late early morning late afternoon and thoughout the day it really matters now remi me ander what is the wavelingth of sunlight great sunlight is going include all visible the visible truns i homany yes well let us let us we can answer two questions there this ris censer a detected four hundred seventy degree a seventy nan a meter to six hundred fifty nan imeter light that is going to be blue an ultra violet ultra vileet's kind oyet i donn't lue to orange yet blue blue to orange that is what this was measuring red light is going to be more six eighty far red is getting out to seven seven twenty and up upwards of that blue light is going a fall somewhere in the you low fors ultra violet is gating down i nto the high threes and and lower amen these these spectr of lights during the day ou n a midday light you can what looks whit light you willsee how the skies blue in the sun is bright whight light not even yellow to your eye and of course do not stare at as spushing the middle of the day you are getting all visible spectres you getting everything from you v all the way out to red light is just coming in at equal intensities as that o potential limitation of this study and that it did not have a censor that could pick up the full spectrum of light potentially especially since there we do not think of humans as you v a capable we cannot perceive youv light a a a ground squirrel for instance can has uv censors in its eyes turns out why they usetes its crazy they actually in the grounds grel sit up on their haunches there as haly signaling one another they rub yourind on their belly and it reflects you v a the the newyork times for some reason has been running a series papers a ar articles rather about a naturally occurring florescence at night in all sorts of to be scorpians and a monotrimes the platapas none really knows the reason for these odd oddway length of light emissions for for all these animals but we view things in the blue violet and up to red and a were not pit vipers we cannot see far red but we cannot see lower than four hundred and seventyn animeaters and we can see higher than a seven six hunder and fifty is there a technology reason why they had such a narrow band in these censrs is it not possible but they could ave used a rous censer that was witer this study was initiated in two thousand thirteen the tack was probably far worse than it is now again i would love for somebody design an ight glass where it is measuring how many fhotons you are getting across the day i'm not a big fan of having everything be apified i would love it if it the frame which a shift color cross the morningli you go outside on a cloudy day you nee where these glasses and a and by thewy it is find to where eye glasses are contacts for sunlight viewing for setting your circatian rhythm a people aways say whle wise that oke in a windows not wele corrective lendses are actually foksing the light onde your retina the windows and and winshiels are scattering the light and filtering and how much are sun glasses filtering this out way too much we can safely say way too much probably causing it tenfold decriment in the total luck's count that is landing on your retina but of course i eu noson glasses ar important driving in thi into sun and a and someby levery sensitive eyes i cannot sit at a cafe with a bright brightly reflective table in the afternoon i just i just squint crazy i cannot do it my dad whos you darker eyed and yours south south american desent he am he to sit there just fime my mam whos got light eyes me and a word ot's really top yjust have a terrible time a people differ in their light sensitivity there is one other ma crow question i have here and it is not answerable because without randomization we cannot know it but it is the question of how much reverse causality can exist in these observation again these observations im demonstrate very tight correlations very strong associations especially in the five areas that we highlighted im but it is possible that part of what we are seeing m is reverse causality brought on by both the treatments which you have already cond of alluded to and also the condition itself you wont explain reverse causality for people a maybe could you mention im for those atmissed at the hawthorn effect jyes i ya yet the the hawthorn effect a is as is an effect that is named after n ouno an observation of what took place in a factory where they were actually studying worker productivity with light of all things im but it whatd t wou refers to is the idea that people will change their behavior when they are observed if im if i said well i really want to know what a day in the life is for andrew hubermen i wont to follow him around for a day it is very unlikely that his behavior that day will be exactly as it was if i was not there it is at' ra you probably will never see a day in the life of andrew hurmn although it is pretty it is prettyscripted unless i'm traveling it is a it is a it is morning sunlight iduration and some cardior wai chaining in then lot of time reading papers to be the most boring vedy on the world is mostly me reading an underlining things but it is why im game ofying things can be beneficial right it is why as g m can can be beneficial because it is sort of somebody is watching you and you are gin a modify what you eat in response to it or why tracking can really be an effective way to reduce in put because you there is a sense of being monitered by doing that especially if some one literally moniters it another words you can set up an accountability partner where your health coch or some one is actually seeing the data that is what it is now as far as reverse causality when you look it variables im let ustjustpak a common one that is unrelated to this therethere is an association that more diet soda consumption is associated with greater obisity 's a bit paradoxical right im zeter it is ye it is it is been demonstrated in many series that thethe the greater the consumption of diet soda the greater the prevalence of obisity and that has been postulated by some to suggest that non neutritive sweeteners such as aspertain or sucrolosor things that are actually part of what is causing obisity im and while there are probably some arguments you could make around the impact that those things might have on the got microbium and may be there is some way and that is happening it is also equally likely if not probably more likely that there is reverse causality there that a person who is obees is therefore contemplating how much their eating or thinking hey what is an easy way that i can reduce calories how about instead of drinking a cokue i drink a diet cok and there the causality which you would impute to mean the drink is causing the obesity it might be know the obesity is causing the choice of drink here the question is a how much of the effect were seeing i is a result of the condition that is being studied right how much of the disruption in both day and night it is a light exposure is the result of the depression it is disregulating the sleep may be ther sleeping more during the day and more awake at night because of depression again these are you cannot know this this is where epidemiology never allows us to determine this and sadly these questions can only be answered through either direct rantimization or mendellian randomization which by the way i was going to also ask you do if anyone has examined this from emendellian standpoint that would be that would be very interesting cause i have to believe well it would be interesting i do not know enough about the biology to know what snips would be studiable but that would be interesting what peters saying as you do notf you knew something about the genomes of these people a you would be in a great position to perhaps yeven link up light susceptibility gene r light sensitivity rgenes with genes for you knon't pathways involved a major depression by polar tyget it gain to this issue af reverse causalitium think it is very straight forward to imagine that the person whose experiencing amanic episode is can be up for two weeks at a time a sadly and getting a lot of night time light exposure yong now dart night time dark exposure as a treatment for bypullar is something that people are starting to talk about making sure that eve those people are awake that theire at least blue locking at night i'm reducing there on line activities but people which severe manic episode's ho the hard time regulating their own behavior of course and it is not one or the other i do not want the question to come across to the listener that it has to be one or the other it is only a can cause be or becan cause a no it is actually a lotof times these things feed off each other going back to the soda example i actually think there is a bit of both right i i actually think there is a real clear a body habituss dictates beverage choice but i also am starting to think that a insusceptible individuals non nutritive sweetners will alter the gotbyum and that alters metabolism what about just hunger i iremember lain telling me and i have seen at least one of the studies that water is probably better for us than dietsota but that for some people dietsota is a great tool for reducing coloric in take i also know some individuals not me who drink diet sota i i drink dit sota from time to time mainly stevia sweetan sotas but but what a'm referring to here are people besides myself who drink tit to end it seems to stimulate their appetite there is something about that this an the perception of sweet as driving hunger were as not eating a or drinking anything with calor with any sweetness does not seem to this one of the things tha i wonder a'm if it impacks why some people intermittan fasting because for some people just even that the perception i wonder if the perception of sweetness or the even just the smell of food we know can stimulate appetite you conmantion that the perception of sweetness in the mouth even if there is no calories there a i do not think it nasilly makes people hipl i seemic but perhaps it makes them think about hem sweet means food forinces for years i love the commination of a diet coke and a slice of petza when i were i was in new york i deally two slices of petza now every time i have a diet cok which is not that often but i dit cocus pecial ill of lemin in it i just think about a slice of cheese or mushroom or peperoni petza s i want i trave it more there is a parent association there that i think i's real and we know based on dana small lab at yale that there is a paired association between the a sweetness from sucrlos and that there is an insolent response the i she had to cease the study in kids because they were they were becoming prediabetic which unfortunale meant the study was never published have you talke to dana on this podcast no we we wrote a premium news letter on this im several months ago it it is got to be i do not know ten to twenty thousand words on all things wre elated to sugar subs o ci si'll read that it wes soe have from dear interested in this topic a i would refer them to the premium uws letter on sugar substitutes i think it was our september adission im the short of it is the data are a little bit noisy i but but there is indeed some some sweeteners in some studies du do result in that itphenomenon you describe the sophalic and slen response i'm and i came away from the research that went into that which was herculean effort i'm on the part of the team a a little bit more confused than when i went in but a being even more cautious around artificial sweetners than i was going in and not for the reasons that i do not neserily a i do not i did not find any evidence that these things are cancser causing right that is the headline stuff people were bout o i in te has ten gre crei came away more confident that from as from a long term safety perspective in terms amotter it interms of gino cancer and catestrophic out comes that that was not issue but i came away much more cautious around these things can really be m ocking around with both your brain chemistry and you are gut chemistry which can pertain to your metabolism and mer therefore migh take away wash buyer beware yuse limited amounts only the one by the way that still emerge to me is a reasonable one it is the only one that i use and a fact about a lot is zilatall zilatal is the uapern me ision said zilatall for chewing for gum and alyolos as an additive those are the safer yyes those were those are basely only to i will consume i'll i'll drink a dii coke every now and again if i'm on o plan or yeye yo this law that got pass for years egause you can bring liquids an in of your own into the airport and on the plan what a glew years ago what a great scheme what a great scheme to get people to buy over price fluids in the airpoit i'mean there more important issues in the world but this one really gets me but ye id i use alibit i drink things wi libitesteviand it the occasional dit cok and i i generally avoid cecrillos i do not the wait taste mong fruits to sweet but thell we get we maybe well do a upotcastile man in the future o case i thnk we can wrap this paper ecause i really well but tell me what you think about that point andrew how i mean you more about this stuff than i do but if if you had to just lay on your judgment right if it were if it were a hundred to zero you would say the light is one hundred per cent causal in the effects were seeing if it were zero to a hundred you would say no the behavior is one hundred per cent causal of the exposure to light where do you again cannot know it yet what is your intuition tell you ket there is my intuition and then there is my recognition of my own byas am because t i start working on these circadian pathways riginaing the eye back in year in ninety eight as a graduets sun at brkly that the sells these melnops an intrinsically sense if rettnall ganliyselles were discovered in the early two thousands by gending igy prevencio dave berson sant mratar sotchin pant and others but that and it was lik one of the most important discoveries in all biology clearly i've been very excited about these systems but if i set that aside byis disclosure made i think sixty five to seventy five per cent of the effects are likely du to light directly now it is impossible to tease thos apart as you mention but to play devil's advocate against myself you can imagine that that depressed individual is laying around indoors with the curtain stron they did not sleep well the night before which gives you a photo sensitivity that is not pleasant it socksav bright lighting your eyes first thing in the morning if you specially especially if he did not sleep well and then there re makin their coffee in a dimly lit what they think is brightly lit environmen an then there youll look int their phone and the the state of the world socks and their state of their internal landscape is roff and there maybe they aredealing with ha painer or at injury or something and thei're likelyhod of getting outside as is low and when they do get outside there gin a shuffle and not you i could see how the behaviours could really limit the amount of of light exposure and then evening rolls around they ben tired all day and a common symptom of depression you fall asleep and the two or threein the morning their wide awake what oe can do it two or three when yofre wideawake sit in the dark no you are going to get on lyine you are gingto listen to things you might have i'm not recommending this but a alkoholi drink in order to tryin falsely mend this is the pattern and shaking up that pattern as really what what much of my public health work these days is about in trying to get people on to a more natural daylight night a night dark rhythm ah but yet's impossible that hese part we do know this and this is a really serious we know that in almost every instance everalmost every psychopathology report of suiside in the weeks but especially in the days preceding suicide that person circatean rhythms looked almost inverted from their normal patterns and that is true of non by polar individuals as well you circatian desruption and destruction in psychiatric healt are inextricable conversely positive mood in affect and and circadean behavior seem very correlated i mean i think am it is clear that if you wanto become an early riser get light in your ises and get activity in your body early in the day you you built the ouen train to those rhythms that you struct to anticipate that morning work out you sarto anticipate the morning sunlight just one more scientific point we know that when you view bright bright sunlight in the morning or just sunlight that is illuminating your environment as you said you when you have to see the sun itself that there is a fifty five zero percent increase in the amplitude of the morning quarters all spike which is a good thing rfor you on because it is inversely the amplitud the morning quarters all spike is inversely relaid to the amplitude the evening quarters all spike and hih evening quartersas associate with middle of the night waking and on and on am i'm very bullish on these mechanisms i also love that theire deeply woven into our evolutionary history know that we share wa single el organisms is wild am but of course there is going to be a by directionality there and it is it is impossible to see where one thing starts in the other ones stolps i mean here is my take and refers t i actually with far less authority than you i'm agree with your assessmen and might even be a little bit more bolish might even puted of eighty twenty and and here all i'll give you my explanati ions which a stem more from my fastidious battles with epidemialogy and general right be to much of the world that i live in still has to rely on epidemialogic data and how do you make sense of it and the truth of it is most of it is really pretty bad a but i i tend to find myself looking at the austen bradford hill criteria all the time and for folks who do not know a he was a statistition who basically proposed a set of criteria a believe there are eight of them and i cannot blive i do not know every one of them off by heart my certainly used to am but the more of these criteriota tha that are met with in your correlations the more likelyhood a you will find causality when i think of your data here the data in this paper i'll tell you what makes these correlations seem to have causality within them in the direction it is being proposed a look at the dose effect dose effect matters and this is done in quartiles and that is a very elegant thing if they just did it as on off it would be harder hi lo that is righo ifi get ot ddn't quartiles allows you to see that every example in figure to i do not believe there is an exception to this nowind i think also in the in the theres only there is only one exception to what i'm about to say sorry too out of god knows how many they are all monotonically increasing in decreasing another words the dose effect is always present another thing is biologic plausibility you spoken at length about that today another words sometimes you have to look at epidemiology and ask is their a biologic explanation and here there is you have added another one which is evolutionary conservation to the biologic plausibility then you can talk about animal models or experiments in human's over short durations that generally support these findings and and those are just a couple of the the bradford hill criteria that that lead to am my belief that yathers reverse causality here but m it is not the full explanation and that more of the explanation is probably the direction that is being proposed a and if that is true cause then at the in of the aylike what is the purpose of the discussion the purpose of the discussion is if you are under the influence of any of these psychiatric conditions in addition to the treatments you are doing now what else can you do and to me the take away is follow these behaviors i man utes it is it is that is a relatively low lift and you con sider some othev things i'm over here asking people to do hisown two for three hours a week and vio two macs work outs and all this of their staff and i think all those things matter for mental health as much as physical health but this strikes me as on the spectrum of lo asks if it shows if it is only even thirty per cent causality seventy per cent reverse causality i'll take those ii would t doin state that yet it is it is taking your coffee on the balcony it is an peell well often say well how do you do this with kids the kid should be doing it too i now it means popping a sone glassis off at means getting out for just a few minutes and the fact that is additive that thes thes photon a mechanis phot on counting mechanisms they sum is great and looky this will paper also says and i shouw stated this earlier if you missed your daytime light ration get your night time dark ration they are independent and additive som that is i'man that is at really something i but of course ideala you get both by appreciate your take on it and am ian thenk for for your a expertison parsing epidemiology i look at fewer studies of that of that sort what i learne from you and now that is one ofthe readns i love doing these journal clumses i learn along those lines a tell us about the paper you selected i'm really eager to learn more well i wanted to pick a paper that was you not kind of interesting as a paper and and this this paper i think is i interesting in that it is kind of the landmark study of a class of drugs but in the same way that you kind of pick to paper that i think has a much broader overarching am imimportance the reason i picked this paper which is im from newing the journal medicin it is about ten years old no correction thirteen years old is because it is kind of the landmark study in a class of drugs that i believe are the most relevant class of drugs we have seen far in cancer therapy and even though the net effect of these drugs has only serve to reduce mortality by maybe eight to ten per cent which is not a huge amount im it is the manner in which they have done it that gives me great hope for the future even if it is through other means im i'll take a step back before we going to the paper for again just the context and background i'm the human imune system is kind of a remarkable thing a it it is it is hard when you are sort of trying to imagine what is the most amazing part of the human system and maybe it is my bias as well becaus just as you spent your time in in the light system in in the photosan sing sistem my spend my time in the imenology world but it is remarkable to me how or emun systems evolve and they have this really brutal task which is how can they be tuned to detect any foreign pathag in that is harmful without knowing a priori what that could be well it the same anothers how can you tune a system to be aggressive that it can eradicate any virus or bacteria billions of years into the future without knowing what it is going to be but at the same time it has to be forgiving of the celf that it does not turn around and attack the cell it is remarkable and of course we can always think of the exceptions there are things called autoomune conditions clearly the system failures fails and the immune system turns around and attacks the self if you see a person with vitiligo i have a little bit of it at vit willi go on my back couple of spots clearly the immune system is attacking something there and destroying some of the pigment i did not realize ve ligo is onomia ye i'm if you do not there is ore their lots of no more serious autoomune conditions of course in a somebody that has lups or where the onimmune system can be attacking the kidney the mmune system can be attackingng automune conditions can be deadly but fortunately they are very rare and for the most part this emune system works remarkably well how does it work and why is it that cancer seems to evade it virtually all of the time this is the question now let us first of all talk about how it works and then when i tell you how it works you will say that sounds amazing clearly it should be able to destroy cancer i'm when i simple fi it by only talking about one system which is how t cells recognize and get activade to have t cells recognize antigents we have some thing called a an antigen an antigen is an antibody generating peptide it is a it is a it is a protine almost always approtine thay can be carbohidrates but there almost always protines and thei're very very small peptides we are talking as little as nine emmino acids may be up to twentyamino acid teeny tiny little peptides but it is amazing that in such a short peptide the body can recognize if that is andrew or not andrew an men again think think about wwe talk about protines in killadultins right we are talking about protins in terms of thousands of immino acids that make up every protine in your body and yet if it samples of protine and sees that hay this little nine ten fifteen peptitomino acid is not part of you i know it is bad and therefore i'm going to generate in amune response to it we have what are called antigen presenting cells you have cells that go around sampling peptides and they will on these things called m h c class receptors bring the peptide up to the surface and serve it up to the t cell they are two types of these there is mh c class one and m h c class to i only resis major is o combatibility complex that is correct and i'm we refer to them that way because they dethat because of the contexts in which they were discovered which was for organ rejection not surprisingly when you need to put a kidne into another person if that kidney is deemed foreign it will not last long and the early days of organ transplantation were rife with immediate rejections and by not not a m the immediates are the a bo in compatibilities but that the sort of next layer of incompatibility was mh c in compatibility which would lead to ou know within within weeks the organ is gone as supposed to within ours you have these two classes of m h c you have class one in class to class one is what we call and dogenis this is basically what happens when a protine or an antigen is coming from inside the cell let us consider the flue if you get the flue the influence of virus infects the respiratory epithilium of your a ou know your larinxs and that viris as folks listening might remember from our days of talking about covet virus is cannot replicate on their own what they do as they hyjack the replication a machinery of the host and they use that yeither to insert theire are an ar d ana to replicate and in the process protnes are being made while those protines are the protines of the viris not of us some of those peptides get launched on to these m h class emh class one a glove basically the glove comes up to the surface and a t cell comes along and the case of m h c class one it is a c d hte t cell these are what are called the killer t cells right and this cell comes along and with its t cell receptor the t cell receptor meats the m h c class one receptor with the antigen in it and if that is a lock it realizes that is my target and it begins to replicate and proliferate and target those and that creates the immune response and by the ay that is how it works when you vaccinate somebody you are basically prebuilding that thing up woith this fall under the adaptod the mun response or the innate munthough this is adaptive yet nate is just these pure antibody response in on the bcell side i will not get into that for for for the purpose of this discussion the other example is m h c class two and that is also part of the adaptive system are the inate system which is more we call the a exogenis form these are peptides that are usually coming from outside the cell worgin a focus more on the m h c class one because this is peptides that come from inside the cell okso just keepin the back your mind if a foreign protine gets presented from incide a cell to outside a cell the t cells recognize that and they will mount a foreign response and by the that is why we basically can beat any viris if you consider how many viruses are around us the fact that we almost never die from a viral and f ction is a remarkable achievement of how well this imune system works voundsintly combating these vire constantly and by the way we do not really have very effective antiviral agents it is not anty biotics we have anti biotic up the waso i mean we are way better at fighting viruses than bacteria can i one cause i've always wondered about this to what extend is our ability to ward off viruses on a dated bay basis as an adult reliant on us having been exposed to that virus during development as i walk around say may be a'll be exposed to a hundred thousand different viruses would you say that half of those ihave already got annabodies to because i exi was exposed to them at some prior portion of my li ye what what if on and the other ones i'm just building up bannabodies i as on i was on ta plain last night ways coughings i was hiding id covit al a while ago i was not to word about that and i feel great to day but i just assume that on that plain i'm in a swamp of viruses no matter what and that most of them i've already been exposed to since i was a little kit i got ll the anabodies and they are just fighting at thak binding up those viruses an and and destroying ye i think it is part that and i also think it is part of them that our body can destroy without mounting much of an imune response or therefore your mune system is doing the work and it is yet it is not mounting as ostemac in flammatory response hat you are not sensing is it also of physical trapping and in my nasal up wa theelingon ye irus yes yet let the you have huge barriers right the skin the hairs in your nos all of these things are huge barriers but assuming that still a bunch of them are getting in at least the respiratory ones that is yothing to keep in mine right there are certain viruses that are totally useless floating around the air right there are certain viruses the viruses that most people are really afraid of hp c hp b h v well if they are sitting on a table or floating round the air they are of no threat to you they have to be cort of transmitted through the barrier i'm but again some oftese viruses you are in defeet without an enormous response and then some of them why is in fluenza quotin quote such a bad virus whereas the common respiratory cold con aside lines you for a day it is the immune response that your feeling the worse the bigger the immune response to the virus the more you are feeling that you feel your immune system going crazy right youyu know the inner lucans that are spiking the third spacing that occurs to get more and more of the immune celvs there the spike of your temperature as your body basiclly tries to cook the virus all that stuff is your body the yep yet you are being drained and all this happening one more point i'l mention just but just to close the loop on the auto imunity i'm how is it that we learn not to attack ourselves thats something called thymic selection that occurs in infancy you and i have a no good for nothin tiny little thymus that would be it is almost imp ossible to see these things you kow when we used to operate on people the thimus is barely visible in an adult in a healthy adult outside of thimac tumors but is a chot in a child the thimus is quite large and the purpose of the thimus is to educate teacells and basically show the teacells what self is and any tea cell that does not immediately recognize it get's killed t's it is a really clever system where we basically teach you to recognize celf they are at a very early age and if you cannot do that you are weeded out and then the the thimus involutes thereafter because it serve of served its purpose ok now let us talk about cancer what we know about cancer we know that again you notcancer is a genetic disease in the sense that every cancer has genetic mutations am most of those mutations are sematic which means most of those mutations are mutations that occur during the course of our life they are not germline mutations the germline being the a egs ensper rigight sayds all other cells and i love that you pointed out that there can be genet that cancer can be genetic but is not necessarily inherited right if i ce it is we rearearly an erican they think inherited ah yes am inherited is always genetic to some extant but a genetic is not always inherited yes there are a handful of cancers that are a derived from inherited mutations lynch cyndrum is an example of that a hereditary polyposis is an example of that where you have a gene that gets passed through the germ line and that gene codes for a protine all genes do and it is either you have too much of a gene or too little of a gene it is either a gene that promotes cancer and you have too much of that or it is a gene that prevents cancer and you have too little of it or a disfunctional version of it right sobraca is an example that braca is hereditary braca codes for a protine and the the women and men but mostly the women that we think about who have a braca mutation that all in some cases almost guarantees breast cancer it is because of a defective copy it is they do not get the protine that they need to protect them from bresscancer what we know whele we know that and this is proby one of the most remarkable things i've ever learned and it still blows my mind every time am well actally before i get to that point i want to make a one make nt pon oit you might think cancer we we ourcelves become canceris but they are clearly hyjacked because they have these mutations and as a result of these mutations they make protines that allow cancers to behave differently and cancers behave differently from non cancers in two very critical ways the first way is that they do n nt respond to cell cycl signaling if you cut your skin it heals but how does it know to heal just right and not to keep growing and growing and growing and growing and growing what knows that because there are cell cycal signals that tell it time to grow time to stop if believe it are not this is an extreme example if you donated to me half of your liver which i know you would absolutely omnagety more than halfm will you do notly ean to give a ent that we could keep doing these geaa within months you would regenerate a full liver that is is' tat amazement wells a salemandry cut off a salem ander limb and please do not do that experiment cause other people are doin it anyway and it grows back is as anysom knows how much to grow back when the cell is perfectly functioning it knows how much to grow and and ts it will cancer loses that ability that is one of the hallmarks of cancer it just keeps growing does not grow faster by the way that is a misnomor people think cancers grow faster than non cancers there is no real evidence that that is the case they just do not stop growing the second property of cancer is the capacity to leave the sight of origin gos some place elson take up residence that is metest that is the metasteses component you think about it for a minute a cell that never stops replicating and has the capacity to up and leave and move and take up residence is clearly different from the cell itself right if i have a cell of colonic epithelium the cell that lines the inside my coling clearly got a set aprotines in it but if al of a sudden that thing can grow gro grow gro grow not stop not stop not not listen to the signal and then somehow wind its way into the liver and just keep growing and growing and grwing it must have different protines the question then becomes why does cancer even exist how has ar immune system not figured out away to just silence this and eradicateid the way it does to virtually every virus you encounter and to me this is one of the most interesting questions in all of biology and it really comes down to how clever cancer is unfortunately how evolutionarily clever it is it basically does a lot of things to trick the immune system it has its own secretery factors that tamp down the immune system it grows in an environment because of its nature one of the things that is long understood about cancer is its heavily glike colitic and when something is heavily glike collitic it is going glucos to piruvate tolactate non stop there are lots of reasons for that am i think there is more than one ittho what is that afford it is it wellse its atnot sat aforid a migratory tend you knowse it is superintereting that is the effect that what i just described as called the warburg effect and when warburg proposed this ah which god was probably in the nineteen twh on ts was before world ware want before wordwork too am he proposed it behe thought the mightaconria of cancer sells were defective he proposed that the cancer cells might a condre do not work hence they have to undergogue likecolisis they cannot undergo a erobic a a metabolism we now know that that is not the case we now know that the the the warburg effect or the varburg effective a refer to him correctly by his name am almost assuredly does not have to do wit defective mat accondria others have proposed several mechanisms i think there is probably more than one thing going on a paper that came out of two thousand nine very influential paper am bygany mat van derheiden and a crag thompson and a lucantly proposed that the reason that caner cells do the warburg effect is that they are not optimizing for energy their optimizing for solular building blocks and if you do the mass balance at completely make sense dividing cells need building blocks more than energy and glike holisis while very inefficient for generating t p is much more efficient at generating substrait to make more cells but innother proposed mechanism is exactly at this one holisis lowers the surrounding p h because of lackta lacta attracts hydrogen p h goes down and guess what that does to the imune system dettracts the immune system it is also a way to hide from the immune system there is a a p h cloaking yes leverging p h to cloak that is rye the signal that the imian system would otherwise se ye and then when you layer on top of that that it knows how to secrete things il ten t g f ba a all of these other secretory factors that also in hibit the immune system bsicl it is figured out away to kind of hide itself from the mune system the way you describe at cancer sounds a virus ysn't it sounds a lot avirus and that leads me to ask are there any examples of contagious cancers irecall seeing some studies about these lo critters down in a a australia tasmanian devils that they would a they scratch each other an fight as tasmanian devils do ash quite cute a and they w get cancers and tumors growing on theire yes and si was it was this nos la it was a literal physical interaction that could transmate cancer from one animal to the nex it is less that there are viruses that cause cancer in that sense you could argue yes there are contagious cancers h p v sure y h p v hp b a hep c a but but there even cancers cutaneous cancers that arise from viruses but am i do not know if that is quite the same is what you are saying no no it is in they are both it what your saying is an important point i meana we do not want to go down tha th ratherhole of of h p v but right that is increasing susceptibility to servical cancer a now there is of acen against h p yut there was not when we were in college as we all knew a ther s no vaxen but the o ke but yet direct transmission of cancers from one one organism to the next more rare yes ok now a moment go i said there is this really incredible thing about cancer that blows my mind and about our mun system which is that at least eighty per cent of solid organ tumeors and re gna mostly talk about solid organ tumors cause that is where the field of oncology has made very little progress if you go back fifty years where has on cology made huge progress hit is made great progress in a blood tumers lukemias and some kinds of lymphomas in fact there is two kinds of lymphomas where the progress has been remarkable one has been in a hockins limphoma and the other has also been an ammunotherape has been in a type of bcelemphoma a where that bsel demonstrates a or present something called a sedy nineteen receptor n in in be seldomphomas with sedy nineteen and you now that there is a very unique niqhe immunotherapy will not talk about that today called car tetherapy that has got rid of those guies and then lukemias ofve also been pretty good but in solid organ tumors there've been only twwo real break throughs in the last fifty years one has been the therape for a certain type of tisticular cancer a and it is really just a keemotherapy cocktail that has been found to work really well and the other has been in this really rare kind of gastric cancer called gistromal tumor which happens to result from one mutation in a cinase pathway and there is one drug that can now target that and at works kind of amaze and cures that cancers that what i'm talking about are the cancers that kill virtually everybody else this is what when use are to line up what are the big causes of cancer death let' start at the top it is lung it is then brest and prostate in men and women it is colerectal it is pankris those of the big five they kill more than fifty per cent of americans it cancerwize not cermly restate that more than fifty per cent of cancer deaths in americans come from those five these are what we call the solid epithelial tumors and you can march down the list and most cancers that most people are thinking of or this cancers will here is the thing more than eighty per cent of those cancers have antigens that are recognized by the hosts imune system i will stated again because it is profound eighty per cent at least of those cancers actually generate and antigen meaning a little peptide in that cell gets presented to the t cell and it is recognizable and now the question is why is that not sufficient to induce remission an the short ancer is there are nout enough t cells that are able to act and or they are being sufficiently inhibited from acting which gets me to the point of this paper one of the ways in which the body in hibits the immune system which we should remind ourselves is an important thing right is something called a check point in hibiter ok go back to that idea that i talked about before you have an anagin presenting cell it brings up an mh c receptor with a peptide on it and there is a t cell that is coming and actually brought a diagram which wergan i'm't a link to this colect id want to make this two complicated but i really think that this figur is helpful to understand how these papers ote's drugs work the emage c receptor with the peptide is sitting there and it binds to the t c tcell receptor on the tea cell but there is another receptor on the tea cell a c tla for receptor and that binds to a receptor that i will not bother naming now cause it is the names do not matter but there is another receptor on the antigen presenting cell that binds to that and that acts as the breaks in the reaction c tla for which is on the t cell binds to another cd receptor on the angemsing cell and it says tamp down the response and the reason for that is we want to keep our mune system in check this basically is a way of asking the imune cyst system cause member when the immune system sees that antigen it wants to go nuts it wants to start replicating and killing that this is a cdiate t cell it is a targeted killer tea cell the check point says let us double check that let us be sure let us tamp down the response and as a result of that a thought experiment emerged which was what if wed block c tl a fore what if wed block the check point could we unleesh the immune system a little bit more and i will say this at the time it was proposed it ceemed a bit far fetched because of the complexity of the immune system it seemed a little far fetched that simply blocking the check point would have any effect it is also worth noting that prior to this one immunotherapy had found some efficacy which was trying the exact opposite strategy rather than blocking the inhibiter it was throwing more excelerant at the fire which was giving something called interlucan to interlucan to is for lack of a betterword candy and fuel for tea cells the idea was if we have tea cells that innately recognize a cancer antigen can we just give high doses of interlucan to and have them undergo proliferation and response and the answer turned out to be yes but only in two cancers melino ma and kidney cancer and only at very small levels about ten per cent of the population would respond to these things now look that is ten percent of people who were goin to be dead within six months cause these are devastating cancers and once they spread there are no treatments that have any efficacy whatsoever andfit ti think median survival fror medastatic melanoma at the time was probably four months this was a very grim death sens am but the idea now was what about doing the exact opposite approach instead of trying to throw more a fire at the tcell what if we can take its breaksdown less gas pard me instead of giving more gas let us give less breaks and am there were some phase to some phase one studies thet demostrated efficacy face to and the paper men a talk about to day is the is th phase three a a a study that compared a the first version of these the the drug worg n ta talk about to day is an anti c tole for drug called am ipililamab a there is another drug out there that came came along shortly thereafter that is a an anti pd one drug p d one a turns out to be another one of these check points on t cells and the nobell prize by the way i think it was two thousand eighteen or two thousand nineteen in medicine or physiology was exually awarded to the two scientists who discovered c tiol for and p d one this i believe this is the only nobell prize in medicine for amunotherapy 's very bigdial this study am sought to compare the effect of anti c tiole for to a placebo and the placebo in this case was not a real placebo it was peptide vack cene called g p one hundred to ask the question inpatients with medistatic malanoma what would be the impact on median survival and over all survival am let us talk a little bit about the paper again one of the funny things about this is a i used to read these papers a lot andrew these these used to be these use to be my bread and butter papers i mean i be you noft reading these i'm it is a my hobby and and i do not read them that much any more it was kind of amazing how long it took me to remind myself of stuff i used to remember but you do have to cond a go back and read the methods and figure out who were the patients in this what was the eligibility criteria why did they do it this way and of course it all kind of came back to me but am it it took a minute the first thing is these are all patients who am had progressed through every standard therapy these are patients for whom there were no other options am these patients either had very advanced stage three melanoma which means it was local regional melanoma but it could not be resected an example of that would b am a cancer that was completely en gulfing where t let us say toe primary sight was the cheek and it had completely gron into all of the surrounding soft tissue it had not spread anywhere but it was unoall the limph nodes of the neck a and an obseen patience this in its you no it is just completely disfiguring am and they' already been through the standar keemotherape and nothing was working and the thing was growing and then it was mostly made up of patients with stage for cancer no melanoma has a very funny staging system in cancer whech typically talk about something called the t n m staging system it is the standard way that cancers ar staged t refers to the tumor size m refers to the limph note status an m refers to the presence or absence of metastises and for most cancers it is a very simple system it is t is typically a number one two sometimes up to three and four n is typically zero one or two and m zero or one either there is no mets or their armets for examplein colerecto cancer am the t staging determines the depth in the colan wall that it went n is did it go to mets and i think in colan i m the rusty on thes siythink colan has n zero one or two depending on how many limphnodes and then m zero did it go to anything beyond that to the liver long et cetera or not malano as a been more complicated it has m zero meaning no mets but it also has m one a m on b m on c and m one d and within each of those it has a threshold for high and low lactate d hydrogenies or l d e it is both a staging based on imaging and bio chemical n the reason for that is el d e level is such a strong prognostic indicator of survival in addition to m staging a higher el d h levels ten to reflect more acidity which we talked about why that is problematic tends to reflect faster growing tumors higher turn over higher metabolic activity m one a on me se if i can remember this m one as r cancers that have metastosized to am surrounding soft tissue or soft tissue anywhere in the body anywhere else on the skin and you might think while that is kind of crazy how does that happen and it is really bazard you can have a patient who had a melanoma that showed up in one part of their body and then they have metastisies on other parts of their skin m one b is and iways get b in c confused i think b is the lung m on b is to the lung m on c is to any internal organ liver it etera an m one d is to the sianess and as those numbers increase as those letters increase the prognosis gets lower and lower and lower one of the first things i lways look at when i look at a paper this is tell me about the patient population what what was the am you knw what was the break down of patience and in table one that is again in clinical papers this table one is always always always baseline characteristics ioh i should mention one other thing andrew this was done as a three to one to one randomization again in the simplest form a the study would have two groups right you would have am rganna just have a treatmen group an a placebo group but in this arm you had three groups with one of them being the placebo the placebo got just g p one hundred which is just a cancer vaxine by the way this is a cancervaxine that never showed any efficacy it was a cancervac cine that had been tested both with interlucan two diractly and am as an agovent for patients who had metaestatic melanoma ris or had surry not mentacsthat nonom who had melanoma resected who were tomer free and then given the vacine as aguvents to ce did that have an effect on outcomes and it did notso it is cune of them known placebo you had that group then you had the anti c tela four group and then you had anti c tele for plus g p one hundred it as racional for the three to one to one it is basically it increasees the tistical power right in this total study was a little under seven hundred people they put four hundred in the anti c tele for plus g p one hundred group and then little over a hundred and thirty in each of the other two groups you are always can be able to make these two comparisons right what you can check by doing this is is there any effect of g p one hundred in this setting which had never been done before again g p one hundred is a known protine expressed by melanoma and all of these people were hapletyped to make sure that their amune system would recognize it and the question was would giving people anti c tily for i e taking the breaks off their amune system whither without g p one hundred make a difference cund of going through this you can see it sort of skus about sixty per cent to forty per cent male to female they talk about something called the ecog performance status that refers to how healthy a patient is coming in e cog zero is no limitations whatsoever which is kund of amazing when you really consider something i think this speaks to just how devastating this diseases these are patients who all have six months to live right a year macx and yet look at this fifty eight to sixty per cent of them have no limitation on their quality of life at this very moment that is going to change dramatically am it absent a kure here and then ecog one has some limitatioen and you can see that ecog one plus ecog zero is basically ninety eight per cent of the population you can see the staging there again very very few of these patients are the m zero category m zeros are people who have stage three disease that is aggressive at cannot be resected that is about one per cent but the majority of these people are the m inas m on dbs m one cs these are people with very aggressive cancers you can also see that about ten to fifteen percent of these people also have cans metastases again the poorest prognosis of the poor and then you can see the about forty per cent of them have the l d h level above cut off all of this is to say were talking about a group of patients who have am you knw a very high likelihood of not surviving more than a year it would be very ou know unlikely that that many these patiens would survive more than youre bat basically more than seventy percent of these people have viceral matastases a a third have hioldy ah and ten more than ten per cent have brainmets the have also all progressed through standard therapy am radiation kimo ye ea and the kemo for for for malanoma can b kind of atoxic kimo that that really just does not really do anything is it commonplace to use a treatment that failed in clinical trials as a placebo in these sorts of studies ye it is interesting think you are fring oways do the g p one hundred and i think the thinking was o k it has not been effective in other treatments for example when combined with iel to or as an agivent but never before has it been tried with a check point in hibiter which is the technical term for this type of drug im i think there was also some belief that it would be easier to enroll patients i do not think they stated this but that is offen the case it would be easier to enroll patients if they would know that even in the plucy boarm they are still getting an active agent got it and i suppose there is always the possibility that the commination of the a failed drug with a new drug would work and then you are increase in the probability for novel discovery for sure and again if you go back to the ranimization of three to one to one it is really only one fifth or twenty per cent of the participents that would get just the g p one hundred another is your basically telling people when they come into this study there is an eighty per cent chance you are going to get ant c tla for that is a much better set of odds than you kow you are typical study where youre gingto be fifty per cent likely to get the a agent of interest writing people who are literally dying of cancer that they il they do not want to be in the control group right that't rent the primary outcome for this study actually changed in the study now they have to get permission to do that nam but the the original primary en point was the best over all response rate il have to explain how responserates are measured this is this is a bit complicated remember all these patients by definition have measurable visible cancer by visible either on the surface of their body but more likely on an amarir c t skin all these patients had to be scanned had to toe within twelve weeks of enrolment a again there is another thing i should point out here which i know you understand but it is always worth reminding people when a study this takes place it usually takes place over many years an it is not the case that all seven hundred of these patients were unrolld on the same day and finished we finished observing them on the same day knownwn o this took place for a very long predotime this took place a cross tens of centers a i cant memer if this was just globalier across the world it might have been a cross the world am an every center really needs to adhere to a very strict protocol you have a central organization that is running this you have a drug company i think this is bristar mot bristol miresquib that makes the drug they provide the drug and then you have a c aroic crinical research organization that that is basically managing the trial and the trial is being done at cancer centers all over the world or all over the country and en rollman i think began in two thousand eight for this nono i thnk it completed in two thousand ate it probably started in about two thousand four two thousand five and therefore you had to kind of have real clear protocals are on the complete response is the easier of these two understand a complete response is everything vanishes completely that is very rare in cancer therapy instead what we kind oe look for is a partial response a partial response and there ares really different ways tho define this their ifferent criteria but this is the most common way you define a partial response a partial response is at least of fifty per cent reduction by diameter cause remember in this time imaging your looking at tu d verses three d if you are looking at a long lesion in its this big at hat youn of it is two centimeters long it has to go to at least one cenimeter in diameter it is a fifty per cent reduction at least of every csingle lesion with no new lesions appearing and no lesions growing 's very strict criteria right again c r means everything vanishes p r means at least a fifty per cent by diameter which by the way is a much bigger diameter much bigger reduction terms a tumor volume when you consider the linear verses the third power relationship of length an volume of every single legion with nothing new appearing regardless of how small and no legion growing that is a p ar you basically have no response progression you maght be talk about those together and then partial response in complete response initially the the authors of this study were going to the primary and poing of this was going to be the best overall responserate what was the proportion of patients that hit p ar what was the proportion that hit a c ar a that is very common in this type of paper where the outcomes are typically dire am however oh i think i said i think i said that the study was a id i do not rmember when the study ended but the amendment was made to change thet primary end point to overall survival am it at at some point during the study and by the way that is tends to be the metric everybody cares most about the overall survival for medestatic melanoma is zero am with the exception of people who respond to interlucan to hydos interlucan to and that will boost the overall survival rate to some are between eight and ten per cent very very low these patients many of whom had already taken and progressed through interlucan too let me refresh my memory on what percentage of those patients about a quarter of these patients had already taken hydos interlucan too and by definition the fact that there in the study means they had already progressed through that that treatment had failed just reiterate just count of the state these patient serein now let us look at figure one gan a'll describe it because i realize many people are just listening to us all this ill be available both in the vidio and then will link to the paper figure one is a o figure that probably looks really familiar to people who look at any data that deal with survival it is called a caplin mire survival curve on the ex axis for this curve is time and time here is shown in months and on the why axis is the overall survival the very top a hundred per cent at the bottom zero per cent and it has three grafts or three curves that are superimposed on one another for each of the three groups again the control group which is the g p one hundred the a anti c tl a four group by itself and the anti c tli for plus g p one hundred and one of the characteristics of a caplin mire curve is by definition they have to be decreasing in a monatonic fashion because it is cumulative over all survival that just means it cannot come down and go back up nobody comes back to life once a pers an dies they are censered from the study and the curve drops and drops and drops and you can see that they kind of highlight and i actually think it makes the graff a little harder to read when they when they put some of those marks on there but what really becomes clear when you look at this is that there is a key t there is a clear distinction between the curve for the plicebo group that ye pee one hundred group and the other two the two treatment groups now you will note at the very end that the two treatment groups appear to separate a little bit i'll talk about that in a second when i look at these andrew i the first thing i always turn my attention to i cannot resist i have to look at the right hand side of the grafh cause what is that really telling me writ the tail of this is showing me the true over all survival and i want a sort of figure out what is going on in the gipe one hundred group which is the placebo group it is kind of amazing to think that there is still one person who is alive at forty four months it is it is amazing i mean it is both sobering and amazing that one person made it to forty four months the next thing i ask myself is well how long did half of the people make it that is called medium survival and to do that you go up to the wy axis and you draw a little line from the fifty over and then you bring that down and and that is that is that is that is awfully low hat's about ya in fact the table well tell us exactly what that is cause i think it is really hard to eeball that stuff let us go to there is always a table that will accompany these things and let us pull up that table ve got this paper spread out over many things that is adverse ovens were's our survival table you are two sebrupenalysis of real survival ud pry be helpful if i staple these things together hswe will thit is always a trade off actilly for since itis a journal club episod ii well say that stabling helps but it also prevents one from separating things out writing in the margi ye li these little mineclipse ye you will financial relationship to the mean eclips either a just hu to tate as i was if you do not say that people go you must have a stake in these man eclips the lac liztle monyclips in fact i'm such a nerve i always have one of these a pilot the five thee sevens in my pock on my pocket of my hip and then that my pockets are always filled with with these limineclips and u then again i've a friend who is a musician ees that and he is always raining guitarpick eu nots in as far as occupational hazards go of being a narried no i's lang i clips ia pi if and of the manycleas nol yet i i went without it to day i right thank you yes table to right let us look at table to while looking at the caplin mire curve jus now this allows us to seek uple things by the way member how i said there is that one per son who kind of is still alive in the treatment group well you can tell that he is not a complete responder here she is not a complete responder because i'm under valuation of therapy in table too it' says best over all response and it says complete responders zero there wis zero complete responders in the plicibo there were two partial responders again a partial responder is i'm some lesions got smaller some got bigger stable disease is it did not really change that much an progressive disease is obviously it i it went beyond non i von you say partial response al lesions got smhaer they literally just tracing the the circonference of one of these smo skin lesions an young o ge got begger go youd literallate had rulersin wor philology yet ye i'm yes this feel crude i turts i mean o makes till sense but in terms o modern medicine o your lesion groupfrom three millineers to six millineters an it merelirely drawing lill boundaries around lll blotches on the skan ya your you are putting a little measuring tape on them now again most of these are happening in the radiology sweet cause most of the disease for tese patients is inside the body member more than seventy percent of these patients had viceral matasteses liver soft tissue a long brain these are in fact if you include long liver brain and vicera it is ver it is all ll pretmach all the patients most of this is looking at a c t scanter an am our eye for the brain got it im o case that is that is kone of the first thing that comes up the median response rate should should be shown pretty prominently here i'm looking through this and tetetetete where is median response maybe it is shown in a different table wut' see not disease control rate time to progression i remember it is about ten months but maybe that is just in the text yep here it is i thought this would be in a table but it is it is on page seven fifteen of the paper it just reports it an i'm sorry i mispoke i'm the ten months was for the ant c tal a four plus g p one hundred an six point four months for the gp one hundred alone that is the control and then ten point one for the anti c tila for alone ok again iways anigat i'm just always doing this i'm goning going back to the paper to be tas i make sense and yet you conat called it right you said median survival was about eight while it turns out it is actually sixon change because cause it has that little ding in it and it is out to a little past ten on the two others the net take away here is again just to put that in english cause it is prof ound fifty per cent of the patients in the control group we are dead in six months fifty per cent of the patients in the treatment group both treatment groups were dead in ten months what that means in cancer speak is these drugs extended median survival by four months now that is our that is an important concept when we think about how his cancertherape changed over the past fifty years median survival for medastatic cancer has increased across the board a person to day with medastatic callorecto cancer or woman to day with medastatic brest cancer or person with medastatic lung cancer these people will live longer with those diseases to day thanks mostly two treatments this is not an early detection lead time by us issue this is treatments are allowing people to live longer and that is an important part of the story but it is only half of the story yet it often gets towted as the story the other half of the story and frankly the story that i think is more important is what is over all survival doing and if you go back to those cancers the answer is zero over all survival has not changed for solid epithelial tumers it is it was zero per cent in nineteen seventy and its zero per cent today everyone dies every one dies from medastatic solid organ tumers now ghen there is those there is those nich examples i gave you testicular cancer is now an exception am geistromal tumers would be an exception and i'm not including luchemias and plotinl and lumphomas were now there are exceptions get within not to try ye overthe optimistic but if i look at the grath in figure one and i look out at the tail of the graph that is right am and for those eyre just listening what i see and and 'm far less far less familiar with this type of work in this analyzing these type of day but what i see is that people in the plecebo group they are all dead except that one the basically all dead at forty four months youbut when i look at the number how long it takes for every one to be dead in the tru treatment groups lik fifty looks likefifty three fifty four months ell and theyre and they are not debd that is the point they are hanging in there right because an extra somebody who lost both of my a scientific advisers two of the three the other one th suicide we have talked about this before but the other at to to different cancers both at the braccatumutation by the way am an extra eight to ten months with your kids or with your spause or to quotuncle get your affairs in order is is a big deal i mant still to p ressing the sense that nobody survives long term but a youknow an extra ten months as long as one is not miserable in that time completely miserable that is i exter ten months a living well and and what is interesting here is the observation period stops and some of these patients are still going what your highlighting is count of the point i want to make which is over all survival is the most important metric and it is the highest bar make no mistake about it and it is certainly not the bar any drug company is ever going to want a talk about for a cancer drug but why not because because they do not none of the work right we do not have dour only want to talk about cures they do not want they ony wist talk about mediun srvival they want ot they only want o talk about extending medium survival and there are you lots of people out there that are on this on this platform i do not need to get on to it but who will say look it is a real racket ank in oncology to day where drugs that are extending medium survival by four weeks our being put on the market at a tune of fifty to a hundred thousand dollars per treatment that is not oncommen in oncology there was one drug that was a prove for pankratic cancer i believe it extendin medium survival by nine days and it cost forty thousand dollarsand's being advertise as it significant yes exten as it was tat it was tis sissicial significant improvement in medum surviva just am it is on e look it is really understandable why people are very sceptical of the farma industry and and i think a much more new wants view is necessary clearly i do not think farma is all bad a but i really understand why people lose faith in farma when when these types of product somehow make regulatory approval does insurance cover these kinds of drugs a it can infect it often does it depends on the fda approval of course in the indication am but a lot of times they do right yet there is a socidal cost to these things am but but there is also a patient costright a lot of times insurance does not fully cover it and a patient has to bear the the cost difference and on top of that you alluded to this a second ago which is what if your quality of life is dramatically compromised as a result of this treatment and yes statistically you areging to live nine days longer or three weeks longer but at what cost to your health in those final remaining days and by the way your potentially strattling your loved ones with enormous debt a in your absence it is it is a supercomplicated topic and there is a dignity component too i may have seen this in people dying it some point they would become such a a diminish version of their former selves that they do not want to be seen by people that way what is exciting about this drug although it is this paper is not the one that shows it the reason i chose this paper andrew is because it was the first approval a second drug came along that is an ant p d one drug that drug is called k truda that drug turned out to be even better and had has even a greater response rate both in terms of mediun survival and over all survival but this was the landmark paper i also have a slight bias here with an i'll disclose in a moment why am but but i think it just talks about very interesting biology let us talk about a couple things that stook stuck out to me in this paper the first thing that' stuck out to me and the authors did not comment on it unless they did and i missed it is look at figure too figure too is the sub group analyses where you are sort of showing a similar graft to the one you showed earlier right where you you showed the response rate or the change in response between the groups and then you put the eror bars on it and this is where we talk about how wele it is a ninety five per cent confidence intervalso does it touch the unity line these are called tornado plots typically and whit you will notice is that in the top youre looking at am sort of a cit is gets comparing the anti c tala for wi g p one hundred verses the g p one hundred and in the bottom you are looking at the ant c tila forvers the g p one hundred at a glance you can see g p one hundred is not doing anything ammn that is that is the first take away of comparing ato be what i find most interesting is look at the sub group analysis of females notice that in females while there is a trend towards risk reduction and this is risk roduction for over all mortality soi can i just whone a re state that the primary upcome of this trial was changed to over all survival which i think it is the better outgome by the way and over all for all patience in when you compare anti c tila for plus plucebo verses placebo there was a thirty one per cent risk reduction in over all mortality that is what that is that is the mathematical interpretation of what you are seeing at the tale end of that caplin myor serve living longer living longer it is it it sounds a big difference and in somes tinbigous rsintit isabe wellie it is for those people because you are really looking at basicly zero per cent surviving in the plucebo group verse is twenty per cent of people are still alive at fifty six months in the treatment group but look that means eighty per cent have died but notice that an an an ensary when you just look at the ant c tila for plusg p one hundred in the sub group b that hazard ratios even showing more compression it is a thirty six per cent reduction in risk of death but notice that the females did not read h significance in the in the first group they barely do and you can see that because the confidence intervall runs from point five five to point nine two and notice the arabare almost touches the line and in the second one it does not reach significance at all actully went and connected a little reading on this after and i said hey how much did this study wath this an outlier study and it turned out it was not a an that about half the studies of antictiole for did indeed find that the drug was less effective in women than men chi found intersting now could not find any great explanation for it but the most plausible explanations fit into two categories the first are maybe there are differences in the immune response to the drug if youre men ore women the second a comes down to dosing i should have said this at the outset be course these drugs are not a pill where it is everybody gets fifty melegrams of this they are all dose based on wait this study is dosed i believe it three melegrams per kilegram and because most men are heavier than women men are getting a higher dose than women and wait and body surface aria and immune system these things are not all perfectly linear i i i kind of wonder if this difference is simply explained by men on average getting a higher dose than women interesting last thing i want to talk about here is in table three table three always an important table to look at in any paper is what are the adverse outcomes right wherd the adverse effects of the drug yei spend asvenalova time with this and i i confess it it yo i deuffllyg do not want cancer to the sent that i can avoid it but this table made me wonder whether or not i would also want to distavoid cancer treatment given the life extension provided i'm in these adverse events are pretty uncomfortable the atoumost just o wa just to put in perspective a and youalways have to cont of be mindful of how many of these adverse events are occurring in people just because their disease is progressing the first thing i was won to look at is total adverse events in all three groups not just great great three and grate four are real toxicities right great fortoxicity is threatening toxicity by the way a great three is pretty significant toxisty great one in two we typically just that is not that severe rent little rash put some corticusterods on it it went away cunnothing o in the a treatment pluscy p one hundred group ninety eight point four per cent of people reported some event all but one point six per cent in the ant c tily four group alone it was ninety six point seven percent only three point one per cent did not but in the plociba group it is ninety seven per cent there is morden to keep in mind on't no everybody's having some adverse effect okat well what if you say will let us just limit it to the most severe events well let us just talk about grad four tocicities there were six point one per cent of those in the placibo group eight point four per cent in the anti c tily four group and six point eight per cent in the combined group not a huge differencs in great four toccicity meaning that whatever adverse events er occurring may not be related to they may not be related to the treatment the begain these are if you you think about it and it is a very awful sad morbid thought to imagine these are you are looking at the adverse responses of people more than eighty per cent of whom died during the course of a very very short study and it is very difficult to disentangle what effects or what side affects a person is having just from that process as they are from the actual treatment but if there is an area where there is a really clear difference it is down in the automomune category if you look at any immune related events you can see that in the anti c tily four plus gp one hundred group t's about sixty per cent in both of those treatment groups verses thirty per cent and if you look at the grade three and four toccicities it is ten per cent in the a anti c til four fifteen per cent in the i'm anti c tily four alone group and only three per cent in the treatment that is our real difference then make cents that people getting this drug plus placibo or just the drug would have automunitious because this is an a meno there it is an a munomodulator in fact what is it doing it is taking the breaks off the immune system but then again the things that they list out per peridus is that a irritationinican ye irritation of the skin a nogh physician but i know that any idis is going to be an inflammaon aoma unfortunately likely a canser sell replication i look at the difference in tat lido i go i mean well yes very or nursory sory look at the gastran testinal differences ye and the vitiligo write three point seven per cent two point three per cent point eight per cent the g i stuff is the most common stuff you are gin to see there that those are those are the really big ones now of course there is diary an there is diaria o aa i there is travellers diarea there is yeno these adiet over the yes an in the arpeople in he mean for diary and then there is cannot relief do anything besides o make trips bacon forts of the bath wel there is there is there is put this way there is in a colitus here is diarhea significant these patients require ivy fluids now what what you do not see here is how many these patientsectual required quartico steroids to reverse the autoumunity a lot of time's what will happen here in these studies or with these drugs is the automumunity becomes significant that you have to stop the drug and give cartico steroids do the exact opposite you now hawe to shut the immune system down she just took the brakes off it with the drug and now you need to shut it down with cortico steroids m when i was with ian mno when i was in my a fellowship am i wrote a paper about am autoumunity correlating with response rate in antic til a for a early on this was during the phase to work a unis the end c i was a very early am aa adoptor of a participating in these trials and am you do not it was observed that or at least hypothesize this what the paper basically wrote about which was is there any correlation between automunity and response a and it turned out the answer was yes r was a very strong correlation there was no difference in autoummunity between the doses and the the paper we wrote was two dosing schedual t was pasily the fulldose the three melegrams per kilegram versas a lodose one melegram per kilegramas te fase two trial those rear two arms there turned out to be no difference in autoumunity between them but there was a big difference between am a the response rate that tied to autoummunity in other words utoummunity predicted response now i think over time these a investigators the doctors who ad ministr the treatments are getting better and better at catching these things earlier because these autoumune conditions a connectily be devastating on a very personal note when citruda a came out i want to say it was around two thousand a lev nonanogosh it must have been two thousand thirteen two thousand fourteen thereabouts am again it was for treatment of metestatic malanoma i want to come back and explain why malonoma gets all of the attention in autoumune condition an inam a emunotheropy conditions i'll state that but am but anyway a friend of mine got pankratic cancer and he got a the bad type of pankratic cancer this is a an an the a a i had no carsonom on the pankris thes this is a a nonsurvivable type of cancer furthermore his was unresectable you must on wit that is yes o the on aabout twenty percent of people who have pankratic cancer technically have it in a way where you could still take out the head of the pankrer the whipple proceda whipple procedure am now tragically most of those patients will still recur my understanding it is that pancriatic cancer progresses from ancerior to posterior in the pankreas and that the whipple is a removal of the front and the anterior that is the whipple procedur if they cancer has progress far enough caudle into the posterior a pankreus then there is nothing left to cut out basically well a me survive without a pankrus for any amount of time oh ye absolutely wilthy just remove the whole pankres oh that is my point it is already micromatasticize it is not that the surgical procedure is not the challenge any more it used to be at john's hopkins which is one of the hospitals where this was pioneered the the thirty day mortality for whipple procedure was i do not know eighty per cent and the reason was to figure out how to suitur a pankreus to the bowel without the sucs the pankres is such an awful organ to operate on because it is ensimes are designe to digest anything in everything imagine now you have to cut the pankreus in half take out the head of the pankreus with the duidenum and then somehow that open half of a ro pankreus up to the end of the jujunum and not let it digest itself one at hopkins figure the sel i'm now the first one was actually done by a o whipple but yes at hopkins is ware they figured out the way to put drains in the srgical technique how to do it in two layers what type of stitches to use all of the new ants is of this were worked out in a few places but i would say hopkins more than any placelf and are ther physicians you try this unnon human primates or something as this always just done on patients ind well nowadays i mean put it this way even twenty five years ago at a at i at a major center hopkins the the mortality of that procedure was less than one per cent amazing ye ito havit in some victories well yes but here is my point it that that is no longer the bottle neck right taking out the pankrea safely as complicated and challenging as that is and if you need a whipp procedure you only one have it done by some one who just does that night and day cause it is you do not want we can warriors doing it that is not why people are living or dying the're dying because the panthing the cancer just comes back it was already spread to the liver by the time you did it you just did not realize it yet whether you took out the whole pankreus or the head of the pankris of the tail of the pankreus the location of the tumor is predictive of survival only in the extent that it basically is a window in to how soon did symptoms occur pankratic cancers in the tail tend to be more fatal even though their way easier surgically to take out because by the time you develop symptoms of a tail pankreus cancer it is it is a big cancer si was going tos this question later but i'll just ask it now given the link between the imian system and these cancers is there an idea in mind that people who are let us say forty and older or fifty an older who do not et they are not diagnose with any cancer would periotically jostimulate ther mun system to wipe out whatever eally cancers might be cropping up just take a drog to just ramp up the imion system even to the point where you start av itll diarhea m if you skin rash is and then come off the drog just basicly did to fight back whatever littld sell growths are string to take place in skin or liver or eno maybe for youn three weeks out of each year i mean why not ythat is nesin question i'm ii'v never thought of it through that lends i suppose the question is what can we do to keep ar imune systems as healthy as possible as we age bes head on a normal circadeanscaduel yhere is elidence for that sure anow ther's evidence at certainly if it promote sleep anything that promotes better rest is going to promote immun health i'm because if you ask the mackero question which is why does the prevalence of cancer increase dramatically with age i'm there ware certain diseases where it is really obvious why the prevalence of the disease increases with age yet mat a agerely immacular degeneration sure or cardy ov ask ther disease is by far the most obvious because it is an area under the curve exposure problem the more exposure to approtines and the more the endo theel get's damage the more likely you are to accumulate placken it gen it totally make sense why ten year olds do not have heart attacks and eighty year olds do but when you sort of acknowledge that will hay cannot you n anybody's a cue accumulating genetic mutations were always surrounded in being bombarded by things that are altering the genum of ourselves is it simply a stacastic process where the longer you live the more of these mutations you can recur until it is some point one of them just wins i i i think that is got to be a big part of it but i think another part of it and i clerely a modeloin thinking this is that armune systems getting weaker and weaker as we age right i mean we people become more susceptible to infections as they get older iand i think that that is equally playing a role in oure susceptibility to cancer yet i think the question is how to you modulate immunity i'm as you age and i to me that is one of themost interesting things about rapmise and potentially is that when take in the right way it seems too enhance i'm cellular immunity which again that that is potentially are really big deal yet at least in in short term human experiments in response to vaxcination it is enhancing vaxine response the question is with that translate into cancer nobody knows could that be one of the reasons why animals treated with rapamise and live longer and get less cancer do not know you knwt you could also be that it is it is it is at a fundamental level that is targeting nutriancensing i'm where is going with that story was that maybeill back up for a moment why melanoma s o we did not really know this thirty forty years ago in the early days of ammunotherapy but what we know now is that most cancers probably have about forty mutations in them that is balpark forty fifty mutations is standard fair for a cancer but melanoma happens to be one f the cancers that has many many more mutations and the more mutations a cancer has the more likelihood that it will produce an antigon that is recognized as nonself and that is why in the early days of amunotherapy the only things that worked were il to against metastetic melanoma in kidney cancer because kinnecancer turned out to also be one of those cancers that for reasons that are not clear produced hundreds of mutations and it is no surprise that the early studies of check point in hibiters were also done in metaestetic melanoma where ubasically have more shots on goll again if i'm going to take the breaks off my amune system i might as well do it in an environment where there are more chances for my tea cells to find something to go nuts agains it is two thousand thirteen two thousand fourteen and this friend of mine who has something called lynch cyndrum am which is a one of those few hereditary or germaline mutations that results in a huge increase in the risk of cancer he had already had colan cancer aabout the age of forty am and had survived that as a stage three cancer but he had survived it well now five years later had developed a pankratic cancr and when he went to see the surgeon am they said yet we nothing we can do it is two advanced that is un to put that in perspective that is a death sentence and that is not a that that is a that is a six month survival and at around that time there was a study that had come out in the new england jernal medicin that had talked about how patients with lynch cyndrum had lots of mutations and we talked with his doctors about the possibility of enrolling him in one of the kitruda trials there is one going on i think it stanford and the thinking being well you would want a target a check point in hibiter against somebody who has a lot of mutations and even though typically we do not see that in pankratic cancer his is a unique variant of it because it is based on this and sure enough he was tested for these miss matchropargines he had them and rolled in the trial and amazingly had not only a complete regression of his cancer and he still alive in cancer free today ten years later but this the these the treatment worked well at activating his immune system that his emune system completely destroyed his pankreus now he is effectively had a pankreateck to me ased on his amune systems and now he ectualy has typ on diabeti's is no pankarious lon jacksonsolentyon with them or know he none of he has to use insilem just some i iatipic being alive with ty on diabedis ot of course no comparison but i's just an interesting example of how remarkable this treatment was able to work when you were you now you could completely unleash the immune system of a person and you eradicate the cancer and the rest of the cells around it and and there are many organs we could live without there are certain organs you cannot live withour i cannot live about your heart lungs liver kidney's but but many things that kill people arise from organs the breast you could live without all breast tissuosity prosstat you live about all nonly tich would choose to o to live without these ut rigt bet em saying if you if if you had medastatic cancer and you had a bullet that could selectively target a tissue you would take it and right now the only tissue we culd do that against is a seedy nineteen b cell that is what those car tea cells are right now these are not tissue specific treatments but theire mutation specific what the last thingil sipe of this paper that i found interesting and i i was looking for it and i was surprised they did not at all comment on if there was any correlation between autoumunity in response i'm they ogusy acknowledge the autoomunity in in table three but i would have love to have seen a statistical analysis that said hey is there any correlation between responsorate and automunity but that they did not comment to that effect we are left ten of wondering what the current state of that is and i guess insummery i'll say that the reason i thought this was an interesting paper to present is that i still believe that imunopherapy is probably the most important hope we have for treating cancer and well i think we are still only scratching the surface of it collectively the overall survival increase for patiente with metestatic solid organ tumors is about eight per cent better than it was fifty years ago and virtually all of that has come from some form of immuinotherapy i think is promising and i think the holy gral is that it meaning the next step if you go back to where we started the discussion is coming up with ways to engineer tea cells to be even better recognizers of antigeons and there is many ways to do that one is to directly engineer them another is to find tea cells that have already migrated into tumors those are called tumor infultrating lemphasites ar till and expanding tose and engineering them to be better and younger is it possible to engineer our own t cells to be more ph veryt tolerant meaning am since this cloaking of the of a local area by changing the p h can could we pullsome tea cells i'm umoisting about the innoculation steff pullsome tea cells as part of our standard examne were thirty and and grow some up in environment that the p hs is slightly more acitic then then normal and then reintroduce them to the body aan after all they are our tea cells in other words give them a opportunity to evolve that the conditions they can thry then or even just keep them in the freezer in case yessoso the interesting thing is i do not know that if you just got them to be comfortable in a lower p h it would be sufficient because there are still many other things that the a cancer is doing as far as using other secreting factors it seems that by farthe most potent thing comes down to expanding the number of ta cells that recognize the antigen and making sure that you can get that number big enough without aging them too much in some senses it has become a long gevity problem of tea cells the way to think about it is you want an army of soldiers who are wise enough to recognize the badgize which comes with age but young enough to go and kill and right now both extremes seem to be unhelpful right when you go and find tumor inful trading lemphasites in a tumor they are very wise they know which one they have demonstrate that they can do everything they can outmaneuver the cancer but they are too old to do anything about it and when you take them out to try to expand them by three logs which is topically whathm to do expand them by a thousandfold they cannot do anything ot it and what about avoiding melonoma altogether i man obviousy a voiding sunburn i somehow i got couched as anti sunscreen and that is absolutely not true i i said som sunscreens contain things that are clearly immundisrup a endicranscevs me disruptors and we aregoing to hole episode on sunscreen may we could do itsome dr it is quit i oing i'm i'm mexy a planting something amout as well i yet i mean enisome dermatologist reached out am some very very skilled dermatologist reached out and said that indeed some sunscreens are downright dangerous but of course melanoma is superdangerous physical barrer no one disputes physical barriers for sunscring right everyone heverone agrees that that is unlikely to have endigran disruption physical barriers are undisputed but aside from limiting a somelight exposure to the skin u what are some other risks for melonoma i mean i think that is the biggest one i do not believe that smoking poses a risk for melonoman if it does it is can be very small im there are hereditary cases one needs to be pretty mindful when taking a family history and by the way there are really weird genet ic i'm conditions that link melanoma to other cancers such as pankratic cancer by the way whenever i'm taken somebody is family history and i hear about somebody that had melanoma and some of that had pankratic cancer i'm there is a couple genetics agjenectes will look at to to see if that is a person at's particularly sensitive just and a from a genetic predisposition i'm but i do think that first and foremost it is and by the way i think with melanoma the although it is not completely agreed upon i think it is less about sun exposure and more about sun burn right and again i'm sure there somebody listening this who will chiman and an apply a more new antsd respons to that im but but i think there is a there is a fundamental difference between amount in the sun getting sun making some vite him ind verses i'm getting scorched and under undergoing significant u v damage there might also be something to be said for the time in one's life and i've i certainly seen things that suggest that early early repeated sun burns would be more of a risk i'm look i i think that is not a controversial point in the sense that who wants to be sunburnd right se's whatever one needs to do to be sunburn whether it is you knowt being mindful of what the u v indeck is wearing the appropriate cover wearing the appropriate sunscreen im i also find the whole a kind of anti sn screen establishment to be a little bit add o the anti suns creen establishmen is odd ye i'm china open the door for a newaunt's discussion about yound the fact that som suns creen's really do contain lings ike ox of benzines and things that are real a ye when yu we atin you sprang am on kids and ye we know just look at the strait of the good old fashioned mineral sun screen yes a perfectly safe ya ya sfar as we know i i also a dare we i cross the sedoil debate into this some of the folks who are really ant i see toil also claim that see toils increase risk for sunscreen i peter and ir are smiling because we we have teed up a a debate soon with some anti s doil and less anti s doil a experts that that is forthcoming that is can be a fun one i will be doing all that with our shirts on i really appreciate you walking us through this paper peter i've never looked at a paper on cancer im an certainly not one this im i learned a lot and im it is such an interesting feeld ivisly because of the importance of getting people with caner to survive longer and lea better lives but also i'm because of the the interaction with the imiun system swe learnd some really important imenology ye and this was this was great ie i i feel much more confident now in the a belief that the the exposure to light early and late in the day connectually have have benefits ann an another said i think that there is i think there is there is some caus olty here and i think it should not be ignored well this was our second journal club i look ford to our third nex't time you will goh first wirl just keep

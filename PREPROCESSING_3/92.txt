let us talk about how all this happen it happen because we in the west do not understand our enemies and they know that and they exploit tath into thousan for president george shtallby bush gave an address at the united nations in which he said one of the most naive things any president has ever said he said thir's a direct quote when it comes to the desire for liberity and justice there is no clash of civilizations people everywhere a capable of freedom and worthy of freedom the desire for freedom it resides in every human heart direct quote from george daly bushy thousand for that was idiocy then and it is idiocy now it is simply not true people have many different priorities for lot of people their priority is not freedom western notians of freedom it is adherence to fundamentalist interpretation of coranic law for many their priority is not economic development it is belief in the murder of jews across the world but this peculiar western belief system that everyone wants freedom has led the west down two separate and equally stupid paths path number one which we saw over the course of e last twenty five years was nation building that is what happend in afganistan and rock the west fooled itself into believing that tribal peoples with different priorities really really wanted i phones and sectual liberation and that if we al fered those things theywofld welcome us with open arms instead of pursuing a realistic form policy designed to protect america's interests we launched off into ou a utopian world of our own making and we failed yet we continue to pursue that path to day we continue to act as though for example it is israel's job to build up the infor structure ind gozo provide them water and power even whilecommoss murders babies in their cribs and put it is own civilians in harm's way that is ridiculous an it is going to faile path number two was the path of wilful ignorance heu see if we all have the same priorities we can negotiate with any one in everyone in fact every one is reasonable everyone wants the same thing even if thingis get a little at a hand from time to time even if a couple we s a year rock as fly from gaza into tell of eve it' just the frustration of reasonable people with reasonable priorities ands just all a sychal of violence this path leads to failure and massdath it lulls the west including israel into a false sense of security people who have different priorities monsters camoss take in manage sodowon a show you a tapit is been releast on our tea which is the russian propaganta channel it is an interview with senior comoss official olle beroka just happen over the course the lasst forty eight hours he explains everything that just happens he explains what happene in this mass terrotack the worst terrotacins nine eleven in the west in intelligence failure that is wayworsh than nine eleven by the way he explains everything we need to go througt in details you can see just what a lie we all fell for many americans fell for that everybody has the same priorities and why that big lie is going to get more innocent children women and men murdered raped and burned hure is the tape again this is a senior cmss official on or tea speaking in arabic talking about exactly how comoss perpetrated this massacre were an a stop and startet because we mean to explain exactly what he is saying in detail he is just saying all the quat parts out lout hagma sutal comfirts then fill wol vo on the pastcople of years he says cmmass has adopted a rational approach tit did not going to any war and did not join the aslonicehodnits resen battle ibut all of this was cmmasas strategy in preparing for this attack of course we made them think that comss was busy governing an gaza that it wantd to focus on the two pone five million palicinians in gaza and has abandoned the resistance altogether all the while under the tables commass was preparing four this big attack posit tere for a second o kay let me point out right from the outset he is sayne right from the outset it was a lie we never cared about the two point five million palsinians who are now hearing about living in gaza cause this is this is the game they play on you believing that they care when israel strikes of comss targats and hit is the civilians the commas is deliberately putting in te way then it is israel'sfall bhe ise after all what will kind of human beings would not care of their own babies are getting killed and the enseras commass as far as the notion that comas was ever a reasonable actor israel lulld itself into a sense of complacency about this well sure they' wanch a few rockets everysoff and oul mostly just approve to their own people that their still a terroers croup but in reality they want they want built te normal governing power thaction wanto be a normal governing power that is a lie it is a lie every bit of money that flowed into gaza over the course of last twenty years was used by a comass four purposes of murdering juis all that money was being used by cmass for purposes of murdering jews is continuedat the tape o do not a the be imanm is sas weverinat to now who take these ralys were attack to tell of eve we bomtelleve on the first day the attack doe heu wanto take them to the galiley the northern front with lebanon has opened to day the galliley is no longer safe for the zinest enemy we can bon the galiley from inside occupi palestine thoh in order to keep the attack secret and successful he says the different factions in our allies did not know the zero hour but after half an hour all the palcinian resistance factions we are contacted as for our allies in husbala and arona can posit there for a second they have state sponsorship the turks he says were also notified theyd state sponsorship and state sino from maran from casbela as soon as it was going they they let all the people mup the turks aran casbala those are all parties that have the same exact world priority as kcomass who do not care about ther own citizens and meu just look t what is going on in aron literally everyday of the week look at how lebanon which was once considered a rose in the mddle least has devolved it to complete caos and tyranny he continues yea meeting was held with them three hours later at nine am we hape they did anyone contactat us t even the russian sent a message an inquired he says and they were updated about the situation about the goals of the war soon the russians were brought into the loop it was all plans in other words the most important part of what the senior commas official is saying is the very first part they do not give a good damn about the people in gaza they do not care it was al ll a lie they do not care in fact they say they do not give any 's about their own people they do not they do not care in fact they high staspiration is death now i'm noting that they save that they say tht the sayt out lheld and they assume that you are sophisticated that better than they do what they are thinking in saying they say it right to your face they say directly to your face and then ofe now now it cannot be it just cannot be must be these railifault somehow here is againd senior commas official ali baraka yesterday on our tea saying exactly the priorities hexactly what the priorities are mo ie the es rallies are known to love life he says we on the other hand sacrifice ourselves we consider our dead to be martyrs the thing any palisinian desires the most is to be martyred for the sake of alla defending his land we have bee preparing for this for two years o kay that is enough that is the thing o they right there he just says it and this has been the line bhy the way this the line in all of the ratical is lming fon mentless world thits line for p it is line fors line ch had it is line for commas it is line for cis balla it is lie for a ran they love life we love death is their line that is their line when you say why why do not they care about their kids maybe the way they care about their kids that when their kids die they think that their martyrs they thing they have done something good apparently we do not care about our people is ay way of saying we t we care about their souls you say it is it is a different kind of logic as robert mally might say it is a different kind of thought ceybut in traditional westeron thought the way care byyer kins not by killing them and the way they care by yor citizens i's not by putting them directly in the line of a of an eir strike that you can sit under ground waiting to kill jews but they do not thin'k we do that is the whole points and they know that you will not believe them they know you will not believe that they can say directly to their own people they can say it clearly an tiv over and over and you still will not believe them that is how stupid they think you are and by the way that is how stupid d west is thewest's is stupid that we believe that in the end this can be negotiated with that in the end whatever human rihts atrocityes happen in gaza as the direct result of commas doing what it is doing right now and it is a human rights atrocity to put your headquarters under a hospital itis a human rights atrocity to plant youweapons underneath mosques it is a human right atrocity to put weapon re in schools in kinter gardens which is something homostas but they know that yo will not believethe'redoing it you will not believ thit because it will boggle your mine but you wilt believe that the jews arethe bagies that is what they'r counting on that you will not believe that the jews are the baggis even after the jews get slaughtere in their beds you will believe that if only the jews hat just given a little more only a little now this does betray something else about the west an laten jew hatred that exists across he less because let us be real about this none of this conversation was happening after nine eleven hone a lot of conversation the united states about well when we go in and we bom from thirty thousand feet and we kill load of civilians the real question is the human ri igtes are we being careful enough should it be a short term short tory after you kill three thousand americans what happens we flatten you that is what happens but when israel has it is borders permeated by terrors who murder welve thirteen hundred jews murder thirteen hundred jews in a wiges pret us all lasting ours on end when that happens that is well those jews man that they they really they really got bulale more careful those juws by bly cant they just more capflf only ha given a little bat harter there there is something going on that is simply beyond western ignorancs and it gets in to a ee i something much deeper and darker and by the way everyone bought it everyone on left ta le's bought it and people who said that it was not true those people we are marginalized people said watnn no come s it is true the pausinan authority to they care significantly more about killing juws than the care about the well being of ther own citizens everybody in the lests when no that cannot be true that cannot be tru cure for example is robert malley to robert malley was until we last five minutes the biding negotiator with te ron robert malley it is radical that in two thousand eight berocabona selected him is forein policy adviser to his campaign and youhat to be thrown off of the campaign in two thousand eight be cause whoas holding secret conversations with commoss the is backin two thousand eight s to by eminstrition brought robert malley back in to hold conversations with the ron and then as it turns out robert malley very well may have been effectively a spy for the aroneans here is robert malley coopted by the perspective that everyone is reason while every one is rational that all on the sameside here is robert malley describing come os and has balla just a just a few years ago it is a mistake to only think of them in terms of ther teris voolence the mansion their social political movements probably the most roted movements in their respective societies hom os not a majority among palistonians by any means but very deeply rooted it is been malliou know its it was born in the first te palisonan to father an in the nineteen eigties it has deep royalty it is it has a charity organization of social branch it is not something you can defeet me m hery either and people need to understand that thi much misinformation about thi i i i speak to them i a i college speak to them now we may disagree with them but they have their own rationality that is one thing to understand these ar not none of them are crazies they may do things that we considered to belong to difference ralm o rationality but within they will not sistem it is often very logical ins some very logical you see they they do social work that is come oss sile legitimate people that we can have conversations with this has been the governing philosophy of the west in many parts of the right as well as the west for it the last several decades when it comes to the midlist and whoas all alie it as clearly alie and it is at self flattering li becaus it gives you the offram everbody wants a solution to every problem ti get it ielso want solutions to every problem not every problem has a good and easy solution particularly not a goodan easy solution that involves youe sitting down at table in writing some words intinding a piece of paper it is not a shock therefore their robber malley who is placed on leave earlier this year for a legedly miss hanling classfine material it turns out that huis probably in bed withthe aronians according to the yorc post the bide administrations former special onvoy toron should face extensive scrutiny for his promissive stands toward the taweron regime after it eihted a comasan cusbala an carrying out terris attaxks against israel critic sat on monday represent af derl isaw of california told the yorc post robber malley deserves extensive scrutiny yesterday to day and tomorrow after the walstreturnal reported their ron was implicitly involved by the lacomass again saying theat ron was involved in all this isas said malley and others crated incredibly promissive environment for homas for ron to do all these things that is gibron the ronhav former special advisor honoran at the state department the ronhoss serves under secretary o stay might pompelo under trump said malley and his negotiating teim quot purposefully funnel billions of dollars to aron through lack of sanctions in forcemen and provision of sanctions relief that is given them somewhere between fifty and eighty billion dollars over the last two and a half years alone a senior house republican aid told the new ark post the cash influx fothering even more generous pout of one point seven billion dollars that the aboma administration made to aron intwo thousand sixteen and this all driven again by that myth by that myth that they all think we do we do not understand our enemies and we assume that they actually care about their own people but they do not care about their own people and again this is pervaded the entire left judith butler feminist theorest who forsure would be dead if she lived in commassustan if she lise then th gosastrip judith butler men tossed off a building dacades ago here is judith butler definding comas i think yes understanding maaa sociaomens thetrestis extremeortn that dos noain critical certain a intions men it does not in tomengions i does not stop those of us who are interestin politincs for raising the question whether their other options besids oo again a cacriticalpor engagement an a certainly thin it should be entere into the conversation le there it is judith butler standing for comass and cusballar who ould certainly murderer if she were living in their territory now the reason tat is all ralvin is because all of the narrative in the current midaly situation is going to shift very quickly and s cusshoe very quickly because people go back to their political priors their political priors very often are just oring ented toward the hands off do not care cycl a violen why who am i to take sides i do not know anything that that boo tand people have the blinder strict from their iyesfrge stomomen and the nogo right back to priors because this is what people do since biblical times when god literally spoke to the israelites and then five seconds later thei ar building a golden calf this how peoplelare for just a moment in time clarity strikes them and then the clarity goes awannigll right back to what they wer doing five seconds ago and the way that that is going to take place is your oing to see a bunch of people who express tremendous sympathy for the now thirteen hundred dead jews in israel they are going to a express sympathy for the parents of the burned babyes there can express sympathy for the husbands of the rape wives in the kidnap they are ere gon express sympathy for that and then the entire narrative is going to shift because israel is going to do what it has to do in order to stop commas from ever beig athreat to it citizenry again as any normal nation would yourars turng sin on sotromedia all of the all of the narrative is now shifted toward what is happening in gaza it is terrible ats happening in gaza now the only way to make that shift is if you assume the wit is happening in gaza is now israel's fault as upposed to it is commasses fault now here is how to think about this morally if i burn down your house and murder your children and then i go back to my house and i hide behind my child and the police show up to arrest me or to shoot me and i hide behind my child it is my responsibility that i am hiding behind my child that would be my fault right i would be the evil actor in the cenareo and you would not call off the attempt to arrest or shoot me if i'd burn down your house ind murdered your child you would not no person would it is insane to suggest otherwise but the world is immediately going to shift into that mod now here is the problem comass as the senior commasoficial says they have spent he last two an a half years building up for precisely the cenareo an big question easy question if cmss ad not ben building for the scenaria howrockets still to day five days hafter tese attacks been fired in israel what is that me it means they have an extensive terrana or underground they build is extraordinary tunnel metwork using every bit of cemout they culd find over the less twenty years that was supposed to be used for building infor structure but a gain they are about people living in gaza ans they took all of that and they built a bunch of tunnel systems they are living down there withtheir air conditioning in the generators and meanwhile on the surface theyr telling people not to leave the populated areas that israel is going to have to clear and bond as to prevent this thing from turning into urban warfare that is their gold israel is doing what it has to do what israel is doing militarily speaking is they are clearing the ground they are blowing up all these buildings and they are essentially turning into flat ground and then there can have to go in to the ground invasion nd the can have to smoke ould commass terrase whoare hiding under ground in these tunnels that is what is going on right now and the world is going to instead decide that because commas is literally telling civilians not to leave the areas that they get killed that israel is upposed to call off its attack and leave commasin place leave commass in power which by the way is an impossibility it is the an impossibility on every score the reason its impossibility is to fold one youe simply for reasons of of justice and decency cannot let the peoplewho just murdered your children live you cannot do that and to the way that policy works in the madelease is that every demonstration of military weakness is an encouragement of further violence if commas is still ruling the gazas trip at the end of all of this the chanceis that hesballa is going to launch an invasion from the north at some point are extremely hide the first available opportunity tbecause there will be a sens that israel is valne able israels in vulnerability was its greatest asset and that invulnerability was punctured by a bunch of terrorist rushing through the border and killing babies that is that is what has just happen and israel has to restore that sense of invulnerability in pregnability and military stability that is what israel has to restore here on the gound tha traft to restore the situation at and then to a brater world of radical muslems who wish to murder every jue in thei bed theyaf to restore the idea that if you cross us we will kill you right that that is what israel has to do here and the world is immediately shifting back into cycle of violencemode you can se it happening in rael time and the are doing despite the fact that again every thing that is happening in the gossistrip is the fault of commass everything let me take a quick example right now israel has turned off the water in the power and thy've announced the water and power in the gossi strip are going to remain off until come oss releasis the hundred or hostages that thy are curently holding and alreadyou are starting to heare rumblings from the a welve yet that isn' that collective punishment and the answer is well when comss has honey combed itself into these areas how exactly weh yo expect israel to accomplish its gaels it was not a ware that done after you murder everybody's everybody's children they have an obligation to provide you water and power i's norn of the weird impression tha israel has a moral obligation grater then the governing body of the gosse strip to the gos and citizens to protect them israel's using that responsibility by tlat by actively warning people out of these areas trying to push people out ofthe areas one ofthe reasons for turning off the water and power is because the only people right now in these areas who have water and power of people underground every one else does not hve water and power ot turn off the water and power presumably people will leave becausethy do not have water and they do not have power ance they will leave those areas and everybodywh's underground in the tunnels who does have water an power becuse again they misdirected every piece of money every piece of maturiel into bilding thse terra tunnels those people were made that is the entire strategy but the world is of courses going to shift into to crying israel mode all their military tactictr to all it is too terrible and its a moral equivalents it is the same thing of israel a temps to boma commas headquarters and commashide's mhind ta iled as if commass breaks into israel and then i once again burns entire families in their homes exactly the same thing ad thats what come os is counting on beasy in their counting on the idea that they are you and that you will look at what they are doing tane no one no one would do that known wuld tell their own civilians to stay in harmsway israel has spent the last twenty years building bom shelters s that every time a rock et flies into israel i's eithere shot down by iron dome or people go into he momshelters come ass use that as a tactic that is part of teir tactic here is that israel cares enough about its on citizens that when the rockets star flying isrel does not leave ts on citizens out there isrel sounds the alarms everybody goes into the momshelter and that is when omos broke through the walls tat was the entire tactic what exctly happen what there is an unasked question that i think needs to be asketr people o t israel is cuting off the water i've a question why asn't gos have water real question why'is not gos have water you may have noticed if you live in the united states or any other decent country that if you live in a farflong bilige on a hill somewhere you have water and have power in that weir and how does that happen and the answer is typically speaking it is not wildly expensive to provide water and power it actually is not certainly not for the mount of money that is been flowing into the gosa trip over the course of e last twenty years cares what actually happened with the water and power and gaza commas stole all the money and they let people have undrinkable water not only to they let people have un drinkable water they literally band their own citizens and two thousand fifteen from digging wells to get water because they do not give ach about palistinian civilians they do not care they do not care again there is a there is an underground aquafer in the gasa trip ba comas did not manage the private wells the oklapher was then polluted by overpumping and waste water contamination and again commas was shipped water pipes to rebuild its water infor structure and it suagin for structure what exactly to they do according to t you can telegraph they literally took the pipes that were ments to move potable water in and out of populated areas in suage out an they use them to build rockets this is according ththis is a this a film from the commas military wing and nactie shows them taking pipe thos shipped in in fornaid cutting it up and using it relathing it to make rockets to firer at jews and kill them that is what comastas that is evel on toscourse one the attempt to kill jews obviously but two you care little about your own population thatyou will not give them water to drink will not give them water to drink and then it is israels responsibility you spend last twenty years having money shipped to you to to build water and power in for structure you take all that money use it on guns terror tunnels rockets and then you have the gall to suggest that israel the people you just murdered have a responsibility to provide to yu the water in the power i'm noe need i'm nean explainer on that one here is the vidio by the way from a comas of what they do with the water pipes their shipped into them as aid this acording you ca telegraph thet e help build more than thirty miles water pipe lines for palastinians and then come oss boosted of teir ability to fortun arsenal of home made rockets from water pipes they literlly put out a vidio of them carving up the water pipes werein commas head gear and then they and according to the you ca telegraph brussels tosportofst a hundred million guras into pipe line projects in territories controll by commass over the last ecade and thse are vidioes that commas itself put out of relathing the water pipes into rockets to fire at jews thtis not joish propaganda that 's commas propaganda meanwhile thet use still thinking of sending more aids to these people it is unbelievable it is unbelievable again lick it is not as though that any of this was a secret according to all moniter which is a ut which they left wing organization they say that commas band water wells this back in two thousand twenty one quote palistinians living is rasha abushal all writing know a wright won ju palsinians livig n the border areas of the gosestripp o lion wells to secure drinking water into irrigate their crops as comasron local muni copalities failed to assume their responsibility to supply water to these areas in an august twenty fifth statement the commasifiliated water an environmental quality authority announce to band against the digging of water wells in all gosi governents under the direct pretect of fighting is severe decline in ground water levels and quality do to over exploitation of the aquelfor into which the wells are drilled the authority sed its decision is based on the palistinian water wal number three of two thousand too which prohibits on license to drilling a but there is a problem the authority called on all citizens who already drilled water wells to rectify their legal status in the next three months obtaining a licence but gasands believe the band is designed only to obtain money in exchange for issuing licens for drilling wells in the first place now bills sulton a resident of all gall border area in the northern gosestrip told omoter ib living the area for seven years the halst are not connected to the water supply or suage network we mainly relion drilling wells to obtain water he said the decisuand mean that people die of dehidration these are the by the way according to the deputy head of the palisinian water authority this is two thousand twenty one is theme its matin albana he told almoniter that ter are ten thousand water wells in the gosesrip including three hundred wells for the municipalities twenty seven hundred wells for the agricultural sector and seven thousand private wells the citizens drilled without obtaining a proper perment what are the water sources in gosi quot there are three sources for water in gosip ninety two per cents of the water is secured from the oquepher six per cent is purchased from israel two per cent through sea water desalination inother words they boched the entire water oqualfor process and they stole llmetarial and they used it for mil and now and now when there is a human rits problem becaue there is no enough water there whose falted theseraelies of course of course meanwhile by blat you have notice a lot of talk about palcinian civilians and and the danger that they are in knows that israel which is why again they'v be issuing day after day after day texts and radio radio messages and internet messages telling people to get out and beo likele where they can go well you may notice if you have eyeballs and map that actualy the gosestript has two borders it has a border in the north in t in the east which is with israel and then has a southern border at southern border is with a nother arab moslem country why what what a nice coincidencen and another aeramosem country who must take in its brothers if they wish to preserve their lives ter innicent civilians after all that country is called egypt that country is called egypt and dum i noticed that dum i notice that egypt was asked two providad corridor for civilians and you not to egypt said hiy said canknow were not providing a corridor that is what they said quote is the jerusalem post egypt has discussed plans with the united states and others to provide humanitarianade through its border with gosistrip but rejects any move to set up safe quarters for refugees fleeing the onclave you want to kno why because they are fraid a those civilians are honeycombed with gloss terrace we will then indanger the stability of the egyptian regime why they might think that tbecause let us see palsed inian refugees put in danger the stability of the gernanian regime which resulted in blacks sop tember in the nineteen seventies in the expulsion of tens of thousands of paus inians from there they then completely reck the regime and lebanon turning again at stable christian rolld country in to a disaster trasheap they have completely taken over the gasa trip and recket it this would be the the pialo followed by comas and egyp is od kno we are not interested according according to the international community increasingly the way this works is that the people who are responsible for every aspect of arab muslim security in the gasas trip are the jews who just got murdered by comass that is the logic here that is that be cut and why would not they be because after all are not we all the same types of people are not we all the same types of people i've just to point out at this point once more no we are not no man who says we are not the commanders of comass here is commass commander macmudallsa har this is two thousand to explaining the goals of comss o this te te theehdation wer werwer when we sutd ou about the army of jerusalem the battle of the promis of the hereafter we are not talking out liberating our land alone he says we believe in what our propet mahometsad w you olo drough the ends of the world a near one another for my sake and i have seen it is easter and western ans ethe da miniong of my nation would reach of those ends they have been drawn near me ab e the entire five hundred ten millions square colometers of planed earth ou will come onderay system where there is no in justice yuw no oppression no treachery nosinism no treacherous christianity and kno killings and crimes those being committed wesho aagainst the palc inians and against the arabs in all arab country us in lebanon syria arrive and other countries are they being un clear i'm just confused but theyre you rober malley says that they have their own system of logip they are just you meanwhile theyre they are screaming in your face that they are not you they do not give a crap about their own children they keep saying gosas hafket that is true what you do its your population is tafketsyou do not stack your kids on top of the terror tunnels you do not hide your rockets inside hospitals that is exactly what they are doing you do not deprive those people of water and power on your own you you ard the municipal authority this was your actual jop for twenty years and then star a terror war that results in retaliation in which the water and power ar not available to anyone except the fighters living underground the terrace living underground by the way just a just to show you how much comass cares about the civilians what exactly are they on what exactly are they worried about colen maschal the leader in founding member of comass gave a speech yesterday and he asked muslims aroun the world for help what he ask for did he ask for a humanitarian corridor for example to lau civilians out ogasa no did he ask for any sort of real financial help for for example the refuges in gasa of course not he called for four things quote to show anger especially next friday the be this friday in muslim countries and also among muslim diaspra around the world he calle at the friday of all oxa flood and he will send this will senda message of rage to zionis and america which is why every synagogu in the region in america across the world is a taking up new security messures on friday as well they should by the way that the the ridiculous propagandizing of all oxi is i it is absurd the only people of freedom of worship on the temple amount are muslims period and of story i've been on the temple mount mont multbal times i'm not allowed to pray their openly jordan peterson's wife when we went up there was forced to hide her cross but donoragizes it it is really it is it is the it is ininvation of t anances he says he asked for financial help from all muslims around the world to help with teir money he caled it financial se hod he askd muslims to give to whom who d e ask moslems ito the refuges to the to the fathers and mothers the babies being being killed in these irstructs nope to the fighters of gaza in order to confensate them for the destruction to the terrists he asked political pressure fom muslim leaders an muslimnations to stop israel's military invasiono gasa again no ask from them for he know some sort of resources for the millions of refuges or can be created by their terro war and the most important thing quot he asked all muslims around the world to carry sgeehod by their souls to fight and be martyrs for all oxa he wants muslims to fight against the jews starting with mslims who live in the countries surrounding israel jordan seriot lebanon in egypt to go to the bors and fried to enter each by their own means sa wants more borer in cursions which will get civilians killed people will walk to the border is cannot let people cross those bors and people die and he wants that for the press because he knows that the gullabl stupid western press will then pretend that this a massacre on the part of these railies as supposed to an attempted invasion bahamas he said this is the time for gehod to be applied on the ground rather than just in theory he askd the musia haddeen to going long caravans to spill their blood on the land of palestine he said funs are important but to day we are asking for your blood and souls the question as to what comes next is still very much in open one a eran obviously knew that commas was planning the attacks theunited states is claiming that eron didn' really know the the scale or the size of the attack adots ther poviding all f the resources thet the single biggest funder of camas jobidon again the bin administration has had on going negotiations with the government of ron for years at this point they have had n the billions of dollars and assets its one reason for them to down play exactly what happened here meanwhile cusballat is the single biggest recipians of eranian for an aid the re sive seven hundred million dollars a year from ron it is missle stock pall runs to a hundred thousand or more and those rockets are significantly more accurate and and dedley then then commass rockets ow all of this bodes very ill for the possibility ofe avoiding a regional war unless unless less makes clear this thing has to stay contained on the israilyside benjaminiting ow who as now formed a unity governe with bany gons all the talk about all the divisions in is raily society tht weve been covering for last year and a half all o that stuff went away immediately i think one thingthat is really important to note here and agan i have tons of friends in family on the ground in israel my wife's familly particularly tons of them on the ground in israel am the unity in israel among the citizens has literally never been greater the response of his railies to this is absolutely astonishing people are showing people are flying back in their packing el all flights back in if there abroad in order to rejoin the isrally military reservice who have been called up many reserves have not been called up they have a hundred and fifty per cent reporting rate the literally more people are reporting tha have been called up for duty civilians are showing up at military basis with food with with clothing with sleeping bags with whatever is necessary if the iservists donts have proper quipment people are are right now in prety much every community every jewish comunity across the world organizing shipments of that into israel the the social solitary in israel and he moral interums of unity has never been higre everybody is of course deeply disturbed by what happened everybody is in a state of morning but everybody else wo understands what has to be done over there andthe vidioes that have merged from from israel of of the unity are truly mazing people who five seconds ago where at each other's throats over things judicial reform all thats gone by the wayside on mi favored that he os o vidio of a tellov y restaurant tellov es very left wing area of israel tell thee restaurants which are very secular andthe e not real big on the orthodoc they have costured their kitchens becaus the on to make sure that the orthodox snactually eat food from their restaurant that that is what is happening muou benjaminites now who he is now suggested that the goal is to entirely whipe commas off the map which of course it must be for both strictegic and giel political reasons you have to whipe comss off the map because you have to make sure tha they cannot do anything remotely this again and also israel hasto restore to turns because of the deturns is not restored then this is only th beginning for the state of israel meanwhile as you can see all of the all the worst actors in the world are calling for n immediate seas fire of corse bajing called for an immediate seas fire which is absurd that is not going to happen israel has not even begun at this point israel also to day had to bom the air port into maskus and aleppo they had to do that because there is a massive oranean shipment of arms that was coming in the strikes targeded runways to the airport to prevent this aranean flight from landing in aleppo to ship more weapons over to hesballah an aranian mahan air flight those batoland in syria turned back to teheran according to the jerusalem post the mahn air is usually used to transport weapons opert is and funs for the islomic revolutionary guard cor and hesballah into the region the political response from the united states has been split it is virtually lar large swaths of it in in both parties are pro israel to this point the retoric from the by diministration has been absolute correct and it should be considering that twenty two americans were murdered in this terrase attack and there are currently many hostagees who are americans being held in the gosestript john curby the national security spokes person he reported on this yesterday i think we onl my disteal ourselves very distinct possibility that these numbers ill keepin cre an that w we may a find out that and marmar part of the hostage well the americans obviously have a a rather large interest we as americans have rather large interest in getting our hostages back and certainly on a ju political level ife an interest in one afvoiting original war that will undoubtedly break ofp th it is goong to happen or if thre's ther will be original wf israel is not to strike amoss thare will be original war it is that simple because if they cannot ostrucke him oss come oss with th clair victory casbala will get in if casbelog gets any israel have to destrike us ballaw it is rell has to destruck us ballaw syria and the rest of lebonon t will get in and if theyget in very large possibility arroun gets in tha the dominale ffact has to be stoped right now and the only o to stop that is by containing this war an allowing israel to wipe comoss off the map that is the only way this happens right now the bi niminstration is is making the right sounds here a secretary void ostin yesterday talk about israel's duty to defend itself at the sonl the ue stnoltry a to tisreal stori foring an yesterday including ken unistious it will be providing mor or aing cginesector o that israel can protect it siti sense and cites it will pen toe toesure that isul has it it mes to keep itself an its sitison safe i gany other country is you es oright ta the fend it ats a prese sa isua has a duty to thefendi in ma co cestate the e states for me ey wonl to prodat power in to direct resor tis to tackle crises in multipl fears this is why presumableave the united states hads now moved two aircraft carriers into the mediterranean and jobiding is warning people do not get involved here is jobidon talking to ere on yesterdays an you better be careful no i scotles ton iniin in ow andlhow many times et te s gin is fori and now already wer resuge iomiitasisens tn thesreally eanspersinplyin ammunition in sept tos eanand nowe we wil eascarriously these tomiatraty torandin wor fretercaeri that region and made it clear be i clear to the radiens be careful yow wel i mean they they best be careful because again if this does broaden out the consequences are going to be disasterous for every one involved but mostly for thy arronean regime meanwhile of course the the response from people on the right has largely been correct rondisantis of all the candidates hanicy haly have of course hav the trongest responsive i ronistans the res pons estera he was actual hn here was ron is tant is talking byut what his trel neds to do in the gose strip i i wondered ats a veteran what do you think that should look i think the reason why we have got into this point as because fur decades israel would respond to acts of terror but they would be very careful to do it in ways there were considered quote a proportionat and that would not get them a international condemnation cause the menute they start doing anything they are always under the microscope i think in this situation we an america we has got a stand with them the goll should not be a qo proportionat response it should be the elimination of hamas and the terroris inperstructure that is grown up a in gaza and that will be something that will be more significant that would israels been willing to do in the past i think they are more than capable of doing it that of course is a exactly exactly right meanwhile presedent trom who again was an excellen presen fris rom the mest present in israel's history for israel i'm i the they just the narcicism of him is is obscurers his actual political accomplishments is it i who did the abraham cords the the god who gave israelly aidat an needed in the middle of rocket wars with with hamas and yesterday he chose to bisarly attempting humiliate the corn prie minister of israel benjamenton aho because he was given isaur in formation that after his loss in the whning when he lection that it isg now rushed to takin gratually bided which wors notrus when the last wel leaders acturally con gradually byton in any case he resdone from going after it an it is now w personally in the midle of war and talking about his balla is smart for attacking from the north which is weird since there is literaly no other place that has belok coun attack from they are located in the north of israel that is the six suggesting the mextical would be smarn if the attacked a merica from the south thank what else would they attack from theyre thei're south of us and wha what hearing up but i'll never forget i'll never forget that baby at yo let us down that was a very terrible thing i will say that and would i see as sometimes the intelligence you talk about the intelligence ar you talk about some of the things that went wrong over the last week they have got as straight enough because thef fighting potentially a very big force te fighting potentially a ran and when they have people saying the wrong things everything they say is bing they gested by these people because theye vicious in this mart and boy of the visious cause nobody has everceened kind of sight that we have seen nobody's ever seen it but they cannot play game we were disappointed by that very disappointed but we did the job ourself that it was absolute precision magnificent beautiful jub and then abeby tried to take credit forhelp isid that did make me feel to good but that is all right they got us strengthen themselves up what woul ed wut ae right men ok and presinent trum agn nothing be gratitude for presid in trum as as a jew and as an american nothing mut gratitude for present hat wih your president right now but the the the fact to the matter is that dat that is that is bizar bizarstof in attacking the prime minister in a current time of war with ha unity government in israel by the way with much people disagree but they do agree on the survival of th jewish state i is a is a very bizar move and meanwhile the left is doing what t left us they are they are moving predictibly into anti israel territory burney standers who as i have said before is about his jewishas a hanstandwich a he is a he continues to be one of the world's worst moral exemplars he put out of statements and right now the international community must folks on reducing humanitarian suffering and protecting innicent people on both sides of this conflict the targoning of civillians a war crime o matter who does it israel's blanket denial of food water andother necessities to goitis e serious violation of international law and will do nothing but harmonis in civilians agen just a point out her this burney standars standing for comas and suggusting that israel shuldnot be able to pursue any of hits one military end because comas has put its own civilians in harm's way burney sander says the united states is rightly offered solidarity an support to israel in responding to commasis attack but we must insist on restraint from his reallys o force is attacking gossa and work to secure you an humanitarian access let us not forget that half of the two millian people in gos our children children inistant pople do not deserve to be punish for the acts of commass that is true h ukno be amazing if comas did not put them directly in the line of fire gen who is responsible for the human rights to trocity the person puts the child and line of fire beause their terrist or the person trats to kill the terrist and accidentally h hit is the child to who who is responsible for that precisely a goring burney obviously the problem is israel meanwhile democrats still having troblem condemning the squad for there consistently procomas stands representive dan goldman i he a refuse to throw were shuted to leave under the bus the other day because of course why would he why would he am me she is a democrat elison she has a palison an flash is palistonan a but what yu just said seems it is a pretty easy answer about the difference between palistonians and a mass and yet a som members in your concus ar ar choosing notis wull look everyone comes to congress with their own lived experiences and prochided to leave is palistony an american she has family in a the palison an territories and has a particular view a but she she is one person she does not represand the democratic party and what you are hearing from the leaders of the democratic party no one more imphatic than president biding yesterday who gave one of the most stirring and pro israel speeches than any president has ever given is that the democratic party stands firmly behind israel o ca i also notice theyoare not willing to one to throw weshuted to leav enohanoma open terror supporters out of your caukis i notice that is whell grutching whitmer doing the same sort of nonsense who rechin whimer of qu rs is the governor of michigan and she put out a statements calling for peace and i in said literally nothing about what it actually happened to the jews apparently should not ame israel in her statement shelso did not condemn comass orts terrism in her statement instead she said we ned peace in the region i and then she folloe up with second post that said that her support for israel is steadfast she also failed to mention hamass in that post and of course none of that is particularly surprising from some of the ratical democrats in people who are who are operating at the behassed of radical islomic fundamentalists including people ohin omar meanwhile left wing protestors across the nation ar or it is a mazing i mean ligke tey're just saying it all out inthe open an wer al spose to pretend that it is not happening one of the one of the rallies took place yesterday was you w students this university wash conson students who are apparently chancing glory to the marters yesterday that is athat is the marters by the way would be the people who murdered jews in their beds we nowe weweleerby any means necessary by any means tessary including the a complete extirpation of every jew from the recion meanwhile zerena grewall and american studies professor at yale the fenitactics used by hamass quote settlers are not civilians this is not hard that was in response to hi skinew's journalist saying civilians are civilians are civilians does not matterwhere settlers are nosviins now letme point out here at this point that dom even if you believe that were true which is utter complete li the jews living in say afra deserves to be murdered becaue they are living afrad if even if you believe that why becaus you are sicko the jews swere murdered here were not living in the settlements the jews were murdered here were living in the negive in the area surroundsing the gossi border which is ben is really territory since nineteen forty seven forty eight that is you are evil you just wone juws to die you just wone juse to die that is all the academic wrote on satuday morning what my heart is in my throat prayers for palestine is real is a murderous jenicidal setler state palstinians have the right to resist through arm struggle solidariy hashtag free palistine tnows in the middle of the attack as in the middle of the attack a this this again particular professor she is a historical anthropologist and a documentary filmaker she 's receives research funning fom bot the fullbright and the loose foundations bout twenty thousand people have now sind apetition for yelle to remove it tat professor that is not council culture is not counclic supporting all kida seems that supporting hamass supporting actual genicitle terrogroups seems that might be in a worth while for those people to not have dropd i eta nonala i do not feel ic anybody has the obligation to hire somebody a who supports it in open terrogroup ano it call me weird i justont i do not thing that i'stheir obligation meanwhile the media already shifting into the anti isral position as they con genitally were predisposed to do wthe bab s has now said that they are going to refuse to call homas terrace terrasts john simpson who is the world affairs tat ear who as routimely use the werd terrace to describe people in his own twiter account he says baby s will not be using he word terrace to describe comas terrast quot terrerism is a loaded word which people use about an outfit they disaprove a morally it is simply not the baby sees job to tell people who tisupport an who to condemn who are the good guis and whoe are the badguis oh is that tat a really i really i seem the word terrace has a definition but i'm noticing that you do not apply that definition to actual terroris when thes terrace are murdering jes i just notice this of course follows tard on the wide spread media questions about exactly what happens theyre there all these people on line who are ur and and this is now kind of the new normal is in the athomathof every tragedy because of institutional distross their people are do we really know that jewish babyies were murdered yot we know the jewish babes were murdered but if you demand pictorial proof here it is get ready folks theris youre morning you'r bout se picture of a dead baby this a babywhois mur bahamas that is it that is dead chile i'm to be sure not beheaded but but still dead i noticed i'm obviously ovus the comas that the therocay now because becaue this baby has the head is still tached the body but i did notice that this baby is dead thaw that' what i notice and that was ababy who is who is killed for the crime of living in a jewish community and being jish if the was that picture of the the dead baby enoghfor if it was not enough for you i have anoth i've another picture of a dead baby this one charred beyond all recognition burned i'm yes that this is for all of you who needed pictoreal representation of dead jewish babies in order for you to understand the evilohomas this is for you meanwhile the press immediately shifting in to contextmo the sophistict ah thi thomas freedman who is a one of the world's most a moral pathetic human beings thomas freemen is just grosst in first alls to more on in his entire career consists of going to randum countries and listening to taxy drivers if ever autimated oober became a thing in foreign countries thomas fry wen automatically be out of a job because all he does just going talks here is a man runs a peeta stand what does he have to say about forgm policy and now i know beximed thomasr he hasn'n intire piece titled israel has never needed to be smarter then in this moment and the entire piece is an apology of for what just happened he sayse i've covered this conflict fralmost fifty years iveseen his rallies and palsing in to a lot of awful things to one another palsting in sucide bommers blowing up his really discos an busses it is really fighter jut hetting neighborods an gaza that howse commas fighters but also causing massive s villian casualties let me just notice right off the bat that the go ta moral tool those are not the same thing those are not the same thing if you hit i comas target then they put kids in the comas target that is not the shame but it is ou not just people doing somebody did something as ehan omar might say but do not wory the entire articles ofbat hout really this abou n it naw who theis about b bs bout the se ralies of course well this operation was surely planned by commos leaders months ago i thing's emotional origin says thomas freedman can be explained in part by a photograph that appeared in the israilly press on october third well i mean that does not make any sense they say they eem planning his for two years and you say that a photo that came out october thord is what ro was the photo a few is rally government ministers had gone to read saly arabia for the first official visit ever and there is a photo the photo is taken by the team of israel's communications minister shlomo carti who is attending a youand postal conference in riad and there are conducting a prayer service one of them tok a picture of a colligue wearing a traditional jush prayer shaw an omica while holding up a toriscroll with the riad skyline in the window beyond that photo ignihts a powerful and emotional rage in many palistinians says thomas freedmen israel shon not pursuit pece with the sauties cause it might piss off terrase is thomas freedmanstake for them that picture is the full expression of the is railly priminister benjaman nittina whose supreme goal to prove to all maysayers indeed to rub their noses in the fact that he can make piece wit the arab states even salyarabia and not have to give the palcinians a single anch se heres the thing thomas freedman is in the crowd o people whould rather notsee piece in the iddle east and see conflicts continue long as he can be proved right in his bizar notion of the centrality of the israilly palsinian conflict he wants to be proving right more than he once people to live thats that that is seriously thomas freedmen's position in all this and that is the position of many of the cophistic ats in it takes a few dead jews and bunch dead people in gaza to prove that whell he is o pay with that he is ook at after all's beby's fault probably it is just it is absolutely pathetic on it is face it is pathetic a best response of te dag credit too a israel's president i's a curzog nown as bugi herzog he that he is anon political figure in israel t e president of israels more of ceremonial figure sorelike the queen of england or something hs the ability to green light the formation of a collision government that ispee much all he does and that he 's giving a press conference about what happen and see an en went full sianen startetogma ho israel's engaging in collective punishment it is collective punishment because of course when when terracs honey come themselves in is villing population it is now the job of the people who were murdered tu to give up in surrender probably you let the inhumanity of your opponent make you surrender and apparently by prostrated their feet a the pritisent present or herzog was having none of that here he was yesterday going after siana and in in colorful and a much deserve the fashion but thistening to you alsis in the thu tun little confused because a line yo say tha is e bi ite ru e bor anis very careful to vo t thesi otinin ti in the gasis but at the same time tin to hold the people o gao i

dis agree about a lat politically he is on the left in israely politics he is that he was he was a leber candidate okey understand that there is no gap in israel right now the gap disappeared all those fractures they came together immediately when thirteen hundred yuse are murdered as well they should and the entire world you are alf hypocrites let me just say that if this happene in yor country if it had if it happened in the united states if it happend in briton if it happen in france it apen in germany if it appened in any of these other countryies do you thnk theyofld be sitting there saying awellla we really have to be careful aout turning off the water and the power for a few days we really have to that this is we wl have to such restraint we have to show we have to show let me explain something in the united states after nine eleven we totown too an countries two of them we occuped afcanistan for twenty years we occupied a rock for fifteen years thows in response to three thousand dead all israel wants here is the ability to wipe out the terrorists and then to leave do you think they want to be building in gaza city they tried to hand the gosesstrip over to the egyptians just as they tried to hand over palestinian areas of judaa and semaria to the gordanians and yo know those country said they said know we do not want that that this this bizar notion that israel has to be held twith standard that no honorable nation would hold itself to is purely antessmatic that is the only rational for this is the only ration ow no one else on earth would be talking this it is absolutely absurd it is absurd in thit the amount of attention and and sor harsh pressure that is put on on israel not to not to take the action necessary to secure its own future you thing hat kind o pressurehas been put on you crane in terms of the human rights do you that kind of pressure is put on help china intrems what china does it is it is it is absolt it is absolumadness andthe fact that that that it only happens one place on earth and everybody knows it everybody knows it there is not a western nation that would be held to the standard everyone knows it and what is even more appalling is that is rael moset and israel abides by it that is the part that is absolutely appallingum talking to is ralyes on the ground every single day and they are getting ready to go in on the ground by foot in an attempt to minnamize civilian casualties israel does thit is all the time i've seen footage from the i a f showing them holding off on hitting particular targas because the'are to many civilians around thay been doing that for yoars they can to riht now that they need to kill the baggives n if the rest of the worald cannot take it well grow the gop because the reality is the jews and israel are notgon go quietly the jews and israel are not going to acqueess in teir own mass murder no one should half to is the universal human message jews should not half to as they western citizen sit there and be told that your government does not have the judy and te right to protect you from mass murder in your own kitchen and the fact thet dis thes the culmination of deckades of absurd western nonsense there is been plipe apply predominantly t israel you see it applied to the united states toes souapplied to the uce little bit but predominantly israel because israel lives in the neighborhood ans that means o comes a blot more often with israel but this again all the people in the media who are uare deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis in gasa as israel attempts to kill terrace and simultaneously tell civilians to get out all those same people who are wore chiding israel to day all thoe same people if someody came into their home and murdered their children and raped their wives and dragg them off to some hellhole somewhere how much do you think they would be concerned about the temporary stoppage of water and power absolutely ridiculous well foks theire lot fpeople asking how they can help is rally citizens right now help jews on the ground christian ins muslims all people who are unifying to fight hommass or who hav been victimize by commas or both well the international fellowship of christians and jews on the grund right now the providing critical essentials food medicin and other emergency supplies for vulnerable jews who need immediate help they need is indeed massive and urgent its great organization they need to help right andouse of human thing about giving this great way to help outs don'at please go to i f c js out or give as generously as you can write it down as i f c js out org o can meanwhile in news that is closer to the united states republicans are still squabbling over who should be the house speakers there is an internal election last night inside the inside the republican party it wa impited represent of steve scalees from lusiana against jim jordan of ohio can i both these guies and noblit these guies jordan was in dorsed by presen en trump he narrowly lost one thirteen to ninety nine now the big prommet than matter there ison't tha matter is cause they still do not have to unattempting votes s there' till not bringing this to the floor that was just seticided who they bring o the floor as the possible speaker but an order for any of that to happen all the re publicans behind the door have to as should get together and acquiesce that whoever they picked in that election they are now going to vote for even if you vote for jordanand the words byind closed dors nagig an o move out fom behind the closd ors and you are going to vote for sculees and apparently they do not have that at the moment again it is a very very narrow victory sculees overjord ther'l owt to hold out jordan is doing his best to up to indors skulees he he basiclly signalled yesterday that he was going to he was going to move forward ihe now he is not clearly come out far con welster journal and publicly thrown himself behind sculees but even if he would that 's no garantee because again there is a mass of collective action problem inside the re publican party all i takes is four re publicans in order tothrow thentire house into chaosin more there is why this is stupid it s the ouston mc carthy to put in steve sculees was in nearly identical voting record with mc carthy and who would pursue many of the sametack pousies mc carthy that is thi yersted si i fail to see how this advanced the ball at all which is why i oppose in the first place at stupid if you'e gong to make a political macavellian manipulation to get red the speaker the house yo better dam well have a back up plan wereyou actually winsome concessions apparently thomas massy is now estimating there at least twenty house re publicans will not vote for scules on the floor he says iet'll beven more difficult for sculees to in a majority thn was from mc carthy in canuary some while makers were frustrated wednesday by an internal vote earlier in the da blocking a proposal that wouldhave required the winning candidates to secure two undred seventeen votes rather than simply hove the most vots of any candidate allas if skulees had been lobbying against the rules change s again their idea was that the winning candidate would have to be able to get a majority and there likg not we will hae an internal vote for no reason and then we will try to ficger it out afterward that is gone great this is this zallcan go really really well macgates for his for his own sake wholed this charge he said he will support either one of them you lie craine another one has said that he would support either jordan or skulees but do not worry there are there a few people who are saying ta they will not vote for sclees among them the attention getting nancy mace i duntknow why nancy makes thinks that she needs to be on camera all the time lately but tom again when you have a narrow majority one of the things that you get to do is postor and pren for the cameras and nancy makes inexplicably joined the cor s of people who provided for mc carthy's ous er she did on the ground tha mc carthy was to conservatantes a good luck getting her on board for steve sculees the other day she decided o donrigize the zalgest humble public servants being humble public servants and nancy mayes decided to wear a m a a white t shirt with the a o a white what what would you call this shirt savy ins on a blaus it is effectively atube toped snonted tube toprights really tight in inicat she she is wearing it she is wearing a white tea shirt a fairly tight white tee shirt that says that is a giant red a on it do not wory gises h their just humble public servants seeking to dour bidin an th the seriousness of what happens in the world jucks toposed with the idiocy of our political class is realy truly something to behold e truly is onlike all sides if serious things happening the world pending regional war in the iddle east it continuing you crane war globl economic slowdown if all these serious things happening and meanwhile in the united states we are running a three ring circus with multiple clowns of all parties it is it is its bewildering and insane and frustrating an here is nancy mace clowning around syou are a scarlet a because she is just hester prine you see i i'm not ture who she comitted adultery with i'm but dom she is just hester prin she explains i'm worring the scarlet latter after the week that i jus ha last bei bein i wo man a herin bitemen ie from mi to en from mi by

te te at on ancany one i wastitat i only answer to the people i'm i am i what then why are you doing this that then she says after the vote for scolse that she is canvote for jim jordan and she this is tis a lady who apparently just wonce to be on sianan alot here she was on siannan you endors tu en yordan i te soming you voted for gem ordn to day if the vote for speaker word to day wirh yo vote for sincsiles i would not i plan on that in fron gen tordand on the floor i mi been very tople about tes to the last oin days i fir throin can not in ten concence vote of sommine who had ten ed a wice to premes conference and compared himself to david duke i 'vd been doing an enormous to service to the voters that i represent in south carolina if i were to do that unt gat all o this syslanderous nonsense the the notion that he compared himself to david duke is second tand talk from the midnineteen nineties thofs a charge that young scoleese described as clat from as similar to duke during a personal conversation with fellow ellas you will lun stephany grace grace apparently neither recorden republish the statement shoe trotted out many years latercon cle going from memory accordince to stephen voss who rites about this o the missoury independen at as far as the the notion that he spoke at a wahe sho premises conferene she was asked bot is is mintale political ra shofs ass to speak

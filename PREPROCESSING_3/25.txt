when it comes to the twenty twenty four election thereare couple of points mad one for republicans and one for democrats le star with the point for democrats celebrities are not going to save you i know thae democrats seem to believe that lebriging celebrity in favor of there best political candidates magically raises them to victory ththey are thinging back to a time when mariland manroe was singing happy birthday mister president to the president the ish stipping j f k the're thnking back to a time during the nineteen nineties when bilclint was plaing sacophone on on late night t v the're thingng back to a time when celebrity matter and awful lot more than it does right now and the have tried this perfore trying to drag a lack lester candidate over the finish line with celebrity tends not to work but when youare a desperate candidate you have to take desperate messures which is wythethan your times is reporting to day that presidein bidon is trying to pump energy into his reelect bid kaking off what is likely to be an ugly dispiriting and historically long slogg to november between two unpopular candidates apparently he is now sent two of his most trusted white house operatives to take the helm of his reelect campaign and wilmington at delaware other bidon aids are drafting wishlists of potential cirgates including elected officials social mediate influencers and the indorsement of their wildest treams the global super star tailor swift oh yes they are resorting to the swifties this early that is not a god sign for your campaign when youare starting to target tailor swift as if she indorse is all my gotess gon to change everen to first of all we should point out tailor swift did in fact indorsed jobidon for president in twenty twenty it did not really move the needle all that much because she is just a very famous pop star and very famous popstars in dorsing people does not any move the needle all that much thank god now there are some poles that suggest that actually a fifth of voters ore likely to back the candidate indorsed by the singer there is a pole conducted by red filld and wilton stratities for newsweek and found that eighteen per cento voters say they are more likely or significantly more likely to vote for a candidate indorsed by tailor swift and that sway was most visible voters under the age of thirty five sivey mild proposal a moderate proposal if you base your vote on who tailor swift in dorses you should not be allowed to vote the united states this does not hold just true for tailor swift if you base your vote on the that of celebrities who spend two seconds engaging with politics but yo really their sons you should not be voting if youre voting republican t based on the endorsement of connia west if youre voting democrat based on the indorsement of tailor swift you should not be voting that is not how politics is su post to work and is worth noting again that backin twenty twenty she literally tweated in favor of jobidon she treated quot after stoking the fires supremacy and races of your entire presidency you have the nerve to fain moral superiority before threatening violence when the looting starts the shoting starts we will vote you out november donald trump now it is also true that seventeen per cent said they would be less likely to vote for candidate backd by tal wift eighteen per cents and more likely seventeen per cent said less likely how bout this how about we do not care hwabout knowing cares what tailor swift tasosand politics because she is a pops star and she makes songs and then it is in many shots by the ano fell quickside note here ii i have to say good for lamar jackson for preserving his breathing on this planet because of lamar jacson had actually put to canta city chiefs in danger of losing the a of s championship came the other day rogerigdollt of him with the drone to prevent from aapne there suc sha drone hovering over the stadium as can mooke a baroccoboma drone attack in some olia or something if if lamarch action actully brought to baltimore ravens to the brink of the superble in any case bidon is now early reaching for the celebrity lever when you are reaching for the celebrity button or leave er that quickly youre in serious serious trouble according to the nork times the campaign is begun to scussin discussions with celebrities and social medeo stars about promoting mister bidnin instrogram and tictoc because there is nothing that kins better then theire favorite celebrities in dorsing a vegetable when bidon took a fun rasing swing through southern california in december the campaign carved out time to meet with in fluenceerse to pitch them on posting probidon content you re member some of the probiden conton from a little bit earlier in his presidency including randum weard people with selthy sticks in the white house be in all strangion off putting or gan to get a lod of that this year the bggest and most infulenchall indorsemen target is swift herself the pop sensation and and i fell enthusiast who can move millions of supporters with an instrugram post or mid t concert aside shindorst bidon in twenty twenty last year a single instragram post led to thirty five thousand new vot o registrations ook et can i just poin out here that first ovall her instogram how many followers to tailor swifthave on instogram she must have oh i got hundreds millions of followers on i two hundred eghty million followers on instogram and sho as able to register thirty five thousand people n those are not amazing numbers if jobiden is counting on tailor swift getting millions people vote good luck to him gavan newsum apparently all but bad de talor swift to become more involved in bidon's campaign he said quote tailor swift stands tall and unique what she as able to accomplish just in getting young people activated to consider they have a voice andthey shulhave a choice in the ex celection i think is profoundly powerful that of course is gavanusum trying to ot missagh tailor swift into indorsing him for president in twenty twenty eight the chatter around swift and the potential of her two hundred seventy nine million instragram followers being reached reach such intensiony intensity that the bidonte urged applicants an a job posting for a social medea position not to describe thei're tailor swift strategy there is an idea that maybe they would send bid in to actually her eras tour which would be the death of her erostore by the way and nobody wants to watch that old duet hobble up there an then try to dans to talor swift over produced music at this point instead of actually being good president they are going to try to bring tailor swift on board in all of this i gain i'jut point out here the democratsmen trying play the skim for multiple election cycles in ro berackobama did not win in two thousandeight or two thousand twelve because he had celebritiinsdorsements he one because he was the celebrity it is one thing for the candidate themself to be a slept donal trump one in twenty sixteen because he was a ce leberity pop cultural relevants dos matter in awful lot but only when the person with the pop cultural relevance is the politician himself it is non transferable credit if you stand next to tailor swift that does not make you tailor swift and it does not give you you a peal of tailor swift again hilriclinn tried to do this back in twenty sixteen here was hilryclintn trotting out every celebrity she could possibly find to sing fight song out of youremember this there is almost irritating things in the history of american politics i mean honestly hillryclintens entired twenty sixteen campaign was just eit to year nails on the chalk board moment wes inturminable nails on the chalkboard and she trotted out at the d n c a bunch of celebrties elizabeth bangs and manty more singing fight song and you it happen she lost here is a little bit of that

a pentigon conspiracy the right has been falling for this line a lot or for the past ten twelve years increasingly every conspiracy theory now must be treated as a real possibility here isthe robem with conspiracy theories the problet conspiracy theories is that almost always they are wrong the reason i say almost always there o sometimes the right but almost always theire wrong because there require incredible levels of dedication theyre inquire incredible levels of competent and every time somebody says something but the moonlanding being fate for example yet to thinks yourself how many thousands of people would have to be in on it and competently do theirepart in order to make this happen and than it could be debunged is my friend mout wall said by som schmuck when the internect connection in two thousand twenty four and a couple of pictures from guglimages and the answer is no that is not that is not real hayd the problem with conspirate that sometimes their fun sometimes theire silly but conspiracy theory start did you damage because if you believ that a conspiracy is in control of all the things you see all the things you hear it is enervating it makes you less likely you get active it makes you more likely to belive that nothing you do is going to end with the result that you seek there is no connection bhet tween your action and the result becaus there is an intervening conspiracy to stop that thing from happening andtat its particularly true in politics it is the reason i do not and still do not i did not i still do not the whole donald trump had the election actively voter fraud stolen from him in twenty twenty the reason this is bad is not just because it is not true an there is not enough evidence to demonstrate it and dona trum has never shown enough evidence to demonstrate that it can say that the election was reggd i agree with that if by that you mean that all the rules were change that you saw an unprecedented number of voters in that election cycle virsually all of whom were marginal voters who had very little interest in voting i the first place in who are now sending their ballet in by mal months in advance of the election in violation of the way that waw is normally suppose to work totally agree at that if youare not argue the de media rigge the election by ignoring all of the relevant issues in twenty twenty in favor tou monchragarbag and than actually hid stories about jobidon in the run up again totally agree you are not argue tht social media was actively stumping on behalf of jobidon an acting at the behazt of actors in the deep state to stime storts totally agree at that that is not the same thing as the conspiracy theory that there was a well organized voter fraud effort that deprive donald trump of his reelict the reason that is bad is not again just because duntrue it is also because if that is true why bother voting and that in fact is how people reacted if you recall allthe way back to early twenty twenty one whene we are in the midst of all of this tratiness donald trump literally told people that in georgia and we now have two democratic senators in georgia a heavily red state that if donald trump is the nominate which you will be then he is going to win that state in all likelihood this time round what happened what happen thid it would did all the voter f fraud just disappear or is it possible that he just one that popular a candidate in twenty twenty because of all the outfirmention reasons and because you are non a bad campaign in twenty twenty and did not do an amazing job in twenty twenty but he could win in twenty twenty four the problem with conspiracy theories is again it leads you to believe that all the factor's out there that could lead to your success are actually beyond your control well the democrats are busily digging their own graves by saing th whor gon to ignore the fact tot wore crat yon policy an ore y a tata to indorse it if we if we can get the nineteen eighty nine lady the lady whose how old is tailor swift now tailor swift is at each thirty four right yew it nhowg ig if we can get the thirty four yoar old lady who sings songs she seventeen years old and breaking up wit the first boy friend again and she is two years younger than my wife whose a doctorine has for kids if we'n get that lady to indorse us then magically we are going to win the election if republican shustood theire why how desperate are you that is a much better tact than what we have seen instead which is a bunch of people hun i the right going it is t it is a si up it' a pentingon si up everything's a conspiracy we get' to more on this in just one second first if you have not already checked out the good ranchers new year new meet special you need to titch the mystery of the meedile get american meat delivered right to your door instead when you subscribe to any box of good ranchers they will add over two pounds of pree trimmed better than organic

chicken and new your savings good rancher's dot com american meat delivered nellison again i think some this tuff is hilarius i thnk that it is i think that the entire tailor swift i's dating travis celce she ken boose the ana fell's ritings and then right abreak up song fury of life may very well be true because again everything around tailor swift is incredibly produced everything round the anifell is incredibly produce and frankly it is funny and i enjoy the funny of it i enjoy the trollory of it but one of the one of the signal failures of the right these days is to believe that everything is a consgiracis there there is a theory going around a can you not thet tailor swift is being promoted by the anafell which she is forratings in the rainings have gone up becaus heilswift is very popular and people are mused and interested in the fact that she is dating the tight en for the cansacity chievs travis kelsy and that every often and by every soften i mean literally every twenty seven seconds for the producer gets fired the anna felt swiveles to a view of her in the skybox people have speculated on the right that this is actually a pentagon deep state conspiracy that is design to elevate tailor swift that she will endorse jo biden and thus change the election gofs not everything is forty chess not everythng is forty chess again i'm all here for the pop culture people dating each other for the press cannis o beause they do that all the time that does happen in howlywut all the time at happens in the music industry all the time ayounfine entire ritings on line of tailor swifts various romances and which are considered legit and which ones are just sort of put together for the prass an that thi's been a long standing tradition in tailor swift circles from what i understanding and i'm no tailor swift expert i'm not a swifty i do not know her songis very well i kno however i do not kno pretty much anything about what she does other than some f her songs are catchy but those ten to be the older songs and she is a riht any of heron sons any more but the theory that is now going around ad againsst become popular on the right he is indicative of a deeper rot inside the republican party which that when you despair of the world you start to think tat everythings to conspiracy thre's a hity othe is going around from twenty nineteen of somebody eatin the penthagon siop division talking b ow they lovedr cruetailorseft i'm sure they would i'm sure they would a man who would not if you are government and you could get tailor swift as a c i a assat why would not you does that mean that what we are watching right now is ake a deep state conspiracy to promote tailor swift and traveas celsy and then i gues there is deep state conspiracy sai san francisco forty nine ors will lose the superable and travels tells you will propose to tailor swift and her first act upon being proposed you will be to accept the ring that immediately tur rounds e but there is only one person i love more joseph ar bidin and suddenly bidns winning in a landslide again if that first mo if that' the pentingon's plans the dumbis plan i ever heard tell swift cant wit thirty five thousand votor registrations that is really stupid but anyway here is the theory being laid out here have you ever wondered why or how she blew up this bll around four years ago the penagon psychological operations unit floating turning tailor swift into an asset during a nato meeting le conovasa a siop for combating on line mis information listen you came in here wanting to understand how you just go oup there and counts her an information operation withthe ideas that social influence can help i can help i encourage or i promote behave your chain persensily ask li a peaceful information operation i include tailor swiftin here because she is on yif she is a fairly influential on my inperson i do not know if you' herd of her yet that is real the penagn psyopthe unit pitch nato on turning tailor swift into an asset for combating this information a lot if i was running bines management perception team i would identify someone who would aline themselves with my agenda such as a tello swift who has close to six hundred million followers i would targid her i would engage her and i would get her whon't get her to do what we use to see is public service announcements that type o enlistment that timena sin withs the teenas leberty is anowagous to the old days of deployment of a siop you una celebrity indorsement in a can in it in a candit is campan is at ortog my her again is this super worth while is this super with what it is it is it the worst thing in the world the people it again it is indicative of they broughter mind set guys not everything you do not is it conspiracy not everythng i do not is it conspiracy some things are in fact conspiracies but i promise you if this is a conspiracy its the stupidest conspiracy of all time she already endorsed bidin she is going to endorse him again taylor swift is a very popular very popular musician probly most popular musician in world history by mattrics and youknow whats can o happen if she indrses jobidon not thing cause hesich cause he is o crap press i nothing is goin to happen selikg allall the ongst and all thet kin of heartburn tht you see on the right constantly about the sortf stuff the left is motivated the left does try to do bad things but when they try to do do the bad things we can all usually see it when they are trying to make sure that small children are exposed to pornography in school libraries they are doing it right out in the open and you can stop it and yu can work on it the whole basis of politics that we can make choices to actually imped the progress of a wild left and when you start getting into every single thing that we see over here is some sort of organized sih up it just a i thinkts enervating i thin i's bad for the republican party i do not think it is good for consere onling isgod for merica i thing the egeneralized belief that all systems are rigged in america is a very bad belief whether t is on the left or whether i is on the right because the truth is in america very few things are truly truly rigged t' the extent that people to believe they are nwhin politicians tell you that things are rige there is everthing is rigs when they say that sort of stuff without any real evidence when then presen evidence tey just say the things are riggd typicalaks because they want more power to rig them the other way that is what they are doing here and i do not any of it we gets more on that just at one second first it is been a pretty strustful time in top wrapper in america visiting polind with elon it musk when i get back home

president the thing that tpeople are actually in a vote based on we are now finding out that the names of the of the soldiers who ware killed injordan biranian proxy forces what exactly happen torning tothe walzer journal the united states failed to stop a deadly attack on an american military outpost in jordan when the enemy drone approached its target at the same time as the you astrone was also returning to bases yous official sad to basically an aranian drone came in athe same time in american drone as coming in they mixed up the american drona and the rnian drone the aranian drone killd t bunch of american soldiers and there is still something forty wounded the return of the ostrone let is some confusion over whether the in coming trone was friend or foe they cautiond the inquiry into the attack was in early stage accoringts officials the enemy drone as onch trom arock by a militia back by taheron and struck the outpost living at quarters that outpost sits near the borders of rock an seria jordan has requested of course american presents injorden in order to protect theire own boarders in jorden is an a us ally in the region why has national security council spokes person john kurbe told reporters there is a responsibility that needs to be laid at the feet of the leaders in tahrama the problem of course is as we have said the bide administration has boxhed this thing six ways from sunday i'll just remind you the right now wha we are seen the release this giant conflagration e's all bided in the same way the giant wave at the border is all biden backins softember twenty twenty three jake sullivan wisist ferrest in the land of most national security such a wise person that he move from the abom ad ministrationary scruipt national security sto bide ad inistrationwary srescript national security hee's that the atlantic conference is back in september and here he was bragging abouthow quiet themat aleast was in september you may recalle that noctobersom things happened ss now batch as laor to say that i has sas quieter to day then in two decates and then here is ansny blink in the secretary state yesterday lok first i the it is very important to note that this is an incredibly wall tall time the middaleast om i would argue that we have not seen the situation as this dangerous is the one were facing now across the retion since at least nineteen seventy three and arguebly y even not even before that oh well i mean what changed what magically changed now of course october seventh happened but the question is why doctober seventh happene and the answer is because you pursued a pro oranian policy from day on of this administration and in embuldened oron and made her on believe that they could push the united states aroun and its allies in the region without any sort of serious consequences and of course oron far has been right and when john kurby keeps putting out there all of these sort of week need responses twron killing americans aron is sitting there thinking i'lok cae we can get away with is ready much anything we want does therereally hurteron if we kill a few of its proxy forces without dismanciling the terror networks does her realy hurteron if we allow the red see to continue to be come a sort of pond on behalf of ronian military proxies what is hout there we doing to hurtron at this point again donals trump have them contain jobidon has not only un contained them his release them his unleased the power of ron va it is proxy's all over the at least look at a map look at a map oron is all over the dam place if you look at the mddle eastern penensula what you will see is aron at the south you will see aron in the east you will se ron in the west that is a deliberate policy decision by the bi an administration to let oron out of the box yesterday john curby said do not wory were ot looking for a military solution with ron nout listen no one wants a war with aron but who really really does not wan worth oron oron i keep saying this but people pretend that it is not a reality in a war with tharon oron loses it might not be fun for the united states it will not be fun for the united states it might cost money but no one wants a worth oron in te united states but who wants a war even less in that matters because whenyou are trying to detur some one if you do not want to getngto fight with that ki over there and that cover there is crazy sometimes if he starts getting in your face you might have to punch him and if it turns out that youare stronger than he is he will stop punching you that is the entire policy of te turns you have to kill the guy ofve theintoi fullscale war but you do have to detur in order to detur to turrance is very simple is the credible threat of military force that is what to turrance is and when you keep saying over and over and over the do not have a credible threat the other side might think it might not have a credible threat here was jon kurby natunall security spokes person yesterday e te an e a we ter e i i we are not lookin orwrth oron a seeking an contit ma de regine atin a otaryway e and as i said in in the opening ot nonot looking to escuate here this attack ot we we can was escuratory make no mistake about and it requires yoa response make no mistake about that i will not get ahead ofthe present iio mak not theeter way wayer i ieron in wor we are not e can orwit eronne nocni p to the present disions ga habout this we will make a decision when we make a decision haabout that now again no one wants worthoron forone millions time there a few people who might be interested those people hav been marginalized in theamerican public tabay no one is interested n a direct worthoron but if you are the white house why are you laying all your cards on the table what exactly is the purpose of that sr john kurby was asked guys you have can ae been i peasing aron for the past several years an kurs agre do not see at dis peasement will ye know who does oron the etether spon to wer l win where th e cr ouerr w asemen we can speak for themselves that' le not the way we see this oh well i'm sure you do not see that way but arondas the pensagon spokes person subrina sang was also asked if to turns had failed by danabash and done she did not have a good answer because to turns obviously has failed which is why theye are dead americans now in looking at this and and more roadly hav you wis the currente policies faild thend how ll the president's respond beint different this time well luck what we saw last night al we saw yesterday was a weful action that impact at our service members and that something that a ways heavily on this building that was havily on the secretary our thoughts and prayers are certainly with those service members and their families a but when you look at the wider region when you look at what is happening in the region we know tensions are hig but the conflict that is happening between israel and gaza has been contained to gaza and we have tee multipolatacks a on our service menbers any rock and seria ah that have been largely unsuccessful miner our injurious minor damage and for structure but unfortunately yesterday we saw an an a lefal action we actually we have had five dead americans over the course of the past couple of weesh if two navy seals who are also lost as they attempted to defang a military shipment from oron to the hoothies in yaman s we actuallyave five dead americans we have some american many americans apparently with significant brain damage because r on in attacks when she says i's been contained understand that it is not that this thing started in gaza and the spread out that its not what happened here what happened is that ron had a well co ordinated plan in which hisbela would attack is ral from the north commoss would attack israel from the south the whoothes would attack the red sea aronian proffee forces in syrial would attack american proxy forces in syria and aroch en this all part of a bigger plan by oron to store up as much trouble as possible milling again it is an electioneer andthats a this comes down to it is

carry a bigstick yit was speak really really loudly and carry no stick at all carry one o those rubbour hammers that squeaks when you had something with it that is basically the bidin policy the reason i say this is because tere isteim biden for weeks warning oron do not do not you you want tyu want toget up aty with us you wan' you want a start making trouble do not do not and ronas do not

jobidns afrasigan allusarelic that is why youbdnis week and r on knows it yesterday and a'lgizeraporter grilled the the spokes person for the white house about all this and said are you following the poles are you gest following the polst now algizera is of course an outlet base it is a prochomas outlet algezera it is run by the cataries the cataries are very much in league with teron they play this sort of fake middle man position the catari's very often in which because they hoost terro groups in their country they act a sort of the stagin ground for negotiations between those terro groups and terresponsers and western states when there is negotiations have to take place or most of the negotiations between say comas and the asrailies over the hossages ire taking place in ctar algizera is funded by cotar and it is a a pro terror outlet is a procomas outlet algezera algezera is asking the biden administration are not you following the puls why the asking that tbecause they understand that the media you must hie out in actural conspiracy the media do not the west they do not they think that the west is bad they think wess is colonialist imperialist and they believe in the equity bel of the the equity structure that is been built up by the political left that suggests that lack of success in the world must be due to exploitation by the west in any case the media do have an ingenda their a genda is shape american public opinion as to pressur gobiding into giving into the bad guies all juzour knows that which is ly the pushing it to here is report for all gzera pressing the white house this is a lection is the president looking at i pulling when hes lay o i otin is the president looking wanin that is an ecumocis not lokin mmmm m len me just stop yeri commanderin

works to protect our troops a sure in our ships at see and any suggestion to the contrary is not ens ga but he is well i's beclear he is that is the reason why wrong things he can get away with all

okime meanwhile why exactly ar the media focussing in on the pulling numbers because this is the thing that they kin shapes the media our very anti isral their very antie america that they do not the presence of the west in th middle east because they somehow believe that the lack of success in the mddle east is due to western intervention ism as supposed to the gigantic history of failure in the midle east but in any case you can see that the media there isan amazing clip that emerge couple of days ago there is a host from sky news who is interviewing a a spokes person for israel and compared the gaza strip to the to the holicost it is just this is the kind of craft at the media ore doing on a regular basis she colds for a voluntary migration of polistinians from gasa in the venban col tha dapece that dapatd in the woll street ginal ou suggested the ethnic clensing of somen galls as population to wat and cou a that would exta a rates te thi a i from tat ons loa one idea is te countries

many toish people during the holocalstimax and it is ae oe ta aan a netyon youfulta nus please neesaf a netevwe ye nexus pleis i e ei eo te we tad yes taidea sgani aveniz sasterarea i me listen to that she literally just comparin the quat the the question of whether a palistinian who wants to leave the gossistrips is not to live inthe gossis tret once to live in egypt or dored in or somewhere else she compared that to jews being shipped the a train to concentration camps this is th this is what these people are talking bat i mean this what the medya are this is why there hoping that jobine is looking ite pulse and unfortunately toby is in fact looking at the pulst particularly on his left which is what he is afraid of meanwhile again because the bodeministration has a central foreign policy fallicy which is that the israel palsinian issue is central to all middle eastern politics and it is a lie they continued but pressure on israel despite the fact that comms continues to deny every hostage deal offered to them according to the jerusalem post commas leader is malhonea is turning down an offer of a two month sease fire in which israel would release more palistinian terrorist in exchange for the innocent hostages they are being held by commas he turned to downbecaus his israel has to stop the war whose anti sees fire now meanwhile the bid administration continues to foment support for the you and ar dbly way you an refug g an works agency which again is a garbage of the relief an works agency is a garbage agency as been garbage for decades is run by commass a recent whalstry journal investigation found one thousand two hundred people out of theu unartible was total twelve thousand employes had direct ling te ommosser f palsin an is lonegy hod one tenth of them and way hire in that bou those are people with direct lengts and the united states temporarily pause to aid to the unardibly way because a commass frunt group becase that is what it is but because the bi dadministration refuses to acknowledge the reality which the depalcing an population in goza is incredibly radical that they they do support terrorism an ideological basis by the way palstinians in westbank by e every available pulling metric every single one there is no data to support the idea that there is a moderate palisting in population that does not seek vast terror attacks on jes and the murder of many jues there is no dated a support that not i wish their wore it would make a lot easier but wish casting is not in fact a foreign policy and yet that is what the bo deminstration continues to do john curby he is been trid out tha by the by de minstration to defend the you on our bl a in the face of this investigation the ouas has aspended aid momentarily to the ugand relief agency on onra an goafter occus ations that members iv the ing an agent sen were connected to hamath and in one case pretesipated in the october seven attack on israil what is the proper response if these aligations are verified and and what does that mean in terms that the humanitarian crisis and got as well as this has bhe mean agency administrating aid there the the youand releasion works agency unres its cu calld cold clear they have been doing a lot of amazing work on the ground in gos a literally helping cy thousands of lives another taken thi seriously o they they brought the information to us by the way they let us know that they had this report of obut a dozen employs who were somehow involved then october sevetere taken this very veryou seriously they have called for an investigation and they have made it clear othat the're gon to hold anybody appropriately accountable to include criminal prosecutions total whitewash total whitewash there from the bidon white househant appeasement of the bad guis leads to badguisting you advantage of you shocker shock or that that again is the story of the bidin ad ministration meanwhile on the migration issue jobidon continues to be a disastr area the giant wave of emigration i legal migration has has thas it crested unclear at this point ste latest stats that we have from the southern border in december which are just release recently three hundred seventy thousand there in seventy thousand bordering counters which means those people the dn't call on border or rests because the vasccentrory to those people are not sent back to their home countries those people are let into the united states is they losing issue for jobiden by every available pulling metric jobidon is getting his but kicked in terms of pulling data on emigration it is a very damaging issue for him naturally leave its republicans to out trid to steal defeat from the draws of victory what is not useful what is not useful is the take our border back convoy to the borter not a useful thing not useful thing the reason is not useful thing is because the state of texas has the sunder control the state of texas is using it is actual state power as it should to protect its citizenry the state of tecas has not been ordered by the supreme quaurt to get rid of razor wire or not build any more racer wire we are not's put any more border wall in place the have not been order do any of that by the supreme quourt they are taking care of the issue what is going tobe a problem is if anybody in that border convoy decides to get frisky with a federal officer guess what the media's gon doe with that june first rule politics to not get in the way of your opponet when youreoppon is making mistake very first rol politics just do not do it and that holds true of donald trump as well donal trump should simply stand aside and he should let joe bidon sizzle in the sun that that is what he should do here donal trump sems to be shading his message in a better ways yesterday who was put the failure of the border bill on me which is exactly what your bide wants to day he put out a statement that is much better and much more explanatory which i mayn i when a whener i read a donald from statement oun canti tell what he is writing in what he is not bas done the sin to acon have a sentenceis a structured he needs the lett other people rite his truth social twits his one very good a border bill is not necessary to stop the millions o people many from jails mental institutions located all over the world that are pouring into our country it is an invasion the likes which no country's ever had to indoor it is not sustaintable or afordable and will under crooked jobidon only get wors i had the safest and most secure border in you es sestery i did not eed a bill they are using the terrific sentit bill is way of being able but the border disast r round to te shoulders of the r publicans the democrats broke the border they should fix it no legislation is needed it is already there cay that happens to be true and donal trump sayin is good don trump saying is good at guy's trum's got this gragg abit is got this in texas border convoy to bring it do not st do not it it raised ha lot of risks that are absolutely unnecessary again when your when you'r political opponents are aking mistake allright were suppose to believe that egen caroll who was a gossip columnists to rote a lot about sacs in the nineteen ninetie's was raped by donal trump and as i've pointed out before egn carls claims they do not beare even an a mild scrutiny she does not now what season it was when she was raped she cannot describe the physical lay out of the store she can een checke the time line on whether she is telling the truth or not she cannot tel you hat day of the week she cannot tellyo anything about any of these things she just knows that she metdonal trump in a bergdorf and then he took her upstairs to a dressing room and proceeded to rape her this is what she said and jurers in new york decide decided that she was telling the truth which means that trump denying it and then calling her contival crazy person was a was an act of defamation according to you essay to day jurers originally said that hehad not quotein quote raped her because they were not convinced that trum penetrated her with his ot with his member but they were convinced that he sexually abused her again she had claim more than that egn caroll claimed that he actively raped her with his member the jury found that donald trump had used his digits but not his member that is what the jury actually found base on what im you no tha that dedo make any sense as a jury vertic tet mixno sense you have a witness who claims she was raped ndthen she describes in detail the rape including what was used rape her and the jury says none no i we do not believe you unlike this happle we believe you on this half if no details on li ke where it happened when t have any ofthat cons a but we believe that he did not rape you but e kind of kind of raped you he sectually assaulted you'l be in rapia is a bazargery verdict basicallyes inew york jury that hatestonnels from finding that the hate donal trump donal trump then ripped on the verdict and he said that he did not believe it and he thought that she is liar in a crazy person all therest of the she suit him again for defimation and this time shwen at e three million dollar judgment now the thing about ejn carroll as we have discussed before on the program is that she is not a good witness she is not a reliable witness in her own cause here is a clib from a twenty nineteen interview with sanend and i superduperweird it just weird you do not feel a victim i was not throwng on a ground a rathis whit the word rape carry many fectual connitation this was nots this was not sexual per i just it it hurt it just wat in just i think ros field think rapin as imen it is a violent asault tit is not i think o think will think of rapas thing fexing wit sixshel bryn'k at the fantacies u a start off wit that now the judge by the way in trumps defamation case refuse to allow the admission of that tape into evidence why because that might actually win trump the case he cannot allow that yo can all out the accuser being a weirdo strange person to to come up here none this case makes anyes an yesterday ejn carroll appears the rachel matow and rachel matow asks her what she is goingto do with all this money that sheis now taken from donal trump and she presumably expects her to say some stuff about how she is going to use the money in order to stand up for women in how she is going to fight rape everywhere in the sexual saul cultur and all this and instead egin carroll being a complete weirdo and a noncredible witness says thas n you can see rachel matow wanting to jump over the desk and duck tap her mouth i meant it is wild here we go you have talked about using some of trumps money that you are about to get i to help shor up women's rits do what that might be what that might look la rachel yes i had a t sacturate idea for all the good i'm going to do i this money first thing rachel you and i go shoppin gin to leie wargo that nesus lover din wo rowi knew noi hi ron for rody rachel what wpenhouse a e kno rachel peous an france you wan france you were to go thinking in france no hat'sa jo atas jo metin in france could is something for women's rights i would take tout is fa t i got latle gi ly le carri o moutias watwe as if as if you ne pera a oh oh my goodness that is some awkward laughter that is sme really awkward laughter and that is the person who are supposed to believe was rape by donal trump did not fip about it is not doing tis fropersonal gain he is doing this because she just up sat with what happened to her aled should ly thirty years ago that iswhrt supposed to believe we are supposed to believe that she dnt do this for money when she literally swan rachel madown sec she difret she littl one rachel mat out and she said what she is going to use the money for is not mean she was lying maybe she was not lying although again i have veried significant dow's base on her lack of any sort of supporting evidence that i can find anywhere that would support her story but that clip is insane rachell mattot is feeding her the biggest ofp on the world which is how are youcan elp women in she is i'mn a going a shopping trip shopping spree you arn't going shopping though the rachel n rachels all my god get me the det me out of you are

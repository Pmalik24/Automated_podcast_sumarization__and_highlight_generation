we are in control tits stressful she says and seasy for them toget on each other's nerves with this flight attendant who as jills nemisis for a while she just talked of lot i think that is what fothered me a lot during our down time going into the galley sort of getting away from people it would just be incessant talking and it it drove me nuts nd i think my silente would drive her nuts we did not get along mo coers from flighta them in s night at each other if they are no lik in the middle of the aisle with the beverage cart we have to dew it in a way that the passengers do not know it is happening for example she would say can you get me some more coax from the galley and i would say we are out of coax and she cho the passengers next to us that sounds completely normal but she knows and i know that we are not out of coax and she is stock behind the beverage cart she pisically cannot get there and get them for herself and it is it is it is wore it is war it is this tiny little symbol of hostility rapped in this little sentence about cocola a she might she might try are you sure were out of coax because i saw some back there and i would say no were out she be poweris i gef we hav to do another beverservis she might i take all te red wine and i had to ask her every time for a all of red wine i think i have to ask her for something every time i needed that might be

sleeping together or working together or just stuck together in some way with very different hopes and goals stories of deseption star cross haters to you be easy chicago its this american life a mara glass stay with us at one drean wevil that teddles can make wore senseas this story goes on jus trustme on that in nineteen ity six a man a woman ran into a euess embassy in vienna said the needed asylum therwe from south carea they told emsy officials this incredible story of kidnapping and intrigue and being torn apart and thrown back together and years of dreaming about escape from the kidnapper will at the same time convincing the kidnapper that what they really want to do was stay with him nancy apdyke has the story the woman who was kidnap was a famous south care an actress named chagan he i read a book about it by writer and film produced her name paul fisher he spent years re searching this story she was compared at the time to elizabeth tailor elizabeth tailor imagined it elizabeth tailor passed her prime but still famous from all her kind ros had just disappeared on cha was that beautiful that much of an ikin i south carea and she was gone she found out pretty quickly who had arranged this when che was kidnappedthe nigtine sevenieht she was put on a boat and a boat went to nampo harbor and north carea and she actually has a photo which as in the book of her very first meething with kimjongel he was there waiting for her off the bot wire the photographer and they ad apthographer take a photo an and then sendet to her as till one a remember this exactly remember that time and he is mten tinme had your kidnapton brought to me and s the terrible picture and heis beaming and smily and shehas got her face coverds for years her family and her country did not know where she was this happened in nineteen seventy eight cha was in her fifties and her first sickening guess as to why she had been taken was at kim jonyel had brought her to north carea to be a mistress for his father the great leader cam ill sung who was ruling the country at the time but no it seemed that kimjonyel himself was just a very big fan of chaise movies he put her up in a fancy villa surrounded by walls and bared wire and arm gards she called it in her memoir less vagus meets vlatabostac kim jonl brought her out to display at parties that was chas life for five years untill one particular night and one special party che had been there for a while and she was standing in a somewhere in a senter of the room and she was used to these parties by this point exactly they e routine a she would started sor feeling repulsed by then but people got drunk and groped women and thand they went on forever and somebody had already told her that you notice is goingto be such a great evening for you and she nodded along because she was used to sort of my purboly about everything che had no idea that kimjonel that night was planning to show off for the first time another person he had acquired the man who had direct ed or produced almost all of chaise movies her ex husband chinsang ock shin and cha e did not know that the other was also in the country chin had been brought there the same way chay was but he tried to escape twice he was thrown in a prison camp for a couple of years the best way to thescrime chin steven spellbergs a sort of good comparison o senseas while he made films that were very good very commercial very popular and also produced other people's films had his own studio and he was the most powerful popular fell mycer and south carea arguably in all of souty stasia from most o to sixties an into the seventeies and chin tenday's prive that as yor sillin prison camp carreles for ten days an avella de fattened them up treacherous storm to hal he arrives at the partoy when it is already you no in full flow and he walks inside and as soon as he anters there is applause an what an insame thing and exaysago you are in a prison campyou walk and youare the life of the party hev wens applouding exact in in the pictures ou w his face to look a mesiated you can tell he s gone hrough something terrible to seet dosn fit now cha does not see chin come in she just hears people start applauding and chay is sort of even on faced by this yu anytime cam does anything people get up an applaud to she dn't know why people were pplotting chagli gantill somebody you kna says why do notyou look happy lookes here and she turns around and it speent five years chins got the marks of having beand torture in a prisen camp she does not recognize him right away and and from that point on kim jungill was pulling them together an and i sort of shell shocked hugged one another and and whit tand moved around yu know blocking in in a movisin bak cim jung ill a what night stand here sit here and here you stand next to me smile to th cameras you now they were sorts of te the guests of honor famous people do not get depict their fans kim johng ill was ta superfan who was also unfortunately the son of the all powerful leader of a tetalitarian state shin and chay had made their best movies together kim loved their movies and he wanted them to be a couple just they were in their hay day he arranged it parent trapstyle he told them at the party thet guess what he had a newly remoneled villa for them that they would be living in from now on together making a joke i think he said something an the newly way ogan wought to be alone now an what a werd and had them taken to a car and by all accounts seemed extremely pleased and expected them to be equally and and it is it is the the moment riht after that when the went back to the villa close about thim door turne the falseits on to took an order to li driate privately they turn the fosses on to they can whisper and exiy ofe a private conexact and they just asked one another what had happened wan oa the way she described to is for the lovely moment whch she asks him a happened to you and he said a lot i'll tell you some other time an and he askd how a happened to you and she says a lot i'll tell you some other time and youn a chin cand have gingerley cand asked her you looked very smily and happy and i just have you been brainwashed and and she made a joke about how the director can you recognize acting any more any sort of both of them were finally able to be canuin with some one and and they spent the next several hours going through everything chin and chay made a long turn plan in a short turn plan long turn they were going to escape but they would wait till they could do it right they would not be caught their short turn plan yinvolved a small taperquarter which they were able to get because one of the weird privileges of their captivity was that they were allowed to shop at a department store that sold things that were out of reach for most people on the country taperquarters kim johngill had long and short turn plans of his own for them he told them that soon he would summon them to talk about his vision for their future then seven months went by and during those months schin and cha spent hours nearly every week and kim's huge film arcive he wanted chin and chay to see it and be impressed and they were im did not just love their movies he loved all movies it was against the law for ordinary north careans to watch fareign films but kim had set up a massof bootlegging operation running in countries all over the world he could build up his private collection witd every movie ever made or as close as he could get the arcive was three stories high and heavily guarded at least two screening rooms all for kim only and now for chin and chay chim was bowled over by every detail the to way the building itself was set up to run and and you kow it admiration over how kim had set up his own arkivan and how well everything was kapt geeking out over the ar conditioning sat things and how he was preserving the seteloid and how everything was cathalogue than the staff and how large it was how as it categorized was it by year or by jonra or by director and went by country first and i think hey went by year as they got the in and and there is that lovely tatch where the south rean films in a kind of normal air conditioning room and and the north grean films an a must lavish storge an screening rim n oll bill ding the films were dubbed into carein after being painstakeng wi transcribe sometimes by americans there was an american defector he was one of several actually who would been there since nineteen sixty five and one of his jobs was transcribing american films but just by listening ecause he was not allowed to watch them yet and he would not know that they were films because they gave him any other american efactors the audio for some reason they chopped up the filmsantracts into thei ferent bits in the long orders that hey would not no i ges they en doing exactly enjoy them but he had this experience of of in a transcrabing him an sunly realizeing why this is ma popins cin an chaspent dozens and dozens of hours watching one movi after another in the screening rooms that the film arcive and in their villa which was also outfitted to show movies they do that for months until finally they got word kim is ready to meet with you they went and they brought the tape recorter and the second they walked in and chay had the tapequarter and her a perse an try flicted on and i think unexpectedly kimdrungel jus talked at them mostly for two hours n a kim ringl spoke very very fast and his mind sout of went all over the place and he had a very intimodate thing wat ther slash body guard who kept walking in to to refill drank and empty ash trace chin and cha wanted to record kim for two reasons first they knew they might not be able to escape maybe they would be killed and their children and friends would just never know what hid happened to them or according if they could smuggle it out would at least be proof of where they would been the second reason to record him was that they knew that kim would insist they say publicly that they had come to north carea on their own voluntarily chin and chay were hoping that in their private conversation kim might admit to having had them kidnapped and brought to him and he almost almost did by making a joke in the first couple of minutes of their conversation kim talked about how he' brought cha over first in order to entice chin to north caree i sayd joke because kim laughs as he says it and then all three of them lac it is tyrant management one o one fhe laughed you laugh the rest of what kim said in that conversation well he seid a lot of things but the main thing was north caree and movies are bad and i am sick of it they were making the same film over and over again and that they were too long and to boring and history lessons and and to mo the dramatic and tand says there is too much crying at in tell anybody but in much crying kimjon yel told shin and chay that he knew he was the only person in the country who could get away with saying what he was saying and he told them not to repeat any of it he said when it comes to movies we are in kindergarten and other countries south careea are in college he said if we do not catch up in the next ten years our movies are going to be the worst of the worst movies in the world the problem he said just between us is the people in north carea had it too easy they had things handed to them e have to hostle shin and chaded there is a point an ta thig wet he tells them that e no an i think in e says i parfirs the bay says nat there is no insentive and socialism tginubet ay hid an as might might screen writers i at they will right something they will get their asions a the other gis mak a film tot at their assions i the capaid no matter what theyn that ates turn out that the work exactly unfollow orders im any thim very conscious that ein i needs some one he he bushes himself more than that who is use to having to do more than that the earnest keep kim jhn yel never mentioned another possible reason why north cree's movies were wooden and unambitious fear he kim john yill had written the book the only book in north caree about the right way to make movies and think about movies it is called on the art of the sinnama it is still in print every one involved in norh cre's film industry in the nineteen eighties had to have been aware of the potential consequences of doing something as unpatriotic or insulting as trying to realize their own independent artistic vision without kim's explicit blessing and his fathers it was better to be crappy than sorry the conversation continued chin and chay murmured that north carea's citizens were fortunate to have a comrade leader who understood film well kim jon yill agreed with his permission the three of them got into crotiking specific films a north cree an one called the starvoe caree and while they were at it a sovi at film called mother hat had a dying scene they all agreed had been atrocious they were three movi lovers talking about what they loved and kim jon yll's big plan for shin and cha was that he wanted them to make north careene movies good that they could compete with films coming out of the west and when awards and be shown in theateres all over the world he wanted chay to act to the movies and chin to direct them chinm could have his own film company just he used to have chin wanted to call the company shin film a very bold request in the circumstances he han nothing in north we had been called anything other thand e knot the work is paradise thays at a part he this at a supremelya this or no kimilsong university im was at big kiel but us also ino very telling of shin that even in this seveal situation his first instinct is o kicocokabut can not give the company my name inin in film noir some one is always using somewhat and often people are using each other and we do not find out till the end who gets away with what chin and chay knew that their only chance of escape would be to convince kim john ale to let them film and work in the west kim john ill knew that if he wanted good movies he had to give shin and cha enough freedom to create them all three of them wanted to make great movies but same bed different dreams cim jangal won ed the films for his own purposes and aneed of the films thoy get away from him and it almost his ambition of making film with the world of respect completely overtook any sense of logic the first filmsion and chay am sha had sequences that they shot and east in europe standing in for the hague and ou now tho showed cim duing el te film am he said this is fantastic it is a european film it is the best thing we'v ever mades alad him t start showing it and i never cross his mind that they had done exactly what he would forbidden his own film makers to do for ever for reason they been forbidden to show the world outside north caree they showed people things that they had not been able to see ou n almost in a lifetime for some people in north carea aboyut nineteen eighty three ninet inty for and a seconds that film siry playing in sinimas in north carea ou know the north green audiences did not take in necessarily the hirproduction valuys am all they could talk about was that first ten fifteen minutes shot on the streets of prague where ou know mhey wait the buildings look amazing people walking into business as theyeil dress differently withas cars wet that is what we had an impact because up untill then they had been told you are to luckiest people in the world ou know the workers paradise is the only place in the world wof people have peace and freedom am and and suddenly they saw that that was not true how do that thes were people thought i was lucky enough to an meets and speak to people who would escape from north carea who were iu kno varing ages that the time at they were able to washtee films am and as another at german researcher ind in japana col the hanas chranher whos ton quite to love tolk to the fact was about the same thing and as one of the things that is fascinating is that shin and chase films had a huge impacts straight away yout the ouldoven people an nerlates thirties who would never seen anything of the outside world they had not been filter but het was not just the people sundenly were able to see footage of the outside world but ou knoshin and cha made am a filmcol love love my love which was literally the first love story and north caree an culture post nineteen forty five there was not about love of the leader ar love of the party was litery the firs sime people able to go tothe senima and see something those about two people falling in love and knot was the first time iu noteen agers had pictures on their wall of of a mathnead of anybody other than the leaders shin directed seven films for kimjaniel and then in march nineteen eighty six he and cha went to a hotel in vienna for some film business manage to grab a separate taxi from their north creen minders sped to the ua embassy and ran in they were dbriefed by the s a a and later by south caree an antelligence and they were interviewed by the washton post and other media outlets and stories about north caree are always hard to fact check for parts of shin and chase story theyr recollections their interpretations are all there is but the movies exist ther corting of kim exists kim jenial had told shin and cha in the recorting that when people asked them why they were in north caree they should say freedom for true artistic freedom for chin there were some bitter truth to that because south caree at the time shin an cha were kidnape had been a military dictatorship with very heavy handed censors shin studio had been shut down by the south carean government in nineteen seventy five his career was in ruin s in north carea shin got to make films again he wrote unimbashedly in his autobigraphy how much he had loved making movies there shin always spoke of north carea as the place where he con ov a that the place he associated film freedom with and create freedom worth because he can ask for anything and gat a you kow he asked and one upsid he he ke asked for and a model train to blow up for a scene an he was given a real train packed with explosives on rails to blorup if he wanted to and if he asked for a whin machine he sent holacopters and if yoe ont a fakes know ihad bettes flown to a mountain ou is no expense fare you not cimdringi felts the larger than life film protucer they hereabout ands he did not have the downsides that if fom producer usually has because if hom producus yes tersay no every nownd and we do not have enough money we dill hav enough time sin in jay had remarried in orth carea it kimjenials suggestion and it endit of being a real marriage they were together till shin died in two doesand six these seem to have been each others big love in life besides movies although shin love movies more than chaded maybe a lotmore and there shared memoir of their time and an north career it goes from his voice to her voice back and forth and cont of the second they star making films her voice kind of disappears entirely and it is all his from then on and ekna it is about escaping but in equal measure ats about making the films almost of thi fthe is writing a memoir of his time and hollywad or something chas eighty eight years old living in south carea when paul was were searching his book he interviewed her for it and he asked her about shin and the movies they made in north carea and and you knowhan i mahern spoke tore he could sense the impatience that she had had been able to get out of there three years earlier an no mate any of the films she had been very happy to do and him notso moc and him not much even great love cannot protect to you from the other person wanting what they want ancshe hat di is

whole foods in berkeley were she had a five hundred dollar debt and hotel the tally that is where arran heart got arrested tring to checkin with her license walking in jessaman saw that it was the type of hotel she would never be oll tho stay a and was not prepared for how fancy this place was going to be right away coming in the door they had whine or they had tea and the hotel staff immediately asked me they could help me and as soon as i said this woman had tried to check in here with my idee the gi knew am and actually a he said usually when this happens and as ic godas happens a lot he is to yas and when that happens we asked in to leave in the leave and he said this woman did not leae the manager knew arnd was a fraud because she got jessman's name wrong when she checked in she had a beautifully groom persian cat with her and was standing in the lobby insisting that the license was hers that is when the manager decide to all the police they arrested her they took her away and the cat was just left there with her stuff and they were well i guess we will have to call animal he mean and then she came a couple days later she was released and asked for cat at the hotel and they said will we i'm sorry we sentert o and she was really upset that they t the cat was not there that jessinately was the first moment where i had any kind of sympathy for her and they gave her the number for animal he mean and then she left and when i went to animal you mean we you wan taniml we mame to go trap yaus extracke on a cat well i say you she had been there s i i ta o and nobody knew anything about her or the cet i mean and i just oke it just left and then i photograph th osa jessaman goes home to new mexigo but she just cannot let this go she still dealing with the fall out fighting with herts and a few other places over bills and she decides to do a bunch of things that most of us would not do first jessman sends a letter to arrands adrass saying basically i know it you did and here is what it is done to me she includes an invois for twelve hundred dollars the total cost of her round trik flight to california combined with an hourly wrate for her time and then months later jessaman finds herself back in san francisco for work and she picks up arrand's trail again she has a list of old addresses rrand abof det maybe twenty of them she got from a private investigator and she starts going from place to place visiting arrand's old apartments at one point jessman pulls up to this gorgeous building overlooking the babridge at the time jessman was seven months progment and she thinks well maybe i can use this to my advantage i went to the front dask the secured off'scer in ws he am as you can see a pregnant i really have to go the bath room i'm looking for my cousin are an hart but i'm i nee he is a restrom first you mind andshe was arran hart a ya i know hor she us to live here the woman actually knew her boy frind at the time sh to guie now i do not know for sure and it is just you now gossip but a i had heard that a she had had several thousand dollars of his possessions are whatever that she took off way that never came back and i was oh wow o k she is you now an chesick well you arand or whatever an elas oh yad hotily aran's old boyfriend did not live there any more sug jessaman took a few pictures inside the building and then moved on to the other addresses all of them were deadans n mean i there any part of you that kind of feeling a creep i knew it was crate i knew thaug it was not healthy i did know that but i could not let it go as just something that some one did to me that i had no control over jessman hates feeling she is lost control and whenever it happens ever since she was a teanager she is dealt with the same sort of way when she was around eleven her dad o band in the family her malm and her three yonger siblings then they lost their house and for a while they all lived in a van with her cat and dog her dad he did some pretty extrane things my da tried have me kinnappe but he tried to kid that few er sent some one t he tried to have some one coming i cidn'ot me at my school and then again later in apar and nd my family we ended up going for o some time up to canada that he could not find us later jessaman's malm got really sick and suddenly she found herself taking care of her entire family at some point as a way to deal with all the chaose she started taking pictures things an ambulence triving her mam away screening matches between her sisters trash strewn all over their trailer home she methodically document when she was going through and it gave her a sense of control she continued to use her camera that way is in a dult at one point eight years ago she had a brief scare that reminded her of her dad a random incident r she wondered if he was following her again from that night on i had not i my had i wanted to find him but i did not want to find him and talk to him what is something that you wanted just i wanted to see him i wanted to first just find him i just want to now if i could find him i did i did bunch of searching and back on chackson gouglestuff and he was about thre and half hours north of where i lived jesman was living in oakland at the time and her dad was just north of her living in a condo on the mendacine o coast she started making covert trips up there she never knew how explain this to her friends she kept at simple and told them oh i'm going to spend the weeken with my dad which technically was true just that she did a wearing a blondwig and from a dustance why ta tellphotolandars really far away i was out in the woods i could get a mile or sif i needed to om what did you see he was on the deck he was out for walk he would go to the jim saking out the trash he never saw you no no when you are stocking your dad of your following your dad subserving him observing him what did that feel felt really good to see him and him not now i was there because wh am because i had some nowledge about who he was and what he was doing it was a one way mirror om i could see and and he could not see me and it felt i had some kind of power i do not know much about the identity that business but i'm guessing that the ideal tarket does not on a camera that can photograph you from a mile away two years after jestaman got that phone call from the police she was still trying to track er and down and in february two tha s and thirteen her private investigator let her know that he found errand she was back in jail and about to be released jestmen went with him to a jail and down town san francisco she brought a telephoto lens in e vidio camera then two of them sat around in is ass you v for hours waiting her peet i had a contact told the maron might come out the back ofully one by one people were coming out and the entire time i'm just photographing i just lens pointed at the door and terrified that she is not int e come out shas not to come out were not con finder and we see her arrenheart walked right past her car she hd a coupleof bags hanging off her shoulder and she was dressed jus simen thought ut she was going to a night club tite lecks her shiny pants and wedge boots immediately i thought only gosh we we do kind of look similar she was a similar bill to me which jis sort of tall ish fi sevenfivy but no fuller figurd wider hips and i could see that she had a roundish face i do and she has this bright orange hair and i just thought of my days and my teenag ears dying my hair that exact orange this superbright orange and i just felt this uncanny connection to her i really did and then from there on for the next several hours wich just a dren o o than two other pies working with them and seper car they all trail therand whose first stop was a convenient sor wer she went into my cigarettes an the ligter she hung outside for a few minutes noting then gon a public bus arran got off right in front of a good willstore walked in right away pece says jump out and going there go after and iws oh shi talke her iu na lik i thin thinkin oh ok he is a noter o do not talk to her jst just go in get your photographs get a good look at her just go cococotand i jumping out freeking out onl ma gody just leaving me here with her what i and then i see ofm na angeral in there the other p ye i oke i'm looking at them for kind of cuse and they are not remotely giving me any kind of cuse and then i just go for it and i go up to her and i do not say anything to her i just stand across right across the rack of clothes and the good will from her as she is going through pulling clothes all looken changing her mind very expressive oh now i would never wear that ike a kind of cure in my mind what she might be thinking from her expression and i mat an angle where i feel she cannot really tell what i'm doing made i'm just checking my e nail or something i'm just looking at my phone and i take some photoes of her but how nervous are you meing you are literally now you are face to face i'm shaking i'm very nervous definitely and i think there is a part of me that is still thinking i could just talk to her rate now errand he errent i could just say that ie i could hur myself sang erin heart am i know you pow we do not recognize m i knowing do not kno me am but iam laure old justlemen level a and you used my idea to do a number of things but i just th the power for me was in seeng her without her knowing that i was seeng her then she disappears into the into the dressing room and that is when the mother pan comes over to me and says she stealing clons ows an one to ei just needed to gen out of ther i was overwhelmed i was feeling realliy i's feel really sad for her and i did not want to feel sad for her i wanted to feel angry at her it was hard to maintained the anger because she was looking at errand and remembering things she would done when she was young and her family was broke i had shop lifted nice cheese or i literally stole the rocola things that i thought and associated with class middle totan upper middle class and i think that is what really was giving me thi sympathy for arand heart was i could identify in away with the desire to be some one else i could see how a path in my life could ave led to my beat in that moment i i really could but it was i guessed a little disappointing i could guess it was a little oh i kind o wanted it to be she was a criminal and did sonetheg fad to me and it just was not that non of that satisfaction of i got her it was just surn of this weird its transition and anger was starting to be sort of replaced with empathy what jussamen did nex does not souwnd empathetic at all when he first hereabout it but for jussan then it was the logical end of her search she went through the hundreds of images she taken and she put together a gallery exhibit it had survellant shots of erand the court summons plece reports bills and pictures of places where her idea had been used she done this once before with tha surveillance potive she took of her dat in fact her whallet was stolen while she was setting up that exhibit which is what sent her down the rabit hole of trying to find arand in the first place she called the new show dear arand heart an one of the idems on display with a sealed letter and a pluxy glass box she asked the people at the gallery to give it to eran if she ever showed up there it was not a dramatic letter just a way of telling erand that she would been looking for wan to talk jessaman did not see putting aran's name an photoes out in public as fr venge but not every one sought that way you are vectim of idanity that whit o consider tracping down the thiefe and turning the table this is from the to daysho in an nac some have described is feveg levell followed and photograph the woman whos told e wallet and then her identity i reached out to aron hart through her probation officer to talk about all this i sent a couple emels listeing everything justman says about her but aron nevery got back to me i could not verify whether she was responsible for bills justmen got from herts and wholefoods er any of the unpaid parking tickets and tolds or whether she shop wat tod from goodwill or stole from her boy front errand secretly posed is justanen and

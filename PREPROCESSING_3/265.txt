this story in the early nineteen sixties during what my mother referred to as the tale end of the lassy years my parents were given two collies which they name drastus in duches we were living then in new york state out in the country and the dogs were free to race through the forest they napped in meadows and stood knee deep in frigid streams coast ars and their own private dog food commercial late on january evening while lying on a blanket in the garras duchess gave birth to a litter of slickpotato sized poppies when it looked as though one of them had diged our mother placed the creature in a casser old dish and popped it into the oven the witch and hancil an gretel oh keep your shirts on she said it is only sat on one fifty i'm not baking any one this is just to keep it warm the heat revived the sick poppy an left us believing that our mother was capable of resurrecting the dead face with the responsibilities of fatherhood rastus took off the poppies were given away and we moved south where the heat and humidity worked against the best interests of a colle duchess is once beautiful cot now hung in ragged patches when finally full of worms she collapsed in the ravine beside our house we reevaluated our mothers healing powers the entire animal kingdom was beyond her scope she could only resurrect the cute dead the oven trick was performed on half a dozin dazed in chubby hampsters but failed to work on my first guinea pig we died after eating four cigarettes in an entire pack of matches do not take it too hard my mother said removing her oven mets the world is full of guinea pigs you can get another one to morrow youlegies tended to be brief our motto being there is always more where this one came from a short time after duchess died our father came home with the german shepherd poppy for reasons it were never fully explained the privilege of naming the dog went to a friend of my older sisters a fourteen year old girld named sindy she was studying german at the time and after carefully examining the poppy and weighing it with her hands she announced that it would be called mathon which apparently ment girl in what she referred to as douch when she was six months old mathon was hid and killed by a car her food was still in the boll when our father brought home when idendtical german shephard the same cyndy crisand as mathon too this tag tean por gression was disconcerting especially for the new dog who was expected to possess both the knowledge and the personality of her predecessor mathon one would never have wet on the floor that my father would scold and the dog would sigh knowing she was the canine equivalent of a rebound mathon too never accompanied us to the beach and rarely posed in any of the family photographs wonce her poppihood was spent we more or less lost interes we ought to get a dog we would sometimes said completely forgetting that we already had one during the era of the matrons we had a succession of drowsy secretive cats who seemed to shary uniqu bond with our mother it is because i opend their cans she said though we all knew it ran deeper than that what they had in common wete their claws that and a deep seated need to destroy my father's golf bags the first cat passed into a disagreeable old age and died hissing at the kitten who had prematurely arrived to replace her when at the age of nine the second cat was diagnose with feline lukhemia my mother was devastated i'm going to have said he put to sleep she said it is for her own good and i do not want to hear word about it from any of you this is hard enough as it is the cat was put down and then came the anonymous postcards and phone calls orchistrated by my sisters and i the cards announced tae miraculous new cure for feline lukhinia while the callers identified themselves as representatives of cat fancy magazine we would to you sad he is our covers story and we are hoping to schedule a photo shoots s to morrow possible after spending a patless year with only one child stol living at home my parents visited a breeder and returned with the great dane they named malina they loved this dog and proportion to its size and soon their hearts had no room for any one else and terms a family there six children had been nothing more than a failed experiment malina was the real thing the dog was their first true common interest and they loved it equally each in their own way our mother's love tended towards the horizontal a pet being little more than a napping companion something she could look at and say that looks a good idea scoot over why do not you a stranger peeking through the window might think to the two of them had entered a suicide pack she and the dog sprawled corpses their limbs arranged and to an internal embrace my father loved the great dane for its size and frequently took her on long amless drives during which she would stick her heavy anvil sized head out the window and leek great quantities of phomi saliva other drovers pointed and stared rolling down their windows to shout hey you got a saddle for that thing when out for a walkd there was the inevitable are you walking her or is it the other way round our father always laughed as if this with ha first time he would heard it the attention was a dictive and he entoyed a pride of accomplishment he would never felt with any of us it was if he it was as if he were somehow responsible for her size and stature as if he would personally designed her spots and trained her to grow to the size of a pony when out with the dog he carried a lechian one hand and a shovel in the other just in case she said just in case what she die in you need to buri her i did not get it now we would say it is for it is for her business my father was retired but the dog had business i was living in chicago when they first got malina and every time i came home the animal was bigger every time ther were more marmurduke cartoons displayed upon the refrigerator and every time my voice grew louder as i asked myself who are these people down girl my parents wuld chockle as the puppy jumped op panting for my attention her great patted paws reached my waist then my chest and shoulders antill eventually her arms wrapped around my neck and her head towering above my own she came to resemble a dance partner scouting the room for a better offer that is just her way of saying hullo my mother would say handing me the towel used to wipe ufp the dogs bubbling sea pidge here you missed the spot on the back of your head the dog's growth was monitord on a daily basis and every small accomplishment was documented for later generasions one can fined few pictures of my sister tiffany while malina has entire volumes devoted too her terrible toos hit me my mother sat on one of my returns home from chicago no wait let me go get my camera she left the room and returned a few moments later o kay she said now hit me better yet why dn't you dispretend to hit me i raised my hand and my mother cried out in pain ow she yelled somebody help me this stranger is drywing to hurt me and i do not know why i caught in advancing blurr moving in from the left and the next thing i knew i was down on the ground the great dane tearing holes an the neck of my swetter the camera flashed and my mother squealed with the lift got i love that trick i rolled over to protect my face this is not a trick my mother snapped another picture oh do not be credical it is close enoff with us grown in out of the house my sisters and li foolishly expected our parents lives to standstill there was posed a stagnate and live in the past but instead they constructed a new we consisting of malina and the founding members of her fanclub some one who obviously did not know her too well had given my mother a cheerful stuffed bear with the calico hearts ditched on to its chest according to the manufacturer the bears name was mumbles and all it needed in order to thrive were too double a batteries and a regular diet of hugs wereas mumbles my mother would ask and the dog would jump up and snatched the bear from its hiding place on top of the refrigerater yanking it this way and that in hopes of breaking its neck that is my girl my mother would say we do not mumbles do we i learned that we liked morally safer but not my wallas that we did not mumbles er thunder but were crazy about stand gets records and the aranian couple whod moved in up the street it was difficult tho keep straight but having known these people an my life i did not want to be left out of the wee during the final years of matron too when the first half of the malina epic i lived with the female cat named neel my mother looked after the cat when i moved from ralley and fluirdte chicago once i'd found a place and settled in neel was old when she moved to chicago and then she got older she started leaving teeth in her bowl and developed the sort of breath that could remove paint when she stopped cleaning herself i took to bathing her in the sint and she would stand still too weak to resist the humiliation of shampoo king wet i could see just how thin and briddle she really was almost comic one of those cartoon cats checking her fur coat at the cloakrim of the seafood restaurant her kidmeys shrank to the size of raisins and though i loved her very much i assumed the vet was joking when he suggested dialisis i took her for a second opinion thet number too tested h er blood and phoned me at home sane perhaps you should think about youth an atia i had not heard that word in a while and pictured scores of happy japanese children spilling from the front door of their elimentary school are you thinking about it he asked yes i said is a matter of fact i am and the end i returned to the animal hospital and had her put the sleet when the vad anjacted the sody in fina barbatall neal fluttered her eyes assumed in apposition and dide a week after putting her to sleep i received neel's ashes in a forest green can she never expressed any great interest in the outdoors i scattered her remains on the carpet and then vack himed her back up the cat's jath struck me as the end of an era

college life the last of my thirty inch wast my faltering relationship with my first real boy friend y cried for it all and spent the next several months wondering why few songs were written about

when my mother died malina took over her side of the bed doe to their siges great danesgenerally do not live very long my father masiged her our thritic legs carried her up the stairs and lifted her

final ten years of his married life she detended my father's retirement lived through my sister's wedding and knew whoeveryone was talking about when they mentioned the em words mam mumbles and morly

have made a mi stake she is an ice enough dog but the timing is off when walking the puppy through the neighborhood my father feels not unlike the foolish widower stumbling behind his energetic young

three foot wingspan and im i fell in love with her immediately and im i i was still in high school i had no money whatsoever how expensive was she she well shthe price tike gon the cage sad fourteen hundred dollars which was an inordinate amount of money hellin do to take you to pay off the bird it took me about five years to pay her off working part time jobs baby sitting and and what did you love about her what was the thing that drew you to her i i ca i find it hard to to to say exactly why i was drawn to her i am i i thought she was most beautiful thing i'ad ever seen im it is hard to describe how how it feels to love an animal but as soon as i saw her face i i just thought she was the most beautiful thing and i had to have her and i and i wanted to see that face every day and i want to care for her and and i did not know anything about bringing up parrots or feeting them or caring for them i just wanted to take her home a big a treasure look at fast forward twenty three years when you first brordcast this story vronica was forty years old married with two twin boys cilan cameran eige five another boy daniel who was eight wone i thing she did not know about parrots when she first saw her mac call is it thin't live for eighty years eighty shevery morning she would take the bird whose name is giddyon out of her cage sho she could threely wantod the house and get into things she should not get into a baby climbing into laundry baskets and ripping up clothes and taking the kids poking mon cards and ripping them to shreds and pulling newspapers out of boxes it at breakfast you have get three little kids thear the kids well interract with each other and gettin will scream as loud as she can over their heads nost play recorting of a gideon for for people it sounds really loud it is intolerable it is the sound that you do not want to hear it sounds very dina store alike ye well wellthe word you just used was intolerable it is it is the most unpleasant sound i think i have ever heard but you have lived with this sound for for twenty three years im i've lived with that sound for twenty three years im it is in my dreams it is wherever i go it is in the kitchenets in the dining room at's in my bedroom and the kids have have grown up with her re they they will not really notice it at at first but after about the fourth of ix screen they well i'm start covering their ears and shouting back at the bird and thet you take little interviews with your kids about gideon here is cameran who is five do you having gideon in the family loreally would you rather that she went somewhere else yea alway just ca to anglan se dorder to scream tor watching chevy would you rather have a different kind of pe then gideon ye off dog des early nice in tis a bite and does in bark but do you understand why mamma lives gideon oh lo this is cile the other twan also five why time she just olmer baggy mi rmihl li kkind and scare e i'm there terrified at gideon if they are approached by her they will immediately screaming run away i'm they will not go near her now and this hat because gideon is infective little dangerous the the right to be lttle scired well gideon dgideons i'm primary objective in life is to be my mate and every other person or creature that comes near me is a threat to our relationship and my children our a very big threat to our relationship because we have a wit physical contact with each other she sees me carrying them and cooking for them in touching them and picking them up and i'm she has a a desire to kill them basically i mean in the bird world she would kill another a preditor or some intrusive love interest now after your gids were born than you saw how gidon reacted to your childrennd and you saw how youre your children reacted to gideon they were scared im that gideon bit cyl im did it change your feelings about gideon i do not think anything can change my feelings about gideon im but if i had a dog that i loved and and then i had a new babyeon the house and the dog was hostile towards the baby i would not feel the same way about the dog i would feel protective of my kid which i'm sure you you did well i i do feel protective of the children and i take certain steps to protect them from her but i cannot i cannot om stop loving her because of her natural tendency to want to drive away competition as i said this is a love story and the vronica knows gideond striving everybody else who she loves crazy she loves the bird the same anogamiss feelings lat gideand mean to every one else ma gidon fantastically sweet to veronica gdon watches her every mo coddles with blushes gidon actually blushes when they way togother she is all the gideon lives for nd is ar to turn away from that thank gideon vronica also worries that she gave the bird away the bird would die the mate fiercely that sometimes when their maid vanishes that can happen an nar gideon it is setting and then there is this story when vronica was eighteen and barely own gideon for a year she took gideon outside with yiu did every day and gideon flew away ronica had not an careful enough clipping hrethers she was ract every night vro could crie herself to sleep every day she sat on the roof watching the scas after six days a kit on his way to school spotted the bird and i went i'm quickly ran to where he said she was and i saw her and probably the tallest tree and immediately i'm scaled the tree got all the way to the top which was about i was up about fifty feet she was on the end of the branch all the way out and i i i inched my way out and about i'm three cores of the way out i was only a foot away from her the branch snapped and i fell straight down without hitting anything on the way and just fell fifty feet and landed on my feet ofm on hard ground and im i suffered a multiple compression fracture of my spine and i had a collapsed long i should have ded according to the that orthopedic surgen do you think the fact that you nearly died trying to save giddeon is one of the thinks it makes it impossible f you to giv gideonoup that some something i thought about yet's quite possible i i feel it is brought us closer it is not a pcleasant thing that happened but i i feel i'm she would have died out there do you say that it brought ust closer but you are the only one who actuallyndderstand that you went out you gat injurd trying to save gitdein gideon does not understand that no she does not understand that but i know she understands something she is very bonded to me she became close to me at one point that she im her hormons prettuced an egg and that is something that happens only between couples i know she feels something om i do not really need to know much more than that an the and i thinks is only partliet story about peronicas leveen t's oss her story about her familyas levt for her hat they put up with the bird and we ll want to believe that the people who love us wo at least accept the parts of us that are not appealing and if ronicas tates the unappealing part just happens to have physical form and be a bird every day that her kids in her husband put up with that they proved to her just how much they love her i isdol ly likin to li her le houh wehe she costs a lot of money i hom went ye she cost li one thousand four hundred dollars o just for aparint why weld they do i amust remarkable thing i thnk abouter trays i love you is how rarely it is used literally to me i love you that i have a feeling of love for you if use much more often i think to mean a hundred other things tell me that you love me or in ned to get off the phoneman or thin's ae fine between us right or yes it is fined that we keek camparent oo coming ut one of

animals that his mam could and could not bring back to life thi's another stoy about what it is that animals can take the place of in our lives an in our homes it is pes a fiction from riter raty youtall it was three days after our old man died that my brother donald accomplishe the most spectacular deed of his life i wish i could have been there to see it donald taking the greyhoun down to nogalas all by himself bying the baby armadllo for eight hundred pacis from a pie faced indian woman at the santa coona market tucking the little thing under his arm a football and running the length ofh the pedestrian border station past the heat struck tourists in their sombreros and loudsocks and the dards with their side arms and wacky tockes pushing through the last steel tooth turnstyle and sprinning a madman into the heart of the nogalas slums an anto o o it was his proudest moment though it did take him the rest of the day and half the night of wandering among the hookers and street corner punks to find a bust that would bring him back to aho where we lived there he was after i came home from hours of frantic searchion sitting stiff back on the couch beni the little armadela was rooting at the crotch of his pants and donald's pink sweating face had screwed itself up with such a grin of utter self satisfaction donald ended up giving the armadella to me but present he said something to make me feel better i thanked him took the armadella which clod at my tea shirt a cat and gave it a little squeeze what else could i do my fatherad workd as ta janitor for twenty one years but he was also a reader of books a scholar if it is possible to be both the scholar an a six great drop out and one of his favorite subjects was zoology he could bore you into a coma with what he knew about the great hornd owel or the common meal worm for the laughing hyenas of africa but of all the beasts of the animal kingddom he loved and admired the humble armadello most no not the smartest of the prettiest he would say when one of them scatted across the highway in front of our old le mans but the hardiest who see what i'm sayin the most resourceful he often promised he would get us an armadela for a pet but he died before he could come through an end all hard attack standing in line at the grocery store i was seventeen donald nineteen our mother a gwadomall and migrant worker would married my father under the impression he would one day be a rich man who could buire a cattalac in a house with a swimming pool had run off when we were babies it was just the two of us now it took me about a week to get over the shock and then i did what i had to i dropped out of school started working full time pouring concrete for hossenfeffers and moved donald in me to a cheaper apartment near the macoman son's recking yard were donald could watch the cars getting polverized from our window we got money from the state that paid for donald's medication but the rest was up to me donald was really something else what could be done with the guy who ate his own ear wax who carried a maroon many bible in the band of his underpans and red random scriptures out loud and in a propriate times who could be sashane about the room one minute doing a dead on impression of sammi davis junior and the next be down stairs in the clos grunning a pig and trying to tear his haira from a distance he wouldn have been able to tell him from any other tea nager he had relatively good hyging did not usually talk to himself and public and was something of a hansome devil with his dark hair hanging down over pale green eyes sometimes i would take him to a party or a dance with me and the girls would flock around us he could be as charming his hue haftener in short bursts before he would have to run off and hide in the bathroom i remember once when i was nine or ten and we were playing in the back yard he kept pestering i in saying i am the indian you are the cowboy o kay i told him to shut his trap i was busy building a cave for my armyman he would not give up me indian you cowboy oke doke over and over damn it donald you freek i hollered do whatever you want but just shut up for a second i'm not a freak he said sticking his chin out ill right then i said the next time i looked up donald was on top of the dog house with the bow and arrow set my father boht for him at a gorrage sail he had the arrow notched and pulled back to his ear just the indians we saw in te ve i had not notice before but now i saw that he had taken off his shirt and tucked at in the elastic of his shorts it looked he was wearing a loin cloth and an used a little blood from the scab on his elbow to make fiendish redstreaks across his face he was doing it perfect really just a t v indian i did not believe he would really shoot me i just sat there a jackass my hands full of dirt i did not see him let go of the bowstring but i certainly did hear the fhop the arow made when it hit me in the chest dead senter more from the surprise than anything i fell flat on my back it was only a target arrow but it pierced my sternham just enoug to stand upright from my chest waving around sluggishly a reed in a river i lay in the grass and stared up at the kneon yellow fletching of the arrow my hands were still full of dirt donald jumped down from the dog house and stood over me he was smiling an oded satisfied smile as if he was expecting to be congratulated on his marksman ship he looked down at me for a long time before he gently put his hand around the shaft of the arrow without pulling it out he said might smack dab in the heart white n i told donald i wanted him to name the armadello after several days of deliberation he decided to name it after odis bhe happy drunk on the andy griffith show who our father had resembled in almost eariy detail i'd gotn used to taking care of donald alone i had no choice but odis was a different story first of all odis smelled he gave off a musky odor that intensified whenever he was nervous or hungry and no matter if we scrubbed him raw with industrial soap and water the smell would come back in an hour or and then there was the furniture armadillas or burrowing animals this is something i learned from my father and in the confines of our small apartment odis did not have many opportunities to burrow instead he would marched through the house a tiny gray tank and moved the furniture around he would waddled into the living room put his blunt forehead against one of the legs of the coffee table and bare down inching it around the room his little squirrel claws scrabbling on the rood floor at least once a week he would crawl between the mactress and bocxstrings of my bed and take a dump my father was right about armadellas they are hardy they are resourceful and if o odis's typical there as dome is donkey crat sometimes in the course of his incessant apartment wandering odis would find himself trapped in a corner and wuld spend the rest of the evening andtempting to claw his way out odis was technically my pet but donald cared for ind lurried over him tormented him teesed him then made up with tearful professions of regret and affection while i was away at work they would do things together donald would carry odi saround outside conversing with him rooding in the weeds ind the vacant lot searching for earth worms for crickets for odis's dinner sometimes donald would hide behind the recliner and when odis passed by would jump out and shout in a high suppranal wale look out odis poor odis would spring two feet into the air a startled cat his leathery body twisting his claws clutching at nothing and once he would landed he would scurry into the hallway looking back over his shoulder and barrisnent in those little piggy eyes his kind of living arrangement was no boose to my social life i can tell you if i ever wanted to bring a girl home i figured i'd have some difficulty explaining why the apartment smelled a bears dim why the furniture was strewn around and why my brother was naked and hiding behind the couch waiting to scare the daylights out of an armadilla it took five years before i found some one i loved enough to bring hoald allison was good about everything told me i was a saint in a christian to be taking care of donald she was wonderful and beautiful and good smelling i could barely stand it eventually i proposed to her after which i went home to talk to donald it was springtime in the desert the smell of cackt is blossoms everywhere and i was full of love and desire i could barely see straght allison and i had decided that we would get an apartment near by that wash my new promotion at hosson feffers and allison's job at the county court house we could afford our own place and with the help of the government support donald donald would be all right as long as we checked on him daily made sure he waes taking as medication and occasionally washed down the place with a monia the smell when bother the neighbors i have to admit the thought of escaping from donald and odis and that cave of an apartment was almost as enticing as the thought of being together with allison at home when i sat donald down to explainthings to him i could barely get a word out i studtered and sdammered kept wiping my mouth when i finally made things clear donald whipped out as many biable and frantically page through it but could not seem to come up with anything the first time i had ever seen him at loss for a scripture he yanked at his hair and ground his teeth together until they squeaked finally without saying anything he snatched up odis who had been napping under one of the couch cushions and went into the laundry room slamming the door behind him i felt kicking that doordown and ringing his neck could't he at least tried to be happy for me to think of somebody other than himself for one minute i wanted only to be with allison and i hated donald for making it difficult hated him for the years of responsibility and obligation and lost opportunities hated him in the way only a brother can hate the brother i took a few steps toward the sdarewell to leave i did not care i was going to stay at allisons i first nigh'd ever away from donald when i heard a splashing noise for inside the apartment the laundry room door was locked and i shouted donald's name but got no responts i tried to kick in the door which was made of something cardboard my foot went right through it once i had my leg free i looke through the splintered hole and could see donald hunched over the overflowing utility sink both arms submerged up to his byseps the back of his neck was purple and pulsing full of angry blood and it took me only a moment to understand he was trying to drown odis i unlocked the door and grabbed him from behind but he resisted me grunning and plunging odis deeper into the water i wrestled him out into the living room ere we fell sideways against the couch donald twisted away from me and stood up the watter dripping off his elbows forming a puddle around his shoes odis was curled up in a ball just when he slept and donald began to shiver badly that he lost his grip and let odis's body slide out of his hands and hit the floor with a wet slap donald's face twisted into a mask of concantrated greef see he wept see what i did looking at my brother i felt all the parts of me that had been opening up since i had met allison collapse on each other many empty rooms hit would have to be me and donald brothers inseparable no one else alowed i do not remember if i looked away or if it was as sudden as it seemed but one moment odis was as sad wet corpse as dead as an armadello could be and the next he was huffing and twitching and scrabbling to his feet donald let out an arching shriek which sent odis zigzagging into the kitchen where a mad chase ensued donald slipping and flailing nocking over chairs and pulling down the drapes still choking and sobbing now with relief he finally hurdit odis under the table once he had pulled him out he held him up his fingers locked in a death grip around his little body and cried odis is resurrected odis is resurrect a fair trade donald got his armadillobac and i got to mary allison never again did donald show any sign and jealousy or resentment he was the best man at our wedding red a lonald section from zeph and iat the reseption and even bought us a gifta book called hot sec for cold fish things went well this first few years we saved up enough to buy the concrete business from old hossen feffer whor we tired to wride his harley around the contment and donald and odis seemed to thrive together we stopped in to visit as often as we could allison cookd dinner for them on tuesdays and thursdays and we paid a house cleaning service to scrubb the apartment down every week but the furniture back in place and steamd the carpets donald had his first episode one night while i was and phoenix at a heavy a quipment action they found him digging up the lawn and front of the city first bank blabbering about how difficult it was to find high great earthworms on the south end of town when the cops tried to approach him he pelted them with dirt clods and threateneed o fistfull of worms if they got any closer he spent most of the night in the holding tank before sheriff braskey figured out who he was and gave me a call a few months later donald climbed an old elm at the city park which branched out over a sidewalk he managed to pee on a few passers by before the groundskeepernocked him off a branch with a well thrown rak we took him to a doctor who adjusted his medicasion and suggested the donald be put in a home where hecould get the care and attention he needed where he could socialize with somebody besides an armadello i brought up the subject with donald but he told me he would rather die thand give up odis and go live in a house with a bunch of half wits and knuckleheads the only other oction we knew was taking in donald and odis ourselves allison was eight months pregnant with our second baby the business was really starting to take off he just was not a good time we told ourselves he might be able to work something out in a few months when things had settled down by the end of the summer donald was dead the call came in the middle of the night they always do sheriff brasky told me the donald had been hit by a car on eighty seven near the refinery he had run through traffit completely naked dodging cars and sprinning down the medium until an old coupled in a minnyvan clipped him with their bumper knocking him over a temporary still divider and on to a concrete platform where he was partially impaled by a jutting piece of rebar he bled to death before the ambulance arrived after i went to the hospital to identify his bady i drove out to the accident side for half an hour i combe both sides of the highway without a flashlight until i found odis cowering under a piece of discarded plywood his left foreleg was mangled nearly torn from his body and he was bleeding from the soft flesh of his belly i drove him over to the only veternarian in town larry oleander and pounded on the door antill he answered larry was an old retired cowboy with a glass ieball and i dent in his head where a mule ad kicked him jesus geronimo christ he said it was four ofclock in the morning i held odis out to him and he said what you have thereis an armadello fix him up i said son he said i do not know what you think do it larry oleander peered up at me he sied and held the screen door open come the hell on in larry amputated odis's leg stitched up the wound on his underside and bandaged him until he looked one big wad of gauze when i tried to pay him he waved his hand in front of my face took a slug off a bottle of bodca he kept under the operating table jesus richard just promise m you will never make a peep about this to anybody i took odis home and he has been part of our family ever since over the last few years i have added on a wing to the house just for him he has a room with the skylight and two bay windows his own pillow bed to sleep under and a bunch of old furniture to push around his far as i am aware he is the only three legged armadello on earth with his own personal waiting pool allison is not thrilled about having an armadello in her home never has ben but she knows it is important to me the kids we have four of them now cannot stand odis either they want another pet some kind of happy slobbering dog or and i'll bino snake to impressd their friends odis is not only real real dumb they argue but also smells do to and not sure which is worse i tell them they are correct they will get no disagreement for me but odis is our pet and were going to love him no matter what i tri not to let myself forget how blessed i am y beautiful family my dream house up in the hills a successful business that pretty much runs without me i am happy and satisfied most of the time but every once in a while maybe once or twice a year something will come over me a dark mood that i cannot shake usually at night when everyone is asleep and the house is quiet and i'll get odis out from under his pillow bed and take him upstairs i run a bat sitting on the lip of the tub holding him close to my chest the way he likes it usually ig just let him paddle around but sometimes and the tub is almost overflowing i take him firmly in both hands and plunge him into the water there is not a clock in the bathor i count one alligator two alligator three alligator this is how i count off the seconds odi struggles a tiny lion for the first two or three minutes writing and spasming wildly sending up a boiling foam of bubbles figting and scratching with everything he is got and i hate myself or what i'm toing t him usually between the fourth and fift menute his mon hy starts to lose his will and his sthrashing weakens as he gradually curls up in on himself a flower dying and goes utterly still this is always the hartest part for me the urge to pull him out his almost unbearable but i go five or ten second longers an the last time one alligator two alligator three alligator four alligator five alligator until i cannot stand it any more i lift him out and he lies there in my hands a deflated sockerball and i'm sick with dread knowing that this time i've taken it too far i've killed him i stared down at him and wait hardly blinking wait for that first twitch or jerk for is nostrils to flare with life and usualy there is an almost imperseptible shutter from under his hard shell a stirring and his tail will begin to vibrate a piano wire and he slowly hesitantly opens up and stretches himself clawing the air and coughing a newborn sitting on the edge of the bath tub with odis wet and dripping in my arms i'm always overcome with the same vision donald clutching a newly revived otis his face slick with tears trams form from a man twisted inside out with grief to some one awestruck at the realization that oure worst mistakes can be retrieved the death can be trayed it in for life that what has been destroyed can be made hole again with a sudden surge odis struggles to get out of my lap he is an armadillo and there is exploring to do i let him down and watch him slide around on the linoleum and try to push the toilet off its bace and i feel a small bitter joy lodge in my heart odis is resurrected i whisper i carre y him to his room and make sure he his comfortable under his pillow bed and only then whill i be able to walk peacefully this the dark quiet halls of my home kiss each of my children good night and lie down next to my wife to sleep orady

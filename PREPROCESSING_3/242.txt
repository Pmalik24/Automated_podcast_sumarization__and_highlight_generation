old film won her computer thire's something that she show lots of people sinc she for sas it is hen old sovie movy from nineteen thirty six this is film called the circus it is kind of the russian version of its wonderful life it is that classic black and white maybe that comes on te be all the time it is heart worming that everybody knows but thon when i saw what was happening i was what is happening am ye i can ha plak there is this beutiful gonan and si singing in the centr of the circus tent she is an american who ha's come to russia to perform and then this man just ert screaming stop the show stopped the shel a solimy explain who he is he is german to be honest he looks a little hiltery the mustache whatever oh when it is that to ti sic sir pipers on the rise yes and he is in love with this american circus star but she is rejected him and to get revenge he is going to reveal her secret to the world thi secret daes she is been keeping throughout the entire film and then he brings out this black baby chchthe thebabys a todlersise ye maybe maybe too and then the german he runs up the stairs and he holds the baby up almost simba and he starts shaking the baby and screaming she slep with a negro chshe gave birth to a black child you ring the sup titles now shaking this child over and over again he is a black child a black child and then this guy comes up to him jus this russhang guy and audience and hes lake what is the problem and the germyexes is a black chheld a whik woman ga ve through a black child i wel the russian't get jhus literaly shrugged his shoulders yet he shugd his olds an hes a whet and the german guy goes off on the speech and puts the baby down and and the taller he just sort of walks off and heople anaudience the they sweep the baby up in their arms to protect the baby from the guy yet and they are passing this black kit around all is he is white russian folks and they are laughing at the gu ye he is lik why r you laughing why is this funny remember it is nineteen thirty six in the you esk fer more than thirty years before inneracial marriage is legal everywhere i mean it is gim crow black people are still being linch tgi and to see thi scene where this guy is being told by all these white people mind you you are crazy this is no big deal what is happening here nd as they started to do more research i learned that this was part of sovie propagan to for decades this message america's rasis we are not an nineteen twenties and nineteen thirtys african americans they actually moved to the soviet union because it was promising a better life the boy in the film that black baby is actually the sun of an african american who moved to the sovie union in the nineteen thirties while and i have not got into the last bit of the scene which is actually my favorite part of the whole thing this lake russian woman is cradling the baby rocking it back and forth and then she starts singing to him mister dreams stepping soft make is he'n anoys yes si shes totally putting this baby dother h putting he babe to sleep yet and then she passes the baby to this next person and it just becomes tis thing where the're embracing this child one from the next racking it back an forth and singing to it the other thing that is happening in this sene is that the're all singing in different languages the sovie union at this time they are all these different astnick groups and then thet they are all embracing this back baby o what i'm latching this black babybeing embrace i wonder was it true would black people really be embrace that and for the in istav in in in the soe union for the african americans who whent over there and left escape braces and did they somehow actually escape bracism because that is a quessin thet i think about a lot hen i go somewhere in the world and escape racism yer i had a year or two where i really thought about this salat a i was working is a journalist in ferguson covering months of protest and ia community really a at is covering a community that was encracis after the shooting death of michael brown and i had just had this experience where i felt a just seen some of the worst parts of american racism from watching people threaten other people because of the color of their skind she just looking day after day the social in equalities that exist in saint louis and the structural things red lining and it was kind of hopeless are i felt kind of hopeless about it at least of the time and i was a little bit i think i just have to leap here i i used to almost play this game as a coping mechanism where i would think about where in the world can i go i would talk to my friends about gona ar central americar places in the cravingam dou think it is better there could it be whutd it be better there to be a black person there it jus seing this made you wonder about russia and did it work out for the black americans to move there i do not necessarily othink that russia is a better place to live as a black person im but for those people who did move there in the nineteen thirties and their kids nd their grand kids what roll did race and of playing in their life how did it work out for them thes ecally the thing that were on be talking about in general want to ay s pro gor we have stories of people who deside im goud go somewhere i coun move there i but a try to fit in i we see what happens and folike one an ac we are calling black in the wasi sar oh that is ceasy you came up wir that day owat i was j thi's good a rare for that act to be for descendence of those african american expats in russia and just explained who you found i' get a the woman that i found her name is youlina hunga im and she wrote this book called soul to soul she is a black russian born in race there and i do not know i sort of felt a connection to her them where i read about her because she is a college atholeyte i was she is a journalist i am a her grandfather is from the same county in mississippi that my grandmother is from we and i i do not know i sord or just felt connected in a way how did you find we originally ye i your book oh you read the book i read the book yet cause im i said elina is a journalist she had a successful talkshow in moscow they call her the russian otbra which is o most definitely because she is black and had to talk sha it was her grand parents who move to russia back of the nineteen thirties they had a left is new york version of a rom com meet kou her grandmother bertha was a polish jew who been arrested at a woman's rights demonstration her grandfather oll of her gold and was black and had been rested down the street at a human rights demonstration and they met at the jail and in the morning a the rabbi came to they ly ran mather out and my grandmather said o wonderful could yo please bi me out together when why nou friend allve golden the rabbi her father saw that oliver was black and her father looked at her a said well you sting an jal weging friend and left them there and that is how they love story began tho weird a weird mamakers situation but it work the couple did not see a future for themselves in america they decided to go to the soviet union oliver had visited before and they wanted to help bild lennen's great new society one that promised no racism oliver and bertha settled in news becckastan my grandfather foult there would be some kind of a kinship bet e an afric and americans and the dok kin yous bi people that is why he chose to go there and dam he worked as a ex fort in a cottn yes her grandfather left the american self and travelled half way round the world to work and cotton he developed a new breed of cotton that would work for resbecca stand's short growing seasn and life was good they made good money had a naces apartment anyany for when their daughter lily was born in nineteen thirty four oliver wanted her to have everything he thought white kids cot in the united states lily had language tuitors music in tennis lessons but ther life got harder after they became full soviet citizens and lost their foreigner status and after stallan began to sollify his power they started to live everybody else oliver died in nineteen forty lily grew up and went to college in moscow she married a politician from zansabar elina's dad he died shortly after elina's birth the only consistent black presents in her life was her mom the neighborhod she grew up and all white from a very young age being black and constantly explaining herself to the world my best friend was sasha he was a neighbor and since my chaldhood i thought he was my brothus because we were to get all the time in this street when somebody would ask me why are you black he would say nombe want she is my sister nombur to she is black becourse her father was from africa and guess what everybody's black f and that would say ya but she was borne in moscow she supposed to be whit and jus says o geyalena if somebody else ask you the question about cala we would just beating them right away we were known in the neighborhood as the most cruel fighter hetought me how to fight we told me you would take a bottle you break the bottle and would this whatever's left ejis put ti face we were on a bed kids in the neighborhood this was when she was only seven years old russia was not some racism fr utopia people yulina obviously came up against what i would call racism but when i asked ulina about it that was not racism that was curiosity that was ignorance but not a racism this happened a lot in our conversation yuli know would tell a story about some experience that sounded honestly horrible to me but she would always insist that it was not racism or discrimination it was ignorance i think tha ignorance can be and often is racism but i did not wanted to bate that fact much as understand how she thought about it oliv people commented on it yulidi did not think too much about the color of her skin when she was a ch hild she did not feel different because she was black but because her family came from america it was not until she started thinking about boys in love that she thought more and more about the way she looked how much she stood out from everyone else and i would ask my mother mam why am my ugly why is my nose big why on my lips guge and she wuld say no your beautiful and then she would ask her american friends to bring american magazines black and lovely i think it was colld blacke and lovely and my move would show me those magansis say look those beautiful bwomen you look just them and i wous take this i would proud i would take this magazin bring it to sasha and other friends in the street and say look i'm just them and they would say yelana this is a very strange magazine why is everybode blake in it do not bring those magazinesin any more and i felt lonely ah because i did not have anybody just me i'd assume that there would be a little community of all the black russians thut they would stick together and hang out all the time but it sounds eolina did not have that was not around peopl that looked her not even her mam really lily was much lighter and gorgeous according to olina just for the record when i met eulina i thought she was gorgeous there something regal about her it is hard to imagine her as a self conscious tea nature but she was my mother would always remind me ah let us say she would tell me be careful would boys they would not date tou because they love you but because they would want to try dating a blake girl and that is why my self was ste was damage probably because i did not trust any russian gy that would approach me and i did not believe that somebody would fall in love with me at all sincerely i wanted to know the ways in which being black shaped yelina's life in russia and to hear her tell it her family was never denied an apartment because of her race she was never put into an inferior school because of her race she was never singled out by law inforcement because of her race there was not that kind of institutional racism but she was lonely she felt undesirable being black made it hard for her to imagine a future with a partner much of my conversation with her was about wanting to find her persion ther strong desire to find some one and her fear that she would not despite her insecurities elina was popular and accomplished she took music lessons spoke perfect english and was an excellent tennis player just as her grandfather would have wanted her mother constantly reminded her that she had to be better than everyone else apparently you still have to be twice as good in the soviet union she was recruted to play tennis af one of the countryes top universities and accepted into their prestigeous journalis an program she had much going for her but she still felt ne boy would ever wanto date her antil she met vacia he was a chess champian ah a'm go well i sawt it in animalscastate university sa i was a dennis playe het was a chestplay and da we were beautiful ful and dom he had a very rough time dating me than ah the coach ah physical training coach of the university cold his parents and said do that hes tating up girl and and this said well yes why was wrong and this because she will get pregnant and she will marry him then he is parents called my mother and said if you think that your daughter will make our son merry your daughter your wrong and then my mam saidt if you think that my daught for mer yos sin you dan wronges noway mi gorgeus daughter bo ery yo wi saand it was dos going back and forth back and for the he felt that he had to demistrate that no mater waght he wull be with me he started missing his glasses and he would come to my classes and sid there the teachers from his glasses would write him you have to attend you have to attend fombombo the end of the story was very sad he was kicked out of univers tupo mii classes and he ws taking to the army we he h had gn o the army ye yet if you a kicked out of university you have to go to the army wow that was my first experience tating i isioul for it ye a pretty dramatic and to he first relationship but the drama did not stopped there for elina a few years later she did a rushing guy from baronish a small town about at das drive away from moscow they went to visit his parents and staye for the week and one morning she came back from the shower and caught her boy friends mother examining the bed sheets and later i asked my woor friend what was she looking and he said was she no was sor people of caloso she thought that the shes beturt and she was very surprise at the worekly but again it was do races it was pure ignorance pure ignorance and this woman adored me later but i felt that enough is enough and it is time for me to to be wit people that nos for i am dont oa misets and do not ask stupe eons something was missing freelin an russia and me in her grand parents she decided to look olsewhere for answers she thought she would find them in the very country that her grand parencs had flad america julina had heard about american rasism but she still thought she would be better off in the euessay when we saw ady murphy a when we heard about our to ash were we heard about those brilliant a me musicians and jas musicians and all of them were black and very very very successful when my grandmother would stop telling me about a rasism i was say yah yah ya right and think about all those vheryfamous african american atlates that would be laughing all the way to the bank a i felt that i would be understood much better by people me and dam in fact yes i was thinking an i was dreaming about going to united states and marrying an african american when you pictured and dreamed of going to ameri ca why did that life look how would this guy look wit hen i nid my oon i said life but i guess we nots again description of the guy aya see i was not really dreaming about skyscrapes and a capitalism and all that i did not understand about that but i just felt that a what is this song onday a the he dam he will be tall and black a aat a who son was that i my jeryyour prince wuld come thlah webe yese actually it is the man i love it is gershman not disny but what do i now my parents are most exclusively less in to stevy wenders in her visions fror misto my childhood i was expecting to me t prince that would look me and he would look at me ant yousay o my got ye was gorgeous because even the guide that really really loved me wasia in the university he used to call me monkey he called me monkey would love he did not realize that that was insulting and i never told him that in america that would be insulting but in russia aguyes would call that girls a rabbit i do not know my cat well he called me my monk heand i could not explain to him that that was races because i knew he wass not to reses that is just how he called me and i felt what cafe i looked a monkey and what waits o it i called you monkee yo did not say hay that is not you cannot do that but he did not insult me he didn mean to insult me he loved me and as i told you he was punishd for this laf anr i would have trouble with thoui nkno i know i know i songs terrible to you i know eolina moved to america in nineteen eighty nine she was twenty seven years old and she built a life for herself there she worked as a journalist she made friends blackfriends he loved to go to black churches and lessened a gospel music alive she went to salans actually knew how to style black hair and she found her blackpinch charming he was perfect he was perfect he was plain tennes he laved yes shelhe classical music he was jest prfect for me they day did for a few years eolina was sure he was going to propose and then one night he invited her out to a fancy restaurant i got dressed i prepared i knew what how i will answer hso we go to this restaurant a ther offence o restaurant and dam them the reseption they tell us that we'r sorry it is bact but there is just one blace near them bathroom and he says no no no were not taking it and i said no why not he says well by one o sit near the window i said well t does not really matter window bathroom i mean exclain the food is the same cause i wanted to hear the proposal o e i did not gare where we were sitting yeso he lad no than he said youl any you do not understand our grand parents were figting they were dying for the right to sit at the window not at the bathroom and i said in russia unless you bride but an if you will not get a table regardless of your collr as long as yogreen you will get it pleased stop thinking of the feeling insecure and he said what we would never understand each other your black outside but your white inside you dot understand what we went thrule and that was the end of our ppos the fandi early yes yes yes because it showed that we were different and he said that we would never understand each othed she agreed they are different pain points in russia she hadn'nt experience a kind of institutional raceism he had and she said her boy friend could not possibly feel the things that upset her as a russian the way she felt them do you feel you fully understand african american the the sort of painpoints ar no i understand them but i do not feel them that i difference the things that upsets er let us say african americans i can see why that upsays but it does not her bhen he said to you your black on the outside but your way on the inside what was your reaction to that i thought he was stupid i said how could i be black hn and white oit inside i am i mean i'm whoy am and the things that i went through you do not unto stand did you gis ever talk about race before that that argument that you have in the restaurant was that a conversation ou gas had are not at all no he no we did not talk about that no with did it surprise you when it came up in the restaurant yes it did because i still do not believe that if they did not afor us a place near the window it meant that detwes racism i still do not believe for you it feels easier just ti sort of give a little bit of the benefit of the doubt arve i cannot i cannot know for sure whether what the attempt what the intention was i a i a no out you and i do not want i do not want to think about it i do not want to damage my nerve system by think ing about that it i will never know the truth nomble one no but to it can be both not but to iat can be both and not but three what difference does it make it is o interesting that you say that just because i feel it is a thing we do all the time in america is that we we replay out these moments of discomfort for each other in the black community over and over and over again fo what for what i had a meaning what if you told me that you i'd ded that and a result as it result this restaurant watz was close for example or isn' result this wato was kicked out that make sense but why going through that again and again and again without any results why scretching the place till the first blood on your body but but i think part of the reason we do it is to recognize the lake thes this is still hat this is happening lake we must acknowledge that this is happening we cannot pretend it is not happening yes i acknowledge it but again if i was was sit down at home and stoped all they did it because i'm juish no they did it because i'm black no they did it because my grand ban resaw american no thet did it because on that and that and that that there is no end to that i think for many black americans there is a curiosity a need to understand and explorer that constant unease wy experience because i'm black is my doctor giving me proper care because i'm black an i here to fill a diversity quota tbecase i'm black and i being pulled over part of what it means to be black here part of what draws us together is an investigation of that discomfort there is com me no reassurance in that i know that black people are not a monolet yet the fact that youlina did not have this curiosity surprised me but it also made sense yeulin di did not have an echo chamber of injustices growing up i can talk to my her stylist my trainer my family ans they hate this thing happened yeulina had no community to share wit nobodyd to cosine her problems were not those of black people but her own i want to be clear being black is not some joyless exercise for me i would not treat it for the world an not moving about but youlin is right about one thing thinking about race all the time is exhausting but i cannot let it go and i try to explain to her why i feel part of it is it it all it theyre small things that i feel in someways at a to one really big problem that just still has not been solved that it is lake it is small things that ata to feeling you do not belong here that the country that you have always that you have always existed and does not want you and i i do not know i had this mer i had this dream that yes some war there was another world where i belong t and this is america now with you i do not understand where your dream how i do not know where mi o a i i do not know were i do not know it at i tad to ad fright are you talking about going to afric i do not esn think it is necessarily back to africa i think i do not know if this place exist i think it is just this this place in someway still does not accept me after all of this this time and that may be this is as good as it gets and maybe there is not another place ar better option do you do you think it silly that i think about these things much yes i think thiss silly that you think about it 's much there are more important things in your life that you you do not have to waste your time on things that you cannot change and do you do not have to change those people if that is how they are but that you you do not i do not think you have to waste your life on changing them you just drop them and go on with yr your life do not worry about the things you cannot change sometimes i think yolian is right that i'm silly for obsessing over this stuff nd i wonder if maybe she is better off for not having spent her entire life puzzling in picking over every in her action with white people that maybe her grand parents moving to the uessis are helped her by pass parts of america's particular brand of racism thut maybe i never really had a choice race specifically black and white such an intrgal part of living in this country yeling ansist i had bigger things to worry about but honestly i cannot think of anything that affects me more being a black american is what keeps me from feeling i truly belong in this country have you ever felt you belong somewhere have you ever found that place ah what ah for me it is not weare it is smor with home that is what was important for me when i lived in the united states it was important that i will surrounded by people i really loved it does not that to where i am as long as i surrounded by love that soll that matters i wish that surrounding myself with people i love solve my problem i am surrounded by people i love a lot of thise people are black and as long as i feel threatened on behalf of all of them i cannot stop wishing there was a better place for us yeling is better place turned out to be right where she started she lived in the you e say for twelve years and might have stayed but then she met her husband a white russian man and they moved to moscow where he did treater i cens us it was hard to find a black salon in moscow aback them heu wud flire at paris just to get our hair done manyul bury s whon tomise o russia tiks to yo lenit any cosky to making a not can entury about black russians that include youlan a conga coming up if i gets kicked at of a thing he had no idea he could get kicked out of that is in a minute miccago bob a greadio when our programme continues tust markin life frm y re las to day's programme get back to where you once belonged stories of people who do not feel quite at home where they are searching for their place otheir

more he fixes his own truck kills his own goats when yeu walk into his living room there is two buckheads on the wall a big t v and in the middle of it all the thing he is most proud of on a little shelf incased in plexy glass ah this is mythey promine just as bed or the emigration o spectr bed that was it is kind of surprising that raoul and of working for emigration given how he first met

they all met just a few hours later at a starbu raoul sat with his father and the two investigators at a table inside no one ordered coffee raoul's dad marguerito told the investigators the story that raoul had always heard that raoul's mom cross the border he would be borne in brown'svill then the investigator showed him the mexican birt certificate marguerito looked down at the table he admitted that yes raoul was borne i mexico at home yes his birthdate was in nineteen sixty eight not nineteen sixty nine yes raoul was a mexican cirtizen he had been textog me during the day the thraoul's wife

have him an i would not have my kites i'm thankful for that what ad any pointthey coult a said wait i need to tell you this and they never did raoul's sister saw it differently they do not blame their dad margerito they tried to convinced raoul that what their father did was forgivable even understandable back then onauthorized border crossings were an unremarkable fact of life the border fence the agence surveillance blims that all came later wespecially after nine eleven margarito told me he regrets getting the fraguen ber cetificate now he prides himself on being honest and he said he is ashamed to face raoul but it did not seem such a serious offence at the time it is hard to get exact numbers but one in vestigation in the nineteen nineties found nine hundred fraguent ber certificates registered by midwifes in south texas same as raoul's the undoing of raoul's citizenship set off a chain reaction in his family raoul's son who he would had from a previous marriage he got in his citizenship throu raoul here is aneet again what av was thn what at was to my daughter lon my grandkits and he gives tho pourt it at people art binking a but tat ye kno thit is that ripple of fet raoul broke the news to his son raoul junior that afternoon after he left the starbux he explained the whole thing raoul's citizenship was no longer valid noi ther was raoul juniors now they were both on documented incredibly raoul junior had just applied to become a s v p officer himself his interview was coming up an a coupl o weeks now of course that was not it happen raoul's lawyer told me that when someone raoul signs up to serve in the government by joining the military working for c v p the government does not look too hard for reasons why they cane it is one the person asked for something in return a greencard for a brother thut the government takes a closer look rafter that day at scarbux raoul and annita immediately made a plan for ow to fix all thens raoul could just apply for greencar because his wife as a citizen it would be a hastle but they would get through it they filled out the application and raoul and his raoul way was superp frun about everything he knew what he was up against he would made a false claim to you a citizenship said he was an american when he really was not but there is a clause in the ues emigration coat that says if he did not do it knowingly the government can exercised discretion he and anita were hoping that u s i s the agency that issues green currens would see this allis a big mix up granting the exception and they would be done they thought itwould happen quickly actually which was not the case for a long time they did not hear anything long they started to get nervous the star to looked for help from public officials after all raoul's a veteran lawn forcement he reached out to their congressmen then ted cruise the senator that is not the fullest why told him the other day sand he know i sid we bol voted for trump whonn't we call him it a hey call me out press i voted for you i said i now better not he might come ic te portu an temwher wer we be even a e a al see ta cass o cortbes i sent her message before we contacted you she never responded everywhere they looked people were turning their backs that thing about our custom's officers arnts was to hang out with undocument to people that was raoul now all his friends the coworkers he re ferred to his family they almost all abandone him en theory his wife and ita shouldneeve be hanging out with him one person who did reach out to him that lady who used to bust his chops in the bridge when he was a kid raoul explained to my producer notty aremen she thought i was having the fi lacial troubles and she called me up and se offor to give me money but she is aythinde about year he know you sti is not sip fer anything that no i told her i tell her i guess ye were right who wil she say she jus starte lefing she is isi aou do not say that another friend whoed stood by raoul and still season is john ag aur sea the jag it is is initials they met for breakfast at a mexican place across the street from an emigration to tencion senter for kids he jag is allowed to see raoul cause he is retired left customs last year said it was too stressful he wanted something more relaxed he became a drill sergeant and a boot camp for kids who get in trouble the goss ip without work who got a promotion bout that got with the dog brag abot his a id yo wont i i thed and the jag's encounterg tat woment in the cargo tin remer lo lacke da it is he ou slawyer lawyer she slap me all she did lonbuy yet s she she ed up the freekon di o my met os coming back much strong ventually after about forty minutes they finally start talking about raoul's situation about how he is afraid to even leave the house li ri now i do not have any stat is at all new i can get stop rigt now and i can get t portit would he migt o set up what he poi an was its it a and my siht te e o it the was its aitl en more difficulto to to deal with because if i gess not my monment oaow i'm uhoner me wil i have not that is riht now can i really go out i i go out bat and wokan over my solra wi ye al hes o e w eis aen ti o i a wo is agle raoul tells the jag he is been waiting wait too long for an answer on his green cart i'm sorrying to get really frustrated he feels the government singling him out because he was a customs officer he thinks theyre trying to cover out the thing imployed in a documnt an immigrant by mistake for non he says is over and over said it to me lots of times but the jag's not sure he is right he says meme the government wants to show the do not give any one preferential treatment unfortunately it if it ever comes out e pagan have to show it i wuo e we just t we give him what he deservei everybody else youl why ave we brik an all he wilgerlo give him an exception everybody's going wit a wiman you can et why the jag does try to make raoul feel better tells him he is sure he will get his citizenship eventially he asked raoulf he is talking of his dad he is not the jag says he should but ultimately what leaves an impression on me is that he talks about raoul's case any other an unfortunate an document in person raoul sits there taking it all in but looking he does not really agree oraoulind and nita had been waiting for nine months when they finally got called in for the green cart interview a needa said ie was a jarring experience these were officers the guiyse they both worked with were the first ones to jump in when things got toht they would had each other's backs for years if any one would get that raoul had done nothing wrong youould be then but that is not what happened we were treated criminals they took a sforn statement from each of us they took two from him they were trying to trip im ofper trip me up for something and and o blame that the specipic officers that did the interview you do what your told o if i did not need my feteral cid i would have told them all to go to hell it is about as dramatic reversal as you could imagin raoul was a hard ask rule following lonforcement officer who would learned he would been violating the very rules he would been enforcing for almost twenty years did it change him did he see things differently did the rule seem fair now that he is on the receiving end of them we talke d about this alot raoul says the cases hes thinking about now or the ones where he stuck to the rules and did not give people o break and as a result they suffered badly there is this one case a brother in his sister they were both really young they were being smuggled we had tolike called the consolate nanand arrange transportation back to the home countries the turns out that a this little boy was sir he was comein to thonly that a inorgant to his sister who was diing the uston he was going a dod do not it his one of his kitneys and we conny one hat him go to save this little girl's life and the little boy was man i got a go i have to go and is i no we cannot and we had to turn abek he stots crying an crying and crying and now what is wrong eh what is going on why you crying si left my bible over there will just give yu another ones an on all that is my bible ah it this point in this interview raoul got out of his chair got some water from the kitchen hows arrument take your tan ah we s o man this the an i have not cit in a long time to here your good we just had to turn m over and that was it ti tall he was doing it for a good reason is do not sont he felt hey was o something good and then he was being treated t that well this is the story he is always felt bad about but it feels worse now think him part because he can relate to the kid a little more do some one trying to do the right thing caught on the wrong side of the rules it is also a story where following the rules makes you do a thing that also feels very wrong you placed a lot of hate in the rules yell because when you did these difficult things that you had to do deported tean or turned back the this organ down our child it was ort of essentially the ruls or the rules i cannot do anything about it and now that you are on the receiving and of that do the ruld seem more arbitrary to you or meaning less than an used to no they don i still believe that the rules of the rules thi still a pli and a i have to abite by them i still have to follow the rules il regardless of what the outcome is of what what happens and that is the frustrating part is that they the have gone overboard on my my case on my my my my situation ther the'r doin things differently with me because who i am you essee i asked will not commin on on going cases but i ran this by four emigration lawyers and they said everyone is being treated badly i did not think raoul was being treated worse than any one else one intexas who has a lot of experience in this exact connin case sad shirt two years ago raoul would have gotten a green card but since president trump basically everyone of frodulent wors certificates is denied in fact if anything she said he s lucky did not lock him up or put him into deeportation proceedings there is lots aways is is hard for raoul his wife annita she told me she thinks a lot about how raoul never wanted to grow up in texas with his ant uncle and cousins how if he would had it his way he would have stayed in mexico with his mauman dad working on the farm in the end somehow the choices his dad made deprived raoul of a home on either side of the border all those years that my husband was here growing up with his ant and uncle suffering without his mam an dat but he would miss his mam he always tell me i wish i had goin morn in mexic because then i could have stated with my maum an dack and now at the age of fifty he mings now thand he could have had that and made lighe to him is not tire time is lik no what was a because they did not want me raoul has not doc to his dad in months since that day at the starbux it totally tastes how i see im mill to wor i i thought he was my heel he was even th let hin't gow up with em i took him to hart i strongly believe in what he told me what he said and that one o the things was dad that bere be as honest as you can at'tl that will a for that will a fell i'll ever see why bet again fifter this has as he reached out no let it'l at'll let'll think at let us see i over agin months tik byt then a year with no de cision by the government about raoul's greencarred application then on october twenty ninth of last year raoul got a letter from the government his greencarred application was denied they said raoul had made a false claim to you a citizenship said he was an american when he really was not atd also pointed out that he would committed voter fraud by voting is an undocumented immigrant of course raoul thought he was a citizen at the time he thought voting was the right thing to do araoul's world has shrunk down to a few acres that he and annita own he keeps goats cattle a bunch of chickens he watches the news in the morning while he walks in the tread mill his badgan integrity award or still above the t f he and anita had dreamed of retiring in their fifties and driving round the country in an rv maybe visiting their kids at college are on a base if they decided to join the military now they cannot leave town they re border patral checkpoints on all the major roads heading out of the valley after a career of working double shiftson overnights he finally has time to himself to think maybe too much the stress of being undocument is getting to him he only sleeps for two or three hours at a time he and anita started fighting raoul worried for a while they were headed for divorce his lawyer told me that raoul could be in this limbo for three or four more years before exhausting his appeals raoul told me he is thought of just giving up and leaving it would be drastic but he would bring this to an end if the corts ultimately deny him a green card and he is ordered to leave the country he told me he would go he would obey the law he said i'm going to practice what i preach he would moved to mexico as a former border officer who would a restance muglers confiscated loads of drugs he is worried the cartells might come after him they would still see him as a you ask customs and border protection guy the way he wishes everyone else would jemmy raff is a reporter for the atlantic gust e da print version of this story at a short vidio documentary we

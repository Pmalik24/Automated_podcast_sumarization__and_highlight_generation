welcome to the huberman la poncans s a science sciencespace to ori mandeur hubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor justin soninberg doctor soninberg is a professor of microbiology and imminology at stamford school of medicine and one of the world's leading experts on the gut microbiom the gut microbiom is the existence of trilians of little micro organisms throughout your gut and by your gut i do not just mean your stomach i mean your entire digestive tract turns out we also havin microbiom that exists in our nose in any other location in which our body interfaces with the outside world in fact there is a microbiom on your skin and while might seem kind of intrusive or and of disgusting to have all these little micro organisms they can be immensely beneficial for our health meaning our harmono health our brain health and our mean system functione doctor snberg teaches us about the gut microbiom how its organized spacially meaning which microbioto live where he teaches us about these incredible things called crips and niches which are little caves within our digestive tract that certain microbioto take residence and at that promere real estate they are able to do incredible things to support our health he also talks about the things that we can all do to support or microbio in order for our microbiom to support our brain and body health doctor soninberg coruns his laboratory with his spouse doctor erico soniberg and together they have also written a terrific and highly informative book called the good gut takin control of your weight your mood and your long term health even though that book was written a few years back the information still holds up very nicely and today he also builds on that information informing usc about recent studies that for instance point to the important roll of fermented foods and the role of fiber in supporting a healthy gut microbiom if you heard about the gut microbiom or even if you have not to day you are going to hear about it from one of the world's leading experts he makes it immensely clear as to what it is how efunctions and how to support it for your brain and body health during today's discussion we do not just talk about nutrition we also talk about the impact of behaviors and the microbiom behaviour such as who you touch who you kiss who you hug whether not you interact with or avoid animals whether not those animals belong to you or whether nothey belong to somebody ealth if all that sounds a little ate bazaar you will soon understand that your microbiom is constantly being modified by the behavioral interactions the nutritional interactions and indeed your mood and internal reactions to the outside world this is an incredible system every one has one everyone should know how it works and everyone should know how to optimize it and to day you are going to learn all of that from docro soniberg before we begin id to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and researchrold stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens at letic greens is an al in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and thereason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all f my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will give you fie free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fi free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and petassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok com slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase the're all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok com slash huberman and now for my discussion with doctor justin sonumberg justin thank much for beeng here an to be i am a true novice when it comes to the microbiom i to start off with a really basic question tis what is the m icrobium i imagine lots of little bugs running round in my got and i do not quite the image of that but i'm aware that or microbium can be good for us but we can also hav an unhealthy microbium ifar were to look at the microbaum at the scale that i could see the meaningful things what would it look and what is going on in there yeh i mean the essentially youre correct a mean we have all o these little microganisms running round in our gut i think you kow just ta start off with clarifying terminology a microbaium and microbota quiet often ar referred to are used to refer to our microbial community interchangeably and all probably switch between those two terms to day the other important thing to realize is that these microbes are a not just in our got but there all over our body there in our nose there in our mouths here on our skin and a basically anywhere that the environment can get to a in our body which includes inside our digestive tract of courses wou know colonize with with microbes and a the a vast majority of these are in our distal gut in our colan and this is the got microbioter got microbium and a the an density of this community is astounding i mean it really is a a if you get down to the scale of a being able to see individual microbes a you start off with a zumed out vieu and you see something that looks ou kno feecal material the digest inside the the got and you zume in and you start to get to the microscopic level and see the microbes they are just pact side to side and and its superdents bacteral community almost a a biophim theyyou know something that is just made up of microbes to the point where a it is thought that ou know round thirty per cent a fecal matter is microbes thirty to fifty per cent you knw it is a it is an incredibly dense microbal community were talking of a a trilians of microbial selves and all those microbial seles if you start to get to know them and see who they are a break out in the got probably to a hundreds to a thousand species depending upon how you tofine a a microbial species and then e most of these are bacteria but there are a lot of other life forms there there are arcea which are little microbes thetr bacteria but ther their different a there are a you cariotes a we commonly think of oucariotes in the got is a as something a a parasite but a there are you carriotes ther fungi there are also little virises there are these bacteria fages that infact bacterial selves and a and and those actually outnumber the bacteria ten to one the're just everywhere there they killbacteria a and ther thirsies really interesting creditor prey iner actions but a over all its just as really dense complex dynamic eco system and and were we are talking about the human as a single species but were also thinking of the human as this complex inegrated eco system of hundreds to thousands of species interacting and concert to do all the fantastic things that we know happen in the human body amazing s we have got a lot of cargo to r may be were the cargoye os ye i mean there there have been people that have likein a human stojust a really elaborate culturing flask for microbes and that we have actually been designe over the course of evolution a design to a just a efficiently propagate this microbial culture from person to person from generationto generation it is a different way of thinking of the human body interesting i believe that our a p h where the th p h of our a digestive system varies as you descend as you go from mouth to to throat and stomac and you said that most of the a microbiotare in the distal coone a are their distinct forms of microbioto all along the length of the of the digestive tract and within these othere a interfaces with the outside world totally yes it starts with our teeth in in our mouth an saliva there is a a oral microbiota a these microbial species are very different in the ones e find in the digestive tract there a usually a built to deal with oxygen very well ther in an area that is exposed to a lot of oxygen they of course see different neutriancs than for incstance e calonic bacteria would see an they grow quite often an in mats that live on teeth there there struck their very structured in terms of an a and not a moving around ta lot they their very fairly stationary as you move down the digest avtract there are micrubs in ar sophagus in our stomach but those are those communities are are not very dense and actually not very well studied we know of a very a there is a very famous stomach bacteria known as helicobacdor pilory which a can cause stomachulsers and cause gastric hancer insomesome a a less frequent situations but the a this is a a a very different a different set of micrubs t afto be adapted to a different environment in the stomac especially incredibly acitic environment a but also very different in terms of their ability to interact with other micrubes just because the communities ar less dense their less dynamic a there is less netrients that stay there and passage through the communitie the alot oftimes those communities are reliant upon neutriens derived from the ho st as opposed to nutrients derived from our diet as you move down out of the stomach into the small in testan you start to see these communities which are the ones that are becoming more well studied a small an testhan is still a bit of a black box just because it is hard to access and there some really coal technologies out therefor using for instance capsils to do sampling as the capsul passes through the digestive tractso that we have a better idea of what is going on in the small inteston and then you get to te coin and this is the community that is incredibly ou kno densely packed a doing a toni that there is a tonometabolic activity happening there nd a a bunch of interaction with the host and that is the study that is the am community that is really the best studied part of the reason for that is because stool is easy to obtain compared to ference and something in the stomach or small in teston and that stool is fairly representative we know from studies that have been done using colonoscapies and forth stool is fairly representative of what is happening in the coland a dense superexciting community but also the best study just because it is the the easiest to access in a lower digestive track very interesting a i imagine these microbioto have to get in there at some point or micro biota seen in newborns a in other words where do they come from and dare i ask a what direction to the enter the body yeer is it fror multible directions ye yat great question one of the burning questions that we can come back to t the into this as where is our microbio to come from because it is this kind of ou kno exestential question in the feeld where where is this community assembling from and the the reason that it is such an interesting question is that a a feetus when it is in the womb if that is actually a steril environment a there have been some studies that have looked at a whether there are microbes in the womb and and microb's coloning colonizing the feetus at that point a there is some debate about this but over all it looks thats not a big part of the equation of microbia colonization and a each time an infant is born it is this new eca system it is an island rising up out of the ocean that has no species on it and suddenly there is us landrush for this open territory and and the you kno we know that infants go through this really complex process of microbiotas assembly over the first days week's monte's years of life and then you get into a switching to solid food two to three years of age a there is some changes in a childhood adolescance working into a dulthood but that first a zero to a one year is a super dynamic time with really a cand of seriotypical developmental changes in the got microbioto that appear to a have the possibility of going wrong and to a c sing problems for infants in some instances but if you step away from that extreme side of things going wrong there all also where a lot of different trajectories that developmental process can take because are microbiota s maluable and plastic and those trojectories can be effected by all sorts of factors in early life an example is whether an infant is born by sea section or born vagenally we know from a beautiful work that is been done in the field that a infants that are borne by sea section actually have a a got microbiota that looks mor human skin then it does either the that the birth canal the the vigina microbiota or a the mothers a stool microbiota babies that are born through the birth canal have initial colonization a vagenal microbes and of stool microbes from their mother and just these first days whether your born by sea section or through or through natural child birth your got microbiota looks very different and then compound on top of that whether your breastfed or formula fed whether your family has a pet or does not have a pet whether youare ex posed to anabiotics a ther all these factors that really can change that developmental process and really change your microbual identity eventually in life the reason that this is a that the field is playing paying really close attention this ind studying this right now is because we know from animal studies that depending upon the microbes that you get early in life you can sen the immune system or metabolism of an organism or other parts there biology intotally different developmental trajectory what microbes your colonized or with early in life can really change your biology and we can come back to that later bu awe should the that getting back to that original question of where your microbes come from you think because you are borne through your mother's birth canal or expose tor skin microbes that a lot of your microbes would come from your mother but it actually turns out that we can certainly detect that signal we certainly see maternal microbes in the infant but there are a lot of microbes that ar coming from other places a surfaces other people perhaps other caregivers but perhaps a strangers as well we acquire our microbes from a variety of sources the first ones are are from our mom or from our caregivers from the hospital but then we add to that tremendously over the first year or of life credble you even said t a pets it a ivikidin if there is a dog in the home or a parokeet in the home that clearly they have a microbiom also in potentially the child is deriving microbioto species from from those pets exactly ad the i the a b s studies that have been done if just let the pts in the household as a fact or and whether that changes a the group of infants that have a pet to look slightly different than the group of infants a do not have a pet and then the question is what what is the pet doing to change those micrubes and some of it is probably actually contributing direct members of the microbiota actually we a i have a dog that dog a occasionally will lick my mouth without me paying attention and that is probably introducing micrubes a we elso nof the a petzer are down in the dirt there outside there there there being exposed to a lot of invire mental micrubes and just a pet serving as a condo it for a bunch of micrubes that we would not otherwise come in contact with a is a is a possibility as well a what we wll return to a pets and in particular your dog an amazing dog by thew i met your dog just the other day and i had to force myself i depry myself away from havenews or i havnt in cred what was your dogs an louis louis louis pastor louispasteura i erit a amazing dog let a personality on the dog a the the issue that i i think a lot of people are probably wondering is what what is a healthy microbium and what is it what is it supporting we we hear that you need a healthy microbium to support the amiune system or metabolism or even tha got brain access how do we define a healthy versis a unhealthy microbium some people might know the unhealthy microbiumas disbiosis is the word that i encounter in the literature but youven that there'e many species of microbiota and given that i think we probably each have a signature pattern of microbiota how do e tofind healthy verses unhealthy microbota is there a test for this am later will talk about tegnologies for testing microbiota there lot a companies now lot people sending stool samples in the mal am never look at the postal service the same way again but there it is out there and it is getting analyze it how should i think about this i i can think about things heartrate heart ra veryability ah be am i a all sorts of metrics of health how should i think about the microbiota how do i know if my microbium is healthy or on health ye it is it is a million dollar question right know in the field and there is a lot of different ways of thinking about that and i can talk about some of those but i would say that a there are sessions at conferences there review articles being commission ther all sorts of kind of thought pieces about this right now what is a healthy microbito what are the features that define it and i think before diving into this the important thing te to realize is it is a complex topic a context matters a lot what is healthy for one person or one population may not be healthy for another person or population and a the microbiota is a malluable it is plastic it change is am or human biology which i think is how we think about health quite often be a mi and longgevity reproductive success how ever you wanted to find it am it is certainly am can' accommodate a variety of configurations of got mycrobiota and we do not have am a it is really hard to entangle am all of the different factors of what what could be you kno very healthy verse is a little bit less healthy am it i i will say that there is no single answer this but there is some really important considerations and am perhaps the best way to st our toguabout this is to go back to am the inception of the human microbiom project which was is am programm that that an age started the invested the lot of money in two thousand eight two thousand nine for am really a propelling the a field of ofv got mycrobium research it was a becoming evident at that point that this was not just a curiosity of human biology that it was probably really important for our health and they haddle this wonderful sequencing technology from the human genom sequencing am project and with the human genom completed that point they started turning that technology to seequencing our got mycrobes and yu know it is important to contectualize the amount of information that they are trying to am document the collective genom of our got microbes is on the order of am one hundred te five hundred times larger then or human geno it is just in terms of the number of genes sos just this vast number of of genes and then if you start getting into some of the fine variation it e kno scales by ten to a hundredfold really a huge amount of information ore trying to document and and the and it is o oh it was a wonderful investment and it continues to pay devidence to this day am but one of their goals of that project was trited to find what a healthy microbiom is verses a disease microbium and different contects and they started a enrolling a bunch of healthy people in a bunch of people with for incance in flamatory bal disease and other diseases am and and the idea was let us let us document those microbiums what mycrobes are ther what genes are there and then we constart to get a sense of what what of the commonaloties of the the healthy people an and what we know how how can that vago wrong in these different disease states and a they they there were some answers from that but you am through those studies we really started to get the image that there is this tremendous individualoty and the got mycrobium and a and it is it is really hard to a start drawing am conclusions after initinal pass of that project of what is a halthy mycrobum but the other thing that we started to realize at the same time there were studies going on documenting that got microbium of am traditional populations of human's hunter gathers a rural acricultural populations and am those studies were really mine blowing from the prospective of all these people are healthy theire living very different life styles and their microbium does not look anything a healthy american microbiums it does that mean that the healthy american microbium is healthy but only in the contects of living in the united states and consuming what is consumed here a or is it that there is a superior microbium signature somewhere in our history or occurrently in the world ye i i think that is that is kind of of a a big question ri now i think a ththere is a great crote from de chancky that says nothing in biology make sense except in the light of evolution and that these traditional populations are all modern people a living on the planted now but their life style does represent a a the the closest oproximation to how are ancestors a early humans lived and and those microbiums and now we know from sequencing of paliophecies the microbium of these traditional populations is representative more representative of the microbium that we evolved with that that a potentially shaped are human jou know and one possibility is that in the industrialized world we have a a different microbium from traditional populations in that microbum is well adapted to our current life style and therefore healthy n the contect of an industrialized society and there probably are elements of that that are true a but another possibility is that this is af microbium that is gone off the rals that it is a deteriorating in the face of anobiotic use and a a all the a problems associated with a a industrialized diat western dia a and that even thou the human microbium a project documented the microbium of healthy people healthy americans that what they really may have been documenting there is a perturbed microbiota that is a really predisposing people to a variety ov inflamatory in metobolic diseases it reminds me of the a as a nerbiologist a was weaned in the in the landscape of called critical periods where early life environment a very strongly shapes the the brain and many studies were done on animals raised in traditional cages with water bottle and of food may be a few other animals of the same species and then people came along and sat wait normally these species in the wild would have things things to climb over and thinks to go through and you provide those very basic elements in allisand the architecture of neral circuits looks very different and you realizing you were studying a deprived condition a and earlier you ave she referred to if i understood correctly to critical periods for got microbium development a is it a fair to say that there are critical periods meaning if my what' say mie what is aimet at me if my if a m got microbium was a dis biotic we was off a earlly in life can i rescue that through proper conditions and exercise oris there ise some sort of a fixed pattern that can be hard for me to escape from yet the there is a big field that is emerging now that a we refer to as kind of reprogramming the got microbium and you kow i think if we want ta conceptionalized humans as is aggregate youhuman microbial biology a most people have heard of crisper in the ability to a a potentially change our human genom and ways that correct amgenetic problems a that is a wonderful technology a and as cn have put on the table genetic ingeneering for curing diseas but it is much easier to change got microbes for a problem just becaus that that community is is maleable a the issue that i think werse seeing in the field is that a microbiums quite often whether their disease or healthy existence stable states the kind of ten towards this a well that has gravity to it in a in a way biological gravity where a it is really hard to dislodge that community from that state even individuals for instance that get anabiotics a you a takeoralanobotics the community takes its huge hit we know the bunch of microbes di the composition changes and you knavthat represents a period of unerability where pathagence can come in and take over in caused diseas but if that does not happen the microbiota kind of works its way back to something that is not exactly but similar to the preanobotic treatment a we know at dietary perturbations a quite often you will see a really rapid change to the got microbium and then this it is almost a memory where it snaps back to this something tit is very similar to the original state even though the diet remains different and there is is incredible rewe refer to as resilience of the got microbium and and a resistance to change or at least resistance to establishing a new stable state that does not mean it is hopeless to change and unhealthy microbium to a a healthy microbium but it does mean that we need to think carefully about a restructuring these communities in ways where we can achieve a new stable state that will resist the microbia community getting pulled back to that original state and it mean a one of the really can ave simplest and nicest examples a of this is inexperiment that we performed a with with mice where we we are feeding mice of normal malse diet a lot of neutrience there for the got microbiot o things dietary fibre and a we switch those mice half the mice to a alofibrodiet and weare basically asking the question that if you switch to kind of a western diet a low fibre higher fat diet a what happens to the got microbiota and we saw the microbiout o change at lost diversity it was very similar to what we see in a in the difference between industrialized and traditinal populations but when we brought back a healthy diet a lot of the micrbes returned is fairly thet there was this kind of memory where it went back to very similar to its original state the difference is that when we put the mice on a low fibre o high fat diet and then kept them on that frmultiple generations a we saw this progressive deterioration over the course of generations where by the fourth generation the got microbium was a a fraction of what ad originally was lets say thirty per cent of the species only remained a something seventy per cent of the species had gone extinct er appeared to have gone extinct we then put those mice back on to a high fibra diet and we did not see recovery in that case it is a a a situation where a new stable state has been achieved a in that case it is probably because those mice do not actially have access to the microbes they have lost and we actually know that we did a the control experiment of a mice on a high fibre diet for four generations they maintain all their microbes if we take those fourth generation mice with all the diversity and do a fecl transplant into the mice that had lost their microes but had been returned to a high fibra diet all of the diversity was reconstituted it was a your your question of how to we establish new stable states how do we get back to a halthy microbiot if we have taken a lot o anobiotics ore have it deteriorated microbiota it is probably a combination of having access to the right microbes and we can talk about what that acess looks it may look the reputics in the future theire lot of compani's working on creating cocktails of healthy microbes but it will be a combination of access to the right microbes and a nourishing those microbes with the the proper diet very interesting this multy generational study reminds me of something that i was told early in my training which was that a it takes a long time for a trait to evolve but not a long time for traits to devile exactly which it generally a is it is true of a human behavior too o the om idefends and we can all do better non the lass very inso i have a apuzzle ar a bit of a conunderment around this notion of a species of microbito sof the if the p h if the ask acidity is differs along of the digestive tract but is more or less fixed for a given location rit om unless something is really off the p h of the stomach is within a particular range in the the the intestian forth and certain micrbio to thrive in at a given station a given location along the the digestive tract and the p hes were fixed more or less i'm trying to fingure out what what is allowing certain microbioda to stay in the given location why do not they migrate up or down are they ph sensitive and that is what is what theyre selecting for along the tract and a i'm also trying to figure out how these changes in food robostly change the microbium it is the way you describe it almost makes it sound food is the the variable that is going to dictate the quality of the microbium although i'm sure their other factors is well and then in the back of my mind i do not know that i wantastis question but i really one aske his question which is where are they in their exactly and why do not they all get flushed out a if a thirty percent of a fequal matter is a micro biota am then where are tey living are they in are they along the the lining an the little microvili of the intestin and what are they attaching to and an interacting with and we know theire nurons in there a we especially within the stomach or theire is lot of work now be done on the egut nurons and how they signal to the brain and forth but who are they talking to intermis of the the host cells and a because if it is just from food i imagine that they are in their having their good time or ere not and then some are getting flushed out ere not but howdoe the ctually stay in there yet whore they attaching to what arethey talking about where they doing for fun and forth yet ye supert superinteresting a i'll come back to the attachment question and kind of why they do not get washed out tis is superfascinating question and a i think youre your a initial point of the the kind of reginal differences and what is happening in terms of physiology by a chemistry along the length of the gut is really interesting there certainly is a ph gredien along the length of the gut there is a actually by carbonat that secreted into the small intestin to tryde in neutralize stomach ascid the're also is bile that is secreted a that creates a a different chemical environment in their vile loving bacteria that kind of live in that region of the gut a and then there there is not a neutreent gredient just because as food leaves the stomach it a you knont a lot of the simple neutrients are absorbed and you might see micrubs in the small intestin for instance that are better it consuming simple sugars but you will not find many micrubs in the coln that because all the simple sugars have been depleated at that point a and then the immune system is a big factor as well and the immune system is incredibly active in the small intestan a the smll intestan is his really interesting challenge for the host because it is a tissue that is been it is purpos is mainly absorbetive and there has to be flow of a a lot of things a lot of neutrients fra the luminal contents in two hocells and that means the barrier cannot be as fortified and the the amune system is incredibly active in the small intestan to make sure that microbe's arngettings close in if they are getting close there is a response to them to put them back in their right location a there is a and then yu know a long this whole kind of architecture of the gut there is the longitudinal gradiance a things peach and forth and and i should say that peage starts to drop again in the colan because a lot of those microbes are fermenting things and producing acids and you actuallyened up with a that the pege starting to drop not as low as a stomach but starting to drop again if there is a lot of firmentation happening in the colan in addition you also have a gradient from the host surfas epithelium out to the the middle of the gut and that is likely the the key for what is retained in the gut and how the community is not washed out lining the gut we hav epithelial selves in the small intestin their largely absorbtive a in the colan there is a lot of mucus production and we shal also see this in the small intestan and this mucus lining is this a substance that we secrete largely made of carbal hydrate actually and the purpose of that is to keep microbes in the right spot and to allow nutriants and water to be absorbed in the small intestan enlargentestan and it is is mesh work that is supose to keep out large things bacterian letten small things nutriants a that mucus layer is a it turns over more slowly than the luminal contents passing by and a if a microbe learns to hold on to that mucus layer it can actually resist the flow of the the contents of the gut and there there is a a many microbes in the gut that are not just good at attaching tomucus but also good at nibbling on it at eating it and ther these bacteria acromanse a mucinifla mucus loving it is a one of its main things it does is actually eat mucus in the gut that is its lic style and and there there is an incredible a gradient of a activity from the host tissue working your way out the middle o the gut what is amazing is some microbes actually do penetrate pastimucus and there these invaginations in the intestan known as crips actually where the stemselves live that produce the apithelium and there microbial communities that can form in those crips and we do not know completely what their function is but we have done some studies that appear to indicate that if you can localize to a crip you have hit the jack pot is a microbe for being able to maintain dominance in the gut if you sit in the cript and something similar to you anothere micro that similar you comes into the gut you can actually exclude that microb and the thinking is that it cannot findest spot to reses being washed out of the got there probably are these little niches close to hose tissue in the mucus that are absolutely essential for a for resisting getting washed out with he with the flow of all the contents incredible that raises a question about two things that are a reasonably popular a one is this notion of cleanses a from either direction people will consume things by mouth to try in cleans there digestive tract as there is a long history of this i'm not recommending this there is differing opinions on whether nothisis good or bad an the other is a fasting or time restricted feeding a the reason a i ask about time restricted feeding as my understanding is that after a prolonged period of fasting there is some a auto absorbtion or a digestion of one's own a digestive tract that then gets renewed in otherwards you your testen in some ec start eating its own lining to some extent in the absence of food would we know about cleanses oh and that i suppose there is cleanses from the other direction to right which a less popular but a i 'e never run thi stitistics but i a but certainly exist out there a what are what is the idea about cleanses and fasting as it relates to the health or the dispiosis of the mycrobioda yet there has not been a lot of high quality science in this aria and it is really hard to conclude whether these are good or good for halth or bat for health the i think the the fasting yu kow we are in a really interesting situation in the industrialized world because we have many problems associated with our digestive tract in that probably has to do with are a highly process diet and perhaps having a my crobioto that fairly perturbed as well and a whether doing things this are good or bad a it is really hard to defined because we may be starting off in a fairly bad state anyway there many diseases that we are dealing with medaboleccindrum and flamatory bal disease thet just put a massive portion of the population in a very different category then people that are thinking about how do i maintain health how do i live along life a from starting off an what we consider a fairly healthy state and things fasting a and and a lot of other therapies that have been developed in the field a i think keitogenic det may be kind of in this category as well there can be tremendous benefits in terms of a there impact in the contective metabolic cyndrom and for people that ar battling a heeping a continual bad diet or something that it man adherents i think one of the po one o the reasons for the popularity of intermittent fasting a time restricted feeding a and sort of i exwhat af they call them now am exclusion diets where you entirely exclude meat or entirely exclude plants or whatever it it is the that adherente as sometimes easier in the all or none am as nobyle just we thing of this go no go circuitry it is harder to make a a decisions a neuants decisions often about food than it is tigus eliminate entire categories of food not eating for many people yet is easier than eating smaller portions yet am yet yet ye some of it i think is nor biological and psychological absolutely and we have have gasteron eurology fellows in our lab that comm in ind we kind of you kow i think that to kind of slice through the new ontes of all this there is a very simple recipe and a really well excepted a kind of broad definition of what a healthy diet is ee no kind of the the mediterranean diet plant base diet a is there is just a ton of data that a particularly people of europe an ancestry but there is a iou know a pretty broad axceptance that if you eat mostly plants for most people that is goin to be very healthy to the point where a a wonderful colleague of ours chrisopher gardener whose study diet a his whole life a tring to establish what a healthy diet as and people was giving advice as on giving advice to a a dietician who is trying to get all the rules af what what she should be recommending to a people that she deals with that are interested in a healthy det and she said that number one om an essay plantbase fibr is probably superimportant an that should be you no very high on the list and she goes on a number to an he said stop he said if people do number one well you do not need to know any other rules i mean it is basically if you can have a hgh fiber plant base diet a for most people at least you nor talking about the bucket of people that are already in a healthy state you do not really need to think about other things because you cannot eat too much me you cannot eat too many sweets youvorty eatin a huge amount of plantbas fiber your got is full your knok in to be hungry a and in a kind of takes care of worrying about what should i eat or what what should not i just eat a tun of whole plant ben a whole grains likeuns a vegetables a fruit that is that is high fibra base not highe completely exclude meat and fish and ther and he was saying people can have their own spends on tis but i i think that the the main rule is just start off with you knon't a kind hi gets back to to michael pallens monshra a eat food not too much mostly plants i i think if you stick with kind of these simple rules and do not overthink should i have this myou know can i eat eggs can i e just knd of stick to these simple rules that makes it very approachable but i agree tese gasteronaurology fellows that we have had n our lob say that they it is really hard we we kind of say to them why will not you give this dietary advice it is really well known and they just said whele it is it is really hard to get people to change their diet unless you are doing either a a go no go sort of thing a or eliminating something if kct carots are giving you problems do noty curets and that is a very simple easy instruction to follow but a does not really deeld with the rute problem of why cannot you eat carets because you should be able to eat carets most people can eat carets and a and i i think that there we a yet we we when w're when were thinking about things a fasting and all these different dietary regimes and cleanses that people do a we we have to step back for a moment and i ocable what what are really the the big high level rules that we should take home and then if you are experiencing problems and you want to think about how to deal with them it is good to go to an evidence based method where there is actually dated to back it up the the the data in the feeld really shows that with fasting a particularly if you go to animals the hibrnate or things that where the is really extended fast you actually have a a microbyo to come up that is at that blooms in the absence of of food coming in through diet a that is really good i at eating mucus you have a you knobacteria that is that specialize in eating neu trients derived from the hose because there is no other neu trance to live on now whether this is good or bad we do not know but it it seems a the consumption of mucus in access is a problem from the standpoint of mycrobes getting too close to host tissue and insiting inflammation which is what we see an animal models when we deprive of dietary fibre we see these mucus utilizers become abundant and inflammatory markers start to come on fasting short term might be fine probably a you knothers definly benefits that are seen metabolically am in terms of what it means for a long term health from the standpoint of that got microbyota i would say we do not have tha answer to that yet in terms of the ea no the cleanses and the flushes and all this a personally i i think it is a terrible idea i mean we know that if as i you kow in studies that are being done now to re programm that got microbyoto to install a completely new microbal community the first step is to wash away the resident microbial community that is there if you 're in the process of acquiring a really good microbita and how to do that then the the fleshing everything out is great a otherwise what is happening is your kind of leaving rebuilding of the community to chance what is it and a what what microbes are ging to colonize who is ging to take up space after you do this flesh or cleans and a that i think it is a a little bit playing russian relet you may 't up with a a good microbial community and there afterwards you may not a you certainly want to pay close attention to what you are eating while you are doing the reconstitution of the comunity after you do something that i thank you for t a i know a lot of people are interested in these kinds of elimination diets and intermitten fasting a slash time restrictof being seems to be getting some traction in part because at some level we are all doing this when we sleep wmost of us are neating whele we sleep anyway and a adjusting the numbers seems a more accessible for a lot of peoplut we have a lot of collegues at tamfor who i i know happen to follow that regimen a or aid time restrictof feeding regimen but am also am whos allow the more traditional meal spating as well of course the one thinks that i wonder about as we talk about a primarily plant based with some in what d you say the pallen thing was it was a eat a mostly plants a and then may be some meat but not too much or yor not too much eat food mostly plants not to got it irst arem eat food not too much mostly pla got it an a in a just i i hear this again an again i know a there are number of people who do seem to do well on a lower carbo hydrate a not even some people report feeling much better on a really strictly almost meat organ only diet and there are only reason i rase this is not i do not pretospatea the oman not one n of those a omnivors a a that out there a i do eat some meat a and i do eat plants as well but the reason i raisis is earli youre talking about am communities that may have microbiota that are am healthier than ours are at least different than ours and there are communities in the world that a that subsists largely on animal products or for which unprocessed animal products are considered the richest neutrint foods in those cmmunities protine is very scarce in a ancestrally protineas was more scarce eggs an meatin things that sort could there be a gonatic component in other words if we fast forward ten years and we actually can make sense of all this human genome stup are we goin to find that some one who has a scaninavian a roots or somebody vas south american roots or somebody a descended from a different tribe well do better on one partyula diaverses another and thereby where i should say and in parallel with that that they are got microbyoum will have different signatures that ar your microbyum might thrive on plants and mine migh thrive on organ mets and as i say this a i'm not of be consumer of organ meats ob just laying this out for sake of example yet i yet great a a a few notes a the first one has to do with the carboal hydrates and restriction of carboal hydrates and some people feeling healthier when the the cot carba hydrates out my guess is this i this is my theory a to betested a that people feel better cutting carboal hydrates out because the diet that we eat in the united states and in industrialize countries the carbal hydrates are largely crap priyes there process there it is starge imple sugar amit is things that contribute to glycemic an dects it is it is these sugars that that we eat they make it to our small antestin they get chopped up into simple sugars absorbed into our blood stream and we have a ton of glucost than coursing throughour veins which we know is bad and can lead to things diabetes a if the car the carbal hydrates that were in our diet were complex carbal hydrates dietary fiber and we to refer to the subset of dietary fibre that the microbiota can actually access as microbiota accessible carboal hydrates and the reason that we that term is that has the word carboal hydrate and it and it is a to point out that not all carbs or bad it is just there are bad carbs or carbs that are bad if you consume them in too high a quantity things a table sugar and simple starches but there are good carbs as well in these microbioto accessible carbal hydrates are the complex ones that we cannot digest and fuel a are got microbiotar got microbito can forment them and a the i think i think a we probably all would be better off with less of the cars that were typically served but most of us and probably the vast majority of us would be better off by consuming a lot more carbs that were complex that were microbioto accessible a it all come back to why that' s important in terms of our biology theire some mechanisms that are known as to why those complex carbal hydrates are important for our health for most of us a i think this aspect of human genetic adaptation to diet is superinteresting and then layer on top of that got microbiota adaptation to diet which is another layer of this that a is also fascinating it is very clear that over very short periods of time humans can adapt to differences in their diet lactaste persistence as kind of the classic example of this just over the past ten thousand years a humans certain groups of humans have adapted to being able to consume dair a by taking this enzim lack taste that normallyes just expressed and most the world's population early in life to be be able to metabolize lactos in breastmilk a by extending the expression of that throughout life now you can consume milk for your whole life and that is an example eof specific populations of humans a human geno genetically adapting to diet in a very short prid of time and this there are other examples of this and undoubtedly this has happened a throughout the world to various aspects of diet certainly amids important to remember that there will be a different diets better better for different groups based on what genes you you harbor and haven your in your human geno the other aspect on top of that is that a there there are a good examples a of the got microbium adapting to cultural differences in diet and the classic example of this is the degradation of seaweed we know that a most americans if fou eat suci and and there is nory there i you you eat a some of this the seaweed it has a dietary fibr in it notice porphyran that porphyran will shoot through most of us untransformed inert substance it you kow it will do other things retain water an service kind of something celulus not be afermented at a high level a if somebody from south east asia that is always consumed a seaweed and is part of a culture that consume seaweed eat seaweed they have a got microbe that can now metabolized porphyran and there these very specific gene trants for events where the genes for breaking down porphyrand have been imported into the microbium of many people in south eastasia to a yu knw we can think of it as helping digest porphyran but it is really just a microbe that is found ad nish found a way to make a living in the got by consuming something that is common in the diet there there are these different layers are human geneticadaptations and there are microbiomadaptations that are cultural and and based on peoples geographic location a but that there is no escaping the fact that for much of human evolution the vast majority of people that are on this planet had ancestors that were hundr gatherers forging consuming huge quantities of plant material just because that is that is what was there and one of the groups that we study the hodza hunter gatherers in africa a and i i should obtake a moment just to say that are research and and research of many people in our field in other fields rely on study of indigenous communities and it is really important to a think of these communities as a are equals ther modernpeople on the planet they have interesting life styles that are in formative with regard to certain aspects of of human biology a but in many cases they also are a leading a vunerable existence and we really take great care in our research program in its important for people to realize that a these populationse take partiner research because theire wonderful research partners an we need to be mindful of kind of thinking about how a yet both we talk about them and use our data thathat is a been gained through ther abgenderous contribution to our recentpopen the hodsa hundred gatherers hat's estimated consume on the order of a hundred to a hundred fifty grams of dietary fibra per day and that is in start contrast to the typical american that consumes about fifteen grams somewhere tent seven to tenfold decrease in the main neutriant that feeds are got microbium in the american diet the the hodza are a one example their differmany different forging populations but the vast majority these populations consume huge amounts of dietary fibre because plants are the reliable consistent sourceat if you as e a hunter gather go on a hunt yusually that hunt is unsuccessful i think the datar that yu o one out of twenty to thirty hunts are successful in landing actually big game for the hodza they have a o birds that they shoot and small animals but quite often a day after day their relying upon a buries tobirs bayobob fruits theyare they relying on the plants in their environment and actually fou a you go to the date and look at what their food food preferences are their food preferences are actually meat and honey they do not eat a high fibre diet because they love fibr they at a high fibr diet because that is what is available and consistent a for them to to survive but our brains are wired for color density and if you took a a hodsand put them in a restaurant in the united states they would make the same crappy decisions that we make because we all want sugar and fat and cowlories at hower our brain is wired and proting and fat are essential for brain development as far as we know alright that it sounds the the hodzi hope in pronouncing that correctly yo you said would prefer to eat meat and honey but they do they happen to consume a lot of plant fibre as a consequence of whon's available the a one of the questions i i have as it relates am to all of this is it it sounds to me there is no question from the purevyand all the way to the edream opposite which youd be pure meat diet a that avoiding processed foods is a good idea you are heavily process foods in general and ev not that the occasional consumption is is am necessarily bad but i whether not one is thinking about one makr nutren profile or another it sounds consuming pprocess foods is just bad for the microbiom can we say that categorically forsir oyetwhether not you also your low car person your eurocar person your extremelegu and no meat whether not your all meat organ meat sounds to me as if a the number one thing maybe even dare i say above crises a a point about plants withou nockin challenge cris gardener on on untritian i would be a way outside the lane lines to do that but is that to avoiding processed foods yet is parim yand i think that is completely compatible with what chrisophers saying he was saying if you put priortizes getting a huge amount of of whole plantbase food with a lot of fibre first you are notking to have room for eating a lot of process yot it is kind of the same as avoiding process food i think that those are exactly the same rule and i think that yeuther your exactly right an we an break down what there is a lot of date of whie different components of proces fhootor bad for us and bad for our microbyum and i can talk about a few examples of that but the flipside of this is this mechanism of and again thinking about the spectrum of a planned base diet ferses of meat base diet a there is a a lot of dated to tell us that a meter or keetojenic or high fat diet may have big benefits and terms of short tern metabolic health that is typically how people think about that diet af there is also a lot of heart disease thats linked with that as well there is good literature for that which as something to for people to to look ot and be aware of the plant base diet if you are eading a bunch of complex a fibrers that feed you are got my crobyoto you are got my croby taproduces these substances called shrt chained fadiacids things buterate and it is known that these short chained faiacids play really essential components both in terms of fueling colonisites in forcing the barrier or keeping in flammation lo regulating the imian system regulating metabolism and a lot of people think of dietary fibras thas inner substance that passes through makes us feel full may be for a little bit but we get hungry afterwards readoway if you are eading a lot of fibr that is feeding you'r got my crobyoto you are got my crobyotis just producing this vast array a fermentation and products that then get absorbed into our blood stream and have all of these tremendous cascating effects that appear to be largely beneficial on our biology and to think about that paradime of simple carbs verses complex carbs in the case of simple carbs you and up with high blood sugar something that will spite your insolent and have all kinds of weird metabolic effects in the case of complex carbal hydrates you will lend up with very low blood sugar because most of those have low glycemic indects and a bunch of short chaine fadiacids that ar having regulatory ral just a to round out that that topic i think there is a reason to think that maybe not appropriate for absolutely every one out there but i think the vast majority of people particularly given the statistics of what we know people eat in the united states and an industrialized countries most people wuld re tremendous health bhenefits from eating more whole plantbase dietary fibr know process foods i think is this other dimension we have all of these weird chemicals artificial sweeteners weird fats a lot of refine simple neutriants the simple nutrians we have talked about but we know that for instance artificial sweeteners can have a massive negative impact on they got my crobum and can lead us towards metabolic sendromactually there is been beautiful work out of the wisesmen institute on this and they kow emmulsifiers these compounds that are put in proces foods to help them maintain shelf substabilities things do not separade and a all the the moisture content is retained appropriately a many of these are known to disrrupt the mucaslayer and as soon as you start disrupting that barrier that can lead you in the direction of inflammation and in animal models we know that can lead towards metabolic cenderom is well theres there is components of process food thetter when studied an isolation known to have a direct negative impact on got biology in the microbiota the mention of artificial sweetners is is interesting it i i confess i it is a third rail on social talking out artificial sweeteners their two camps it seems or at least am two camps one that say artificial sweeteners are not detrimental at all another that says ther very detrimental mainly based on the mouth studies and than there people in the middll that are i put myself in that category i durink the occasional tha soda i do not consume them in large volume but of sort in the the middle there however and i just throw that out there because i know immediately peoples am are jumping on that but i ljust mention their some recent data faut of aum d'igoboris lab that duke universiy that the nurons that live in the got mecose of these nuropodzells can actually distinguish between artificial and am true sweet the sugar verseis artificial a sweetners am base they would send different patterns of neral signals up to the brain and the brain circuitry seems strongly impacted i think as the data emerge were hearing more more these artificial sweetners am yeither are problematic or at least are signalling different events in in the gut i do want to make sure that we distinguish a artificial sweeteners from non coloric plant base sweeteners u and this is based on mistake that i've made over and over again on the pod cast while just kind of lump artificial sweetners into one becategory and say and that i'll mention steve ya what about plant base sweeteners that a not artificial they were not manufactured in laboratory sacron or sucrelos or aspertame what do we know anything about plant based non coloric sweetners are low coloric sweetners there very little a lot of those have a a lot more bank for the buck there the're incredibly sweet soit takes a really small amount for them to trigger a huge amount of sweetness and a and it is depending upon the mechanism of action by which these am sweeteners that are not sugar ar impacting are biology it may be that those are actually less negative or ar more healthy than the ones that are rtificial just because your requires less of them in the food for us to perceive that sweet taste it may also be that because there ou kow i do not think that everything is that is natural is better necessarily than things that are artificial but it may be that because of am kind of evolutionary exposure to these compounds in or diet m historically there are i think traditional populations that use these for instance to sweeten asweeten different foods u that ar bodies just can f know how to deal with those compounds better than the ones that are synthetic m but i think the mean the studys still need to be done do you actively avoid artificial sweetener sucrelos aspertame sacron you personally ye i i do i i avoid them but i'm not a am i worke closely with my wife ericaas we do we were in the lab together and we am wrote this book the good got where we kind of document our journey in changing are life style dietary habits choices we make based on the researchas we have got to know it in the got my crobiot over the past fifteen years and am i i think that one of the lessons that we have learned is that just i doing things i moderation makes it a lot a easier and doing things slowly makes it a loteasiere and there very few rules that i have that are hard and fast i'm i'm a pretty flexible eater i do not believe that having an artificial yo know having a diec cok am well somehow cascade into some terrible disease or something that a i i try to avoid them i do not really the flavor of them i'm i'm supersensitive to the the new lances of the flavor even with the en ostevi and mogrosides fom mon frud enstuff that i just really the ow flavors are really hard for me to deal with but am but i also in this journey of changing our diet when we started off in my crobium research i was in the habit of in the afternoons having a sweet a muffin or a cooky or something that and when we started to realize that weu kow we should be eating less sweet since eating more dietary fibr this was an incredibly difficult change for me to make i was just wired to kind of crave this classic scientist ye exis is lof the the pessuring the afternoon toing coffe yei all days it used to be a cigarette to rigtn right exact when i started my training the lot of people still smoke yet right and it was only during my postoctral training that they eliminate smoking on cempasses and and productivity took to a trough for a whi and until these people developed other tools to i to focus their tanchat exactly exactly there there is this kind of need and that once you have an in graine behavior and ma be things that are addictive it becomes incredibly im difficult to break that habit and a and i would say gradually over the course of five or more years we have a migrated our diet a way from sweet foods to am things that ar or less sweet am am it is it is been a journey it is been a slow process a but we have got into the point now where we have just retrained our palates and it is amazing how this happens now where all have something that is something that i would have used to have daily and it is unpalatable i i just cannot deal with the sweetness of it and and i avoid i certainly avoid artificial sweeteners but i also avoid just sweet things in general that have sugar in them m just because they now thet is originally i was make iwas trying to be disciplined and trying to change my diupat now they just do not taste good me likewise i completely lost my appetite for sugar the turn of the last year and i do not know how to explain it but i the way i am you en knoug i do not have an mechanistic explanation i just i say i sweet people i do not sweet food any more i just do not i have not lost my appetite for a fatty foods i love cheese and a certain certain meats for me a i blame my urgentine lineage i is a is i gravitate towards them but in any case am avoiding process foods probably avoiding sugar is a mulsipiers these kinds of things and for people listening or watching we are not setting up strict gidlines it were just a bouncing around the a the carnival that is the microbioment and a nutritian because i think that these we hear this everywhere eat this do not eat that or this is best for microbium or worse for microbim but i mhearing fibr again and again s were gin to come back to fibere but i want to make sure that we a close the hatch on this issue of fasting and cleansing based on your answer earlier it sounds to me it is not necessary to do what cleans or fast prior to an attempt to repopulate the microbium in other words if i want to make my mi microbium healthy or it sounds i do not have to try and flush all the ythe the current microbio to out of there first is that correct yet it is a very good question and i do not mean to suggest that those things are known to be terrible or i would just say this the studies have not been done and to me wiping out this mycrobial community a in less it is done with some sort t inless is done in an informed way and we do not really have the information for how that would be done it just seems a you not plain the lottery little bit and i i think you kow i do not want to say that those it may be that when the study is done those are shown to be amazing but i just do not think we have the data to know that yet it is somewhat of an arbitrary thing a if somebody out there feels wa better when they do this and are not experiencing problems with it than maybe it is the right thing for them but i certainly cannot cannot say that it is something great to do i i i cannot imagine a future where a as the microbium gets incorporated into the you knw emerging paradime of precision health you go into a clenec somebody types your microbiom and says oh there is a this huge mass of mis configuration you have all these a ingrafted bacteria that live that a residence in your got microbium thatre sending out molecules that are not good for your health it would be good if we do a massery programming of it the way that we do that is we flush your gots and we actually give a light anobiotic treatment to try to kill everything that is there and then we repopulate with this other consortion of micrubes that we have studied and know or healthy know or compatible with your human geno and can be reinforced with the diet that we know is good for you will install those micrubes will help you along in the diet to know how to nourish those microbes and that will be the way that will reconfiguryour got microbium i i cannot imagine a future where that sort of flushing or cleansing is part of somethi ing for repopulating the got but right now it seems a little half baked to me great love to talk about fibr and fermented foods because you and chris at a rely what i think is a really interesting exciting paper at the end of last year about comparing am the inflamatome u inflamatory markers of people who ait a certain mount of fibr or certain amount of of these fermented foods this study is amazing for several reasons but am almost as amazing is how diverse the interpretation of this study was in the media if evere there was a study that was am kind of hi jacked by different priority schemes out there am it is this study you performed the study a with chris and your postocs and graduate students ans staff what are the major conclusions and what sorts of directives if any emerge from this study and i'll just a prephasis again by saying if i was not clear some news report said ah this means fiber is not important and that others said this means fermented foods and fibr are important an others said fermented foods are the thing and the only thing it it was all over the place and am at one of the reasons for doing this podcast at all is that we can go straight to a the people who perform the work and eventhoig'm not certainly not expert in microbyum give you the opportunity to share with me and me to ask the cons o questions that have ive zero genda i do souer crout i do drink the occasional a i combucha am i do low sugar not sweet forms of fermented foods i would be delighted if ferment of oods are good for me but i have no stake in the fermented food industry a av ya great am yet wonderful and end and important not there is is the one you pointed out that this is an incredible collaboration with christopher gardeners lab and a bunch of people a eric a sondenburg help lea the study and then and then tons of your same postock staff and a other people i at stamford and then wonderful participants that am were were part of the study a huge team effort am let me take before i dive into that study let me take a step back because i think the reason that we did thi study and and kind of a chrisopher's group and and our group as as started to a pursue this line of af looking at dietary interventions and how they impacke or microbium how they impact am human biology goes back to this am kind of eepithany that we we had while studying the got microbum because i think when we started studying at at stamford we are thinking about it as is cand o newly appreciated aspect of our biology almost am finding an organ that we did not know is there and starting to think about all the drug targets that were there can we go in with small molocule drugs and think of ways tomanipulate this community to amiliarate disease and a this is largely the mind set of western medicine and largely borne out of the air of infectious disease a you wait for an infection to start a bacterial infection you treat with antabiotics and that is the way medicine as practiced and that is become less successful over time as we moved into this era of inflammatory western diseases and a with the exception of the thecrpendemic tha set of weeping the world a largely moved out of the era of infectious diseases at least infectuouspacterial diseases that this paradime of waiting for diseases to appeer an come into the clinic a is not really very effective in the contects of inflammatory western disease is autoomune diseases metabolic sindrom a hard diseases and inflammatory diseasing now the list goes on and on and a and we started to think a lot about how can we get out in front of this how can we think about preventative ways a dealing with this crisis of metabolic and inflammatory diseases and this tremendous beautiful body of literature started to come forward in the field about ten years ago that showed that the got microbium is absolutely critical tomodulating our imune status if you change the microbium you canfundamentally change how the imune system operates and we know that the imune system is the at the basis of a lot of these diseases inflammatory chronic diseases and it it brought up this possibility that may be the fact that were not nourishing this community well enough may be the fact that it is a deteriorated over time a due to all f the things that go along with an industrialized life style anabiotics and forth a may be we have a microbium right now in the industrialized world that is setting our imune systen ati setpoint simmering inflammation that is driving us towards ease inflammatory diseases and would not it be wonderful if we could figure out how to a a use diet specifically but just kind of learne the rules of how to reconfigure both the composition and function of our gotmicrobium that inflammation was different in ourbodies that each one of us was less likely to go on in to develop an inflammatry disease leading to better longgevity in health a over the course of our life and a we we were uno studying tess in actually in malse models and realizing that a we really needed to star doing human studies we needed to a start studying microbiom and humans and because we were studying diet we knew that this was something we could go in and do right away we did not have to apply for ftie approval for a drug before we could do a human study we could ju start doing human dietary interventions laungitudally monitering the imune system and the microbium and starting to put the pieces together of what is it in diet canchange our microbium in a healthy way helplus to find what a healthy microbayum is and monitor the umian system in great detail and therere really two critical components of this an addition to our microbiom experaties one was christopher gardeners group a we wanted to do these human studies but were absolutely terrified if humans we work with mice humans or terrifying a in many ways thay rouse themselves you do not have to thaty a oter to pay for their housang that that is true nos thet can a four thousand of course yet sadly just for that portion of the population the a it is o chrisopher's group were they are masters af working with human populations and then the other wonderful thing that we have it stamford is as human amun monitoring center a run by mark davis and holden maker they started this beautiful center for allowing people to do iminology in humans critical element because a lot of the mouth studies do not trans well to human if you can do the studies in humans a similar to how we were thinking about the microbyum you learn something tht as relevant to humans and having that immune profiling capability where we can moniter hundreds to thousands differ of different prameters in the imian system longitunally in people from a blood draw and not just know if see our pegoes up or if interlu can six goes up or down but to be able to seet all these facits of the umian system change in concert as were changing the microbium with diet was really a key component of this and our flagship study supported by wonderful doners a this actually is not funded by typical foundations and national institutes of health at was funded biet a philanthropy we wanted to understand if we put people on a high fiber diet a how would that affect their microbioment i mian system and if we put them on a high phermented food diet a diet rich an live microbes in all the metabolites that a mour present from fermentation in foods how would that change microbioment a mian system could you give us some example tof what those diets look and were you changing their basil diet were you just adding things on top of what they were already eating the hard to change people's di is it is very rd to trust that they actually do it and the're not sneaking and not totally ye and we a and we started the center for human microbium studies at stamfort for doing a lot of these studies and a portion of the studies we do focus on supplements probiotics microbes delivered in pelform prebiotics which are a purified forms of fiber and in those cases we actually can have placibo groups a because its it is more a drug study and a we do not change peoples diets we can just administer this on top of what they are doing in a way theyre lot more controlled but it is not food when you start doing food studies you cannot do a placibo group cause people know what their eating and the other problem is that a it is really hard to just change one thing because as soon as you start adding something people usually eliminate something else the ideal was t a basically give these people simple instructions for in the case of the high fiber diet just increasing plantbased fibr can you eat more whole grains more liumes more vegetables nuts get the fibr up in the range of from fifteen to twenty grams per day up te over forty grams perday can you kind o double or mor the amount of fibr that you eat per day knowing that that would have a tremendous impact on a lot of other facets of their am diet they a eat less a a meat animal base protine a less animal base fats as a product of this a i will say that at getting back to the you kno christiphers rule for a healthy diet a a lot of the makeron neutrian changes that we saw in their diet were consistent with a healthy changes in di less saturated fat less animal base proting more plantbase protine a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial kind of came in concert with just telling people eat a hi fibr di high plantbase a fibra diet a the people that were eating the high fermented food a diet a they were instructed to basically eat a foods that you could buy at a grocery store that were naturally fermented and contain life microbes and this largely consisted of yoger a keefer a sour crod kimchi a some fermented vegetables a kind of brind fermented vegetables pickles things that but but they do one of the things that i think is a pitfallen in choosing fermented foods is you can go down the canned foodile and thereis a huge set section of pickles and jars that are canned a those are not fermented foods those are are cucumbers that they have put in a setic acit and vinegar to reconstitute that fermented flavor but there is no live microbes involved in that and even sour crowds in the canned foodile even if they were naturally fermented quite often theire not quite often their just brind a in in vinegar but even if they are naturally fermented all the microbes are killed prior to canning or during the process of canning and if you want i what we use for the study and if you one have live fermented foods that contain life microbes you need to buy those out of the a the a refrigerated section essentially and i'm really glad you pointed this out a because you can find sour crowd on the non fermented anon refrigerated shell that is indeed nonfermented a a lot of fermented foods that are vailable n yu ask a can be high and sugar am wher is there any instruction as to getting people to make sure that they were consuming yogrs that were notloaded with sugar if or or did you let them just select for that the stuff in the cold the ovld section that is fermented know its superimportant point we we instructed people to eat non sweet d yoeogert's am the it is i think a huge pitfal in the saries you can have a yogar loaded with bacteria a kind of the base of what is healthy and then a tun of artificial flavouring and sugar loaded on top of that manufactures put a ton of sugar in after the facts a kind of mask the sour taste of fermented foods which is hard for some people to become accustomed to when we were switching to more fermented foods our daughters were young at that point we would take plain yoger which am they did not just kind of neat am we would mix in a little maple sir up or honey am just a little bit and gradually we reduce that over time to the point where am their palid ajusted now they just really plain am yoger but it is i think getting use to that sour flavor is is difficult but people really should try to stay away from those fermented foods that are loaded with sugar and that is what we instructed people in the study and beer was not included i hear t the onref youl that aske when i i did a brief a thing on social media about the studyan hopely i got it right think i did but people jos ask about beer i'm not a drinker for me beer has no appeal anyway but a beer is fermented correct but were they instructed to a void beer or to drink beer just to go with their normal dietary habits but that did not count as a afermented food and cumbooccho was as woit was and cambucchican have small amounts of alcal and it am but a a we a cambuccho actually was one of the major things that people drank during the er consumed during the fermented food fase an am the that the deal with am with a beer is that there may be beneficial properties of the microbial communities and naturally fermented beer but most the beer that we buy again as canned and filtered and there is no life my crubs there very different than if you siphen it off of your hombrew and drink it probably if you buyit in store as is i get to the results th studying just one moment but i wont say lot of people shyway from the high quality formented foods becauses t they can be quite costly out just prefer people to a resource in tim parrises book the four hour sheff he actul gives a excellent recipe for making your own sour crout which basically involves cabage and water and salt but you have to do it properly because you can grow some not necessarily a leethal but some somewhat dangerous factory if you do not scrape off the top layer properly but he gives beautiful instructions for hou to do this in vats we started doing this at home now factually as we get the which is serrammic that and you canc seyou can make large amounts of truly fermented sour crout just from cabbage water and salt if you are willing to follow the proto cal and if yourinterest in science that protocal looks a lot what you will do for most of your graduate career except may be some sequence in tro anyway jus to er for people to a source thits very lotw cost yow compared to buying the high quality for mented fots even cam boochas soe yet you knots five dollars a bottle atly only at i's much and if you consume liquids toay i consume them that is kind of it that is a just a the the start yeam and but yu know cif you can get your hands on a scopi combucchas another one that super simple at the land grow your own you can you can just make your own in its super easy to do i make it i ll constantly have a bachi cambucha going at home and it is just de knotesas it is a scobes a symbatic community of back terean east that you you knw you you brut you had sugar to it and you put the scopian and you wait a week or to depending upon the temperature and you then you just move the scoby over to a new batchin yat year old ye what the scopy was in is cambuccha at's it is wonderful i love i would love it if numbers is audients would a stare to make their own combuccha and sarca i ave been having much one i do not do it but im a it is done in our home am i do not i do not go not no anywhere near the food a production s for every one's benefit am how much formented food and then a were they consuming and cause you mention the number of grahams approximately of fibr and a wat was it eaten servings ounces a how many times a day early day late day rit yes a the we had a wonderful dieticion instructing people for this and o namestollyor promen and she really was the key and is the key for many of our studies for getting people to eat differently and am i the general instructions were for people to eat as much formented foods as possible more as better and but th the reason is that with this initial study we really wanted to maximise our chance of seeing a signal if there was something biological going on with the idea that if we the dose was excessive and not yeasily achievable by a lot of people the end we can go back an insa o ce this this is the point at which we lose the biological signal but people am during the height of the intervention fase the intervention fase with six weeks am during the height of that were up over six servings on average per day of formented food kind of too servings at each meal and that ounces or weight or size diit really depended on what the formented food was and we just told them to stick to what was a recommended dose on the the package that they were they were buying for combuccha be a six to eat outs glass am sour crawt a half cup or something that in sam with ore great what what were the results yes that the results am astounded us in a way but then thinking more deeply an an e it will be evident even after i explain it in the contects of this conversation likely why we saw the results we saw am the results were astounding because am or hypothesis going into this was that the high fibre diet was going to give the mass of signal we know that this is the big deficiency in the western diet am we a all the mouse studies have told us that high fibre really leads to a much healthier microbioto can lead to positive changes in the imune system and in fact even when we had a limited we had wonderful don or support but still limited amount of money when we started the study a my lat was really very eager to do the hy piberer a part of this really well and christopher kind of had to twist our arms to do the fermented food site of it and we thought it was kind of workin an nee life life microbes should be exciting let us try it we put that in and it turns out that we were very thankful that he twisted our arms because it was that a hygh fermented food arm that really gave us the big signal even though our hypothesis was at the hygh fibr was in a lead to more shorchine vadiacids produced in the got a more diverse mycrobiota a less inflammation in the immune system we did not see that across the cohort we actually saw very individualized responses to the diatary fibere and all come back to what those responses were the the big signal really was in the fermented food group we saw all the things that you would hope to see in a western microbiota and western human we saw this increase in microbioto diversity over the course of the six weeks while they were consuming the fermented foods a and we cannot always say that a higher diversity is better when it comes to our microbual communities we know their cases for instance bacterial vaganosis were higher diversity as actually indicative of a diseased state a but we a know in the context of the got and for people living in the industrialized world higher diversity is generally better a we know that there is a spectrum of diversity people with higher diversity generally or healthier if you can push your diversity higher your in better shape and we saw that increase in diversity and then the major question is what happened to the imune system as these people were increasing their got microbioto diversity through the fermented foods a we we did the a this massive immune profiling and we see a couple dozen immune markers in flammatory markers decrease over the course of the study we multiwe a measure these at multiple time points thrughout the course of te study in theirs kind of the sep step wise reduction in things interlucan sex and a a interlucan twelve variety of kind of famous in flammatory mediators and then even if you go into the immune cells an you start looking at their signalling cascades we see that those signalling cascades or less activated at the end of the study compared to the beginning of the study indicating in attenuation of inflammation kind of exactly what we would hypothesize would lead to less propensity for inflammatory disease overtime that is a a huge extention of a very short study ind olong was a study that the complete protocol i think was fourteen to seventeen weeks or something that the actual intervention phase consisted of a four week ramp and then a six week maidenance period the intervention itself was ten weeks but there were six weeks of really kind of hard core high levels of of fibre or fermento yet at ni 'm glad you mentioned the ramp cause my experience with a fermented foods is that you it can be beneficial to give the system and opportunie to acclamate i mif you consume a giant bowl of sour crowd a it is i con be the worst day and night of your life but you you will you will know you did il jus leave it at that and you want a kind of acclamate to it a i meat the point now where pulet some people might think thiss gros but i after i exercise av bin sweating a lot i the saltiness of the ac shul drink the a the liquid that the that the sour crowd has been a steing in and i get i'd to think that i consume some a fermentation that way it salty acess kind of a a post training a replenishment but if i had done that a six months ago straight off i think i it would havebeen pretty rough or my sistem my started taking little bits of it in then adding at each to totally and both with the fermented foods in the fibre it is well known that that this kind of gradual ramping is a really important way of mitigating a bloating another can ave digust of discomfort that can happen when you are my crobium reconfigures and starts fermenting more and changing communuity member a you should take that ramp at your own pace if something seems to be going wrong just can a level of stay there wed we did this in a very delicate way to get people up to the hihdos the a brain questjust a a a tangin here for a second a that was actually one of the products that we a had people used in the fermented food fase there is actually product called gut shots which is just the brine from that they have marketed a we actually nawadge studying it in the lab i just actually before this came from a lab meeting where a g i fellow in my lab is actually putting got shots sterilized got my croor the frmenfermented a a fermentation mycrobes removed or present into mice and looking at changes in their mecosal a man system ere studying this in detail now because this is it is a rich source of lack tate and a bunch of other interesting matapolites i love that my weird behavior is a it vertantly being studied a at stamford medicine a i wanted just mentious thing about that the got shots a those are r sol it as a as a drink those also just for certain listeners in different budgets that can be very expensive if you really think aout some of them are exceedingly expensive but thewhat i described before with making your own a cambucha's t is not quite brining but the a ho made sour crowt that protocal is out there is a mention in in tim spoke the the for hour shaff and you get a lot of the brining from from that an almost endless amount a a cautionary note i once went intothe refrasraton and saw something similar to got shot it was not gutcho and i drank the whole twelve ounce bottle and realized that it was twenty four servings and that is where i got my initial a experience with what it is did not do a ramp up phase ye do not recommend doing that some of these it is very potent it seems and you can consume even a half an ounce ur announce yave ter i mean very potent from the standpoint of fermentation but also very salty i know ther there is the lot of affects ye an y do not do what i y a at least not at the outset and a a but that is a an expederience to warning they did this as i recall there was a swap condition where there was a halt condition you did controls right we was not just comparing groups you had individuals a who were initially in one group or the other a move to adupt different group wel we for little stop and then return yet we we actually just did a stop and followed them during a wash out fase and i the ideal situation for a dietary interventions this are to do a cross over studies as your suggesting we have a recently completed a kee to genic for sis mediterranian diet intervention or e date a published a not yet the chriciphers been tweating a lot of these data and there is a haper in revision right now if you go to christopher gardeners a to id put er feed you will be able to find him reporting some of the the early results of study give us a snip it of was there sur pure just give us a you ought to tell us which one but a was er superior a condition of either mediterranean verses kee to genic a i should the menabolic affects of these a it is a beautiful study i should let his group comment on that the microbioto ty a we actually or just generating now that the study that hes his group has put together from this is a largely independent of the michrobite data and now were doing a mwere in depth analysis and i'll have more to say about that the future but now return to that but it is a super exciting study because it is one of these were people eat a certain way and what is really beautiful about this as weven got food delivered for part of the a intervention we had complete control over what they at least had available to eat a and then the second fase they a they a make the food on their own and then we cross over and do the same thing and that is really the a if you have a good enough budge et the right way to do a study this for this we did not have the a the time or money to do across over but we did do a wash out fase were people we did not make them stop eating whatever if theye were enjoying it but we monitord and there was some rcitivism where there was a decrease of fibr formented food and we could see for instance diversity start to plateau and reverse and many these people there does appear to be a a need for maitenance af the intervention te maintain the perceived howth benefits that we were measuring great we will provide a ling to the study in the caption and thank you for that very clear and through description a from the ves one of the investigators involved in the study that i it is great to go direct to the source a anecdotaly were there improvements in mood in a resistance to coltan infection a during the course of the study and this is a kind of a prelude to where im headed naxt which is there is a tremendous amount of interest in the called gutbrain access but also i want to make sure tht we talk about how these mi grobes in the conditions their establishing in the got or creating positive or negative health offacts having action basely how signals get out of the got t a did peop i certainly notice that when i meaning more formented foods or theirs probiodicts in in drinks i consume and forth that i feel qouldn't quote air quotes completely subject i feel better am i wish there was an objective measure of feeling better a but i seem to think more clearly sleep better mood et cetera and i know i'm not alone in that a and peop and anytime iave taken harsh and to my odects i feel worse but then again i'm usually taking them because i'm feeling bad about something else or i i do not take them just because did people say they were feeling bette a in any way and if what did you observe and again were high letting these is anic data yatotally a we a as as part of this effort a to look at how dietary interinterventions effect ar our health and well being in forth in my crobium in a man system a we a interact with a lot of people who have red ar book or kind of have become my crobyum enthusiasts and of implemented a lot of these changes in thir personal life and i hear the same thing that that your saying intou that yu kno tons of people say they have more energy they think more clearly the sleep better ther family is nicor to each other the number of crazy things and it is really hard ton couple is it because these people have taken charge now of what their eating and just feel better in general for being in control of kind of what they are doing or is there this cascating a set of effects that are actually impacting ar are yifyou know conemanating from the cupbrain acces and and we actually implemented a bunch of questionairs and even a cognitive test to try to a get at some of this and and i should say that the list of this goes on and on their people who claim that their complecion improves and that ther alargies and there is probably all sorts of reple effects if you can affect your inflammation you we know that you can affect your cognition we know that you can ffect youre your your skin and inflammation that is occurring on your skin i really think that there is a basis for a lot of those anecdotes it may just be hard to see in a short study and in a a small ou know a small cord of people over short prid of time but we did notreally see significant things associated with cognition and moods and all of the things that that a we were testing for which a yet there there could be a variety of explanations or that te we also have a a a standardized a a stool measure that people use and there was a kind of less constipation better batle movements over the course of both of these interventions it did seem bal habits improved which a a lot of times can lead to better moods but that we were not able to tomesue the classic pcyclaniless would have a a field tey with that what sorts of interesting things did you observe in the fibr group because it is clear that that group u yielded some unexpected findings in both directions that you things you expected to see you wouldidn see as to the same amplitude as you did in the fermented foo group but i'm guessing you also sawu some very interesting things in the fibr group to totala yaso a we started looking at the date and more detail when we did not see the cohort wide response and a one of the things we observed is that in measuring all these immune parameters there appeared to be three different groups of kind of immune responses that we were seeing one group that got over all less in flammatory and then two other groups that kind of had a mixed result partly more inflammatory partly lessan flammatory in all these markers that we were looking at and when we started digging into what a aspect of the biology of those people dictated or predicted which group they fell into the really interesting part is the people with the highest diversity got mycrobiums to start the study were the ones that were most likely to hav the a decreases and inflammation and e the you a data seem to be telling us that if you start off with a diverse mycrobiota may be one that is better ecuipped to degrade a wide variety a dietary fibre youre more likely to respond positively to it if you have a very epleated got mycrobyum youre not is likely to be able to respond to it ind thinking back to that experiment that we talked about before with the multi generational loss of of fibre formenting my crobes in in mce that were ftat a a western diet a it it may be that a many of us in the industrialized world have a mycrobium that depleated now that even if we consume a high fibra diet at least for a short period of time we do not have the right my crubes an r got to degrade that fibre and this as actually been observed by other groups beautiful study out of university of minisota looking at emigrants coming to the united states and within nine months but certainly over the course of years immigrants that come here los af a a lot of the diversity under got mycrobyum but a lot of the fibr degrading capacity in there got my crobium to it could be that overtime this becomes he one way stree and it is hard for us to recover a the the microbes that that actually ndegrade the fibre and i think that this probably intersects with sanitation in our environment in the fact that we do not have access to new mycrobes that might help us degrade the fibre that we actually a have loss these mycrobes in their in some ways ourecoverable without deliberate reintroduction of fibr degrading my groups i can recall from childhood the wre gids that would eat dirt yin snails and ithars is sounds tolly discusting but gids covered with maud and you knowed that may be not much any more and it certainly during the pandamic there 's been a lot more use of these hands antizers that prior to that people seem pretty spooked about but than obviously the they priortized them uam ddo you while you have children did you o you encourage them to a to when they were the young did you encourage them to interact with pets and dirt and abson a stoffen the environment provided that stuff wasn' immediately talks of yo exactly this is really it is it is a continual a cost benefit analysis i think the a i i will say that i with the pandemic now and a certainly just with infectious diseases in general it is really important to be aware of a the the possibility for compromising your health through the spread of germs and that that is just ee no handwashing is important and we have to be careful with am the the spread of germs but i do think that a the sanitatious sanitization of our environment a has gone overboard with the a varioust things being impregnated with anobiotics you o shopping carts and things that and tooth brushes and it is it is anaobiotics and and a things for killing my crobes or her everywhere and when we were raising we know when our daughters were young and we are weere making these decisions the calculations that we would make were really am one a how likely ere they to encounter a disease causing my crub if we have been out on a high or in our garden just kind of working in the dirter whatever maybe it is not as important to wash your hands before you have lunch even if there is a little bit of dirt on them a if they have been in a public playground were maybe thers a other kids with germs or maybe even cemicals pasticides and and er besides that are being use a maybe it is more important than to wash your hands certainly if you have been in the grocery store on the subway probably good i dead to wash your hands but itso i think you really need to think about kind of the the contect of it and a i exposure to my crobes a from the environment is likely and important part o a educating our mean system and keeping the proper balance in our mean system an its just a matter of figuring out the right way to do that safely and it may be that the fermented food result that we saw is a way of capping into the same pathways kind of environmental exposure tof my crubs that' safe interesting to touch on how signals get from the got to the rest of the body and a we pri do not have time to go into all the systems that benefit from having a diverse microbyum or healthy microbyum but ya we talked about the imen system am there is active signaling in transport from the got all along its length as far as i know into the blood stream into other organs and tissues for the mean system am it seems straightforward am to reduce in the amount or number of inflammatory side a ines ile six and forth may be increased the antiimplamatory side of kinds ileton and others but we know there is a got brain acess an durons that literally talk in both directions between brain and got but let say i i eating my formented foods a'm doing all the right things and i my got is diverse an i've all the good good eas at all the right places how is it that a that the fact that those microbout ar thriving is conveyed to the rest of the body a because they are in theire doing their thing and i do not know that they have a mind but their probably not thinking of taking care of me andrew but i get feel better or i might a get sick less often or combat a any almess more quickly how is that actually happening aman is it is it that the microbiout o stay restricted to the got but the signaling molecules are all downstream a in a downstream way or are making good or bad things happen wore is there some sort of direct recognition at the body level or their sells in the body that ar responding to o they got microbonamas healthy and therefore i can make more of the good stoff in less of the bad sto yet speak yet the great the i a youre rite it supercomplex theres a huge array of ways that our body a perceives a both the micrubes and the molecules that they produce in or got and the molecules they produce are of course of product of what micrubs are there and then what they receive as ckind of metabolic in puts what were eating and what other micrubes are or present in the environment providing molecules to them heu knowties is complex matrixs but we that a probably the the simplest place to start is just the imune system we have a in immune system that they know the vast majority of mune cells in our body or located in our got just because theyre such a a dente a population of micrbs there that have ther the're a we consider them a beneficial micrubes but they are only beneficial if there in the right spot in the got as soon as they mis localizes we know that they becan become opportunistic pathagens and the immune system really playing in important role to keep to them in place is essential for this system not a moving into a diseased space the immune system has a variety of ways of of monitoring what micrus are there theyre actually specialized structures in the got a known as pira pires patches that actually take up micrubs they they actually allow micrubes to transit in to this population of immune cells in a very controlled way that tast set of amune cells becomes educated as to what micrbes are just on the other side of the barrier while it isom a cound of a border patrol exactly yesor they they bring them in they they finger print them and then a have have kind of this a set of responses ready to go if needed me a theyre they are other cells known as in dridic cells special types that actually send a long arms these processes out into the luminof the got and do the same thing take up microbes bring them back in and sample them a in addition to these direct sampling mechanisms the cells that line the got have e a huge array of receptors specialized protines that perceive patterns that the a molecular patterns that the a microbes makes things indotox and mipapoli sacride a just the cell wall of the a macteria we have specialized receptors that recognize those if those signals become two profound or if theyre perceived in the wrong place that can stimulate and inflamatorsso there is all these ways of kind of monitering the membership and where it is and how close it is but then there is is whole other set of a ways of perceiving metabolic activity in what is happening in the n you mention before this direct a eno these cell types that a express taste receptors in the got and have ways of sampling dietary components there 're those same types of a are an analogous cells in are got that are perceiving metabolites produced by the microbioto that a our bodies can perceive what sort of metabolic activity is going on and then in addition to that there 's this tremendous itremendously important interic nervous system that a sending signals back to the praying dictating things motility do i get rid of what is in here do i move it along quickly what what actually is is happening do i need to interact with t mune cells there is tis really complex array of of a interactions between the different cell types and then a lot of the cells that are in the got perceiving all of these signals a lot of the imune cells can actually get up and leave they can get into the blood cycled through and and then home to other regions af the a muchosal surfaces that muchosal surfaces are are a educated broadly against what is a what is passing through our got there is there is a a vriety of ways of cells communicating and then a lot of the molecules that the microbiota makes can actually make their way into the blood stream directly and an the a the array of molecules is still being defined were trying to figure out a what all these chemicles are we mention the short chaine vadiacids but those are just the tipithe iceberg ther really interesting compounds a yu know indol derivitives and a fenals and and iu know derived from menoacids metabolize by got microbes taken up into the blood stream and then we further metabolize these they become kind of co microbe host metabolites and then they can go on and bind to different receptors throughout our body anywhere or blood stream has access to and start to triger signaling cascades is it known whether not any of those m olecules are small enough to cross the blood brain barrier because the hypothesis it a and the current thinking is that a nor transmitters manufactured in the got and signaling along the got brain acis literally nurons talking back and forth electurically from brain to gotin got to brain is what regulates things mood or at least an animal models and there some emerging human studies improvement of symptems in in a otism spectrum disorders it maybeven in eighty eight to what a basely saying here is that thereis some evidence a emerging that improving the got microbium can improve a outcomes in psychiacturic and developmental disorders but what you are telling me is that the that the microbiota themselves are manufacturing chemicals that can make into the blood stream and therefore i'm asking if those chemicals can move from the bloodstream into the brain directly it may not be a got brain axis via nurons it acturic a a speceepage of ceretonan into the brain and wer toleto calling into the brain for for that matter totalya and you knothe a the tas ththe biology f most of these molecules is not well understood but certainly in cerer sfinal fluid that is been analized a it is you can perceive these mycrobule metabolites they are there the answered we yes some f some of them are getting across the mbut really interesting thing is i think a lot of these molecules are if there experience that high enough doses are a toxic or half toxic properties we know that a a lot of these a metabolites when they make the rain of the blood stream eventually are excreted through the kidneys and urand actually we can moniter the metabolism that is going on in your got by actually looking at the metabolites that are present in your urine because those many of those originated in your got from your got mycrubs but people with kidney disease whose kidneyse a filtering proceses not functioning properly actually a build up high levels of many these metabolites in to the blood stream and a that can lead to more of these molecules making it across the blood brain barrier and in fact some of the a transporters in the kidney that are responsible for shuttling these molecules out into urane are also found at the blood brain barrier for shuttling the molecules back into the blood streame if they do get across and and we know that mental fog is a big one of the big symptoms of kidney disease petentually because the lot of these metabolites accumulate in blood and then make their way across the blood brain barrier into o the sentral er system amazing i'm glad you mention mental fog a few years back there were some a reports a some scientific reports and as a consequence in in the media that a excessive in take a probe o pillform probiotics could create mental fog i doft now if that ever took hold a and an it raises a general question about a pillform probiotics ai took them for a few years just thinking that would be good for my got microboman than i switch to the fermented food thing the largely on this a consequence of at the work that you and crispublished am but it what what is the thought about probax for for the typical person that is not recovering from a round of antabiadics were that am has been prescribed them am i've heard that the species of a microbioda that they a proliferate might not be that species that we want to proliferate but i've also heard that maybe that does not matter what what is your general stands they can be quite expensive em also i know i'v n ikg about expense lot tody but ialways want to takein to account that people are showing up to the table at with avriety of budgets and you probac o one of the more expensive supplements ou that you can quickly get into the several hundreds of dollars er month if your getting the a quotun quote best quality ones and if they are got actually causing brainfog than a matterid want to use them now completely and there is a tunnis snake oil out there i mean there is just people know that they i know i think that many of these companies are aware that they can pray off of people's feres and get a lot of money from them with absolutely no dated to back up their probatic is doing anything am that i think that the first thing to say is by or beware because it is a supplement market its largely unregulated and that means that there are a lot of bad products out there and a lot of products that am yeven thoug they are not intended to be bad just do not have great quality control ther ave been several studies that have taken off that a over the counter just kind of off the shelf probaducts surveyed what is in theire based on sequencing and shown that they what is in there does not match what is on te laple that that is true of many supplements and unfortunng supplement companies this is tonly we get into on the bod gastllot there there are reputable brands and they go through a lot of work to to get things right and there are many that just for whatever reason it just does not matchwis list exactly and there there are am i places thet probatic companies can send thei'r product to have it independently validated you an to look for that sort of validation on the una product m there also are names that are just very well known and am it is a myou know theire reputations are on the line they probably in vest little but more in quality control than may be some of the other less er known names am but there there is a huge range of am deta an probiaducts and i think that the thing that we kind of recommend is am try to find good products and en experiment for yourself and see if you can find something that works for you i know people who have experience constipation an am cannot do not want to change their diet and have found to probatic that help some with tht am if you can find that right nex great that that is wonderful am i would say that that the dat a right now is not am overwhelmingly positive for what t probiotics do to the got my crobiotus there have been some nice studies looking at the impact of probaticts on re covery after anabotic treatment and it appears to slow down the recovery of the mecosal mycrobiota a and a some some other studies that have a werwere the the big signal is not seen as you might hope with e a probatic that supposed to treat a different disease there have been meta analysis that do suggest in certain instances recovery from a a anabiotics that there even though it may cause your my crobiter to recover more slowly that it may actually prevent a direal disease recovery from viral diry is probatis may help but because there is such a huge range of products and because each person is theire own little keeper when it comes to the mycrobiom it is really hard to know a whether there are great products for a given indication the really good advice that i have heard is tride of find a a a study that supports in a really well does in study an this is very hard for people who are n'n scientists to avaluate but with your experiencing a medical problem or when it consult te doctor a the eu know that that might be helpful but finding a study where specific probatic has successfully done whatever it is your looking for and then sticking with that probiotic is really the best recipe for as a as a place to start in the space ithing and what about prebiotics is their number of a reasons why i can imagine the prebacs would be beneficial a which essentially its your pushing the fibr system which we talked alout about to day yet ye absolutely a that the studies that have been done on prebiotics the it is really kind of a mixed bag of results the a there've been studies done with a purified fibres where you actually see my crobioted diversity plummet over the course of the study because a you get a very specific bloom in a small number of bacteria that are good at using nat one type of fibr and that is at the expense of all the other my crobes that are in the got and a it is really hard to replicate with purified fibre what you get for instance tat a salad bar in terms of the array of complex carba hydrates that youuld be exposing your mycroboto to and i think the kind of a a broad view of this in the field is that consuming a broad variety of plants is and and all the the diverse fibre that comes with that is probably better in fostering diversity in your mycrobiota then purified fibres now there are a again a lot of people who benefit from purified fibres either for geimotility a or or for other aspects of af gi health proms that they have been experiencing again i think it is a type of thing where you haf te try to find the thing that that is ripe for you but there a there also our studies that suggest that if you layr rapidly for menable a fibres on top of a western diet you actually can a resulting in weird metabolism happening in your liver because you have this incredibly rapid fermentation of fibr along with a lot of fat am coming into the system at least that is the that is the theory and in a mouse study that was published a few years ago they actually see that a subset of the mice develop hapatisalular carsonoma when there feta a hi dose prebiout o answer liver cancer on top of a a on top of a western diet whether that is representative of human biology we do not know but a purified fibres are definatly very different a'm both in terms of the diversity of structures but also in terms of how rapidly there formented in the got because a if you are eating plants the complex structures there really slow the microbes down an terms a fermentation in you and up with a slow raid of fermentation over the length of your collin as opposed to this big burst of frmentation that can happen if you eat something that is highly soluble and and easily accessed by the micrubs interesting i guess i is a fair to come back to this idea am trying avoid process foods the highly palitable foods there alght sometimes superhighly palitable foods there now call thetere packed with hidden sugars an also fire am sounds some fibr is good am and despite the outcome of the study you identify that if you have the appropriate micobiotar than you will a back round than net one will respond even better to the fir maybe a longer ramut face for for those folks and than the fermented foods it is no reason why you cannot do both and as we talk about before i'm a lot of formented foods have fibr you can aguilty birds with onestone totallyn and it could be the the diversity increase that we saw in the high fermented food group could be something that would aid the high fibre group and now were planting another study coming up were we are doing hgh fibre high fermented food and then fibre plus fermented food just to see if there is a center justic affect the hate on in roll am seriously although i guess onbiasd cause i sorvoe no where you'r trying to whit a well it will is it blood draws that you use to measure the inflamotone itexactly we on a o s l larger i weans i sout the ara you have covered a tremendous amount of information and i'm incredibly grateful this was a areabiology that despite having learned a lot about through papers and going to talks and and reading articles in the media has remaind somewhat mysterious to me until to day you have given us a very vivid picture of how thi system works where can people find out more about the work that you are doing a we concertalin provide links and an you and and your wife a co run your lab you have a book on this topic could you tell us about the book where we can learn more about the sanan burg lab in the work of youre doing a maybe people even trying in rollan some of these studies ye fantassica'd be great if we can get people to it and roll were always looking for a for r we nun willing participants a yes o a ericand my wife and i wrote a book called the good got and a that that really was a a response to how we were changing our lives in response to to being in the feeld being very familiar with the research seeing that a lot of our friends that were not studying thet got microbyum but were very well informed many of them scientists we are not doing the same things we were doing and it was very clear that it was just tha a lack of information funnling out of the field to other people and we wanted to a make that accessible to people who were not microbyum scientists there is also a really interesting story we are at a a conferent sight that just haw scientific conferences all summer long week after week after week different fields and it is people the work there that are just dealing with these new groups coming in week after week and the week we were there for microbyum conference a people a a the work in the dining comments came up to us in they said what group is this this is weird and were what is were in the said we cannot keep the saladbar stock and it was just it was very clear that nobody was doing what we were doing until we would go to microbyum conference and then everybody was doing the same stuff that we were doing and am we anyway we wrote this book to talk about our personal journey and kind of the science in the field and a yet just to a lay a foundation for people if they want o start thinking about these changes and then in terms of a and of connecting with our researc certainly there is the centere for humean microbyom studies at stamford whichis kind of our home base for doing a lot of these dietary interventions we liss the studies there m give more information on what were doing and then we have a lab webside to that people can go to and read more about our research a yet but a werkmen we are always looking for prarticipents for our studies great well we will provide links to all of those sources and i just want to say thank you much for sharing with us your knowledge for the incredible work that you and erica your wife and and cris do and am and are continuing to do i think this is an area that and when i started my training i heard a little bit about am microbyoda and always just lout those are people tat work on infectious disease and all the bad stufsorts it is interesting and and really a important that people realize that tit were caring all this vidal cargo and we need to take care of the cargoes who can take care of us thank you much for your time and for the work you do and i hope we can do it

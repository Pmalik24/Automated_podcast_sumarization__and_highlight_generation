as the twenty twenty four election gets closer jobiden is becoming more and more desperate and he should be the world is an uglier and uglier place onder president bidon nearly no one believes that the contry is moving in the right direction and jobiden is clearly an ailing a man he is not with it everyone knows it that apparently includes formin presideent barokobama according to the washington post over the week and quote for a presdent barokobama his raised questions about the structure of president bidon's re election campaign discusing the matter directly with bidon and telling the president's aids an allies the campaign needs to be impowerd to make decisions without clearing them with the white house according to three people familiar with the conversations in other words borokabama is telling jobiden to outsorst his campaign to people whar not jobiden now apparently obama grew animated in discussing the election he recommended david proof whos abama's own two thousand eight campaign manager to head ap jobidn tre elect effort other democrats are also deeply worred about bidn's re elect chances according too the post quote representative elisis lot can a michigan whos running for her states open senency has expressed concernd to allies she might not be able to win if bidns at the top of the ticket according to people familiar with those conversations and according to acios quote many high level democrats think things are not fine they fear the president's political machine has not found the sweetspot between a chills en and dangerous complacency and has been waig tos en bidn's allies our worid that his base will not joup that includes jim cliburn your member jim cliber the congressmen from south carolina whose in dwarsemen of jobidon over burning standers basically turnd the primary elections in twenty twenty toward jobide here is cliburn saying tha he is worried that voter turn out is just not going to happen for jobidon hhow worried are you about black voter showing up for president bidning november on that word a very concernd at tat tat tias a tat ha in no at sotes report abo sen is one repot indicati tha tat that i asat tan nat it at it him a that to him abat a ens a i hat noft problem it abat nivistation and what it is done tat probet is o we a that in able to break through at that thgowal in tht yet to people exactly wit is ps it has done guis do not worri he is not worried he is just a deeply deeply concerned and again he should be deeply deeply concernd because twenting twenty was an outlier election in terms of voter turn out as we discussed last week the presentage for eligible voters who showed up to vote in twenty twenty or vote by mail was sixty seven per cent that is sixto seven per cent tich points higher then in most prier elections 's real statistical outlier do you think that jobins can to get that can tot turn out in twenty twenty four the answer is not based on his performance this means the biden is already turning to his very last messaging refuge st op donald trump last week on friday he ov a speech in valley forge thofs a weird place to effectively launch your reelection campaign because when you think a valley forge you are immediately thinking of negativity my valleyforgeis not a happy place you are thinking nation under attack trying to live through its stark is moments just about in the shattle of defeat it is non about hope or about changed about soldiering through the winter it isabout george washington and a bunch of starving men at a fort it isabout gangreen and frostpigte now when i thing about ta that is of ion think reelect success if you are the president and you are runing based on your record and your running based on what a high achievement you are first ad ministration has been opening you'r campaign at valley forge is not exactly in inspiring moment but well get to wi jobin pick valleyforge in just at one at moment first if you are looking to save

additional fifty per cent off your very first month of coverage'ka gobin chose up in valleyforge to give this speech and the entire theme of the speech is going to be how he is george washington and i turnt out the donal trump is kitler thi's the entire thime of the speech in is can with t theme of the campaigns o you think that is wenty twenty was a rough campaign wait un til twenty twenty forg and we are in it it has begun hi's the first time by the way that jobiton ha's really launched against trump in the campaign he is really been attacking cquon kl mag or republicans in the impression that perhaps sompany wo is not on trumplasgon to win the nomination i think biding his hardy figuring i have to de find my pponent trump is likely to be the opponent he launched a full skille frontal assault on donald trump at leas best he can now the obtects he picks for the speeches are always a little but strainge the obtects he picked for his last democracy is in danger speech which was as i recall before the twenty twenty two election that one was in philadelphia he is flanked by marines in the background and a blood red intepennance hall and that is where he declared that thir's a battle for the soul of the nation well this time he decided to do a general paten he is standig in frontof a giant american fl ag and again all of this is just a little much it is a little much not the american plag mag place grate but flanking yourself the american plag wall you declare that the people whoe are running against our threats to the asctual democracy it is a little bit much it is a little much and this entire speech was bidon going full hitler as bidon saying that donald trump was a full skale motzy and those who had vote for him presumably oar little brownshirts that was the message of the speech he did not really to ferenshate between donald trump and his followers he did not really to frendshape between trums followers and othe republicans he' did not to frenshape between trump voters who do not januorsix and trumphotors who do januorsix everybody who hoald vote for trump is apparently in that particular camp and that is a very dangerous plag it is the same sort play that hillery clinton tried in twenty sixteen when she suggested that donald trump again was the leader of the deploribles and turns out the known voted for hillaryclinton people just did not show up and she lost the election well what happens this time when you have an ailing elderly fragile old man who has terrannically used the power of the executive in orer to overthrow generations of president with regard to what the president cannon cannot do standing up there and declaring that his political enemies are actually enemies of the republic itself again that is why he is a bally forg he wants the dark he wants the cold he wants you to feel that but he wants you to feel that not about his administration but about donald trump i think that this amank shot i really do bankchotston ton to workan politics for those were not familiar with baskaboult terminology a bankshot is when you used the backboard in ord to make a basket another words it requires a rickashiy jo bidon attacking donald trump as a candidate with reference to january sixth particularly as opposed to what donnal trump will do as president or what donald trumps o genda is as president it it is not con a play because again he dait on the calender as of to day is january eighth of two thousan and twenty four we are now three full years remove frum january six and in that intervening time donald trump has not in the president of the united states for all the talk about ho horrible januors six was at i think januorsex actually was quite horrible for all the talk about january six was horrible i did not actually stop the peaceful transition of power in the united states it did not donal trump left office on an allguration day and drobiden became president and since then there've been three intervening years since then thereve been three intervening years of this man being president and hre's wan talk about any of that any of it he just wants to talk about how donald trump is a threat to the republic and acain this would go over a lot better if this guy himself were not a threat to the republic as well discuss hura here is jobidon launching into his that this really was the launch of his campaign this is the first piece of his campaign relaunch very regarder year trum two hundred forty sicurs later just one day efore januar e six a day freer surd ar maver becasit was on that day we nearly lost te men lost at all oet no one who has a brain believes thus no one believes the january sits we nearly lost america it was a riot that went out of control and then was cleared up within three hours and then the vote was certified by republicans and then jobide make cim president of the united states does any one believe tht a bunch of golts and some people who jus did not now the how they were doing walking through the capitalbilding was a threat to the very fabric of the most powerful republic in the history of the world forall the people were saying tha it was a cou typically a coo requires you to activate the military and to use that military power in order to take control of the levers of power did any of that happen iin the actual building itself what was the crowd generally armed with weaponry ie fons him knives on beu they find lots of guns i'm bazuga's rocket lonchers what iyet you you can point out thet january six was ugly and terrible and was predicated on a lie which the device president of the united states had the powerst unilaterally overthrow the sort of fied election results from states that was not true it is a bad legal theory and donal trumps should never have been pushing that grap es that the same thing as we almost lost it all that day but the pillt here is the thing the reason that biding has to say that is because simplication is that if donald trump wins the next selection you will never vote again do you thnk that is true i do not thnk that is true i only tas true that if donald trump wins the next election you will never vote again i only in fact i know that is not true i know for a fact that is not true thatis not a reality he hast it the the worse is presidentcs he looks the worse he has to paint trump ats a fashust the fact that he is going in january twenty twenty fourt lice eleven months before the election the fact that he is already going trump is a notsy where d yo weuveveen go from there how do you build the campaign beyond that what is worse than notsy by trumpeits goin to be fullon statan he cannot say that because to any democrits sate but wet i where is goun a go from there iwoun't been understand he starty this is starting point he say here he goes he is continuin but the democrisi still america secer cars it is the most urgent question of our time that is what is the twenty twenty for election is all about toice is clear o top campagn is afbour hand not america not you o rops campagnis ofsess with the past not the futrue he is only to sacrifice ic abouts prut himself an power or campagn is differen from me como our capagns about americats about you it is about every ag in back oun ao cu py this country no one believes thus an can particularly because the line that he spet hes spouts there which he sehe says donal trump's campagn is obsessed with a pass not the future he is literally doing in entire speechobout generosix the entire speech is about janeri six now again i may not be amazing with math but i know how calender's work and i know thet january six twenty twenty one is in the past and i knoticed that you are at valley forge and you are sighting va past that this is not fact the entire stick of the campaign you being out there saying that donal trump is all about the pass and worl about the future as obviously no truealso when he says things ars sacred democracies at res again i would take that a little more seriously if i did not believe that you were willing to over throw petty much every vestage of democracy in pursuit af political power you attempted to use the occupational safety and hazard administration in order to foist thateens on eighty million people and we had to soo you to stop it you yunalaterally declared the you could get rid of student lonedat after acknowledging you ron of the power to do that you what what power has has this person not tried to irrigate to himself view the executive is anyuone truly believe that jobidon and comila haeris our deep down devoted quottn quat public servants none believes that gan this is go op better if jobide or nout trobide ma jobidon is jobidon making the claim thet donal trum is self centered is truly am every one knows that but how is that any different from jobidon and comila herris the last time we had a true public servant as they as a president of the united states i'm not yourats happen in my lifetime well get to more from jobidons campaign launch speechion what it means for his campaign and all the respecs again situation th unitedstates is very rim ring how things do not

standing in the doorway preventing donald trum from destroying democracy here we go for the first time o a is isurrectoso covestar e pecaltanortansrparin mer first time spahy renditor shatterin doors ar tacking the police a gain all of these charges would carry a lomer weight if commia her to rice president had tried to bail rioters out of prison during twenty twenty tred bail them out of jail in twenty twenty and gan any one who thinks that t january sixth events were even remotely on par with prior insurrections in the united states lake take the civil war is out of their mind that is a crazy talk no one takes the january sixth talk that seriously other than demograts who is he speaking to core the moderates out their warlike inflation is up twenty per cent the red sea is being overrun by whoovy pirates the president might fall down at any moment he secretary defence literally got lost over the weekend will talk aby that al a while but i do remember on january sixth was bad i understand thet democrats hon to make this thing a national holiday and that every yearoeging commemorate january sixth as thoug it is representative the great breach in american society but it really really is not it really is not i think this mouth works when jobidon is not on the ballad but when jobidon is on the ballat hins can ofe a tough sell then jobidnt started talking about how he won the last selection which of course is true what is weird though is that when he talked about that he did not talk about winning the electral college which is actually how you win elections that was the entirate debate of the january sixth rioters in in compatriotes the were a time at th electral collegein states certifications an all the rest insaid he sided the popular vote which agains a weird thing until weare we do not decide presidential lections in this country base on tha popular about a record eighty onmillion people voten my cans thandistes trop lost the popular vote by seven million get then he suggests the donal trump if he were to lose or if he were to come president again and had the power he would invoke the insurrection act to gong restall of his enemies now get that that is not when down trum talked about nvoking the insurrection act whos talk abut to stop actual honest god riots in the streets in two thousand twenty here is jobidon just let i gess the ideahers that if donal trum becomes president then jobiden will ent up in jail because trumpinvokes the insurrection acted to overthrow state governments ore something what is he talking about eformer a tromplansinvo the insurrectinsac insurrection u to allow him to deplors not low to do noryi allow him to deploy yes military forces on the streets themeri si caus thos to por oppose vermin talks tabouk the blood of e mar is be poison at goin the same exact language yofs notsigermity gas o again trump is a noty hes a noting na now most of us look a trump and we say that kisis clownish things on on the regular he does he says very silly things all the time in the same speechin which you will talk about poisoning the blood of the country hewill talk about how magnets do not work in water that is about how seriously most people take donald trumps actual verbiage but we are supposed to believe that donal trump who is buffoonish when he speaks very often eis somehow the same person who is going to in vokthe insurrection act in send federal troops into your home to arrestue if you oppose him or something and he says this figt the opponents of the republic our ponents of democracy he said at a at a rally flanked by a giant backdrop of an american flag as he lables his political opponents enemies of the republic and then of course he lumps in our re publicans ad this is this is his mainstick his mainstick is that he is going to lumpin pretty much everybody that is clip eight is true the pushan pold american istry's not a fry e every trie forad americ is neverrosispa asmeny times those o fer progresstoseloit tat fer for the no personal gan from those who trafficand lives to for power and profit for those whore dirnen by grievers and griff cotrume by consperisi victim o thos seto very histry a van books and can all this is just such a projection and when he says things the people who fear progress meaning if you do not agree with him those are people who exploit fear for personal gane he is literally standing theire telling if you do not vote for him the republic is over he is exploiting fear for personal gane he says from those who traffic an lies told for power and profit he literally lies about the history of the united states suggesting that because america has terrible racial history that means that all in aquolity to day is a form of an equity he says the people whoare triven by grievance and grift and consume by conspiricy an victim hut are on the other side he is entire coalition is a coalition of the supposed victims from those seek to bury history and band booksthere literally pulling down statues it is it is truly namazing thing this pitch is not going to work if this is bidon's final pitch i just do not see how this cannact in the same way that it did even say in twenty twenty two when jobidon was not actually on the ballat a this a trump was not on the ballat but neither was bidon when bidon is on the ballat is that what you are thinking about whell get tou joe bidon in just at one second his actual look what is atually happening to him the is par the probe is the person presenting this message is not a credible person presenting this message first i know it is to start and run a business done here at daily war time saving is key that is what i'm very excited t have ramp it is a bran new sponsor if you are finance professional looking for better way to maximize prodectivity and cut wasteful spending ramp could be for you ram p is the corporat card and spend management softhward as sine to help you save time and

bank members f d icy terms and conditions apply go check him out rant out ramp dot com slash chipiro of gat the prot on big promise here for jobiton is that if you ere a ringing image of small ou republicanism some ye believes in democracy he would not look a seenal decrepid messenger of a failing ad ministration but that is what he looks jobidon concluded his speech and one big proms hid ben having on this campaign and thraut is presidency is that jobidon literally does not knowhere to go when the speech is end his not know whate to do here isn't knw where to go he gets easily confused a'm tarr if this is herting feeligs but it happens to be the obvious case to any one who has e functioning preefrontal quarttexan retinas every time tobiten finishes a speech she starts wandering off into alls it is bazar i shan gillis is line which that he turns into a rumba at the end of speeches it is totally true soa what they do now i'm not getting ji bidon sheck she sprinted up on stage she sprints upon stage to go grab him by the hand and leed him off the stage here she us she sprints this thing ends she is on stage ok a shot here e go u g vam and he is trying to make a joke about his wife but he see nil it does not come off and hes trying say t she is the real power she sprints up on state of roms wise jill up there she is in the crablone second go and here is the reason jellows up there i th just to lead him back he can barely walk he is still confused when you the very an he is looking round the weremak wery gong well ther beo mo 'm s it is sad i'm laughing but but it is sad it actually is sad that the president of the united states is obviously ailing he is obviously ailing and by the way when we talk about threats to democracy here is a kind of a thrat's democracy what happens when you try to jisqualify your political opponent from the ballit what happens when you sick cur to ja on your political opponent filing no less then for differint cases in various jurisdictions some state some federal what whald exactly what amounts to an assault on the republic right now schere is a polling staff for you ready eighty one percent of democrats believe that stat should disqualify former president trump from presidential ballots according to a new sebiust news you gofv pole eighty one prersent four in five democrats believe that donald trump should just be thrown off ballots thrown off the ballots he is never been criminally convicted of anything e's anymeing charge with insurrection by the way and all the various cases where hi's being charge is not bein charge for insurrection which would be the thing that would theoretically in voke section three of the fourteenth amendment but any one presentof democrats want him summarily kicked off the ballot now poll republicans on whether they think that jo bidon shoul be actually barred from the ballot i guarantey it an any one per sent youron't talk about insurrectionius legal theories basically the case against trump when it comes to january sixth is twofull an you will heure both cases made by democrats usuld the merge them one is the january sixth was in fact the actual insurrection was a full scale coo attempt by donald trump wich is weirds and chouse the president of the united state and has the power of the executive to order aroun the military which he did not actually use there is that but the claim is that he incited in the insurrection the standard for incipement is much stronger then you need to go peacefully protest at the capital building that is not incitement of an insurrection too it was not in actual insurrection is a much a morons who decide there can a break into te capital building while screaming and shouting one drest a weird barbarian wearing buffalo horns and then a munch people who were jus gen to following along cause the police officers were standing right tere in their walking between the rope lines again tha nont tho minimize the violence done the police offcers outside the building those people we are arrested but case number one that they make is that trump was responsible for the events of january sixt that said trump raised the temperature that is not the same thing as being responsible four the actual breaking into the capital building two is the idea that from november fourth two january sixth donal trump put forward a bunch of specious legal theories they were untrue abat election fraud about certificasion of state election results about what the vice president could do in the face of all that and the idea is that that is insurrection the specious legal theories put forward into law is an attempted insurrection and this the other case the ulk your democrats make what o you call it when you activate state players in various states to literally removed your political opponent from the ballot without a criminal conviction or in vestigation of any sort what a dectly would you call that because of a is insurrectionist activity then be clearly qualifies s insurrectionist activity which is it youron't tolk lout threats sedemocracy it seems to me barring your political opponent the presumed nominy of the opponing opposing party from the ballot that seems all little insurrectioni that seems a little non democratic and yet this is what democrats keep saying by the way went when jo bidin says things donald trump is a threat to the republic and that january six was infact an insurrection he is agreeing with that legal theory when he suggest january six was an insurrection and the donal trump is responsible for january sixth he is agreeing with the legal theory that says donal trump nees to be barred from the ballot under the section three of the fourteenth amendment whut here is washington he see's mar murial bawzer who cannot stop cryime but certainly wants to stop from from being onballd talking about trumping boody from ballat do you think he should be barred fom any ballats given his actions on ganyway wa i support that every state taking variagrassive action on tit to keep him off the ballat i he is under gowan a in a court action across america that is amazing stoff meanwhile the colorato secretary state his responsible for borring from from the ballat there pending supreme corlitgation shis ta metisenfranchising anyone by barring the leading presidential candidat for the opposing party from the ballat do you think t ht there is a risk here of tisent franchising voters i think ther be is ris o tis infranchisein voters happen on january six when donald from tri to teel the presidency from the american people make no mistake that is exactly what he intended to der i we are a country of as in our constitutions there are qualifications for office is ta for example if a mo aters woe to von for onals ortinater it would not be able to do se because he is dis qualifie from ining for president under the united state constitution te dorsh is not disen franchising anyone he is actually dis qualified witdle man's i democratic hou mit say not allowing killed the vote for your political opponent that is exactly out from is responding to all this he says you are calling idiator that is rather insulting since i left power we got to beat this gi this fool this fool thes i stron a donal trop is redictator can you ma tonol trumpeser tocome dictator all i want to do s have a great country i want to have great i do not want to be ripped off with tratdeals i do not want these countrys sas a ripping us and boy we had it stopped we did you as sim se a we did the greatest ratdeals ever but all i want to dos have a great country low taxes we did the best taxteal ever bigger than the ragantaxteo we just what i have a great country says i ma dictator insulting actuallates insulting but he is a a threat because he is a threat or the to he does even note the word me she is a threat to democracy and then he says something that is true he says you can also be a threat democracy by being grossly in competent which is what gobidon actually is from it is not wrong about this and here is the problem for jobiton if things are going well tobide would not have to resort to this sort of attack but he has to now and at's because he is grossly incompetent dis gy goes around and says i ma threat to democrac sy know he sa threat as he is in competent he is a threat to democracy you can be grossly incompetent and be a threat to democracy cause he is gotus inc to wars were in warstow you look at the middleleas look at what happened in you cran that would have never happend these things would have never happened in flati i would have never happened t attack on isreaal would'tnever happened the attack on neu crane would never all these things would

planter arth that is the that is the one really again what this going to come down to if this a battle between bidin calling trum pitler and trump calling bidning competent i'm sorry trumskan win he is because guess what bidin is incompetent and trump is not hitler ein dislike him in the is a clowning thing he is fool on dis his reteric in the is toxic the number of people who believe truly

sunlight insanthemonicas drinking their sparkling wine well trump was president i its just it is it is an obsurd contentient if the battle is between the accurate definition of your opponent donald

catszer does not lose yourselfon but jo bide in needs to be chipped with his ad ministration officials or something because they just go missing for significant periods and no one noticis it is crazy do yo remember when secretary of transportation pep boutojedge took paturny leave to help his ailing husband who ad just given birth for a couple of months and no one notice who just gon frlike two mons arisi well a where is pet un well now if this is way worsh by the way this right here is way way worse apparently loid auston who is the secretary of defence now you may notice the united states is currnently engage tan genchally but fairly seriously in two incredibly serious conflicts the war in crane where the united states is in fact coordinating with you crane trying provide military aid and support and what is going on in the iddleast where the united states in om cases is directly engage we have right now aircraft carriers and battleships in the middleast in the red sea in the mediterranean we have weve been shooting down who the drones wehave been shooting down pirate ships the veln flatable boats thtr being used to attack shipping right now the united states has troops that are in harm's way in seria in e rock there being fired upon bironian forces it e makes a bit of difference where the defence secretary is the stuff is happening in real time here is the problem according to se annend deputy secretary defence cafholen hiks the pensagons number two leader was among the senior leaders kept in the dark about were the hellloid austin was he checked into the wall to read national military medical center following complications from nelective surgery and then he was just missing and no one knew according to political the pensagon did not tell present ntho bidon and others hop officials about tofene secretary austin's hospitalization for three full days according to three ouus officials wor in themiddle of all of this conflict all over the world really it is a spicy time inform policy and the secretary defence just goes missing for three days ango bidin does not know national security adviser jke sullivan and other senior white house ades did not know of austin's january first hospitalization un til the d'o d sent of a word on january fourth the officional said it was highly unlikely austeon ad conveyed wor debidon before jae solven was briefed on it if jake did not know noway the president knew said one of them wouldhave told him of austin's condition of notchake tif some one did tell the preside and jake would ben his first call bight n held a cordial conversation with austen on saturday night for one of the os officials the present has complete trusting confidence in secretary austin the official said but as the news of austin's situation came as a shock to all white house staff they were unaware the penagone bast was dealing with complications following an elective medical procesur national security staffors were surprised tok the pensagon longslat them know of astin status the pensagon did not make that in formation public until friday evening they notified congrasabout fifteen minutes before they released a public statement austins had quote i coul have done a better job in suring the public was appropriately informed i commit to doing better but this important to say this was my medical procedure i take full responsibility fror my decisions about disclosure a then you need to resign probably because that is crazy apparently he was in the ice to you for four days for four days on friday evening as many people were turning toward thir week and deo dspokes person major general pat rider announced austin had been hospitalized since january first his deputy caflen hexs partially assumed some of his duties during that time but there is one problem seeanen is now reporting that actually she had no idea where he was from january first which again was a monday until fhursday she did not know where he was there was no one at the top of the pentigon any time of conflict and wour secret people our suming te secretary defenethat his death's doing jop no he isn'the icy you the number thofs not been informities in the ic ou she is probably not even receiving up dates he should be receiving this is crazy that is totally wild why exactly with this happen apparently those because austen is supposedly two mocho to let anybody know that he went in for an elective precedure and ended up in the ice to you but tha's a terrible reason when you still left to let people know when you are missing producers act not in to day he told us and thn he did not come in that is hot works when you are sick when you go to the i see you im for four days and you are these secretary of defense you dont to let your number to kno what in the actual what the what what that is crazly nsire that is totally insane apparently these number to where bushy shofs on vacation in porter reko at the time and shos not in formed of austen's hospitalization till the afternoon of january forth at that point hiks began to make con tingions he plans toreturn to washington esy on friday but becaue asten was expected tore turn tho his full duties i'll be it from the hospital sheside stand porterico to enshurect contonuity of communications there all these people around the secretary t all times to manage hmen hlp monitated deybasis no one even told the white hose had one pence gon officials i'm surprise that no one is using the word cover up yet i mean is obviously a cover up what the whow whow that is crazy accoring to politico some one's head has to rall but i's onn be austens i'm sure to be some low level age who is told you need to tell my number too and then the number two never got told to low levelade ends up without a job excepts the lay usually works in washington to see the higher up shuttles all the responsibility down to somebody lower down that prsnt gets fired anza and tht's the end of the story the white have some pensigon insist austen's job is not in jeopardy but they are stickings that line despite not even knowing what is action ben going on at the pensagon the precise nature of austen turge tore medical complications even is current con dition remin unclear seener defence departmentin white house official still do not even know the details of the precedure totally insane totally totally crazy he no one's in charge the present is non charge he seccr defense non charge number two at thedefense department beti weu know the secretary defences no in charge things are going amazing meanwhile over on the border we now have some new stafts according two data released by the biding administration the department of homelen security they say that two point three million aot migrants havebeen alowed into the southernborder coring to deaches now i do not knowif that number is real that number seems low to me it does the reason that seems now lotomy is because at least six million border apprehensions have taken place since jobidon took office to put that by way of prespective during the entire for years ove donnald trumps administration the're one point six million border apprehensions by the wynt apprehension is not mean that the person is then turned away and sent back home where they came from a border apprehension means they pick you up they take you to it tettention facility if you claim asylem then they release youintof the country within seventy two hours of the date to come back first some sort of court date that is literallyti means the period of time between when you arrive in the country andare picked up by border patrol and when youre released ins the interior of the united states is usually within a week whill always within a week and usually within seventy two hours when they say two only two point three million people of entr of the country i have serious doubts that that number is accurate i think that number is wa way higher that also oes not include the stimated one million godaways people who just when into the country smuggle drugs into te country or entered but tween ports of caul and and were not picked up by border patrol and apparently known godaways only re per cent may b min they really do not know s they on't know me un known godaways they estimated the c b p that 's sixty per cent of all godaways are known which means youre talking about another eight hundred thousand unknown godaways theoretically sho ime got nearly two million people we have got into the country as it godaways anyor talking about according to d h s two point three millions that is four point one million 'sa lot of people and by theway the numbers are way hiredn that there is no ways only two poin three million people a d chu spokes woman said saturday the agency continus sotport significant numbers if on authorized migrons including family but is that reality i really really doubt it again all you have to do is look at the charts the charts are insane in december of twenty twenty which is the last month of donald trump full month of donaldtrum's presidency youar talkingabout approximately eighty thousand seventy five thousand border apprehensions bife by march of twenty twenty one when everybody now realizes your bidens in office youare looking at north of one hundredan seventy five thousand boarder apprehensions more than double and then in december this last december three hundred thousand apparently these are insane numbers obviously and it is a real border crisis it is not just that is crisis the borderts that everybody knows to crisis at the border according to a brando c bs news you gov poll forty five per cent of americans say whats happening the border is a crisis thirty per cent soy woas happenig th border is very serious eighteen per cent say that it is somewhat serious you are now up to by those numbers ninety three per cent of americans say that is at least somewhat serious seventy five per cent say a crisis or very serious by the way to crisis only seven per cent say not much of a problem ay that is i that is ian astonishing number according that sam pole immigrants in your local area have been forty per cent increasing thirty five per cent haveng noticed twenty five per cent decreasing as far as whether people believe that the biden administration should be tougher should be easier or is handlingthings right fift five per cent said should be tough fer in suptember it is now sixty three per cent two thirds w americans believe thet jobdon shuld be toughfer on the border only sixteen per cent say that jobiden should be easier and the twenty one presented say ther handling thingis right obviously does understand wat the hel's going on the border by theway what is actual going on the borer is two things one dow trums fr main a mexical policy was ended when people come to the border an the claim asylum by american lather ow put into the system he use to be don trum had negotiated to deal withthe mexicans to keep people who applied for asylum in mexico awaiting their border hearing this cut down on ai legal emmigration by a huge margin bekaus a lod those people get turned down and if he ready a mexico they have no entery to the country day one jobidon ended that policee instead people come they immediately say i fear for my life my home country the united states states them in process them and releases them into he general interior of the united states that is wal you have to do just say i fear to go back to my home country under americas current asylum rules number two because the united states refuses to detain full families together under the flora settlemen and because the united states re fuses do you re main a mexico a'll yet to do shop witht kid andbasically yreging to be released into the interior of the united states jobidon ended every policy that would have prevented mass illegal immigration by the wy the car tells know this the cartells and been redirecting american resources toward this wave ofy legal migrants that is e why they are doing it and then meanwhile while the board patrol is acting as a bussing and farying service for legal emigrans all of the godways that were talkingabout drugs smugglers criminals those people are just t entering between these points us rushing into the interor of the united states and boarder patrol is not there it is not that we require more border patrol agents its that the board patrol agents we do have oure basically acting as d m b agents at this point and members of the local metropolitan bussing l authority as hoppose to you kno actual boarder patrol agents here is them images a bum a breach in the boarderwall and arizona the by e way the the way tha you reach the borderwall is om if they are no bord patrol agents around they are no boarde patral agents around heg just cut a hole in the wall which 's wha thyre doing hearsome thayo te legal emigran strimming through that borderwall this would be on thursday it' e people just walkin right on through here we go in the united states by the wy even if they are caught at this point border patrol then ask them what ar you doing here and they say i feared you go home to my country and then what happens theyre process to released into the interior of the united states that is the way the dhis works mike johnson these speaker of the house he says yo of course this is a border crisis that is why we are trying to focus in on it what happens miss peaker an no no money for you cran no money ter israel no money for tie on and then no fix for the border a ma hatis is carisoll what do you thinkin well well we are thinking that the white house has the com toit sens as they are gettin cressur fro even dever crats o course tha the mayer of these fic sectary sitis and blue states thetre crying out for help they no that a thouts as tan abo ther tran in all ther re sours as there we have a tecollics on the other side ofthe ow who understan n that this is aprise us that must be resolves iam often tess tacke and hopeful that they will listen of the americant people and make then u sary changes and policy tho get this thut i hope the set it whitl tacke up our let us lation aar to and to the right thing the comen sens thing that fix the problem amazingly enough the leader of the sane opposition on this point is john fetterman i dron't havent john fetterman h's certai into christans intima it is amazing here is john fetterman over the began talking by the borograzes anan allies admit theres ta clise at the border and th i do not know how anypoty could pretend let there isn's correct everyone knows this everyone knows this but democrats are tighed into the idea there must be masse migration mass illegal migration that they are refusing border funding if it even means changing the asylum rules that is what' crazy the single thing that is the biggest magnet dwriving people north of the border is this idiotic rule that if you claim asylum with no evidence whatsoever that you are being oppress in your home country other than your home country is can asoc you are immediately admitted republicans ha been saying ookate why do not we do a fou things why dn't we number ones who remin a mexico number too if you claim asylum we have to establish at your initial hering before release you into the united states thyou are likely to prevailum in that claim for asylum you cannot you say the magic words and then abrcate abra all f the door s opan democrat suppose this alehuns or mayorcas the dacha secretary he says that they would not even accept more funs if those funs were used for du portation when you say that republicans will not except the extrafunding they have a problem with the funds being used to release an transport illegal amigrants around the country congress is listening right now which you exexcept the extra funding on the condition that the funds could only be used for detention and renew removal but not release into the country a brect the funds are needed to provide the department of homelyn security with more borted patrol agents the funds are needed to provide the department of homelye security with more technology the funds are needed to provide our department with more detention space to provide the department of justice with more imigration judges what he wants is more money to broad in the spicket along more legal imigans into the country why well because ao se she says the quapart a la sas there two ways of shutting don in legal migration whone s you close the border the other s you prevent anyone from saying tes yupalon to legal out say thes fouve are legal now you an't you tended legal migration by this token by the wagan and all murder in the united states by legalizing murder it watch abricat abra murder is now legal i gess that no illegal murder is taking places on murder is legal that is baselgood aos he is suggesting here just with regard to emigration here she does from all parts from the political spacktrown whyne of the pigetations that will have when it comes to megration is the fact that we have an undocumento population tat you can fix that by trina build a law or you can fix fat by trina document people and create a pactositisenshep i failook at the fiftons ekno that our shelter system hav wait an things that but one of the reson that our public system experience way ifs because people do not have a documented and reliable path to work and fifteen an fols just all of our ancesters did and our and our granparin yet the difference is that when our great grandparents came to the united states there was not a giant welfare system that was in plays for public support of people who came he without any job prospects whatsoever also because of that people were force ta similate much more quickly when my great grandparents came to the united states in the early twentieth century they will spoke gittish none of their kids did why because the markets did not bear people speaking gidtish particularly learning english was a major major aspect of this it turns out thet markets are great way to make people assimilate to american values because if yo would to live in a market base economy youve chave to peter to the customer bowen get rid then entire system and then you declared there should be open emigration of course what you went up with is a multype cultural stoo in which nobody actually assimilates ibut you saidn't quite part i lad which the democrats you want in open boarder s again we are talking about open border not a great economy and say d i all over the administration verses donald trump is a fash just which one of those you thinks is more damaging politically when it comes to d i this administration as declared itself in favor of equity at every step of the american experiments this administration is says that in fact equity modivates all of their policy apparently including migration policy which is why we are just can open the board wide well i have to say oneof the great exchanges i've seen recently on telvision happened over the we can ryhan salom is a an author and right rights over the manhatan institute use on john gulberg and on the other side of this debate were a couple of wild leftese including cariswisher andthe're talking about d yi an ryhan who is not a white american is in fact my nority american you would be mumped into the people of color category he just goes off right hereins prtty spectacular when a person of color fails all of us anate an inditemen of an entire system that the right does this a ridiculous she was a graduate of exiter and stanford with a pachty from harvard an w ateration aa ceterationation american who came from a family that dominated the concrete in do siraety she was not the wretched of the earth yhou a soine whoshon an ogsdaughter barredly and i oition raat waar a lo go absolutely not but she was selected because she a stablished the ofths of diversity equity inclusiod an belonging ot harvard she prosided over a steep decline in th freez feech foi i lean she alsoargit by nority profectlolo to sanctit from per perspective that la a problem she waartin with ideas not flly byhog ever i ha are nothey he is exactly right about all of that but again hiversity equin inclusion stick that is the biding stick again you have lined up on the one side don trums te fasas notzy or in jobines worth whos o gove to and on the other side you have jobidon is doing equity hesillelimigration and by the way he is doing complete supplied chain failure the hoothe attacks on shipping continue across the world the cost of shipping has markedly increased you wige that tis a chart from axios and what it shows is the average shipping contanerates for particular roots and what you see is they have jumped spiked dromadically toward the end of december why because that is exactly when ye startd seeing hoothy attacking shipping in the red sea and the babyl mandib straight in facts what you see is that the cost of shipping from the asia medi terranean from as to the mediterranean areas jumped wildly from a little bit over twenty three hundred dollars a container to fifty one hundred dollars the tlik doubled when you look at shipping from asa to the north american east coast rit the stuff the we care about ye cost of shipping went from what loos about twenty three hundred and twenty five hundred dollars to thirty nine hundred dollars that 'stha massit that is pur container who bears that cost you bear that cost we all bear that cost because jobidon is allowing the hoothies to basically gum up the works in the red see and in the babelmandeb straight why because democrats keep hoping that well if we are swet and if we are nice than things are not oin askclate me ferther when it is precisely the opposite tack that actually gats thing is to calm in th midleast when you ont calm things in the midleast it you do you make clear that if you screw it the united states things go real bad for you that is the actual way you calm things in the mdeleast it is why every one in te elast was afrit to start up while donal trump was president because they thought that guis nuts that guids rase you migt just fire missile at my house i do not know but with jobidens i od or no should we touch the whothese shwe not that maybe should remove an airocraft carrier from the meditr why do youthink thes thing's lasting as long as it is with re got to his block has booge keep firing antitank misiles into northern isral why dyuthink the're doing that if the united states had liscen when his missiles goes aright and hits an american and you will not exist to morrow morning which is true that is actully the reality by the way that is what would happen if the united states said that if the united states said if you rads your rate of fire above ex and you just wone exist tomorowmorning you kno it would stop tomorrow morning that but jobidon is too cowardly to do any of this instad you have gener for grand home who is out there declaring that they kind of hope that things are going to calm down they are not sure exactly if theyre goig to calm down nockin this secretary of energy togging about how shipping ill poblyc get atter even though marsk is now saying that the'e can completely avoid the red sea which of course creades is obliging bottle nack what will it take to actually insure that shipships can go through that area o coobviously yet there has to be this coalition effort i know that many commersial a a ship shippers are really not just the're doing what mersk has decided to do which is to a ircumvent the red sea and the siss canal and that may add some price to to energy in terms of how long it takes and how much more sull it takes to get the shipment surround but this coalition and the active not just monitring but a but in certion of both a sanctions as well as a lots of discussions behind the scenes i think we are gin by hopefully if it does not escolate further will be o k hopefully if it does not esclade further 'se responsibilities ma sure does not eslade further might be your ad menistration's responsibility and here and lies the problem they do not want the responsibility that just wen y all about down from i

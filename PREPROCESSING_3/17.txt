jobidon's presidency is over i'm's gon t put it out there right now his presidency is over it was ended yesterday when the special council robert her the person who is investigating jobidons mis handling of classified materials issued a report essentially suggesting that jobidon is non compos mentus that the jude does not have a functioning braiy he said it in the report bring it to all the details because jobiden then proceeded to blow himself up the challenger it is the most disastrous press conference in american history it was a shocking day in politics yesterday it all began with the usual which is jobidon going out on the stump and making dum mistakes an seeming as though he is not all there yesterday jobidon was giving a speech in the middle of the speech he started again babbling nonsensically missing up basic terms here here he was yesterday well i si w i we pushjolis prograver tedoee presereereee estetor grigsta red state or a green stake and this is every single day with jobidon we'n doing this for a couple of years at this point where everyclip you play of jobidon he screwing something up and as i've said before watching a jobidon press conference at this point is watching it will lenda cross a tight rope over a volcano you are not watching because you are hopeful that he is gon to make it you are watching because you want to be watching if god forbid he falls off the tight rope and yesterday jobidon did not just fall off the tight rope he jumped off the tight rope directly into the political volcano now again all this began with this usual day this sort of mistake caejohmp pereis increasingly being asked to defend the fact that jobidon is not all there here sho us yesterday giving a variety of excuses for why he 'd screwed up a bunch of different things over the course of the last week or this happens it t a it is it happens to all of us aand it is common but i do want to i do want to make sure we do not forget wit the overraw arching kind of thene what he is trying to say about about our leadership on the cle stage what do you taya to amerigan ho tater and ma the three time in ji the coup of gat ga weer on a r ted tehtheagan as you just statis in your question comme i i just laid out a other other leaders in their community or elected officials who have done the same it is not not on common eger in e ies the president powef iou an not she uashe is line he doesnit all the time i the line from the white house has been surie's up there an age but you screw things up to you forget where your keys are you forget where you'r phone is that does not mean that he cannot be president of the united states and then yesterday and hd met'l laugh of the afternoon he special council report onjobidons mis handling of classified documents brakes and there two headlines from the report one of the headlines is that jobidin is quote un quote exonerated now that headline baries a law of misuse of classified materials we can go through the whole report but the big headline is that the real reason that they are not actively going to prosecute jobidon fom mis handling classified materials is because they believe the his senile old man let us go through the report in all of its detail mhen we will get to what again is the hindenberg of presidential press conferences oe the humanity i mean jobidon set

send wen an divided up into a few parteers get all the details cause this pretty important first yes jo bidin did keep classified documents clearly there ware classified materials that were in his possession but says the department of justice were not on a prosecute him quote we conclude no criminal charges are warrnted in this matter we would reach the same conclusion even if to partment of justice policy did not fore closhes criminal charges against the sitting president our in vestigation on covered evidence that presinetent biton wilfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen these materials included one marked classified documents about military and foreign policy in effganistam and two notebooks containing mister bidon's hand written entries about issues of national security and foreign policy implicating sensitive intelligence sources and methods afthe agents recovered these materials from the garrash offices and basement and in mister bidn's wilmington delaware home however for the reasons sunrise below we can clude the evidence does not establishes mister bidin's gilt beyond a reasonable doubt now what exactly did bidn have in his possession apparently he had documents from fall to thousand nine that had classification markings up to top secret sensed f compartmented information level those were founds in a box in bidon's delaware gerage that contained other materials of great personal significance to him and that he appears to a personally used and access as well these materials were mostly proof of a stan that mister bidon took that he regarded as very important which was all about how he was pushing borakobama to be ys pullfull scale out of afganniston which of course jobid then did as president when he became president in the most asastras fashion in american history now the report continues and he said and an the special council says that jobiden certainly knew this was a legal or should have known it was i legal to keep these classified materials and the report reads a lot the hillery clinton report that eventually exonerated her from james comey busily saying she was guilty bught it is to what this this report really is is he is guilty of miss handlling classified materials but jobido shold have nown this was a legal according to the special council robert her some evidence suggests mister bid new he could not keep classified handwritten notes at home after leaving office bidon ho had decades of experience of lassified information was deeply familiar with the messures taken to safeguard clssified information and the need for those measures to prevent harm to national security in fact twice in two thousand seventeen jobidon visited the national archive skiff to review his classified note clars whele writing his book tut he kept his note books which also contained classified information in unlocked drawers at home he had strong motivations to do and to ignore the rules were properly handling the classified information in his note books he consulted those note books liberally during hours of dis cussions with his ghost writer and viewed them as highly crivate and valued possessions with which he was unwilling to part in fact wele reading aloud from his notebook and is the most damning part wele reading aloud from his note book mister bid enlisted four points he made about the arock setuation during ajuly seventh two thousand fifty meeting bidn explained to his ghost writer or person in mark's wanitszer that he had made his similar argument years earlier during the twot thass an nine d abate about the troop surge in afgannistan bidon told's wanitter he had sent obama a forty page handwriten memol arguing against the employmen of additional troops in nafgannistan mid sentence during the interview bidon said in a matter of fast tone that he had quote just found to all the classified stuff downstairs again first rule of criming folks do not do it on tape jobidon did it on tape he had mits full scale on the tape in his words that he quote just found all the classified stuff downstairs awhich is him admitting that he hasifclassified stuff and it is downstairs it is no difference then donald trump ragging to a reporter that he had in front of them a classified set of documents all about oron for example is is the same things as i have i just found all the classified stuff downstairs n that shoul be open and shut case of violation of criminal law when a comes to classified information and mishandling thereof and as we see are are political boss is in this country they get treatment that no one else would receive when my wife doctor was working at veteran's affairs if she had walked out of the veteran's affairs building i whenchras in residency with biolations of hippot material sheld ouldhave een prosecuted jobidon is bragging to his ghost writers that he has classified documents at the highest level in his cabinet downstairs on tape and the still didn'n prosecute him the special council found that there is evidence that after his vice presidency bidon wilfully retained marked classified documents bat afgannistan and unmark classified handwritten notes in his note boks both of which he stored in unsecured places in his houts and it is clearly b idon's material is not as though got mixed in and we know this because is can ofunny he wrote on one of the folders afganistan but he spelled fganistan without the age member this this a captain brilliants over here he cannot spell the word afanastand but e knows all about afganistan policy according to the special council mister bidn said the handwritten label on the folder looks his handwriting the distinctive miss spelling of afganistan con firms this bidon repeatedly used this or a similar mists pelling in handwritten notes as vice president and before that notes he took a senator dating bactinactiaty agan i man let let us be real about this jobidon was never any intellectual bracchakes the fact hthe is been mispelling the word afganistan for literally forty years is kind of amazing rea the special council then finds a series of excuses for why jobidon should not be prosecuted number one the special council says we expect bidons defence at trial would be he thought that his notebooks were personal property in who was allowed to take them home even if they contained classified in formation during our interview of him that mister bdon was emphatic to claring his notebooks are quote my property and every presen before me has done the exacsam thing a now that sounds lot presid in trump frankly presiden trump has been claming over and over and over that every document in his possession is mine and that is actuly been the real excuse it is not as though he was going to disseminate documents to the russians or something his ik these are my documents i'm cape that emin's exactly abidna saying except bidasin herhornarces that excuse for not prosecuting bidon looks very much the defends that donal trump is going to use in his one classified documents mishandling case furthermore the place where bidon was storing this stuff not exactly the most secure location quote we expect many jurs to be struck by the place where the afgannistansdocuments were ultimately found in bidons delaware home and a badly damage box in the garage near a collapsed dog crate a dog bed a zapbotes box and empty bucket a broken lamp raped with ducktap potting soil and synthatic firewood clearly handling classified materials in the way they should be handled now the special council does go out of his way to try to distinguish bidon from trump saying quote most notably after being given multiple chanceis to return classified documents and woid prosecution mister trump allegedly tid the oposite according to the indictment he not only refuse to return documents for months he also obstructed justis by enlisting others to destroy evidences and then to lie about it in contrast bidon turning classified documents to the national our coss et cetera now is that this positive on a difference between trump and bidon not really because what that really suggests is that jobidon was perfectly willing to misshannal classified documents for years on end and only when he got caught that iswhen he turned overall the documents which does not relieve you of the responsibility nocuments hannel classified documents if i take home classified documents for ten years and i'mis handle them i lev thm out everywhere and then you come to means a turn in the documents and then i turned in the documents that does not mean i did not yo a a criminal act befor and by the way when it comes to hillery clentonshe actually bleech bitter hardrive nal that but none of this none of this is the real reason they are not prosecuting jobidon the real reason they are not prossecuting jobidon is because special council roberher makes it clear in the report is what devistating for biton he makes it clear over and over and over again in this report that jo biton is no longer mentally fit to be even in the even in the defence box let alone precident of the united states what ambout to reach you are all direct quotes from the special council report making absolutely clear that jobiten is no longer with us and notaonly that has not been with us for years theit is more on this in just one a second first that old car is still sitting right there you are tired of looking at it you are really tired

dot org slashben get that ball rolling go checked him out right now if you have that old car in the in the drivic just get rid of it get the donation get the right off crs for ids at dot org slashben here is what the re ports has quote mister biten's memory was significantly limited both during his recorded interviews with a ghost writer in twenty seventeen and in his interview with our office in twenty twenty three now remember the year is twenty twenty fort this report is saying that jo biten's memory was going in twenty seventeen tht is full on seven years go at's gotten worse since then quote we have also considered that at trial mister bitn would likely presents himself to ha jury as he did during our interview of him as a sympathetic well meaning elderly man with a poor memory another words his defence is going to be and he is a nice old gent who does remember things any more which is that a great description of what you want in the oval office baston ar direct interactions with and observations of him his some one for whom it many jurors once whi dens fi reasonable doubt it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him by then a former president well into his aties of a serious fellony that requires a mental state of wilfulness s there saying that they are just can to see a jeriatric dotterd and the'regnto let him off more quotes from the special council report quote mister bitn's memory also appears to have significant limitations both at the time he spoke to his gost writer is wonitser in twenty seventeen as evidence by their recorded conversations and to day as evidence by his recorded interview with our office mister biton's recorded conversations with as wantiter from twenty seventeen are often painfully slow with mister biton struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries another quote in his interview with our office mister biten's memory was even worse he did not remember when hofs vice president it isn mind bogling sufffoks jobiton sits down with special council investigating him over classified documents he is president of te united states of the time he does not remember when he was vice president forgetting on the first day of his interview when his term ended quote if it was twenty thirteen when 't i stop being vice president and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term t began quote into thousanon a i still vice president now call me crazy but it seems to me that the president of the united states should remember when he was vice president of the united states in terms of the years that seem pretty important ike i remember the year that we started our company here at daily wire pretty important year twenty fifteen iremember's pretty important there is lock going on that year that is not being vice president of the united states he was vice president he could not remember the years who ise vice president it gets worse quote he did not remember even within several years when his son bou died mind bogling absolutely min bogling mein jobidon pulls out the story of bofsdaf all the time on the campaign trail when ask difficult clestions all the time its started off as sor of a sad thing that he would that he woud talk about his deceased son and then became obnoxious and terrible because heu would do it in the worst possible circumstances he be talking to the family of he dead soldier in ho suddenly be talking about bou and implying the bo had died in a rock in service or something but now we are learning from the special council that he didnt he quote did not remember even within several years when his son bo ded and his membory appeared hazy when describing the afgannistandtbate thatwas once important to him among other things he mistakenly said he had a real difference of opinion with general carl i canbury when in fact i can bury was an allie who mister biton sited approvingly in his thanks giving memode to president obama there is more quote given mister btons tendency toward loose talk withis wanitzer and mister biton's limited presition and recalled uring his interview with our office discussed above reasonable juroers may hesitate to place too much evidentiary wait on a single eightword utterance his waniter from almost eight years ago in the absence of other more direct evidence and other the reason that wre not prosecuting him oversaying to his ghost writer i have a bunch of classified information down stairs is because he is too old in his two senile and then they reiterate bidon will likely presents himself to the jury as a sympathetic well meaning elderly man with a poor memory bhile he is and must be accountable for his actions he is after all the president of the united states bason are direct observations of him bidon is some one for whom many jurs wants to search for reasonable doubt quote we believe some of the same evidence that supports reasonable doubt for classfied afganistans documents also supports reasonable doubts for the note books including mister biton's cooperation withtheinvestigation his diminishing faculties in advancing age and his sympathetic demeanor again nice old senile man is the vertict that is why he is not going to jail this report is much more dovi stating than a simple indictmentwould a ben a simple inditment bine publer to gotten off you to killed trums classfied doctments dictment as well but be stain of a special prosecutor saying we cannot prosecute him because he is old in senile is devastating and of course be bidant heen picked up on that right away they sent a letter his lawyers to robert herk what we do not believe the reports treatment of presenent abidings memoryes accurate or appropriate the report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a common place ocurence among witnesses a lack of recall of years old evends such comments have no place in a department of justice report particularly one that in the first paragraph anounces no criminal charges are warranted and that the evidence does not establish mister biton's guilt and then they make an excuse the excuse they use for whyd jobiden cannot recall when his son died or when ho is vice president is quote his interview began the day after the october seven the tax on his rol that is going to be the actual line tht's going tobe the actual line now i ask you is that a good defence there is a major international crisis and the president gets more see nile and that apparently is supposed to be a defense to his sinility see that is why we hire you for the job is because you are supposed to handol the fore a m fon call as hillerclin once called it with some level of mental acuity if you lose your faculty is the minute in initernational emergency bricks out what are you good for what are you good for present embitent then put out a ritten statement in which he said quote over my career public service i have always work to protect america security i take these question seriously no one has ever questioned that ay he did not make any comment in his original statement about his lack of mental faculty at this point jke taperon tanan was correctly skeptical abiding's original explanation andy could see many members the media were prettyu critical of the defense because we can all see it we can all see it and everybody has ben told in the media to shut up about jobidon being seenile he seenile he dan seenile for several years at this point we all know it every timeyou watch him talk you see it every time you watch him walk you can see he no longer is in control of himself this is not a giant secret we all buch hus been gaslet for years on end we gets more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes or unfiled returns this year the ires is escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents great nes wellin these challenging times your best offenceis use tax network you es say along with hiring thousands of new agents in field officers the ires is kicked off twenty twenty four by sending over five million pay up letters to those who have unfiled tax returns or balanceis owed hes goese are not your friends do not wave your rights and speak with these agents on your own without back up tax anot work you us say i trusted tax rely firm has saved over a million dollars in back taxes for their clients they can help you secure the bestial possible whetheryo ten thousand dollars or ten million dolars they can help whether it is business or personal taxes whethey have the means to pay or yon fixed income tax net work can help finally resolve your tax burdens once and for all sees control of your financial future raght ow do not let tax issues over power you contact tax nat work you u say for immediate relief and expert guidans call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or visit t and ou i sa dot com slash ofpuro turned to tax nat work you say find our path to financial piece of mind that' t and you u sa dot com slash of pero and even the medium members the media were tarting to say ought know this it the special council is not wrong here is jake taper yesterday let us talk aabout that of a little bit more because this is a particularly bad week for this report and it is comments about presdent bys faculties in his memory to come out because twice this week he has acted as if he in two thousand twenty one spoke to european leaders who have been dead for years a once he confused of franclon me terall who died in nineteen ninety six with emanual mac cran who is still very much alive and another time he was referring to angla marcoll until recently the the chanceler germanly and referred te helmet col who i think tot in two thousand seventeen im this memory issue is already out there but i wontder know how many voters in michigan with consen you think know the difference between no no a noboy but they ar no or arguni half ther weyu an oke or argun a calf ter vote for president based on whether someone is naming manuel mac cron or franc francpa ma toragen bu name they probably do not even know but i thogh not i gon it is ta bount faculty in memory and ind in whether not somebody they perceive is competent but he tapper is speaking for virtually all americans on this whatever jobidon's rantom failure of the day it is one about what he said when he mixes up a dead french president with a live friends president or makes up germany in frand the problem of course is that every one knows every one can look and see that jobidon is no longer in control of his faculties this is now merchancy time and fairly late last night for jobiton which is to say seven forty five at night we know that he usually calls a litt seven p m because again the man is he is currently on the old age home sceduel they have him in political hospice this president it is really sad honest to god it is really really sad he is my president because he was elected president and it is dad to watch the president of the united states not in control of himself say they called a pressor an emergency pressor at seven forty five now thre's only one bull for calling in a merchantcy press conference and that is to blow up the widespread assumption that jobidon is not in control of himself at the ideal was going to be than enormal political cycle wht would happen is the present would come out he will be fully in control he be ready to go fully in control and he would then demonstrate that the special council was just wrong that he was having an off day or that he had not had a low sleep last night or that the special council hates him but clearly this is a person who is not only in command this is a person who is at the piq of his powers jobi don comes out last night wennt go through this whole press conference because it is ve most is asterous press conference in presidential histry it with barnon barnon a seen a watomum folks and following the stuff for over twenty years and if seen a lot o tape this is easily the worst press conference f all time because not only does jobidn show that he is not in control of his faculties he then proceeds to commit the seeme baucheries tha lad the special council to say that he is not in control of his faculties this thing starts off and as always jobidon 'skelling al wind up towaight at this point the first several minutes li gok hav well he looks away and then as whatever they have shot him up with wears off he starts to fail and the battery start to sputter and the light behind his eyes starts to dim he can see it happening in real time which is whie is important t we watch thewhole thing jo bidon staggers out at about seven fifty five is ten fifty minutes late to his own prss conference and as some fifty eight i guess as thirty minutes late to his own press conference and he proceeds to out to then speak about the special council report as the special counts released his findy to day about then look into my handlyn of classified documents i esplease to see he reached to firm conclusin thet no charges should be brought against me in this case this was in exaust of investigation going back more than forty years even in in nineteen seventies when iwav still a new ninestate sent and especial countil acknowledged i co operated concletely i did not throupen y road locks i saw it no delays in fact i was determen to give thespeciof counsil what he needed i went forwith a five hour in person five irein personanity over two dayse on octobey eighth and nine of last year even though israel had just been attacked by ha mosths on the seventh and i was very occupied was in the middle of handlyternational crisise i was especially please o se spester counsil make clear the start distinction differens between this case in mister trump's case special council wrote and id co several me teral testinctions between mister thomps case mister biters are clear continuing o ot most notably after give a modable chancos return classified documents to avoid prosecution mister chompel legerly did the opposite cording to the indictment he not only refused to return the documents for many months he all sobstructed justice by enlisting others to destoy evidence and then to lie about it in contrast whon to say mister bidon turned in classified documents to the national our cart and department of justice consented a the search of mudib locases including his home sat for voluntary interview and another ways co operated with ninvestig posit defferos in you can see obviously heis riaing u tello pronpter an he is not pausing to thank or anything heses reading a quote of the telle pronpter and the floring is getting worse again i'm hesitant to analyzed the affect of jobidons speaking because what is what is theire to say but this enire press concer conference was designed regarding affect wegets him oreon ths in just one moment first are you having

some lingle in report about my recollection of events this even reference that i do not remember when my son di onhe dere res an get posof her secon at this is where it starts to go off the rails for join truly authorels far he is just been reading from the report now he has no defense for the claim that he does not know whan is sundied instead he tries to substitute outrage the claim was that jobidon will be found by a jury to be an affable elderly gentlemen who is not in controle his fa aculties jobidon went out theyeraprove that he is in control of his faculties instead he spent the rest of the press conference demonstrating that he is in fact not affable that he is in fact not likeable this is where thing sart to go totally sideways for him a can i's ask the questioni thought to myself as ty e dan business wat what me tay somthn si me commin i was ince to day he died every sing e day rose he got day oh nomo they rewholl to service rememberi him of ta posery teir friends he he literally in the middle of his big dramatic moment can not remember where they got the rosary for beau when we we are three minutes into thes press conference it is started seven fifty eight is now eigto one p m eastern time and the president of the united states trying to demonstrate that he is in full control of his faculties and gettng into the heightened o motional moment of trying to show that he knows every detail about bau himself steps directly on to the land mino mentioning a thing no one asked about this rosary that he was going to uses a prob he pulls it out and then cannot remember whre he got it in the middle of the pressor that is just the beginning folks it gets worse i me te te a loti ii me anyone i me anyon i my me many cas o way es simpe se this as at er fi i to day o tanse can o ask pertys the same time i as maneasof crisis the task as to makein the cisn but whether o bfor te charges in this case that ta e sesin to mak that te counsels te cis to mak that is his don they e siit not to move forward an exchaneous commentary tay don no what they'r talking about it thas no placenes report o ga op an tae that that is not even true of course it has the place in the report the report is not just about whether or not jobidon mis handle class fy documents he very clearly did the question is why you are not prosecuting him if he mis handle class fi documents and the answer is cause we are not in a prosecute a seen our old man when he says that it is not their place to analize that of qourse it is that is what prosecutorial discretion is this happens literally every day for prosecuters across the country they afe the decide whether they believe they will be able to succeed in a case in one of the factors in whether yougan able t succeed is the state of th defendent in the case jobidon again trying to walk right past the question it is not going to work and again we are foure menute's in i keep i keep time checking this because all he had to do was give o pressor in which he said things and did not answer questions for probably five minutes and within three he is screwing up basic matters of fact he is mis characteriseing the report and he is feeding incredibly b ably here we go matter is now close i canciny what i've always fokestin doe y presi na tao ma i can not take som pressns iy sopping he sfessal counsils say his reporr is te orm of reasons

conference he is already failed to come up with where his son's rosary came from and again that is at that is an own goall nobody even asked him about it he has suggested that his memory is not in fact fading in any way shape or form well simultaneously fading an energy he looks his being assaulted by the cuestions that he himself solicited it gat's worst folks were five minutes in it an last much longer but it is a bad period of time here he gop he i we e e wo oue i wolly my someony i a e i take responsibility o not having seem exactly what my staf is doin ios inre af thinks it appeard m

olifi cersois contobe casy nyaets a my staryohass son couple thing one when he says that your judgement not the judgement of the press first of all that is the judgement of the voters every poll taken for the last two years has suggested that the american people have deep and apparently well grounded concerns about jobidin's mental states and then when he says he is the person who is most qualified to be present into in the united states at's a rather audacious claim how mad you bill really believe eme democrats really believe that that there is no one else no one else in the united states wh's better qualified to be president of the united states than chobiden nobody believes that which is why this yute has a serious prob on his hands i do not share classified information i did not here you l pasit my gor elen that is a why that is a why he is long it is not true the report it self says he shared classified informtionwith his ghostwriter it says it straight up when he says that he did not shared classified information with hisghostwriter he is not telling the truth it is a life if he is lying enmyes for getting things in a press conference that is supposed to be how he is a totally with the truth teller continue not garante did no wut ther thether contes thate ai e did not sa that only be bo e o mister pete woev or ar the fact that the matter is what i did not want repeged i did not want him not i did not read it to him was i had written a long memorandum the president an abama why we should not be in this in afganstand and i was of tis amotible pages and what i was referring do i said classified it i should have said it was should be private because it was a contact between a president and vice presn tas to what was going on that is what heis referring it was not classified information in that document that was not abome bob when you lookd back at this incident is there anything you would do differently now and do you think that a special prosecutor should have ben appointed at te first plase in both of these cases first of all what i would have done is oversee the transfer of the material that was in my office in my offices i should have done that if i go back i didt not responsibility that there was my staff was post to that and a reference that in the report and my staff did not do it n a way that for example i did not know how half the boxas got on my garase until i found out staff gathered them up put them an gether and took hiem to the groge on my home and all the stuff that was in my home was in filing capinents that were either locked or able to me on it was in my house it was not out and in marlago and a public place where and none of it was high classified did not have any that red stuff on me on o me in round the corners none of that and i wish i had paid more attention to how f the documents were being moved and were i thought there bein move to the art coce i thought all was bean that is what i thought it was the last party question special consilis sho tha then appointed in this case had on the case of your riable present for i think especial council should have been appointed and the reason i think especial cancounsil should have been apointet is because i did not want to bein a position that they looked a trump and work on a look at me just they looked at the vice present and the fact is they made a firm conclusion i did not break the lall period thank you ar is is thank you very much and then hes starch to head off and this point he stavli bout this is this is bad is is not good bat maybe the bringings i reliefe and then he comes back he comes back for more ere we go ation he comes bac for moreanis stafeihet must be springing what he mur es pt what are you doing i know you as that the conduc overesfonse in goz in a gaesti as an ow over the co i think at to iyo now man he is not ely epresen e mexico ses i not one open af the gate tolo e man carryin to a caposipfer a second he comes back just to suggest apparently that israel's response in gaza has been over the top now the whitehouses out there clean upon ile mine trying to say that what he was saying is at commases respons in gaza to demands the release the hossage has been over the top whatever he means he clearly os saying something terrible morally there israel's response to twelve hundred of its citizens being murdered and two hundred forty taking captive and a hundred still being held captive is not in fact over the top an's gross him to say to earn votes in deerborn michingan but then he makes the biggest of all boobs he calls abelfata else se who is the president of egypt the president of mexico in a press conference design to show that he is mentally fit and able and his memory is working just fine in appress conference design to show that he is with it he says that the president of egypt is the president with mexico we of mex what in the act what in first of all this would it this might explain why we have nt open border hebes calling elsesian asking to shut the border and elsies his the borer is shot meaning the gasaborder and bazagua e tells me has shot i guess a en on over closeaway wa a what the as some one treated hilariously the nilesn't just a river in mexico lik my goodness my godness remember this is ten minutes into apess conference ten minutes this not been two hours does not been five hours is not the daftractober seventh this is ten minutes into a press conference it is not late at night it is not ten thirty at night it is not eleven or twelve at nght it is eight o eight p m and president of the united states is calling the president of egypt the president of mexico while babbling nonsensically about the s raily response in gaza i mean have you ever seen a political self immolation this he dowsd himself in political gasoline and then after a few attempts set the matchalight my goodness he is almost done here we go i tock i can asoagi tot the baby open the gate one as really i'm a pushy really har really a tgi man cancicencean the gat ne lot of innocent people ore startin i inocent peopleor a to a ti as castot not a on nomber to i was also in the position that i'm e ie make the case than we have to d o much more to increase the mountof material going including fuel the windemboys lindrnownce i've been on the fone with the cataries an han efon went the egyptians av a fonment to studies to get as much aid as we possibly can into gossip the innocent people in is some women and children we are also a bad and badly need of help and that is wete were pushin and i pushing very hard now to deal with as hosty cease fire because as a now of the working tirelessly in this teal how can i say this without refealing to lead to a sustain pause in the fighting in the actions taking place in in the godos trip and a because i think if we can get the delay for that aan initial delays i i think that that we would be able to a extend that t that we can increase the prospect that this fighting in gods a changes as also a negotiations you may recall and the very beganning right after right before hamoss attack i was in contact with the sodies and others to work out a deal where they would recognize his reals right to exist let them make them part of the mattlast ad recognize an fully an return for sertain things an to on istates should commit to do and the commitment to that we were proposed to do related to two are two two way tan tem i can going detail but one of them was to zeal with a haveling on sense of potection against their arch enemy to the north west a northeast te norse less than fites te second one by providing ammunition and material for them to defend themselves coincid dentwy that is the time frame with this broke ow i have no proof for hm about to say tut is not a reason suspect that a hamoss understood os about to take place and anted to break it up before it happened he and then he just con of staggers off and that is that does anyone believe that this person is mentally sit to be pres if you are a democrat i've a question for you you say the donel from is the scarious thing ever to come down the pike it sellont from becomes president of the united states that the united states bates lle over there will never be another election it is philips it is philip wroths di thet the plot against america that warrang chitler is going to be the guidan charge are you choosing to keep it in place this dodtering seenile old man it seriously it is february folks it is february the election is not untill no vember a if you i cannot it it is hard for me to even imagine the democrats keep mint the dop ofthe dicket and if they do if theys do are they likely to defeat donal trump the mediaave taken various angles on this bidon pressor angl number one is that everything is just fine rachell mato tried this one out last night an imas embysee she claind the is all hub ub about nothing after all jobidon can wride a bike an neat ice cram occasional y her we go the fact tot his age is not something you can rebut nit cannot be you cannot tact that if some one is you are too far left you can tack to the center you you there is not the man is eighty years ol he rite the bike aali he is he is andand its it it ti gery useful political attack for that ret get chris hayse tht least living the world of reality rachel mattabing loklike does he does ride a bike he does riht a bike good luck to you with that argument now let us be clear about this we live in such a crazy political time bat that see nile old man could very well win reelection thereason i say this is because i'm old enough remember a senate racon pennsylvania where a person who had a stroke and could not speak or heaker one a senate race simply because many people did not donald trump in pennsylvania is t quite possible the bidon ould win anyway sure is that a risk thet democrats argona an ta take that is a serious question is that theritten out the promem for them is tht the person who is backing up jobidin is comla harris the least popular politician in american history she is horrible and everyone knows it she is that she more likely to lose to donal trump then jobine looks to hide him in the basement maybe if they get away with it and then eventually hell pass on and then eventually comla harrise present n al the rest that is the hope but if they have comela harris at the top an take at their toast andthen have a lot o other options they have to find some way of getting rid of comela harris and puting in say gavan knew some or something from california in order to have in much more robust candidate for the presidency it is am loose talk about michellabama she is made pretty clear she is not interested in running at this poin shou would be a solution to all the democrats probs because she is a black woman which means that she could supplant comela harrison nobody would say boo inside he democratic party but she apparently does not want it but democrats have a real pickle on their hands a serious problem on their hands and donaltrum knows it which is why yesterday donald trump was out there slamming jobine's mental acuity as therectio to tever happen tha was a balance tagainst a ran and we blew out the balance and now a ran has esent ioly torac and theret s a li sang tat tat towan is i os ashame the world is in to en tis dan dao te possibtea world wore three and we have a man whis at toole the worst tes te i ti tis toe tan to gan te to tn tis togen teis not to bea e te goto wi who a she wo ti yon on we toa toct en tobea te tegotsion wit anybody only knows tat e tois drop on go ov the plac meeting is bonce except te gimalout of people now here is n't thin you see members the media hor trying to compare donal trum's mental acuity to jobidons ther not a questions about donald trump in terms of his for example impulse control but if you are trying to pretend that these two men our somehow in the same league in terms of closeness to sinility that is obviously untro it is obviously untren out trum for his part had a pretty awesome day yesterday first he watchd jobion completely blow himself up in the greatest political self own i have ever seen my lifetime and then the supreme court basically struct em is idiotic argument that he should not be allowed on the colorado ballat the supreme court had a hearing yesterday during that hearing virtually all of the justices were slapping around the boyers suggesting the donald trump could simply be kicked off the ballat in colorado for quat what insurrection tespite the fact that insurrection has no actual legal definition sufficient to support that on a federal level here is chief justice john roberts of course is really no ri winger talking to jason mury the colorado voters attorney who is defending coloradofs action o kicking trump off the ballet i would expect that it a goodly number of states will say whoever the dem mo cratic candidate is yeur off the ballat and others thfor the re publican canidate year off the ballant it 'll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decine the presidentual election tats pretty daunting consequence will certainly youre honor the fact that there are potential frivolous applications of a constitutional provition is not a reason wel nold on i mea you might think of frivolous thuon the people who are bringing o may not thingk to frivolous a insurrection is a brond brown term and to some te bate about an i suppose that wel go into the atesision and then a ventually what we wul be deciding at whether and tet was an insurrection when wen presiden tod something as suppose to wen somebody else to something else and wen we do to we wate until near the time of counting the balance anso to go through which states valad in which states are not is as john roberts taking to task jason mary the colrado voter's attorney and its very much every justice yesterday it was just as cavina it was just as goresit here is just as gorsage going after the anti tremployer wultimately there still has to be some kind of procedure in place to ejudicate the disqualification certainly congress could impech to stting president but that is the only remedy i'm aware of that exists for forremoval or otherwise negating the authority of a sitting president why wething well on what ther because the suct o tre speaks about disqualification from holding office you say he is disqualified from holding office from the moment it happents correct but neverthelessit operates you say there is no no legislation necessary i thought thot as tha whole theory of your case and no proceduness he happens automatically will certainly you need a procedure in order to have any remedy to enforce the disqualification which i under that is a wholesuce question that is to defact of thatent done work here o kept wit that aside he is justqualified from the moment sulf executing done and i would think that a person who would receive a direction from that person he president for a president in interview would be free to act as here she wishes without regard to that intividual i do not think because i think agan tha di who officer doctor would nevertheless come in to play to say this is kno defi to that wuld that th dosn't work mis te marik is dhefact a officers to that a fon e conduct thats don afterwards an an an insly from cudition of view put that aside mi cut a say to yen put it aside ha again gettin badted around trumskan be on th ballat that is just the way that it is again democrats have a choice thay can leave jobiden there and take their chances or that can tried to defentistrate him and throw the entire race into complete and utterat chaos twenty twenty four is indeed the at least he is not the othr gilach tht's effectively where we ale right now weif the democrat whare actively making the case that at least jobidon is in trum and we have trum backers wha're making the case two independents and emocrats while at least he is not jobiden whoh what an election this is going to be of can meanwhile tucker carlson did his long wayted interview with ladmer putten yesterday i thougt tuckerded fine man i thought that he asked some pointed questions particularly near the and about evengershcitch which were i think very usefultos were questions about the walstere gerneral reporter who is essentially been kidnapped by the russian authorities in is being held in jail for no actual reason for as a bargaining chip i thought there ware certain areas where maybe tucker coud a push back har but the reality is that puten just used the platform as a way of fillibustering i only tucker did anything wrong in doing the interview in fact i think again tucker asked him interesting questions that is fully coincident with a belief that vladmer puten is an anti american dictator who has very evil intentions and proceeded to use the interview as a fillibuster technic and i mean even tulkor basically said to a fron tucker said in intin introducing the interview at the virsthority five minutes of the interview is just vladmer pouten essentially beginning with the creation of the earth explaining his version of the history of you rain in tucker is explain why you invaded ou crain and vladmer poten is it began with the forging of the great rains i get that that is really that is realy what happened he goes thorty five minutes just explaining what he sees as the history of you crane which he says with never really a sovereign country and was really created by vladmer lenin which is not really the case and all this is provisionist history but you would have to be sort of expert on eastern european politics and the history of you crane the pullish with te wanian common wealth the history of of russia eastern europe in order to fact chack him in real time on this sort of stuff and that is not some the ithing tuckers paticularly interested and here was ladmer pouten taking advantage of the situation to talk about how lenin created ou crain what matters this that landin tha founder f the soviet tay istablish you crane that way iv sothin is por the cates thet ucranian soviet republic developed as parch of the ou a i sa in i at te peecan she minyand for unknown reasons again the bulshofexper engaged in you cranianization it was not merely because the soviet leadertiop was compose great exthand o those originating crocal tingrather it was explained by the general policy of indigenization pur sothed by the soviet union sene things were done in other soviet republics this involved promoting national languages in national cultures which is nod about in princip and went on tas ti sering passin of you by the way and tucker is sitting there can i get an answer to a question wi o but a couple things jump out one is that when y nactually listen to the full interview you will see that vinerpouden has a very self serving view of you cranian histery the basically alows him to argue tha you crane should be fully injested by russa he claims tat of course he has clean hands and all this he is never had in a farious thought he is never had anafarious opinion he infactis not anti american n just that the americans have been unkind to him over the course of russian history after the fall f the soviet union you will also noticed that justin terms of affect vlanmerpooten for all the tot there is a lot of tolk how vladmer pouten dying how laderhooden sect he certainly does not look he is dying or second this sinterviep vanmerpouden is very much alive he is very much with it am just in terms of personal affect if your worried about the future of the united states and you see as i to russiat as in a farious force in the world in terms of foreign policy which they have been and continued to be then the prospect of a president who is not with it sitting across the table from vladmerpouten should not make any one sanguine at this point again he went on this for a very very very long time and again his history basically suggested the reason that he a tacked you crane is because there is a promise that was made for example that the west would not expand nato eastward in the after math of the fall of the soviet union that promise was apparently never made according t mc chio gorbichov who is the had of of the sovie union at the time the promise was supposedly made he claims that the us broke its promises there and then tulker asked what is an interesting question he says wyeactly did the end of the cold worn not fix the relationship in of course puten than blames the united states why did the end of the cold were not fix the relationship what motive ates this from your point of view witscause inesto you said i was bitter about the answer no it is not bitteres it is just the statement the fact we are not brathen groom bitternes resentientit isn't about those kind of matters since such circumstances whic just realized we were in welcome there that is all oqe fine but t let us build relations in another manner let us looki por common ground elsewhere why we receive such a negative response eshould ask your leaer i can only gess why its o be a country i theson opinion an soons and be i i sis ie seeing how ises er being resolin n again his idea here is that t was the united states tha really led to the conflict between the us and russia post soviat il get that is not accurate the reality is that russia took a very hard anti u s anti western stands in for example the war in yuduslava they were back in the surbs the serbs were committing what amounts to technically a form of genicide there are all sorts of reasons why the u s and russia did not end up walking and loch stap as john conner suggest thed he thought that they would in terminator to for example there are lot of reasons for that it is not merely that russia is a wonderful player on the world stage again russia has spent the the time since the fall of the sovia union embrasing oligarcstation destroying it is on democratic flowers shutting down the press telling political opponents invading sovereign countries they madea georsia in made u crane twice their threatening other states that are in their near area and this none ofthe secre to atucker by the way all the secreticaputn and it that is ot of reginis historie putent for example he says that he did not actually start the war in twenty fourteine in u crane in crimia and the donbas that of course done true he somewha the called little green men which were russian soldiers wearing the uniforms of supratists into these areas to effectively create break away a renas in these particular areas but what is weird is that russia did not actually want to simply annax the parts the wornk crimiaso russia annexd crimia after twenty fourtein russia did not annex the parts of the donbassat controlled why the reason is because the russian government was trying to use those areas of u crane as a bas of operations from which to democratically take over the government of ucrane tand this led to all sorts of bizar sort of ramifications in which the central government of ucrane did not want to allow regional elections in the donbas out of fear tht those would then become effectively sort of enemies within peoplewho wanted to hand to over the entiratyove ucrane to the russians it led to all sorts of serious conflict to led tothe violation of the minsk agreements which were agreement signed after twenty fourteen th or pretty un clear in exactly how they were to be interpreted both russia and u crane violated the minsk agreements by the way the bottom line here is that only one country invaded the sovereign territory of another country russia invaded the sovereign territory of ucrane they tried to march on keeve and take the entire country here as lanrputent claiming that actually it was ucrane that started the word to spitethe fact that realisticlly speaking vlodimers lensky was a dov and before the war lodimers lensk actively informed his entire upper military ashelon that he did not want them openly preparing for war because he was afrad that would scuttle any peace negotiations that he had with puten he came to office pledging that he was going to make peace with lanrpten in fact that a lot of people on the grannurane are very angry at zlensky for having improperly prepared ucrane for the invasion by russia literally days before the invasion huewas basically happy tau cking the entire possibility of an invasion of ou rane is olensky in any case here is puten claiming that everythng is everybody else's fault of course yit was the who start tet the warring two thousand fort seen ourgo is to stop this wenyo and we did not start thi sworing weny sweni this is an atsent to stop it im then whyhe has not the war stopped that would be the big question that is the question that coukar asked he says whyn't jus stop the war and puhten then lays out a rationow for the complete dissolution of the governmentof u rane he claims that the government of ucrane requires densfication listen to the twisted logic here now again you craie does have certain parties in is military namely the azo batellian that have been highly linked to neonaziism in the past forshore that is true the idea that the govrnment of eucrane is effectively a giant nty party is a bizar argument from vladmer puten here we got do you think you have stoped it now en if you achieved your ames no we have not the chiterans yet because one of them is the nacification these were people who exterminate the bulls jews and russians if the d ga testasa biographyudu het was it is necessary to stop this practice and prevent the disemination of this consit nnotthini say that the cranin sare part of the one rushian people ethey say no we are a separate epoin e o ke e fineloishthi if they consider themselves te separate people they have the right to do bet noton the basis of nosisnthen not siateolege tht gis what he is doing there the case that heis making is that many people who ar considered serve the heroes of ou crane hecause they resisted for example the soviet take over of u crane in the after math of world where two or as worldward wo his ending that many of the people who were resistant to the sovia take over were people who were in fact pronazi if this is the difficulty of european history that also happens to be true in a lot of eastern uropean countries that many of the people who who were rebelling against comming ist rule in the postwar period wore people who had formerly allied with the naties that there is no doubt about that the idea that all of oucrane is taken over by nozism because of that is totally crazy that is a wild contention by vladmar puten by the way when puhten argues that he is attempting denatfication in u crane which of course is an absurdity and than he tells his misbegotten history of worldwar to one of the e hacte said this interviews he blame poland for the outbreak of hodwor too which is pretty while for god whose claiming that he wants o denos ify the claim that the nozies were not responsible for worldward who is a hell of a claim hears what he had to say in tan't teen thirty nine after blan cooperate ed with thicklerculisg e i pushis oi did coloborate with heono hitler offered poland ta pes and tha treathy of friendship h es elego and a lions bemandtin in return that poland give back to germany the called the vanci carridortho iconnected the bulk of germany with es brussha and kinningspiras noises get i my esgin ge he slusstosiyposo eworand this teritory was transfert to poland and instead of tanci a city of dunsk emerged istthente tushitler asked them to give it anicably bit they reused thof course that still they collaborated with hitler and engaged tigether if get e isthat any in the pertitioning of checka slavakion and now let me explain what he is attempting to say here ando makes us sense you manin this claim for a lot of years the reason he is making this claim is because he is a defender of the soviet union can the actual history when it comes to the break out of world wor to is the malatov ribbon trot pact which insured that russia would not attack hitler from the east divied up poland it carved it directly in half and t give a large trunk of it to the naties and a large trunk of it to the soviets in the after mouth of the nazi's sweeping through poland they dive it up a bunch of territory the soviets and the nazies they of course were the real allies ief you are russian you have an interesting claiming that the malatov ribbon trot pact was not in fact and attempt to grab land wile allying with hitler whose actuall an attempt to forestall a hitlarian invasion of the soviet union in invasion that of course did in fact happen in nineteen forty one that is a revisionist history the claim that that puten makes right there is that poland was somehow allied with germany because during the to datan land agreemen during the munic agreements of nineteen thirty eight when checkslavaki was basidly divvied up because hitler took it and then the western powers basicly to shrug that is that is the famous peace in our time nevil chamberland stuff when that happend checkaslavaka got divied up by a number of parties including some to hungary some to germany and poland at the very last minute theyg it grabbed a tine sliver of checkaslavakya that had in the aftermauthol world were one belonged to them the borsin eastern europe were constantly changing all the time ay because of that he claim they were allies of hitler which of course his weird because then hitler demanded that e port city essentually be turned over to the to the germand and poland refused and that was the outbreak of world wor to and we pudden plays that is that poland was actually pushing germany to hard and forced hitler to invade poland which is insane and that that is why world war to began now the reason he saing that also is because that sort of is what he as saying bhat you crane when he is basily saying is that because you crane is in is defending it is own borders and because russia has been encroaching on those borders since twenty fourteen in crimea and in the donbas and because you crane does not want to grants anough power to those areas that is what justifies you the erussian invasion of you crane he simultaneously saying that we will saing that he is trying to de nots toifi gand none of this makes any sort of sense but putn's a clever operator he again none of the stontucker is an putent putenis puns a clever operator obviously's a very smark eye he is com pletely vicious he has no commitment to the truthe die cage you be operative i mean can we stop pretending that ladmer puten is some sort of great ssaviour in scion of the west he obviously is not he is a russian nashe is an arch russian nationalist who wishes to expand the borders of what he preceives to be his new empire he wishes to grab some strategic territory crimy is very strateic thereis this dombass that he is colneltly occupying are very strategic and of course yo would love to break a partnato because that would allow him the possibility of further territorial expansion which his wife you talk to any one from any of the baltic states they do not believe him and those are people who do have a border with ladmer puten we talk about how now americans we shuldn't really care al that much abouts going on e eastern our yabut eastern europens should i mean eastern europeans have every right to be afraid of ladmer puten f yescalithuanian or if you ask in a stonian or if he ask somebody from poland are they woried about russia on their boarders the answers if you have any knowledge of history about thisree fron ons or of course the word about sh their borders rush as a long history of invading these blazes obviously tucker ask him about this in clipten tucker says people are arguing that you invaded you cran ing you have further territorial aims in putent just flatanize it which again i do not believe the cage you be operative sorry for the argument i know this is that wellhe invaded you crane he has territorial ams a cross the continent and your sang unequivocally you do not siunit aslytio it is absolutely out of the questionhou jus done have to be any kind of analist it goes tha gainst comlan sense to get involve in some kind of a globaward loiin teagr and ta global word will bring ol coman at thy to the brink of destruction he sayin his after invading you cran ing threatening the use of newcleor weapons i do not believe you sir ey and tom and then puten makes what is the case that he is been waiting to makting entire interview read he makes the case that americans should basily not care about any of this do not you gots have your own probise tofiing jest you crane what proem is it of yours and again clever tastic byputen because the reality is that yes you crane is very far away now they are serious jeo political ramifications to puten simply being able to take over all of you crane first whle they are serious economic ramifications not only becuse of complete russian control of the blacksee and shipping routs an all the rest of it but also because you crane is the number three grane produceer in all the world also because that would then put ladimer putent directly on the borders of hungary on the borders of poland it would also grant him the presumed ability to run directly through lithuania twart colinin gratis we discuss yesterday meun if you thing the puten's ambitions somehow anterm just wondering why did he invade georgia a the tds not the first time he is invaded you grain non ts first country is in mated a you granting him the benefit of the doubt that he is just a mild man or person who is seeking to protect russian interest without crossing sovereign boreis ignores his entire rechime i here here he was a though trying to make the sort of quasy isolationist caste for a for america ignoring wat's going on do the united states need this what for tat editytoty wastnesom thousands of miles away from your national territory gat i meets e po buyus do not you have anything better to do you have issues on the border issues with migration issues with the national dent more than thirty three thrillion dollars le heu have nothing better to do you should fight in your grain but you might sid waocois would not it be better to negotiate with russia imake an agreement who can pose ri ter s here is the question what agreement is puten proposing here what what ageements he proposing to during the interview heu reference the idea that there is an agreement that was put on the table in april of twenty twenty two in istanbol and that agreemen wis still being fought over there wrestill questions about whether agreement would be reached and he'r getting somewhat close to anagrement by petty much all afvailable reports including one from the wall street jurnal just this week there is only one problem in the middle of those negotiations has the russians pulled away from keth because theyr actually having someprety significant military problems near keeve as they pulled away they pulled away from a town cle boucka that town was the sight of a mask for of four hundred fifty people includig men women and children and when the west saw that the west said ok i do not think we can quite negotiate the way that we were before becaus you goies are cmmitting full on war trocities that is what scuttled the negotiations er the atrocites in boucka now if that table if that deal wer put back on the table would blodamer puten accept that deo today he is made that completely unclear the biggest question from the tuck or interview is what does puten want what will he axcept iun return for an end to the war and in no point does he really explain that that is the biggest problem sir tucker does ask him that near the end of theinterview he says would you be willing to say tonato you win were done here and here is puten's answer would you bee willing to say congratulations nato you one and just keep the situation where it is now nas not ye the pigmitmio wi it is a subject matter for the negotiations no one is willing to conduct or to put in more accurately thisis i tet they are willing but do not know how to do it dooki know they once in lafe it is not just i see but i know they do want it but they are struggling to under stand how to do it they have triven the situation to the point where we are at it is not us who have done that it is our pardners opponents who have done that well no let then thing ho to reverse the situation oke there is only one problent that that is not to answer to the question ' the only question thet tucker yes set out to get an answer to putten woodn't answer ar the only question that matters how do we get to an end to this thing puttn would not answer instead he used the interview as an opportunity to talk abouto the west is terrible to ham in the west is supermeane to him and talk about the glories of the russian empire at some point he actually suggested that russia has always been very loyal to people who professother religions which comes as a bit of a shock to all the jews were forced into the pale of settlements over the course of russian history and it but in any case puten is a is a skilled dissembler he is a skilled liar it is what he does he is in fact he dictator who does not have america's best interest at heart again two things ho me tor at one one tucker did a fine incredible job in this interview there is nothing wanl tucker interviewn puten too you should not believe a word that comes out o puten's mouth because in fact he is an anti american dictator who kills his political opponents and really seeks to set russia up as a counterbalance to the united states in world politics ardy folks the rest of the show continues right now we will be getting into whether the senate haf the united states will in fact approve some form of aid to crane and to israel it or not a member become member used coach pero check out for two months free on all anuel plans qlick that lincoln

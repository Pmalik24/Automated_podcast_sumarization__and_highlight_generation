a few other things by al he lives with his cute older girl friend an his exceptionally patient parents and a small partment in the midwad section of brooklad instead of going to high school he is enrolled in an internette homeschoolin proogram he is at work on a science fiction novel and his llec several hundred inflide hours as a student pilad but most of alec is time is spent as ha guetaris

brooklan second they all very earnestly on alof and third alec jarofv whether he is riving on his back on stage or reclining in the dressing room with a beer an a cigarette is kind of a supersta ibefore we get to our story the other kee person on the to meet a sommone who entered alec's life at a crucial moment years ago when alex first came to the states alex had an awkward adjustment he fought in school on whis kind of depressed he was bored then one day alec was walking along the brighton beech board walk and saw a group of olderguyz collecting money for something called the russian punk rockclub of america older guys twenty five and thirty years old alec was twelve one of the musicians he met that day was roman gogel off who immediately took to the young alec well he had disa blink in his eyes it is sometimes you see exstro inner person and a you kind of knowleegse he was not a peertlize is felt year old a detmoment at twelve years old he was right in sons that i was

alec began walking around in an old bulshevic style hat and trench coat and his friends gave him books dostaevsky tolkin guides to slovic paganism the beats and also robinson cerusoe an treasure island alec was particularly fond of those win our story to day our own seafaring tal happens on a boat that roman ons the twenty five foot white sailboat which alecs liks to refer to as the yacht one cool eving last may alex roman and another friend named alec alec slewbachonsky decided to take a nice little boat trip in to make a bay the body of water that wrapps around the southern end of brookland he was alec the three of us decided to just get tan gallans of gass and my friend roman he ga t a bottle of rum and we got two kans o food and we just decided to have a cool trip on on the yacht and the i started saying oh our go as the open ocean we let us sail to polland i told thim roman had a slightly less ambitious agend blend was just to goa to the breegch under the reck away bridge thent turn around and then come back it should have taken about the flootting in it yet thing started to go wrong almost immediately for they even left the marina roman who would been making headway through the bottle of rum fel in to the water and they had to haul hin back in he was clearly an no shape to drive this is alex can he got drunk and he just was babbling something laughing he said do not go there do not go there and he wass constantly saing do not hit the shallows he was a yous already tu nothing he did not console the situation by that time as a responsible journalist i should say for the record that roman does have one objection to alex's version of events it was not therom by t it was at conyak i do not know wy everybody put trum it was at konyak you sure i was at let reck yes i was at reck gonyk i do not know how come its become rom it is bor alec tolld was rom but it was gonyak not a little bit it was a looknit was out of gon i was out of conition alex and alex had had a few drinks themselves but we were perfectly sober and everything we might have had a few drinks but we were perfectly sober lyirin was hav drove buk no no but we got a head hauled of it was not that hard we we knew how to drive it i then seem pretty hard turn on the moter et turnd the boat at turns cool somehow they managed to get out of the marina gun the engine and take off across the water toward the marine part bridge in the distance once there they decided to try to sail the brighton beach and headed toward a landmass but they got confused and turned back to open water they drank some rum or maybe conyak one way or another they drank a lot of it at one point they almost crashed into a small island guass was running low but they figured that if worse came to worst they could always put up the sails and still make it home then they got caught in a strong current that turned the boat in circles the perfect time you would think to begin to panic or if you are the kind of person who forgets trouble the momenture out of it or even while you are in et the perfect time to shoot off all the boat's flires into the water just for fun finally the series of mistakes reached the critical mass they had no selphone romans had died when hey fell on the water no fliers no captain and almost no gass even alex had to admit they were in trouble we did not know where we were and then we realized we were not gonon make it anywhere and were er in the morning well figure out what to do we e went to sleep it was a glorious spring morning on to make a bay sun glinting off the water gulls calling overhead as our young pleasure cruisers slumbered the light filtering into the boats cabin woke roman and alex glewbachanzky first and they came up on deck what they saw was not good after drifting through the night the boat had come to rest in the shallows of a small bay alongside an uninhabited landmass stretching out behind them they could see a long furrow where the tide had dragged them deep into thick mud and as they stood there blinking and wondering how this might have happene the wind carried them another ten feet inled they could see the skylant o man hatan on the horizon the runways of jaf kar poured a little closer and signs of civilization in every direction they could even see boats passing by in the distance but these were too far away to take any notice he was obvious that they were in a word shu pthe hung over sailors sat down to decide what to do roman and glubechonsky were in favor of waiting to be rescued or for the tide to rise and pull hem out again meanwhile alex was formulating his own plan beyond the island tey were closest to lay another land mass which alec was sore led somewhere his idea was to swim to it walked to civilization catcha buss somewhere and bring back helped for his friends who as alex remembers it thought the plan was frankly idiotic these are islands said roman who in truth had actually been out on the bay before him was in a position to know but alec was sure that roman was rowl alec stripped to his underware he put what he thought he might need ind a water proof clastic may an at his jar he brought his metrocard for the bussus wot a swim to an expired passport for i de and his favourite brutus madali for luck he wrapped his clothes in a celepane blanket and bid his friends fairwell roman watched him disa peard to the sir w worst it trike to stop him i triet thoyiu can reasonable thing but he get little bit to much excited i decide to give him a challenge in leg what what should i just knock him down and say stop it yiu nhe wanted to sil im you knok ye wanted to swhim and if he swa he swem i swam really really violently to get myself wormed up and by the middle i got really tired and it was really callin on him aw it is it is much worse than i thought and and there is birds flying beaking on me im other crazy strange farackway birdz are an a bit nears or something inner and i and i got really lucky because my legs suddenly hid the hid the bottom in im and i got was happy when i came out there i was cold but i was at oh ye and i was definitely sure that i was civilization because told buildings were right behind the trees they were and the bridge was right over there and i'm all finally and and and i was even singing a song walking and the birds were screaming something to me and i'm yen i made it i've still not sure i understand why you left your friends because i thought we were goiting to be stug there for a really long time maye be for the whole day the only thing i could do is just try to get to civilization and especially these islans they were they were pressuring me to go there ther were close and i'm and i got realy board i way comp in the morning i do notw'at a stay in one spot on the ochten and then think about how we going to get saved i really want to do something and i'm ook cam can i have thes this little adventure im going go out and try to make it somewhere and i did except he did not soon he realized that he was indeed on another island with no way off except to swim back through the freezing water to rejoin his friends andhe was not about to do that he was alone alec set about doing all the things a good castaway should do he wrote a giand help in the sand for the benefit of the plains landing at cf kay he circum navigated the island looking for supplies he found a stick an a piece of red cloth and made a flag to signal passing ships then he found several big pieces of styrefom and some wood and spent an hour or two fashioning a raft but it collased when he sat down on it underturred he went back to searching for something that would be his tick it off the island and then he found it e was the hollowed out carcass of a cetsky were as he calls it a scooter i knew i hundred prercent yeu that i was on a float although ws pretty badly dug in to the sand and as i was digging out the schooter something really bad happend there was a pieces of glass under it and did not see i was just digging and digging and i did not have any any shovel or anything and i caut my finger really bad astator getting huge mounts of blood was coming out and a i'd this white tea sherder was eventually oll in blood now there was really the way off the island even by swimming because willyou know sharks it was a galling situation and it was made even more mad cause the city was right there i was thinking hown the hell that i get myself into the situation i i never believe that something this could happen in in new york city an is such a huge city that you could see sky o sky scrapers ten miles away and on the other side you can die looking at them iand also i got a little mad at the city of new york i couldnt i could understand if they had just one pay from there or at least i do not know a button to press toto know that you are there by probably in six ofclock in the evening it was getting a little dark all my excitement has flad away and am ik a i got very cold i was shaking and o shivering and no help at all om wal this is going to get really bad were you hungry at thi pored also i was very hungry and i was very thirsty and i found limes i try to opene them up but they tasted nast i could not i got in't even think about eng there was no source of food other than the ducs i yes the ducks you want i hear about the duck s i was not going going rescued in the next hour or two i had a plan to kill a bunch of ducks to get some warm blood to warm myself you knowso to drink some blood and to cut them open and used them to warm myself i had this strange idea about a use them a slippers i even had after that i even had this a delic idea of a floating on the ducks making a rat a raft out of the ducks imagin a a man with ta with string is attached to the ducks a a floating on the water as this duck riter n totally normal for a a for a russian hiker to go and pick up a duck and not just to kill it but to eat it i cannot ato but you could just over and pick up a duck it how did you catch th duck oh im er you just go after it with a stick i mean your human being youet more brains than a duck you can catch but i was not really thinking about doing it i was not fantasizing about killing ducks or anything that i was just thinking that if it comes to that iw'll have to 'll have to get some blood to drink i know it sounds very violent but i was fighting for my life people might laugh when they her about being trapped on an island that is close to civilization and the sharks and the ducks i knew it was funny situation but i really i got the feeling of what what is at being on desert island i felt a robinson cruso you knw i i knew what it was to be by yourself away from civilization with no help and your facing this huge problem and the only person that is near you is you and the the ghost of your death close by you nwso i can smell the did smell my e smell my death in the air it turned out that the island were alics was trandit is called ruffle bar it lies only wenty minute boat right away from the coast of broodlan far from being tromatized ore ashamed of his exploits alex wanted nothing more than to go back out there and from the vantage of my overprized undersized department i wanted to see a place where you could be totally alone in the wilderness smalling your own death in the air while in at least theoretical communing distance to midtown and hat we hired a boat to take us to ruffle bar in truth i was not as completely surprised that sun might be to learn that such a place exists i grew up near the islands of jamaica bay in a neighbourhood call canarsy and when i was little my friends and i would cut through the empty locks near my house to explore the mixs of trash and nature on the shore line it was a place totally apart from the rest of my mostly urban childhood a secret place that my friends who lived even ten or fifteen blocks away ore unaware existed but then the smaller islands around new york have always occupied a weird place on the edge of the city ome to all sorts of enterprised that the citizenry either does not know about or prefers not to city sanitariums and prisons potter's fields and grand failed schemes rufflebar itself hade been the side of several of the ladder since the civil war dat howse the ferry stop resort hotel and even a short lived oon community of some forty buildi n we stopped in front of a concrete foundation building ofs onr gind was al that tha this is a cooting this is one of the world wyho are too tingti here i can alpan the mopan you can go insizes a romin mind me something a bockoor something you see the rope you the rope as miling old an tick a picture there are no buildings left yere the island his returned to a deeply wild state ere's a wall of dense brush and a few trees around which sinister gulls or siround we pass a flock of docks who take onlucket alex on the wiselian wa av im really thinking about where hack o ti ootofit seemed it should be lik as we turnd and thit should be more shur yere a ay may be th ye that is exactly it i wo that this is the scoter i trytody a lime show you make ye may be ill see the lasteas it was not he dis not as we search for alics 's budthist medalliand that he would left in the excitement of the helicop to rescue we walk across a plain of thick dry grass matted down a carfidt underneath you can hear shells crunching and mysterious things scurrying around still reminders that we are in fact in a major metropolis are always close at hands for one thing thre's the garege miles of plastic and driftwood but also shoes steering wheels prescription bottles deflated balloons a washer dryer several wrefrigerators and oddly boats three perfectly intact ones complete with oars i hesitate to point these out to alec though to be fair theire probably too heavy forhim to abdract to the water and then there is this reminder of civii do he doctor boa was othing avbe time het was always close enouth to the city but simply having a selphone would have had him tuck safely into bed with an half an houl alex was finally rescued after seven hours thanks to roman and glubichonsky back on tha boat they were having a fine old time a police halcopter was performing drills near by and apparently no slotches in the cleciade castaway department themselves they had figured out that they could signal it with the mirror but why rush we really engulted the time staying there well as just you no sitting in the bullet and tha smoking te lust toblacka that they had let and the we make i deal that bee not going to eat each other i really going to get basical o us heaving fun weknow just little bi nall nol hoscil no noten and ar very qwuiete nice leather oh you did not you you were actually holding off signalling the hallcoters wall you had a nice daye of course was it mic day still as it began to get dark in the cigarettes ran out he friends thought it was probably time to get a move on a helicoptor soon arrived and air lifted them off the boat it was not until they were safely ashore wrapped in blankets in being fed complimentary cookies the either of them happen to mension that they would been a third passenger when the helicoptor came back for alex cold exhaustion and dehidration had left him in a trance almost wild state and for him this island will always be a place where maybe they be monsterand i was auly whene else yar onderin told of be wild place ar there any animalse yr an that er i was may be hoping to see some o an ilik iageloran mi batcers li is the hr yes one of my favorite atyew i tages fr the same reason probably i the state of you tot where i never was ther something that has some kind of i was sutcotlike te secret or is hiding ort the they tract me in the way that they they might be hihting something e from me and that is what after many hours spent with alex i find myself liking about him to mos is insistence on finding mistery an adventure everywhere he looks it is easy to laugh at that to write it all off is adolese and stupidity what if it is more than tha on if it is also a kind of adolesce ant magic actually i'm thinking that this needed to happen i i san't inthing if i was not boring person and i would just ike stay at home all the time and be a nurt i would never get into the situation icink this happened a strictly because i was with the right people at the right time in the right situation you knw think about tht every step of the way by almost any measure alex could not have been more wrall it takes a special kind of grace to turn that into right time right place and how can you help wut envy tha who would not rather live in a world where if you believe you should have an adventure you do in which each of your mistakes does a narrow your life but expands it in which the worst thing that could possibly happen is being bord and you can go to sleep on stormy seas and trust that when you wake up if you are very lucky you will be in uto on 'm tryng to say is this alex does something i never in a million years would have thought possible he makes me think it might be cool to be a teanature there is a story that back in the eighteen thirties a ship carrying fifty four thousand dollars in mexican gold was hihjack qui pirates outside to make a bay and that the treasure was buried somewhere near ruffle bar on our way back from the island i tell alex this and he listens with great interest if you found the treasure he wants to know could he keep it maybe i say if yeu did not tell anybody to which alex answers precisely as i know he wellthe only way he possibly can he says but what if i told everybody brae mine wis he out tor a difficult man behind the scenes of a creative revolution coming out looking aboutch caga that noothe outsite cgo o believes about chicago but the actually is totally and completely true that is in a minute ito got ge beblegadio went out programme continues dismackin from yr glass each we can a pregmef quess you chose a theme bringon a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day shel in the shadow of the city strange about things happening out of sight fror most of us but bary close to us we have rived at at two of our programme act too troubled bridge over water son't you dosn't three on the edge of a city half way round the world in nanging china a man named chensa mister ch an had it out to a bridge away from his wife and daughter he was ever ten hours a day the ridge chose is this concrete communis monthstrocity four miles long cover was slow gans that celebrate the worker four lan to traffic thousands of pedestrians on the top dek two trained tracts on the lower deck over the anxe river into nanging a city of seven million as to mister fuzzy but the best guess is that one person per week commit suicide off this bridge crickheads up by the way that this story undte discussed suiside mister chen decided he wnt to tried to keep them from jumping and he started to single handily at first hen with an occasional volunteer the blog that he keeps about this is the most sober taciturn non boastful account of saving lives imaginable cas you an mister chamell in sert his feelings be ware heavy thoughts he declires tor himself in one entry how i wish that he will soon be free of this shadow he says about an old man tat he saved in another promostly is just the facts he was a translation from the chinese i dih twenty fifth at ten thirty in the morning i dis covered a woman lying on the bridge railing on o belly weeping i went to her she wiped her eyes she said she was just playing and walked toward the centere of the bridge i went with her and she very ordinarily dout herself found when i returned at one ten i dis covered that she had already climbed up on the bridge railing i restrained her i forced her on to her mobed she is from nanjing's gianie district he last name is jaw an to day she is forty five years old because her husband surname lee and fifty one years old is violent towards her and mis treats her she tought killing herself would be better however she has silent and she thinks of her fifteen year old son march twenty first two thousand ten yesterday a three of five pm i saved a young man in the middle of the bridge he a drunk out of alcohol was flinding to jump over the bridge railiy i at once restrained him and dragged him to safety is we spoke i leaned to situation was actually quite funny hes thingig about jumping because last year his wife promised to start returning to him two hundred you on of his monthly fourteen hundred youron salary to spend as he pleased but she had not honored her promise hesterda afternoon he streated drinking with his friends an the more he drank be angrary got he believe the killing himself would make a realize that not one cent had come to him he then said another funny thing his mother's colleague said that the bridge is haunted and could take one soul is at haha it his haunted by drunk ghosts and i took him home this was the calmest simplest rescue of mad in recent years many of mister chensentries ore about the people that he does not save feber fifteenth five thirty in the morning a middle age man jumpe to his death is reported at this time and he was holding a photograph of his family augus ten two thousand aht saturdy afternoon at one forty p m a young woman three hundred meters from the south end to te bridge climbed under the bridge raily i immediately started my mo ped it because i excelaryted to quickly the mopad week oil in nighte had to run to her but when i was two hundred meters away she jumped into the anxy ir soatt was visible in the water an a spot fifty meters away and i could still hear her yelling for help into a large wave obscurit er from view at the end of heach year mister chendisn inventory of how things are going on the bridge this one this from the end f two thousand ning he wrote that ofm since he began back in two thousand three he would saved at that point one hundred seventy four people from comittien suicide counselled another five thousand one hundred fifty on the bridge and sixteen thousand on the thon fifty one thousand people at textat him totral days volunteering to that point six hundred forty six my paternity wrote a magazine article about mister chan he first heard about him years ago from newsrepords i read a bit of his bloging gugle trans li i fell ik he had to meet this man who on his own decided to rescue many people an we to china i thought maybe maybe e'll see him in action maybe i'l get to see him save somebody just as back story i mean actually came i had come from mam cambodia i was i was covering these genicide trials is i i was not leada i din't have the most optimistic feelings about humanity im and i thought i was going to find something there you tha you are thins on a hopeful figure ye i mean oh perseverance generosity i but as soon as i got on the bridge i realize that all those notions were completely absurd i mean i got instantly depressed first of all thers this four mile long bridge and this one man out there sor of trying to pick out who was ging a jump i'm just seemed from a distance insurmountable odds tactually maybe pulld somebody off the bridge yet you read on the article whene when you say fors ot ther's the cars and there is the trains and the bridge is shaking and thn there is just a see if people thousands of people in the rain with unbrella s a going back and forth in the bridge and he is just one one guide kind of walking up and down and he haps his little mob had and does a little cruise on the bridge every every once in a while but i'm even that is somewhat a somewhat comical sight to behold he is on this little broken down moped put putting through the crowd with his bridg parbinoculars around his neck i sert of thought maybe this is an evend real maybe this blog is complete figment of his imagination i or a fiction that he constructs you now one week and i just do not see how this guy can save anybody out here and and you read in your article he wont he will not really ttalk to you when when youre when you there in the bridge ye he is really grumpy and u'n willing to acknowledge me and then soand giv me a typical exchange between the two of you on the bridge im i think i did ask what why why you standing here i supposed to any other spot on this four mile long bridge and a he turned and lifted his binoculars and focus i'm out toward the river and then brought his binoculars down turned the other way put his binoculars up and focusd i'm in the other direction on the crowd but that is it his not he respondd no it wasn' i was i was not even there is i was son gos ta i sort of went through some of this and then i said maybe there a better time for us to talk and hea said to the translator i cantalk to you at lunch say good to lunch with them and and whend what happens there well we were in a little i but they call family restaurant near the bridge and if there are no families present i mean it is just workers and there pretty hard drinkin in this case i grain alcohol and beer and we sit down at the table and mister chen has invited i'm a man to join us whose name is mister she i and then we are served some food and mister chen and mister shek stert realy drinking a lot of grain alcohol and i started to i'm sert of drink with them because it was the convivial thing to do and then i just realized i i i mean to pass out if i an scay with these guides i im literally i was my head was fie at i was thet of the hull rom was revolving i dis not and he was you would ha very disappointed and and he sort of said you had just were drink in here this will we do at lunch and drinking loosens the tongue and get with the program and if if ye cannot then wyn not we you do not want you put on a tat then he it lunch he definitely opened up a little bit more ime he he was not looking at me im when he answered questions but he was answering them and he was speaking more expansively about life on the bridge did he explain why it is that he does this im he said he had read a newspaper article about the bridge and about people jumping off the bridge and and he himself had grown up in the country outside an enging he really related in particular to these people from the villages who came to the bridge tand their lives and whose lives were hard and full of dispair and he completely understood that see go bick up to the bridge and and and he he puttysoff and his mopad and thnd and then yen then he jumped on his moped to go on his rounds and em i did not have anything to do but i turned to the translator susan and i said haylit is take a little walk out on the bridge and we strted walking out over the bridge and were chatting a little bit and this guy cannot came lurching by and he idid not pay any attention to him but this guise about twenty fe thirty feet ahead of us and he seems to be climbing up on the railing and at that pweny i just yelled hey and then i said to susan he is going to go over and i started running for him and susan came running and i had that one little flash of mister chan saying some of these some of these people will really take you with them if they can either that desperate and i had that little flash thi ould be stupid waiy te i be ridiculous if i yen go down wit thisgy but it did not come to that because when i got to him i had my foot on the inside of the sort of the concrete butres and and i try to flip him back toward me and tat he was completely lemp he was a back of sawdust he he just flipped right back on to me im ai had not even really and pulled hin that hard t's hard to explain but ike when i think of it i just get i'd have to say just i i have just goose bumps all over my body raght now because because because he ah he was going to kill himself and because he did not did you feel good im now i am feel good i felnt kind of nacious i felt wa there there every week somebody actually does this thing and even if we were to clumn mister chan and there were two hundred of amount there they would prod still one a week some one would would figure it how to do it and then all my got who is coming next and sai sai mis chan comes back great yet will it took mister channa while to come back on his mowpead but when he came when he showed u the crowd sort of parted and i was holding on to this man whose name was fan pane and he said to me step away which i thought was a really bad idea cause we are standing right next to the railing but he had such command of the situation and all the ne ance is of the situation that i just

back yard not a story about a some of the mysterious things happening on the edges of the city in the shadow of the city right under our knowses and i'm to but this stoy in some contacts woudn' turned out to hor hate just you may member where ha he sent some story for a program he says the when you move to a new city you cannot get into the regular conversations that everybody else gets into he found thi satt a litle wile back when he did the one thing that everyone y cicago agrees is the very worst thing tha anybody can do he moved to new york all new yorkeris won i talc about is what subway traying to get to take to get from i be and it goes on and on and you cannot say any that you cannot be they discoverd o tenth planetand well youl you would take the dms yeto get tet the desle at it it is inascapable and when you that conversation finely peters ou it is somehow and it it does not fail turns into a conversation about selfhan reception youti n't i get into that you cannot get into the count know where the dead spots are you cannot can do any small talk what happens is the smell talk becomes you just moved in new york where you framiliar from chicago how do you new york how do you mork every onc's in how you near caus they want you say you'rs the greatest place that i've ever been to and i've i've burned all of my connections that anywhere that i've ever been before because i love it much here when in fact people would say howdy new york w i it it is big it staff but i i really chicago i really whats chicago chicagofs tis you wonderful dream land where there is a bar on every corner and the bridgeis smell chocolate and then you would pree much i have a a silence and your the ice in your glass would clink a couple of times and then then say the bridge of smellike chocolateand then i describe how wonderful it is that the bridges with smell the smelled chocolate and this is something that people in new york have never ever ever ever ever ever believed but if you get up early in the morning and it is sort of quiet out and you go to the right bridge and it is just that sort of magic a twinkling hour where the sun's coming uppened and the you are in a big city but nobody's around every now and again they smlling browneous ye but tha thet's i sou true that is very rat stiling say it is it is true and the reason' wy is because there is the is a chocolate clap on the west side that spws i that ispews the smell of chocolate you have the smell of magic to say someth to say a the bridge smells chocolate does not convey what actually happens what actually happens is that when you are walking across a bridge and your dodging cars and it is a bridge over a dead river in the middle of it part of town that is industrial and totally unnatural you you you just sort of walk into this cloud of the sweetest memory you have of cook he is then made as a child your sweetest childhood memory can walk into that and en walk into my surprise in the middle of the day in the middle of tha city not know that im that that all this is ending right i know i know it is a thousand little stabs in the heart thanks to the federal government it is ike a million little stabs in the heart what happened is this somebany complained about the chocolate smell they complained to the vire met a protection agen ciy an the fedow government ever responsive to ev any single complain from any of it citizens anywhere in the country leapt into action the sent inspectors to the blomer chocolate company whichhas been making chocoo barson o the goodies when chicagoes west side since nineteen thirty nine inspector's found that too much coco dust was going into the air more than is legal under federal standards the plant installed foottering equipmen n fact they said they'v been planning to get that equipment in place even before the p drope by in any case fewere coco particles in the air means less delicious chocolate aroma youu ctapury to pinkof liking a oneol pokat factory e yel om le com plan an tha wel de look of yet of the probley re picter but yet your a pbaen e time where it happen et the powerpoin n nothing happened that is bryaner bishevsky director environmental health programs for the american long association in chicago and as he points out it 's been widely reported here the illinois attorny general's office has documented over seventy six hundred violations somewhat to th chocolate company violation at six coal plants in elinoi in the last six years and n p has never gone after any of those coal plants bo i let wi the packomintn cocoate factory are not a majour sort ot e fine particle collution when you look at powerply very po able por about a quarter of the problem and chocolate is chocolate a quarter of the problem as well no o i now it i it t probably o you par par arle one er tat ooh the there is a quort that you gave i'm where you a used an animal metaphor that i've seen quoted mily in a million a articles that i just relike to you to repeat here for our listeners oh i do not know if i e an i tr y to ot the wolv and the ant ti itra ot e o animal acter te after me for that ein a that wolf e're not beinr te human oh that that being said oh it you e i i'll say it if you if you dn fike you can you u said that i'm honifer sic and i haveit year ah u you said that the p what t p was dong with his chocofactory and ignoring the col plants you said quote it is crushing in ant when there is a pack of wolves around then claiming you have saved people from harm ho bout at we pay it not it what crushing in at yet do not be scare to this atima writes people not oto tin ave you sharkin that o we shar i just this s just my entire relationship to government right now can be summed up by this story icay there is all these things are thring particles in the air and the only one i is the one the'r getting rid of oh ye and ou on ta marfo tryo well fedoy p has not ben talking to the press about the chocolate factory when i called the illinois state e p the manager of compliance in inforcement for the bureau of air a cheerfule publice servant named julia armitage inform me that there has been a misunderstanding yes she said the coal plants had boutesdout too many particles seventy six hundred times but she thi's times was very very short at the least a momentary spike at the most six minutes long each one was a blip she said automatic monitoring equipmentis going twenty four hours a day taking readings at up all the blips per year and you get two hundred eleven blips per plant per year meaning that well over ninety nine per cent of the time the plants are in compliance with the law yet taken out a contact id it it a pears to be a a very bad pituation put into contact it vertury an onisou and as for the fact that now there may be less chocolate smell in chicago i'm net really to podition when i prefer do not a pad te hollblo e proe yet and you do not feel an y sort of twinge as an environmental regulator who is here to make our world a better place as you are that that could be the upsote of the whole thing at the bet hat the chocolate a roma appears ya you do not feel any sort of twinge if that would happen well hou a anfortunately a mind yob here can shure compliant with an biroment al law o regulation and and wherever my sentence is going to siste exactly not the answer we th e people of ellinois wenty here wer i ony here about laws and regulation e o but there there there for readon in and for themost part oueverybody wis fing the rules she says thi feds inspected just the suppose to blommers was in fact emitting too much chocolate end of story and then in the months after i had the conversation with her the p says blommer fixed the problem stopped spewing particles into the air o thet vyway tod the law and good news incredibly what the remitting still smells delicious chocolat e angs the wa chan tasn n the wingae na es com e fonoen cema

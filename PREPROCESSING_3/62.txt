out on is yon do we wanerosso that is the thing you did ye yepeople we to make friends ocae i let us go back to the inception of this idea you approached me and you said we should make a fictional film about this topic now be fair i think i'd actually suggestes the granboys that they do this as a dock yes i originally went to them and i said you guys should go try after much ladies leagues and that became not possible because as it turns out most ladies leagues do not allowing actuall mens an brands a they were not willing to go tho ful hitens in terms of what it would require in order to the actual hormone treatments in everything to plains from the ladies leas pot in any case it turned into this explain ye whet thing the thing that you have to understand is that i was getting ready to leave the country to go make our pendragon series on july nints and somewhere about mid march i thought would not it be crate if between to day and july ninth we wrote and produce an entire future film yethe the craneboys mentioned the i did that you had given them and and had been in the back of my mind that we really should be making the movies at only we can make effect i think it is a ling that yu had had come up with an what are the things that only we can do i i thought what obviously there has not been a true comedy made since brokobama became president i mean brokobamma destroyed three things rokenroll comedy and america other than that ue's a perfectly average president but it it became impossible to tell a joke during the abom adminstration cause abamma made this sort of pacet with awith culture shapers hthat they should change their fundamental understanding of themselves and in the case of comedians they should no longer you mock the absurd but the should be agents for social change the head rider of esanell famously said o know that they would make no jokes about brokobama he said there is literally nothing funny about this man it is as though he is carved from a a single piece of pure obsidian which in itself is one of the funniest things that any one has ever said cause if anything it was half of a slab of pure obsidian and the other was snow white marble little racious but us ill a littler is but this is the view that tey took a babama because if is sort of singular religious affect you could not make any jokes anywhere ever and you have seen i mean comedy has changed fundamentaly in that erra and hollywood stop making these kinds of films you go back to the early two thousats yef some of the great comedies you kno probably ins culminates a tropic thunder its starts with dotfall into tropic thunder i miss those movies you miss those movies i think are odiensmiththitismovies and there is never been anything funnier re mockable and re laughably absurd an the main strame part of our culture then letting grownasdp up ify calling themselves checks amit is it is pattenly absurd and soy it was liwop there is there is a joke that needs to be told that only we can tell let us try to do it somehow the next ninety days weg'te to more with gjermy and just one second first pure talk has you covered for the holidays with a free modo g

anded op going through and rewriting a lot of the scrap you and it up tho recting the filmians at of being the star of the thine that that was basily demanded by circumstancesfi tias it the to the they are wort actors who are willing to be in the film because of all wa i was getting ready to go to europe on the location gout and i sat down two writers that hve worked with us in the past bryan hoffman and nixshian both really talented guis and i said goys i'm leaving for two weeks when i come back any descript ures what it has to be about i outlined for them what i wanted the the moving to be i went and scouted romaniand bulgaria and serbia ot looking for places to shoop pindragon came back and they had had done yooman's work they put together a script in that in that time they solved some pot ellments that were really good but sort of every one that we approached with this idea originally no one wants to go all the way and i did a little work on the script to help maksure that it went went the full distance and then we start going out to actors and literally every single actor that we went out to for every single roll told us snow and i want to be clear that this is not they read the scription said this is not funny many of them told us no just point blank on the fonm when we pitche the idea and i also whn to be cleared these are not actors we did not go out to leo de caprio you we are going out to people who are on our side who have been telling us for years since we first got into movies we will do we will walk across broken glass to be in a daily wiremovy this is people who have in many cases already been cancelled and even they would say to us upon hearing this pitch gis tas the one thing no way that you you will never it is not just hat you will not work again you will be person an ungrod and every room you ever w hey will fire you from a cannon into the son yesteday that is correct and it was really shocking ii suppose it should not have been but to hear these already cancelled conservative actors who who wanted to do things with us just unwilling to touch the material and and that is when th sort of the idea of well what if it was just us what if the daily wire truly made the movy that only the daily wire could make and we all had some trepidation about that going in i want to say though that i i cannot imagine any better way that it could have gone because if we would gotin any of those actors yes they woud have had skills that we do not have they would not have taken the jokes as far as we took them they would not have been willing to go the distance and our guyes particularly crane and co yj crane blane crane and david cone they committed themselves completely to this process and i was telling you in the make up chair before we started the things the physical stuff they subjected themselves too you both from body transformation losing way gaining muscle all of that piece have at be then just also all the stunts the hard days we are working we hadn'n eighteen hour day our last day and these guys ye they were they were eu li eledathletes before they moved into the sports commentary space and you see you see it when you work with them just absolute dedication and completely hilarious and of course pretty much everybody cannias in this thing some have smaller cano then others i wno it wis not very large but your canamiofs not very large but i will say it is the bluest comedy and the entire film at's true it is it is exactly what anyone who knows that you'r funny which is apparently no one on the left to never understand when you are making a joke but any one who actually watches your show woill be there goes there goas been been and it is hilarious and a obviously we have everybody from rily gains to tad crues makes an appearance ye in that well yo i i watched whatting crashers and it i ha cin hav you right an me it tut a has been tad has been itching for this all his life since he was doing i d o and then somehow anded up in the united states and it and also renning for president what he actually wanted of cuse if he ad gott in this when he was twenty he never would aveben in polita i will tell you that that is one hundred per cent true and it is the perfect movy for ted because what people may not know ithe man loves basketbal its sre play to yeu playe to me can play be me camel and beat him i he he loves basket ball he wants to be an actor in fact i've never told anybody this if actal whe will be mad at me for telling i you he is in a tough relection race right now back ind texas an obviously whe need ted cruse in the senate but i called him as it hay i know that there is no way you can do this but you should come to hungry and be in pindragon is i've got a roll i will physically transform you will not be a camio no one will know its you we will not market that you were in it it ill just you can actually come transform yourself and spend a week with us and actually act and i thought i'm given a powel his actual dream and then he reminded me tht he has an actual chow wit enormous responsibilities but for this he is willing to come out into a camio for a sin and was truly funny and i and then we played a little one on one and i do not have a dream of flying basket yes i was also skunked by a bu it it is definitely all of your daily wire of favorites yes' it matwalsh is it it he is hysterical you saw him there i know you may have missed him because he does not look matwash but in fact that is mat walsh with a manbun ye you got got michael mull's and a brad cooper in it as well michael gives the most offensive performance in the film shocker i cannot believe it the most shocking i finally justifying that that is salor ye and there camios that we have not announced yet some other e people who who show up and a and get some laughs forus which as the as the day's draw toward the actual premer will wildrely some of that inpobut i wont t go through some of the tweets that is a the people been sending son mot most positive s to th reception on twiter paticutlarly has been astonishingly good overwhelming when it is been probably twenty million views to displayin on twitter some where intha neigborhood also we talk about this as thoughit is a controversal issue but cause the left pretense that it is a controversal issue virtually every human being alive to day and every human being alive and till to day has known that men should not competing is women in man's sports i mean that that blamecleb where he is picking up the girl and throwing her to the mat i mean i it is hilarious but but also it is hilarious because it is absurd and that you never be allowed under any circumstances and that is actually happening in the actual world no i can sat watching that be shot was difficult i mean we had a great professional stunt woman a true pro she is wearing of up skeletoll body armour basically that is made to do this sort of thing and it is still hurt mean blane is lifting her off the ground an slamming her into the into the mat you have to do it over and over i felt bad for her she wath such a trooper and i got in the van on the way home that night thinking man we are genuinely being terrible to women in the making of of this movy and then i realized oh no this is real you can fight imima you are the first bio logical man to fight against a woman in the imema broke her skull and the left is celebrating this meanwhile everyone knows it is wrong and only this weird virtue signaling social proof culture a causes us well not us but causes many people to pretend that they do not know that it is wrong and what i think it is great about our movy is it does what comedy is supposed to do it actually points out an absurdity the movy is the movy is absurd but it is only is absurd is the real world we are just choosing to frame it in a way that to las you to laugh at it i think this movy is is less i kin to dodgeball tonally it is dodgeball but thematically it is much less dodgeball and it is it is much more a a what was your movi a that you turned me on to a about stall on death of stal tath of stall and think yuas it is much more death of stall eg's underneathers an actual serious its the o teli actually what happened it is just tocatea laugh right exactly exact lok case lit is look it some of the weets o rily gain to a who is camoing and that she says highlighting the absurdity of allowing men in women sports through commedy and whats supposed to be satire this is the way excited for this make shure to wash lady ballers featuring me and some he most influential people in the concervtive movement on t twelve one yet right riseing it she is great you could not make a movy about this topic and not have rily in the film seth dillin from the bablonbeesas yes the man is must be mocked well ton chair me iu'llget to mention when i when best supporting actor for my part in this et i i i guess i was not there the day that that seth was on at yo i i was trying to side who do we ask to camio in the film and i needed some one who was the kind of bada low grat guy who would allow himself to be tied to furnaces i the kind of grifter who would actually put forth men to participate in women's sports and the first got iv thought of of course with sethfillan a seth has been good that this is actually whone i whene i called sethan asked him to be in the film ii said within all sincerity there very few people of be n more consistently outspoken on the assuredanc south and you shich is the reason he lon musk colnelly own's ax that is e xathor o set sethons in some ways some very directwis contributed by making jokes about this topic he changed the world that tri contributed to the preservation of free speech in our time and be out to have having sathon the movy was wwas an honor and he is funny and wokeness tweated this is what we have all been critting for long actual comedy lady bollasas can be one of the topblock busters of the year mark my words by the way i i think that is actually true nif you saw how wished it over the week and ut i think to significant possibility this at per forms weshme in this night that is a very low balockbusters the lowbar n twenty twenty thre man of course talor fisher who is in the film as she liks i he toed out a i caught my goff to be in the ves he is a method actor much commentment much pa it is it is amazing and aand then howmedy people people retoit of course the vestun valti this this is truly one of your bift we thank i appreciateeds a people were trending you ant a man yesterday because sort of hirs out that there was a movy twenty years ago called juana man right what i learned about yesterday and on and i knew that it was there but i d not occurred to me thats a people to see the similarity because i mean frankly it is transfobic to see the similarity you an a man is the tragic tal of a basketball player in the u b not the u and not the anb ath u b and a hans o being expelled from he u b a and is pyssically tutzy but basketball and bad i and i and he ends up going to the u u b a and playing int u u b a and falling in love with his room made but of course he is suppost be a girl in this creats all sorts it is exactly it is the plot of tutzy but with that low brow and basketball but to compare that to this is just sic i'm sorry it is tran as i say how daring you compare lady bollers i moving about beautiful transwomen with jou ant a man movin about a man pretending to be a woman your bigotry is horrifying and it is true it is a trpublic this it is conof amazing them all these people on the left we are blithely comparing ar film that is right tos you ant a man which shows that they know the thing right because jou nt a man is about a man litera is not pretend that e's actually a woman he pretent he is a man pretending to be a woman he does not say i am a woman therefore i get to play in the u b a he is a man pretending to e a woman it is mis us bavantage he is he is ye it is wrong and he is hiding it right he is afraid to get caught when you guys compare ar movy to jouan a man what are you saying about transwomen in sports what are you actually saying about trans whomen in sports also yes if you look back twenty years to a time before brokobama was president there were comedies sire right imean hot checks with ma blane picking up that girl in slama and that is that is rob shniter taking a pillow and just bashing a gril into a wall a trand you use to be able to do that because the idea of it is hilarious and stupid and wrong and this has gon to be a criticism that we get ra people on the right who are a jealous that we made a movan include them they are going to say the delyar miter drag comady bobobo yes be cause for all of human history dude's dressing chicks as funny because s in congruous tat silly thank you that is right and now were supposed to pretend that that is not funny is it not only not funny it is brave theat the bravest men are the ones who dresses women the best men are its you'lway say the best women are men but also the best men ar women betragh the best

hostageis being held bycamas he toured the sights of the october sevent masker and he met with both prime minister benjamin it is now who and president isaac hersat musk sat through of vidio com piled from bodycam footage of commass terroris that day is tht i was horrifiing to watch the joy of those terris as they committed their savage atrocities thissis vidio of that visit is in far oza there he is with prime minister nitinaho by the way when they are wearing the flackfest that is not just for show there is till live gon fire happening not all that far away dis quite the conclo sees fire there are still military operations the commas is attempting in the northern gossips trip right now thissis vidiobviously of musk and if now who looking at oneof the crims wer babies were slaughtered after this tour of far aza masfthen held the press conference at which he spoke the plain truth about the situation on the ground he was here was ulan mak summing it up ir thng ta mothly te cal tey ito see the placeis where people of mitit aste to uet the p the piness a and dan i think this an aorsy the the three things that nee to happen i in in gose situation and tis no twic petu kill thes you insist on a mern ofy tis ecis an they no cancate their mind tatand nd the second thing is to change the the education he an any generation of of maters is not chanty meters and and the the thingtos of important is to cato prosperity take this what you sayright there that is an excellent three prong plan for thestroying comass and othe radical terrorost groups ot kill the people who murduer the civilians that means comas and its allies you wil overhaul the education system in the west bank and gosistrip which are run by parties who hate yews and seek the destruction of israel and you bring economic prosperity only after those steps are fulfilled can there be talk of some sort of peaceful settlement of the conflict because only at that point while there be partners willing to make peace this also happens to be the only strategy that has ever worked counter insurgency strategies directed at hostile populations can only be successful over time if the most militant members the cerroris are killed the population is reeducated away from hatred an economic prosperity becomes possible and make no mistake the population of the gosistrip and west bank is indeed wildly hostile to his raial and deeply antismetic population not just come oss that is not a slore that is simply a reality here is vidio from yesterday of the gosan population harassing red cross vehicles carrying is rally hostages e mosco to cleared the streets whn what do you see here what you see here you see young children following the following the the red cross van macking people inside these are the gosin civilians cheering because they know that this has brought them time comass macking the hossages who ware taken tis a triumphant parade of comas family members and friends then the locamin children are in the crowd here bocome any kidshere are macking outside these red cross vans civilian children whore inside the red cross vans being being return to their families min sick is is a sickness is a sick mentality that would lead anybody to do something remotely this again those are civilians including children mocking is really hossges also including children these are the wages of educating an entire population of pure hatred here for example is vidio of a kintrgarden graduation ceremony in gosit does ok quite your kids graduation ceremony from kinnergarden and here some het yo from memory tive in wht you see are kids who are at a graduations are they are theyre acting as though they are terrise performing quottinquote military operations these kis are five planting fake gas cannistar bons underneath tak tangs flanking twar ways performing actions that include kidnapping an killing quot inquoe enemy soldiers ttin a ggraduation ceremony for five year olds for five year olds had kennergarten graduation ceremony and goszap in this is insane is a young kids and stab kill the occupire with stones and knives look at tit men have ever been i have four kids three of them have graduated two of them have graduated kinnegarden and i can tell you this noks nothing why ma kid's graduation ceremonies from kennegard by the way we are just starting to hear of the stories of what the hostages went through in gaza according to the ant of one of those hostages it was civilians beating the hostage twelve years old as he entered gozap to you lawrene av beu lawrnce of arabia once compared making war on in surgents quote eating soup with the knive he sait was messy and slow that of course is right the model for such counter insurgency tactics is the british counter in surgency against commonest revolutionaries in mailea from nineteen forty eight to nineteen sixty by the time that that counter in surgency had started the british had already had forces in contry for about a century according to historian andrew roberts in general ty the petrac in their new book at conflicts the milan campaign was a mixture of stick and kerroc quote providing people with electricity drinking water schools clinicts and property rights proved a powerful disincentive for them to support maism but a heaty enticement of security had a dialectical partner firm discipline for those who disobeyed this by the way included in some cases strictly rationing diets to half daily calory account the british leadership also new thi stradity would take a very long time the general in charge of the operation said he would quote shoot the basterd who says this emergency is over eventually after more than a decade the british did win israel can secure its future too but only if it takes the time an effort necessary to do and this means ignoring the stupidity of those who wanta quick ending to what will be a long struggle the first step in that struggle destroying camass what do on mass said is what israel is going to have to do that is what is really primnister ninting ow who makes clear here he was yesterday in a live chat with masku if you want peace iscuiamas you wassecurity istihamasi ou want a bette li o the pas thinins in gasu been hijat baamas tiscuiamas all that is the pecressr to the questoned you ass i crest at to get rit o the poisonis regime as you dd in germany has you did n you can tn wo or tothes were to there is o choce there is no cos sa that o thers thro rics yet is a at that then look at what happened i mean what you had in germany was teasicecation what you hadin to can on you tutisme carker was a cultural reformation e an to can that you visit to day is sodefe frm gocan of the niht e tis thet germany that you visit to day is sodice from germany of the nagt e tates well is that possible in the abwol i cant a gord e say of course it is because we have seen adority in two places we have seen it in the gulf states and we see that when you visit to buy o when you visit abegaby ony visit bay you see something entirely differecer in porsoness now who is totally right commass has to be destroint why well because they cannot be reformed their nevil teros group in facts cmmass apparently to transfer control of the entire beby's family which includes a forerael than a ten month old to the popular front for the liberation of palestine another terros group apparently for money commass military leader yach yas sinoir apparently appeared personally to the hostages in the tunnels to show them his power one hostage was forced read ridiculous letter before her release talking by hoccmass had quote treated her daughter a queen well in captivity of nacketting commass is evil full stop tis is why early calls for israel to stop its operations against comas are not jus foolish their dangerous when burney standers jabbers about israel's cruelty toward civilions he is not protecting civilians he is making their lives more dangerous since veadis way they wd ent up under commases tender protections presumably forever here was burney standers yesterday israel was a tact in an absolutely horificuoy by commas thirteen hundred innocent people was slaughted israel has a right to thefend itself but what israel does not have a right to go in my view its to kill twelve thousand people in six seven weeks two thirds of whom are women and chiltren that they do not have right to the thoughts a violation av in conational lant warge suas of the democratic party seeme determined t prent israel from doing what the actio need to do to secure their future this vi center of christmurphy is calling for conditions on aid to israel which by the way is sotally vine were america we canput conditions on aid but the conditions that he seeks to place on israel if things compliance with international law israel's are to complyin with internictional law at wholl point but the idea here is to create a vague definition that leaves open the possibility of th drawing aid bhey sent israel' current gasit actions on friday present abidans had conditioning aid would be a quote worth while fought yesterday national securedy adviserspokesperson john kerby when rule it out either the porsit were taken with israel and quite frankly with their partes in the region is working its getting aid into people that needed its getting a pas in te fighting its getting hostages out it is getting americans out and quite frankly we continued to urge and well continue to urge these raillies as they conduct military operations to do with the utmost care for inocence o thin li in ca in the barty is party who say we ai tar idicini a in forinwe etay i thyou would stay exactly what he san to oh yesterday when he un ask this quest tat the work woll thougt but the approach that i'm taking now is working approach the we are taking now is working its getting result this is ridiculous the idea that you hand cufg the party that is attempting to protect itself the democracy the democratic ally in the face of a giant terrogroup is ridiculous it is also foolishoness for people to treat the quotenquo two state solution as though that idiotic nostrum represens a true solution it does not and it has not in instead holds out the hope that the more pressure is applied to israel the more death brought to israel citizenry by terroris t more international pressure put on israel the more israel will then conceide to those very terrorist which of course prolongs the conflict i've a question does anyone really want a terr a terrestate in the westbank on the gocistrept beause tat's exactly what would exist if palistinian statehood were declared to day as the apparently the ridiculous government of spain would wish come oss would end up the governing party in a new state with control over its bordered than its weaponre d you think the possibility of globale conflict is larger or smaller under those circumstanses now president bine has been more stallwart thani wouldhave expected far but is language on this matter is insipid here is what he twe to quote a two state solution is the only way to guaranty the long from security about the israllian the palsinan people to makesure is rallyes in palsinians likeliv in equal measure of freedom an dignity we will not give up on working towards that coal can you imagin in the middle of world wor to if the president of the united states had tweeted out what we really need is a peace agreement between america and japan in orded to end this terrible blood shed and leave the japanese fashist in charge of japan no coas hat won to made any sense right listen the two state solution may oventually down the line become a possibility but ironically talk about it pre maturely prevents that possibility from ever materializing because every incensivization of terrorism increase is terrorism thus making such a solution absolutely impossible how do we know this because what happene on october seventh was the culmination of three decates of large scale terrorism pursued by the palcing an authority palsinan is lomatyhod come oss what neens to happen exactly what must sais finish come oss reeducate to getes away from islemism builds up the economy but that would require moral clarity and that of course is precisely what is missing these days from a disconnected west in just one

everywhere if there is one face of lack of moral clarity of the next generation of idiots the we ave created through the toxic combination of legacy media attention social media and wokust philosophy that face is the ridiculously dum face of gretatunburg who continues to be treated as though she has something worthy to say sho never had anything worthy to say shos always a foolish child whose running around the globe saying dum things to adults who wanted to feel better about themselves by allowing a foolish child to yell at them for the cameras as shou very privileged persons of this grentitunbrigthul grobin a very rich family and that gave for the ability to bistically drop out of school and go to a bunch of adult symposiums and yellodun bat hov the next generation domon of vou random things those ranum things include d growth d industrialization andall the rest well turns out but that radically anti western viewpoint is not confined to her invironmentalism which of course t is just partin parcel of a broader intellectual rubric the idea that you want stopcluble warming does not have to be connected with d growth it does not have to be connected with a belief in the innate evils of the west but it virtually always is and grintomberig is just a symptom of this she was caught ontape just last week instocum shouting about antisinism what the held is greta twonburg have to say bout israel what exactly i did not notice for example that the people of gaza and the and the arapalistinians living in the westbank ore particularly concerned with invironmental issues what exactly in fact israel is one of the greenest places on earth in terms of highly industrialize countries what tdells shou taught again it is all partin parcel of hatred for the west that is all this is sheis emblematic of what west has become a suicidal death cult of stupidity here is greditwin again the fact that this was everg she was time magazine person of the year a few years ago for being a stupid child who ran around yelling an dults it is amazing to me re what exactly she chancin she is chancing in sweetish wo what are we going to do you will crush zinism an regto twinberg climate activist shouting about this sort of crap privileged white western people shouting about the evils of white westernism amazing amazing stuff and again this is the privilege of living in the west is that you can be as hypocritical and ridiculous as you wanto me whall be golberg spent yesterday doing that they were considering over on the view the bright minds over the view they were considering why it is that many members the meatyoug movement are totally silent about the fact that commos raped a bunch of women that there is a gine report in the washington post about commoss raping women hard their pelices broke raping women an shooting them to death while they were still inside the women and what what were all the worll thef emenistrites on whereis linde sarsour and the women's march why why is there no comment weird weird wetl here is whippy golbrg trying to explain why i am still deto fated wer two month of the thwars ben under way by the fiolence from womenscir an this country about that gra a natesthas tan oc of war nd th the tack the fact that fectual violence was aes against this railing women and the mager womenscir on ths contrey havin out cut out in anounce that the wegan charl fand ber cut out a grecttingvetio calling for it that violet th every roll of want of warfare at is the height of immorality and the fot that thinatinations and anady for ganer quality and women an powerment has been fiolent and that commt on te womination of discrimination against women has been fiolent and the anrnational naton wofmen horhad perhaps the reason they have been silence is for the same reason that you just describe they do not lont anl has what little on exascerate you no lissan i i i know that this is really hard for people to sit still worth right now we are glad people are come now and that is what we are going to keep talking about because we want ting courage that the bottom wine truly is this you do not have a troit you have to end this yeve to end this and what you mean the people who rape women to death that that is what youd have don why whipy golberg is silence on all this because whil be golberg believes a the jews are just white people and white people are bad that is why wipy golberg says this kind of stuff is the same idiot women who suggested that hitler killing jews whose white on white violence and was not in facty form of racial discrimination that is liter lly what she said and then choe suspended and shou try to walk aback we did not really walkaback that is what she believes the reason she apparently is totally fine with this silence is violence wi'll be golberg going out there and suggesting that if you did not put the black square on your facepok page an mittle a black lifes mattes cause you hateo black people accoring to will be golberg not because you jisagreed wout ases o premis which is the black people oure widely victimized in the united states but because you hate black people when jews are actually victimized when jues are actually raped weal begoers what we wud do have to be we have to keep quiet about that we do not we would not one exastcerbate the conflict we would not want to make it worse you are right condemning rape would make it worse will be golberg that nailed it nailed it again there is only one reason will be golberg is happy say that about this prerticular population and taskas their jews that is the only reason tat will be golberg is willing to well we just have to end this wif to en wreally not mentioning their rape ends this the only way the sense is when commoss is under te ground that is and i doft mean in the tunnels i mean dead just to clarify but the reason wil be golberg believes all the sypecs again she bisince this oppressor oppress rachalist matrics and that is in evil matric it is a very very evil matrics that that way of thinking is pathetic and disgusting and just one secon will get to lack of moral clarity from our friends

replete in our media they'r people i pere's morgan nige i consider peers a friend got to say that his coverage of the tissue he is trying to both sides its he is trying say one being objective and being as objective as possible but when he gives monologues the one that he did yesterday about israel's activities against commass i got to say he is not both sizing it heris peers morgan yesterday h' a monologue essentially accusing israel of the same sort of terrism that commass perpetrated october sevent that is insane a'm tird thage is morally wrong it is wrong on a factural level its wrong on moral level is just not true here was peers doing that routine yesterday a being pigto this wee can by people remindimm of tweet twenty fourteen by then isrell loge to masted bonbabman of gaus from his false the bud a three is ready tee mades in the west fight wahappened amas bha e li changed by position waabn says poposition iswell commicted atrosseties in twenty fourteen in lastimation it was e complete dis proportion of response to what as happened it lebolat revenge to me that a mian its ostrotegy e present ababa told im to col it olf we de tat bobboba i also what point dis israel's carmenits o strotegy bhe com the very terroism professs to be fightin an to day i'm beginning to ost myself bot exact same question based on what based on what and first of all i do not on i do not think that peers ere manyin the media understand what proportionality means proportionalityes does not mean that the original a trocity has to be responded to quati quhat proportionately that is not what proportionality means if you murder my child i do not then get to murder your child that is not proportionality proportion means that the means use to achieve a military end must be proportional to the military end in other words if i want a killed one bad guy i cannot just rop an abom riht that is what that means a but again this idea that israel has to be hampered in's military aims ore that israel has magical weapons where yo wave the magic herry poterwan and all badguize to superbut all the civilians are left over that is not true by the way peers was wrong in twenty fourteen the fact in the matter is that in twenty fourteen by the generalize statistics of the people who were killed in that particular conflict bout two thousand one hundred people were killed in that particular conflict by israel in the gossistrip and that was prompted by the kidnapping of thran murder of three is raily teen agers as well as a series of rock is fired into israel as por commass's usual arrangement in that conflict accorting to the measurements available from the israilly ministry of orn affairs which is significantly more liable than the uan or the goz a health ministry thirty six per cent killed were civilians forty four per cent were members of commass or other terrasgrupts and twenty per cent were quatin quhat uncategrized mails between the ages of sixteen and fifty which cipically means civilians wuare associated with commas or one of the other terroris groups this sort of moral lack of clarity of course means thet kno one can wone but no one can win awaruner the circumstances be clear about this there is no war that can be on by western power against a terrorist group in bedded in i civilian population under the circumstances that peers is describing as quotinquo terrorism it is not terrorism to try to kill people in the ipposing terroriust group and they are hiding among vilings that is not terrorism terrorism is when you go in and you slaughters civilians purposefully not as colateral damage purposefully as the goal of your attack which is what commasted peres trid to exstend this to wat to questions that he is asking of alon lady who the spoke person for the isrally prime minister here it here he was yesterday by an ermission a justifes moments ago thes says they make it incredit be diffical for you to work ow who is a hamass terrison who is this of evat seems to me part of the problem that you have with the altics of this to the why the world is at thes seing horrible immatery all day lon man is it is just the warsting ov ever seen all o the social madea all thost the only of the scene with the atrocities that a noa no o no onthe sand iud not sen thankfully i've not seen what many tenis scen which is the forty five minute som of that and i the stand its absolutely herrific i wat mad ise is ot mak candy him in osand but no i i would not say anything is worse of that i for the record a but they horriblimaty old day long it is suggesting to people that there are thousandsand thousands of thousands of women and a lot of children may be as many as five six thousand children now have been killed by these astrikes and now the groundatac and i think the problem that you have mus say this respectfully the prope you have is at you done nat she know how many hamas terrori cer killy that if your honest you done be i get well i mean under the circumstances who would mean it yet e the answeris a lot by the way they do know in approximate numbers how many commass terrors theyhave killed but if the idea is that the only way thayou can fight a terrorist group is presumably by knowing exactly exactly how many terroris you are killing and only killing the erris no one will ever one a war agains the terrigr began is not possible it is just not possible to do that by the waywhen we talk about the number of of civilian casualties in gaza is very difficult to separate who is a civilian from who is not when you are talking about a seventeen year old mail who is hanging out with commas is you member of commas or is he is civilian this ils happens to gring true wih regard to thistatistic about quin quit children an you have heard that is reals keeping women and children in prison the many the prisoner is bein release are women in children in the same wayour hearing that describe in in the gods strip i mean they are technically women and miners that are being held in prison for terrorist activity i depends hofs being killed again we do not have great statestics on any of that because since when have you in real time bean able to count the exact number of people who are dying in war thet you cannot win a war under the circumstances if the idea again is that immunity is bought by simply hidig among civilians that means terrorius win every war from now until the end of time and you have now created a mass of incentive structure for them to hide among civilians in violati n of the guniva conventions to another words the punishmen for violation of the guniva conventions a coring to peers and many in the media e's immunity nothing happens to you you sit there in everybody just lives with it it is totally crit by the way even one peer says he is not aquittng what happen on october seventh to what happend intygaza he literally did in his monologue he literally said the this now tipping over into the terrorism that israels on october seven that is not even true in that lack of moral clarity is what means that the west loses wars forgetabout israel the west in general loses wars on this basis and tat is a serious serious problem and meanwhile jobidon continues to trail in the poles there is new article out at real clair politics trump shohn trend to day and anhe points out that right now if yhadput betting money on it trump is the favorite he says in twenty sixteen trump led hillery clintn for all of five days in the national ireal clar politic polling average each of those days in the immediate aftermafh of the republican convention he let in twenty nine poles taken over the course of the entire campaign in twenty twenty trump never led bidon in the national arcy p average counting the eletimes trackerds i single pole trump ledina total of twenty four a national poles in january of twenty twenty this cychel he is lettin that many since mid september he is lettin more pols in the pass through weeks than he did against bidon in the entirity of the twenty twenty campaign if youg the state level polling trump is currently up in virtually every battle ground state mit romny never led brocabom in the arcy piaverge an wisconsin pennsylvania michigan or ohio where is it today trump is leading the real clepoltics pulling average an michigan he is leading in pennsylvania he is narrowly trailing in wisconsin but he is lead in some ofte poles in florida he is way ahead in arizona he leads in georgia he leads in ohio he leads here is what trun trenses quote an other words analyzing the selection correctly is not just a matter of giving lip service to the notion tha trump can win the selection the correct position right now is there trump is better position in the poles to win the selection than any go pe nomine since at least two thousand four not only that hes habitually over performs this poles trankly if you are willing to set favorites this far out sul almost certainly the clar donal trump the favorite does this mean the trump willwin the precidency their god arguments why perceptions of the economy wil improve between now and then although maybe they will not perhaps trump ill under per form his polling this time as the geope didnint twenty twenty two although maybe he will not teir good arguments trumps truminal trials will road his standing the poles although having watched trump scandals unfoles for the beter part of for decades maye they will not this al makes for fun speculation but when the conversation returns to what we do know there is only one correct anser trump canwin the selection and wright now is well positioned to do and jobidon is struggling man he is having a tough time again he really he is contending not only with firers on the foreign frum but also he is contenting with the fact that people just do not tink the economy is very good ire's an entire in york time's article titled even most bidin voters do not see thriving economy quote a majority of those who back presen n biden in twenty twenty say to day's economy is fair or poor ordinarily a batomen for incumbens seeking re election by swing stat in the twing states the percentage of jobidon's twenty twenty supporters wo say the economy is excellent or good thirty per cent hundred fifty ca by income thirty seven per cent if you are from fifty cato a hundred ca and forty two percent say the economy is excellent or good if you are over a hundred thousand dollars meanwhile if you say the economy is poor or only fair seventy per cent of people making under fifty ran sixty one per cento people making from fifty to a hundregran and fifty seven per cent say the economy is only poor or only fair if you are making over a hundred thousand dollars and by age eighty nine per cent to people eged eighteen to twenty nine say the economy i's poor or only far we are tulg about jo bidons twenty twenty supporters wre not talking about the entire brought electorit thoseyou are amazing numbers by the way that is a serious problem for jobi naturally he is trying to teach people that done tere's wrong about the economy

dancer and activist and of course you een ar all over social media particularly right now promoting the fight against taintitematism montana great to see thank i for having the thnks much for coming in excited how did you get into this fight against stantisematism in the first place i fick i've been fighting this fight for a long time now i one year go leading up to crestel nock lost novamber i release a holcost educational docky saries call hos to nver forgat i ge up with hallcos of iver gran parents a from hungry and ra mania and i grab pa masteris maholife s i've always been educated bout the holicosts not just in school not to from movies but from direct stories from my grandparents and when my zady passed away four years ago at ninety seven i relatched to show a foundation o testimonials and and my grandma is han i was cin nee to do something with this i actually went to poland and filme the whole series i been now for the posse year fighting aunti sematism on my social media in person going around speaking and when everything happened with israel then i have now basically taken over my social media posting about it what is the up takan ance hi semis in te use an been since since october seventh i mean i think that oxtl tstatistic is four hundred persa they say but what is happening on line is something that antisematism has always been here rigt it is always been round but now with the power of social media it is been taken to a whole new level and what is happening on social medias now going into the college canpases is going into high schools even there as a high school teacher that the other day had to be lotked in her room because there were protest to be in high schools i'm seeing it directly to myself on social media but every day were hering about new stories now what is happening in schools and on the streets at restaurans people boy cotting restaurants because they support israel in some cases there even boy hading wre tronce the servics hly food thats happening in fell it elf yeat's totally wild you been doing some amazing act of this to work ou ven you mean with people on on all sides of the political ile to talk that aunti semc is an for folks who do not watch or feed and have not been following what are the kind of stuff that that you 've ben doing yes i've been going to whether it is polet a go going to the my house and speaking about it there or going to different schools or going i just spoke at the rally and d c on which was three hundred thousand people which is in a insane number of people to come together to support israel and to combat aunti sematism and my falling on on social media was not built from my octivism it was built from my dancing from my singing you knave collaborated with people of all walks the life all offenescitese all races to use my social media to be posting about israel we know what is risky some may say but i've felt that if i have the voice and i have the power to may be educate some one to share what is going on i know that is what my grandparents would want mean to do a what they i wish they had a voice back then and with whish the djewish people had a voice back then to be able to a voice what was going on i feel i gets our responsibility now with these platforms to make sure be use them and educate i mean divernentlys a brave thing to take a a social media following that is on completely different topic and sool lit over to something that is insanely serious and really threatening in the world right now i'mnunlucky i i' do a political shell which means that i can just talk about wits going on politically pretty easily my audience can with with me it is it is stuff happening the world but for you to take a a complete image that has been built from doing funstuff the the tam in the dancing no and shift that ord o something deeply sers hal fans reacted to the when i firsted the the hallicos series a year ago i was nervous i was deffllin very nervous i was people follow me to see me be happy to see me dancing in the streets of holli woud boulivard tos see me collabrat wit tarry crewis no one's goin o want me to sit here and do something very dark very serious i mean me going to oshfits have you have ever bee not en something that any one watching i mean no matter what religion you are what race you are it is something that i think everyone should go and experience to see what can really happen am and that is very dark that is very serious i mean i never went everyone was seeing my my natural reaction i was his hystherically crying half the time in the series an you'ryou are walking over mass graves in the series it was risky and i was what if an impacks o one person if one person sees this and is impacted great and honestly the series took off in away that i never expected i really did not expect it and itit really has changed people's views and opinions i've have people rit me saying i was taught to hate jews my whole life and after hearing your story and hearing your grandparent story you have change my mind or people who are not you or sting ye know you have inspired me to want to go learn more about my hisfamily sistery am it is it is been interesting of course there is a lot of the a lot of the hate that has come with it i mean deffuly more hate but there also has been a lot of really positive beautiful things and of come from it jafter doing thats yeris about hollcosh an obviously you mention going up in in home with with hallcost or adle ran apperence whore do you think we stand with the un such mucas im in the world wer i know it is crazy that it is twenty twenty three almost twenty twenty for and we are still here and weare here actualy not still here we are in the place what we have i do not think we have been since the holicost people need to take this more seriously i think that this is why keep saying this is how the hllicost begain because people are not taking this seriously enough and to understand people think all the hallcosts can never happen again but that is why israel is important my mysidy would always tell me how importan the state of israel was because he fell if israel was around that the allcost would never happen nd that is why it is importan that we protect israel ht me stand for israel during this time more than ever and people saying antisin ism is not auntisematism ah it is and it is it is really scary time that were in right now and i cannot believe that we half to prove ourselfes again back in the day my my my saty would tell me stories that he would have friends is entire life and then all the seddimen all the annoncements came out about how terrible the jews were and in all the propaganda friends turned on him sar spitting on him in the streets are to beating him up and and saing you dirty do i mean that is what is happening on social media in you are having conversations with friends that you can even imagine having a year ago you woudhave never imagined having the t kes the conversations with them it is a really scary time were in and that is why it needs to be taken seriously u and to make sure that the never forget never again does not happen again and the denial is mi particularly astonishing a me whent when you look at the amount on social media of people who are just saying none the have ocurred or israels exaggerating what happened or thethe the forty beheaded babies that therefore all the babies are alive or israels lying or all all of this it is boggling to the mine because for those who actually think the truth matters in the facts matter it is pretty evident that for a huge percentage of the population that just is not true the arrative matters a lot more than the fact it makes no sense that at first theyr saying the hostages are not are not that people are in the streets plying down the postairs they revidias o people saying they are not hostages om hosted to take them who kan now we have all the vidias of them the hostages being returned where is your denial in that one oh they do not really murder them they do not re then you have all the foodage that comes out on line every day people are china ii'm involved in all these grieves sat people are begging people to see this foddage i do not want to see that the forty five minute long cause i believe it but the people who are denying it need to watch that foodedge they need to watc that foddage because how can you deny that how can you deny that yeu really is astonishing loyer doing amazing work to mon tanatuckor think you monh for stopping my and thankiu for doing what yofre doing itto bravean and a necessary thing realy breched o thank ee much already folk who reach the end of to day shall we back here to morrow with much more i'm benspure thi sis the venchbereau show

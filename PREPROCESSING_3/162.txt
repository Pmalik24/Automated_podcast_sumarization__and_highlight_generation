aw quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the shou if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websight this american life doto work from w b easy chicago it is this american life i'm shon coal sitting in forire glass late last year i got some not great health news that kinna scared the helt o me basicaly i was diagnost with mild emphasima lung disease and too with their calling small benine noduls one on each lung it is i scar tissue i'm trying to focus on the words mild small and benin the cause was not mysterious i'd been a daily cigarette smoker for about thirty five years i's to be a pack a day when i was younger sometimes more i'd cut it down to maybe a half or a third of that later on and i'd been meaning to quit for a long time but i just never tried to not really and now it felt i had no thoice which before i tel you what happen next i feer i should explain what a huge change that was going to be i was say i started smoking when i was fifteen and started an haling when i was sixteen partly i just wanted to be the people in the british teev dramas i was watching on p b s pulling these perfect little white cylinders out of silver cases that snap shut i remember i painted an empty metal bandaed container light blue and kept my salo menthals in there puffing at them in my parents drive way and my thirties in forties i was the guy in the frind group that i ways had cigarettes i'd smoke during the shortest of walks from this office to the hotel bar across the street i'd smoke after a ten mil training run for a half marithon you smok ing your car some one would ask and i'd say yes what i bought it whenevber i imagined myself stranded in the woods or on a life raft in te middle of the ocean the panic i felt was about not having nough cigarettes with me the prospect of stopping for good always felt trying to strand myself on purpos everything in me opposed it the emphysema diagnosis was an early november i figured i'd put off quitting till after christmas when i did not have to work for a bit whenever i went too long without smoking my cognition would slow down to where i could barely think december twenty eighth i'll stop i told myself and started practically counting down the cigarettes i recorded voice my mus though al this this one's from december twenty first a week before quitting day this is one of the lass times i wi'll be sitting here smoking out the window looking at the world trade tower and then i guess going forwird al just sit here and a i know thank her something this is how much of a smoker i was i didn' you realize that when you do not smoke you do not af to go and sit by the window but the thing i'm really here to tell you about is how i was planning to quit i was going to read a book kind of thee book for people in my situation it is called allan car's easy way to stop smoking you might have heard of it it is sold millions millins of copies pretty famous ot a famous people read it and then cell about it on telovision james spaters of pan it was easy it was perfect and it was all because of thi book ellan to generous the easy way to stop smoking allan carroat and everybody who reads the book stop an and i stop and sto at i wi as i had ashton cutcher grea ting is fon youre reading the book yit to smoke wi to y in i ok yous li ii i fi to b telling point he insists you heep smoking while you are reading the book and then when you finishe it you stop my method is known as easy boy this is alancar recorded back in two thousand five and it will ennal any smoker to quit immediately promanently and actually enjoy the proces before you dismissed my plams bear in mind that i've been proving them for over twenty years that is wy my book goo netwok of plinics a successful this book is the only thing that is ever given me a shred of hopefulness about stopping smoking it literally always felt impossible in the past and ow here is thesguy saying that not only would i be able to do it but actually be happy about it that is the true measure of success alan car says not just stopping but becoming a happy non smoker could not imagin being happy not smoking i could not imagine that a bunch of words could get some one to stop feeling and incredibly strong urge that words alone could make something that seem impossible lictually happen what type of whichery was afoot here in this book and all the stories in to days show er about that people kind of casting spells to try to make people completely change their directions in life in some way o and you get to listen to me try to quit smoking stay with us act one the straw that broke jok camels back racon not sure about that tuttle there is a couple of others here that we act one can i still be a joker and a midnight toker wer is when act one the unbearable lighter lessness of being anyway the book is relatively short and really really repetted it he says you have to follow every instruction to the letter and the wy it works car says most people who try to convince you not to smoke will tell you the reasons you should ent howth risks all the money you spend whatever but he says smokers already know all of that if any of that actually worked alancar says you would o quit by now now whut he does not stead is the opposite he names all of the reasons you give for smoking all the things you about it or think it is offering you and he carefully explains why every one of those reasons is bokus he describes it as a kind of deprogramming altimately removing any desire for a cigarett and a lot of the precepts make a lot of sense for instance he says smokers belive that smoking helps them focus and concentrate but he says the're just kitting themselves that is just an illusion all smoking does is remove the distraction of nikotine withdraw you only think it is helping you think better there tinds of fallacies that he says and smokers perpetuate them without even realizing it is is fo brook says smokers claim that the cigarette relaxes them and helps them to handle strussful situations but they also claim that it helps them get going in the morning and that it gives them a boost how can a drug that relaxes you or relieve stress also stimulate you this contradiction illustrates the truth about smoking the cigarette just does not do any of the things we tell our selfs at dos i should say he distinguishs easy way from just going hold turkey or what he calls the will power methot those poor souls are not real non smotkers he says tere jus smokers who are not letting themself smoke what kind of life is that whereas if you have no desire to smoke any more you do not need will power you also will not be irritable were depress or gain wait wore any of the things that according to most people make quitting hard also the reporteds accesserate for will power alone is really low it depends on do you ask but it might be as low as three to five per cent cutting down does not work alancar says caus it just makes every cigarette seem that much more precious it iswhy says to just smok as you normally would while you read the book also you really wants you to sit with it how is the taste what is it really feel going down into your lungs and do not even get him started on nickotine replacement therapy patch is the gum all that steff thats is ging to keep you wanting cigarettes he get into arguments on this point this one on sky t v with some one from a smoking cessation charity itit is not nicketan re place thoroy it is nicketin maour ace given

never had any training in psychology or medicin he says one day he just realized what a consmoking is and took things from there start of working with individual clients in the early eighties and group seminars tan the book and altimately in organization that operates in more than fifty countries around the world for my money his cred was even better than that of a therapistor psychiatris he was a smoker for bout as long as i was and much heavier sometimes a hundred cigarettes a day ye traied to quit a lot of times before hitting upon his method at which mon he just stopped on a dime if only he figure to doutway sooner alancar died of longcants er an two thousand sex he had not been a smoker for about twenty years i fo tis growing excitement as i read the book i was tarting to beat out my fuare of pitting it one point i wrote in a note book alancar is write about the taste it is foul smoke felt bad going down my lungs i think my thinking about smoking has genuinely changed the night before my final day of smoking i felt a kid on christmas eve eve sort of thrilled and wishing the day would just hurry up and get here already alancar said this might happen the next night the sumber twenty seventh i smoke my final cigarette sort of ritual built into the process for sommers at i wanted to be outside walking the neighborhood i smoked it may be faster than any cigarett ever knocked the burning ember off the but threw it in somebody is trash can and said out loud good by cigarettes and when i woke up the next day i wanted to cigarette more than i ever remember wanting one first thing in the morning which is not what the book says as suppose to happen no what i did or did not do or what exactly went wrong but suddenly the way felt anything but easy in the book over and over again alancar says some version of the actual physical with drawal from nickotin is a very mild slightly empty in secure feeling it is mild that most smokersdone even notice it throughout their smoking lives i've also heard that the physical withdrawal only lasts three days or is it a week or is it three weeks and after that it is merely psychological i've heard the individual cravings last anywhere from three to five minutes and than they pass all i can say is in my exsperience all of this is utter horseshit i do not even understand the concept of individual cravings my case with drawl has meant a constant crazed yearning that varies in tolerability throughout the day this is how hi described it a couple of weeks in it is a world wide ich all of my limbs are phantom limbs is swallowed a live animal much larger than me that promptly died and now i have to walk around with it inside of me soul and all or it is opening all these awful little packages in which there is something i cannot see that painfully stings me and there is no telling how many more i have to open nor for how long it is the thing i'm thinking about more than any other thing and more than all of the other things this swas on january thirteenthoke ive had of susneks and nothing makes it better literally nothing makes it better everything makes everything that i do in stead of smoking makes me want o smoke more this is the worst day that of the non smoking that there is been far they what is it were now going into day seventeen ah now i i do notno they are hard they are all hard the thing about thinking something is going to be easy is that when it is ultimately not it makes it that much harder yef i cannot do it i must be an idiot then thinking back on some of the passages in the book i felt gaslit my lived experience was being question this is alancar in a british takshows sometime in the early ots we told about these terrible withdroll your sight is rot wll waitet it at yu wy it show me i can say exactly where january eighteenth three weeks in i had this attack i was on the corner in my neighborhood trying to decide we there would go home go to the bar just the bar and my brain wass i were walking about i'm for a cigarette ha and i said no we do not do that any more and my brain was you mean itsittime for a cigarette i said no it is not and then it is i was physically punched in the solar plexes with something electric that sent a shock up through my face and has i screams crazyin i liin turned wocking is tis hoc hoh got well it better get better at some poin it got worse i've gained wait been drinking more i when a month with no nikotine at all and then gave in and started having a nikotine lowsane here and there i have but to a day now which naturally made me relitigate everything dalancar had said else made me wonder why was not this working for me if it works for many people i start looking for answers and i stumbled across this pogcast that was way more revolatory to me about my addiction than anything in the book welcome to the hubor man lo oncan n cu science science pac toine frein n li you might be familiar with anterhummandhe is kind of a nero science rockstar now go as a lab it stampord school of medicines yet where he researches narrow biology an optomology s i do not pirsprid apart from that he is made it a personal mission to explain how your brain and body work you can may be make thetter choices or yo dr and he has an episode on nickotine which made me feel some one had put their hand on my shoulder looked me in the eye yo and said you he sir yet are not insane the only bases again salancar central premise is that all the thing smokers about smoking iin relaxes us and focases us and gives us a boose carsays that the only thing were feeling is just the withdrawal going away but according to hubourman that is not true at all scientists have been studying the brain chemistry of this for years decades and just to be superbreviated about it here poncestis two hours long nikotin juses up your brain with these three chemicals dopemin you'l bebhard of dopemin w people think it causes pleasure but it is also the thing that makes you want pleasure stri it motivates you ticular makes you goud strive pursue i a seet o coling which i syoua never heard us release eps you fokus im up with ideas sells plus sthis is werd you have a seet to colling receptors on your muscles too which huborman says could explain why some people feel more physically relaxed on nikotinen vortue after nefferen and then apaneferand which you could just call a grenalin when alancar says the nikotine itself does not give you a boost it gives you a boost thi you mow and when you put all of that together we now have a very clear picture reward pathways are turned on attention is turned on alertness is turned on you feel better than you felt a few minutes ago you are blood pressure is up your heartrate is up you are preparedness for thinking is elevated is well and yet your body is somewhat relaxed that is a very interesting state of mind and body interestin because it is somewhat ideal for cognitive work if you are going to sit down and work on a book were you going to sit down and trying figure out a hard masth problem ore you going to write a letter that is been really challenging you for you to write or maybe that you'r really excited to write but that you have been ou kno slow to get out the door for whatever reason here i'm talking about my own habits of precostination that state of being very alert but your body being relaxed is almost if not the optimal state for getting mental workd on we are turing but one molecule nicotine found in plants thik to matoes and potatoes and the tobacco plant one molecule that can trigger activation of all the circuits for focus and motivation in one fell that is romar when i gotn't touch with huvermen and we sat down for conversation he said the stuff was obvious to him the first time he smoke o cigarette his fourtin same timehe had his first cup of black coffee i though that i was about as good as it guests until i took it my first drag off a cigarette and then i realize to wow wow wow nicotine just make s everything look a little different if youl focuse and relaxed i mean that at's a very hard combo for most people do just drop themselves into unfortunately niccotine also has a lot of harmful side effects can stricts blood flow and cause hart problems and just to say the whole second half of the podcast is about how in credibly bad tobacco is for you fuberman does not smoke any more ere use any kind of niccotin i ran him through some of alancars claims about niccotin and he did give me is take on them although warily i have to be careful because i do not want to discourage any one from using a resource this book that could help them move away from un unhealthy practise sir a jert i do not wan to under mind his his efforts cause i think that the effort is a noble and important one but he says alancar's right that you can get dependent on nicotine that you do not derive any benefit any more and justsmoke you can feel normal that can appen with any addictive drete rbut he says there are tons of studies supporting the idea that nicotin helps with focus tresses n and now it does not curbyou stress but it might make you better able to handle strest is s caus you'r more keit up ind vigilan if the central premise of the book his flod and nicotin can do all of these enjoyable useful things why do you think if you were to conjecture wid this sisdam that did not work for me per say work for many peopal a man you now i jus thingin about that i i think i know why from a nurba en i look at everything through the lends of biology r much to the discomfort of peoplomost to me a mi can say that the book did a very interesting thing i have to give him credit what he did is he tried to by pass all the deeper biology of dopoming a seat of coline a diction et cetera and what he did was he said you have got a forebrain your forebrain can tell itself stories by telling itself stories you can set contect let us tell yourself a story and the story is thist withdrawal does not really exist or it exis but nicotine's ot that bai ologaven nicotine does not really exist yand when you feel on comfortable that is you knowther words he used the lack of knowledge about the way it really works in the reader to trick the reader into tricking themselves in to by passing what would but se shul be a much more complicated process now for some people and apparently celebrities it worked for them but what if i came along with just the tiniest bit of knowledge to the contrary or what if some one you has it an experience to the contrary well then bam you are right back in square one i guess it just does not work for me or theres something wrong with me something wrong with me that is what i'd been feeling and that is sort of endemic to the method if it does not work it is cause you did not follow all the instructions readn't understand part of it read it again or callus or attend the live seminar in one addition of the book alancar writes that if you are thinking i'm still craving cigarettes after reading it than quote you are being very stupit how can you claim i wnt to be a non smoker and then say i want o cigarette that is a contradiction if you say i want to cigarette you are saying i want to be a smoker non smokers do not want to smoke cigarettes you already know what you really want to be stop punishing yourself having this information knowing what nikotin was and h is no longer doing to me was comforting as i was it is not in my imagination i wish i'd known all this before i'd stubbed that i'd had more of a map of the landscape instead of just pretending i was not even on the continent an this was march therty first the day after i talked with humerment sthree months in been trying to get test for no ten or fifteen it everything's just a little bit harder since i stup smoking slower i'm slower and all forget i mean that supposedly it is good for nicotin is good for working memory meaning we why why did i come into the kitchen again o ye ah nd tend iven do iv no working memory any more and it takes me for ever to do simple things and they are not ass that is not the word for getting dressed but they are not it is it' just feels everything feels a little be lok at sure ness thereve been lots of new stories about alancar's easy way he was interview to ton in the uquet when he was alive and the people took over the organization after him than a lot of press but looking high and low i had not seen anyone question the scientific accuracy of the method even though most of the biology humorman talks about has been known for a little while ither i'm missing something which happens alve where nobody's ever raised this pahticular issue with them before soyou will be thiny i did exonis cont i sat down with johndikin alancar's successor he is the globalci o an senior facilitator of easy way now he also took the seminar himself to quiksmoking and says he was enthralled by how well it workd t that he iquot on't quote hastled and haranged alancar to let him get involved they but id head sometimes or ois but john really considers car to be a genius i asked him if they would never talked about brain chemistry when car was alive he said they had although he was not really interested in beson sit you must not know i think he not mo really rean gesays sone of things a i reallything as much i to bring to the sie with im mygsad gen you now we talk to bes he would say that he was the world's leading expert on quitting smokang e i you smiling and i at m he he would ent sort of as the world's leading expert in quitigs for self professo worlds leading expert in quitting smokang be be necessarily curious about that staff you ofthing is busy doing other thing wa iin terms of i the easy way method im mus not be in a pots of he is fifteen or sixteen ther re a dictions rishes there is the easy way to stop drinking the easy way w e ing h to lose weight i's one about being addicted toyour fond lots of things i should say an updated version of the book different from the one i read addresses brain science for the first time but it is very selective and it still claims nobody's ever had any pleasure or benefit from nicketine i started taking john dicy through what i'd leane from interhubour men thee research that contradicts fets in the book and that my help explain why for lot of people it is not going to be easy to walk away from smoking when the book says that it that it doesnan't physically ad and concentration just scientifically it does ate and consent sion an e ron you think he is wrong i do not think he r o knowhis rom he is a nerrow biolodgy o o care ward i meanit not be disrespect for yet he know sure he has a theory hes is e as on eun i mean it is based on oshould bis just wrong s ommany levels anam i'm struggling wats tam why is a desperation to prove or i believe the nicketine does something when it does not youmeve huts much nonsense in my life i'm sorry you very noce gm sure surele believes what he saing but is absolute nonsense i think that is where we are mis understand each othe beus i'm not loking for positives of nicketing ou i was just looking for it wha what is the mechanism i was just looking for wht its a mechanism and when i learned about the different nouro chemicals that that nicetine e voks in the brain an it just felt that the method was pradicated on a line that ly ou itinlres you would you tight nickotine for the rest of your life now although and o no i one ot well it was not my plan it was not my plan because i is not yo plan why is not you planif es give me these tremendous benefits u strugglewithout it why why would you just tike you restyo life i think because there are health dattrmens ther nothing things got spicy li with john dicy os you get older he you mell me more than once weeks after the fact to say he was still realing from the interview again does not understand why anyone would push back at the allancar easy way method anothe we have only ever done good in the world he said wese that is kicking a cat and why would any one ever suggest there was a benefit to nicketin ither than may be the tobacco companies a big farme if it was true i could almost live with that if nicketing did make it easy for people to comeo trite non nicketinatics to concentran i could live with that andd i when o o genuine interest to look at the studies you look tat if the wore fonpotous to it a serny it nowledge that but but there on th it is just i guess how can you say there are not when you say that you have not looked at the science when that that it is just not an and that is fine that it is not interesting to you but when it is not interesting to you and you have not really rout about it and allantond really read about it and how that nd how can you say it is not tri just e ser relevan is not it i don i want to a i would not wone t spend too much time discussing whether the moons maght out chese pretty sto no mi i think the heis hugy dangeous to talk about you no a there migt be a benefits to nicketin ut is just simpply not true i's unfortune of the book tin work fr you already sorry about that and i a wish you would reached out i hop or the time a because it 's maf to be this compicate it ready dos' im reapsyou smoking and o what as you can beyu te promocit after the hayou im ou a if you think besunderstanding this help you continue smoking ust br but u welt thank you for asking i am i think i mo said basically th then johndicy says the organization does not make any claims about the successorate of the book for any measurable success they always point tof the seminare they give which alancar always said was about ninety per cent effective he base that figure on only about ten per cent of seminar goers taking advantage of the money back guarantee in order to get your money back you have to do the session two additional times for free anyway the companies backed off from that claim in recent years the seminar was put through a couple of randomized controlled trials where it was pitted against methods that offer both behaviourall support anformacology nickotin replace ment that kind of thing the more recent and bigger of those studies found that nineteen per cent af the alancar people were still quit after six months virs is fifteen per cent of the other group the margin of air that basically means there on par though ninetein per cent success still means that the method did not work for four out of five people in the study johndicy told me he does not thing those studies ore a good reflection of what the results are out in the real world an literally ilooking through my kitchen window watching police officers smoke on the fire escape of the precinct this is four months in iu kno kind of wherever you look wherever ye smell there it is a your past it is you broke up with some one who is horrible for you and than you leave your apartment and that persen is in every street coirner wafting their perfume at you which was and remains intoxicating literally and then you go back to the confines of your apartment and you look out the window and there they are blowing kisses at a brick wall now i cannot tell whether i am talking about the metaphor were the physical reality actually may have stumbled into a really good though kind of worrying explanation as to why i'm not in the per centile whatever it is of alancar's successtories i talked with a prominent psychiatrist who ise had patients that use the method she is familiar with the book her names anna lempki she runs the addiction medicine duel diagnosis clininc at standford chelso wht a book called dopemi nation which is where i leand that niccotine increases dopamin levels by one hundred fifty per cent which is fifty per cent more than sects i calld her to talk science but our conversation became a little a therapecession at some points i told her this this thing that happens in the shower when i first turn the water cold at the end makes you feel god after not during and weardly i do not just crave a cigarette right at that moment it is this very specific sensation i'm taking a big wif from a glass ash tray that it just emptied but have not washed out yet it is not grose feeling it is a wanting feeling liggrets is it happen immediately when you turn the clook feel first feel the pain of the cold water yes o case of that is very interesting there am there is a whole famous series of experiments shou told me there were these studies done where they would take a rotint and get it addicted to some drug by letting it press a lever over and over again to receive that drug but thend if you take the drug out of the equation it will venely stop itting thebuten cause wit is the point ndthen it wanders off to do other things in the cage to amuse itself however if then you take that same animal and you expose it to a painful footshock the animal will immediately run over to the lever and wildly start pressing in esly to ye is not interesting i suspect that that is what is happening to you that by having cold water am showers what you'r doing is your shocking your body with a painful stimulus which is then triggering your automatic neurlogical safety and compensitory mechanism which is to smoke a cigarett well that is wild well ye ye in other words in you have created in a laborate neurological circuit a round smoking an even months after you have stopped smoking that neurological circuit is still healthy and firing away in response to significance tressers people talk about the the physical addiction to nicotine and the psychological addiction ton icotine that that sounds physical to me that i mean tit is o ye it is very physical wall this time i'd been focussing on the damage that smoking had done to my lungs thirty five years worth of damage i somehow had not thought in terms of doing that amount of damage to my brain to that will take a long time to repair and alemp ye told me especially given my age i brain is not as plastic as it once was and there is another school of thought she said more depressing one which wonders whether the damage could be far gone i cannot repair it it will always be in the ind of state of perpetual neurological withdrowll which might require some kind of intervention and in your case that might look something nicotine replacement therapees for life potentially or life i what what is that for life ye for life and potentially at higher doses than what youre curently taking well ye we used to use nicotine replacement thereape just to help people quit but more and more were now using them in the mainnence fase where people are just using them four years to decades and again the thinking there is that well the ideal is that with sustained absinence your brain would heal and you would return to whatever your presmoking baseline was but in reality what we see is that some people do not get to that place and that they man meed some form of nicotine to feel and function o cay i'm going forward indefinitely wel it is possible that i've brokn my my brain sort of my my myt open mean receptors to the point where they are just not gune a returned a normal kind of ye i mean that that is that is possible i mate i do not to ou say that your brain is brokn but i guess just to think about it little differently just could be that you no longer have the brain plasticity to completely reverse the changes i had to listen back to that part of the interview a few times to fully feel the bomdrop of it i know it is not an official diagnosis or anything even an unofficial one and when a over react but the impact is something when i learned i have lung disease permanent brainchanges and lack of plasticity makes me think of aging which makes me think of dying nicotine replacement for life for the rest of my life how long is thatcon to me and still yeven a sessing all of that damage knowing all the havoc that smoking has reked on my body still i wish there was some tomenshon in which i could keep doing it youre wondering it is now been seven months and i still ovin smoked a cigarett every now and ten i was wake up to it all over again still mon doing to talking with analempki confirmed this idea that had been pecking at me since i first fread the book alancar says there is only one kind of smoker and that any smoker can find it easy to quit but i talk wit a lot of people who tried the method folks at both worked foreign did it just think there is differen kinds of smokers i thin there is a certain kind of smoker me for whom there is a s lot of anger lerking in it it is every hour or a couple of hours we climb up to the roof and fling ourselves off of it as a petulant fucku to being alive after all we started doing this thing when we were kids i fifteen sixteen wone of there' such a delictious nialism to it for some of us 's my fifteen year old fingers were still lifting the cigarette up to my fifty one year old lips i cannot think of a lot of other behaviears that are not associated with survival it is even the opposic of survival that i did every day for that long there is a line in one of the additions of the book i have where alancar writes if health happiness and freedom are not enough to inspire you then you have bigger problems than smoking i underline that passage and in the margin i wrote this is possib or na coming up when you wish you knew how and whether to quit some one and then you receive possibly the most well articulated relationship advice of all time that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programme continues this american life i'm shon col sitting in for ire glass today's programme i cannot quit you baby stories of being on the verge of a big change not wanting to let go and the people who give you that final push we now present act two of our programm act too a spoon full of sugar wen we are puttin together this wek show one of the other producers here thought of this advice colum she read years ago where the person writing and was not sure if they should quit a relationship or not it was the column sheral strade used to do called dear sugar heare's the letter dear sugar i'm in my early twenties i've been in a serious relationship with the same guye for six years on and off the off portion taking place when i was younger i have been very distracted and have been second guessing the relationship for a while now but i cannot come to grips with losing this person that seems to be right for me permanently of course that i want o break is hart then again i do not want a settle and have regrets later in live i feel we want different things out of life and we have different interests but i just cannot aside i've talkd to him about my feelings for the record but o no avail we went on this little break but god nows breaks never work basically my biggest fears being alone and never finding any one that measures up it does not help that my closest friends are settling down with their boy friends an her talking about marriage cringe honestly i feelic marriage and that kind of commitment represents a loss of personal identity mot her why but i would love your advice sugar please helpe sincerely sceared and confused here is surel strat reading her respont dearest scared an confused i lived in london when i was twenty i was technically homeless and desperately broke but i did not have the papers and american needs to get a job in london i spent most of my time walking the streets searching for coins that people a dropt one day when i was searching for coins a man on a business suit o croachd and asked me if i wanted and under the table job three days a week and a major accounting firm that has since collapsed duto corruption sure i said and this is how i became coffee girl one too three coffee girl was my actual job title the one two three was stacked on to communicate the fact that i was responsible for providing coffee and tea to all the accountance and secretaries who worked on the first three floors of the building it was a harder job than you might think coffee girl mand would call as i passed them with my tray often snapping their fingers to draw my attention their way i wore a black skirt over white tights and black fest over a white shirt and i was almost always out o breath bannd from the elevator i had to race up and down staps in a starewell that ran along the back of the building to get from one floor to the next that starewell was my sanctuary the only place where nobody snap their fingers and called me coffee girl during my braks i'd walk down to the first floor and go outside and sit on the patch of concrete that edged the building that hows the major accounting firm that is since collapsed due to corruption one day while i was sitting there and old woman came along and asked me where an america i was from i told her and she said that years befor she would visited the place in america where i'm from we had a nice conversation and each day after that she came along during the time when i was sitting on the patch of concrete and we talked she was not the only person who came to talk to me i was in love with some one at the time in fact i was married to that some one and i was in way over my head at night after i made love to this man i would lie beside him and cry because i knew that i loved him but that i could not bear to stay with him because i was not ready to love only one person yet and i knew that if i left him i would die of a broken heart nd i would kill him of a broken heart too and it would be over for me when it came to love because there would never be another person who i'd love as much as i loved him o who loved me as much as he loved me or who was as sweet and sexy and cool and compassionate and good through and throug i stayed we looked for coins on the streets of london together and sometimes he would come and visit me at the major accounting firm that is since collapsed tu to corruption while i was on my breaks one day he came while the old woman was there the man i love and the old woman had never come at the same time but i had told him about her and i had told her about him too is this your husband the old woman exclaimed with jubulant recognition when he walked up she shook his hand with both of her hands and they chatted for a few minutes and then she laughed the man i loved was silent for a good while giving the old woman time to walk away and then he looked at me and said was some astonishment she has a bundle on her head she has a bundle on her head i said she has a bundle on her head he said back and then we laughed and laughed and laughed hard it might to this day still be the time i laughed the hardest he was right he was right that old woman all that time all through the conversations we would had as i sat on the concrete patc had had an enormous bundle on her head she appeared perfectly normal in every way but this one she wore an impossible threefoot tower of ratty old rags and ripped up blankets and towels on top of her head held there by a conplicated system of ropes tied beneath her chin and fastened a loops on the shoulders of her raincoat it was a bizaar sight but in all my conversations with my husband about the old woman i'd never mentioned it she has a bundle on her head we shrieked to each other through our laughter on the patch of concret that day but before long i was not laughing any more i was crying i cried and cried and cried as hard as thad laughed i cried hard i did not go back to work my job is coffee girl one to three anded right then and there why are you crying asked my husband as he held me because i'm hungry i said but it was not true it was true that i was hungry during that time we never had enough money or enough food but it was not the reason i was crying i was crying because there was a bundle on the old woman's head and i had not been able to say that there was and because i knew that that was somehow connected to the fact that i did not want to stay with the man i loved any more but i could not bring myself to acknowledge what was very obvious and very true that was such a long time ago scared and confused but it all came back when i read your letter it made me think that perhaps that moment delivered me here to say this to you you have a bundle on your head sweet pee and though that bundle may be impossible for you to see right now it is entirely visible to me you are not torn you are only just afraid you no longer wished to be in a relationship with your lover even though he is a great guy fear of being a lone is not a good reason to stay leaving this man you have been with for six years will not be easy but you will beoke and will he the end of your relationship with him will likely also mark the end of an era of your light in moving into this next era there are going to be things you lose and things you gain trust yourself it sugars golden rule trusting yourself means living out what you already know to be true yours sugar cwhen thet pretty she rute it up wi the wek we story meeting some one else said that she had read the same column and that it was what made her decide to divorce her husband thot the same thing heaven with the front of hers read the column left the relationship this won am talking about but a conspell being cast sell told us that of all of the thousands of letters she is goten in the thirteen years she said the column this is the most common predicament people fund themselves in all over the world people are wondering is a time to get out something a third of all of her letter writers ask fer this quaskedion an adaptation of some of shail strate's columsis now streaming on wholo it is called tiny beautiful things our audioversion of this column was produced by diam wo act three tender resignation some times of words that convinced im one to quit a thing are not advice arn't supportiv but ther just is effective in getting you to let go maybe more this next storyis a case that ands from producers ta wa chase to start this next quitting story i have to take you back a few months to november twenty twenty to election nate we ran a story about an election administrator nots of people with that job of quit in the last few years because of harassmen and death threats from people who believe the last election or last elections fer stolen ot this guy not hyder garsea intarrent county texas home of fortworth he would never d be driven out by conspiracy theoris in fact he would figured out it seemed this rare way to work with them to invite them in there was one example during one election one of the act of his came in to where the votes are tallied and this activis was if i were in charge i would make the walls glass you could see the election matines and where every cable goes heyder was oque i hear you i told him what about if we re arrange a room the machies are not in this little cabinet under the desk but up where you can see them an you c sot whatt maybe that would be a stort the next election that came back in a runnolfs one do walk the room i told him all the machines are on top of the tables you can see the backter against the glaster label what each one of them does this is what you wanted right and he had that moment of oquet will you got me on that one and it is little things that that we keep doing right heyder gave out his telephone to any one who wanted it there is this one act iv is in particular aubry camble she had this channel on telegram about election frid stuff nd she posted about hyder a lat and she called him all the time she called him on election din ata ea art o aaa at all a sar he outing is a not get a tha a jus a ayes at it the ma e yo look theu wat it is le thabegrit ya he an aubrey had built up a real relationship even though they did not agree on anything she came by an election mate to hang out and watch everything and ask more questions really seemed to me nothing could deter him from this job the reporter who brought us hyder's story natalia contraris she talks about heyders ratical patients with the election conspiracis whused to fill his office an election administrators in the rest o the country look to heyder as a model for transparency openness efficiency the secretary of state of texhis fact the not a democrat avery conservative guy said an italia last year if you were building a proto type for an elections administrator you would just copy heyder garsia but an april sixteenth twenty twenty three hyder released a letter it begins gentlemen please accept this letter as my formal resignation from the position as election administrator for tarent county five months after we ran that story heyder had quit t some people in the county were pretty upset the spoke up at this public meeting one of the people was obry voter fraud activist was always questioning him o a sho a ie asin he sin oin wor he wit tin he is trans tan y n in tat a it is alos ais n hes o he isnce he is more bot i in cera ta i e in m mos te ais a ithing i ei sai men for than ne ment or firt er coney but what happens hiter would not talk about it for this story citing his new job he is on this federal election ad visory committee now but here is what we figured out an a lot of this is based on a talias reporting for vote beat it actually all started the night we were down there election mate one of the elections hyter was overseen was for who would be his new boss i position called county judge the guye would be in charge of terent county the winner was a man named tim ohar he heavily featured election fraud issues in his campaign claiming that voter fraud his rampint it is not that the twenty twenty election was possibly stolen from trunp it was not hiter had dealt with scores of elections keptics but now one was his boss one o the first things timohar did when he got into office a few months ago was set up an election integrity task force ee promise during his campaign to investigate election crimes there was a big press conference we curge every one to report actions that they have concerns about whether its at the voting boot whether is hyiter was not consulted about the task force andwhen the task forse was announced he was not there reporter asked if hyiter was part ofthe task force the tas forst is made up of investigators and deputis he is a full expectim to cooperat with it but he is not part of the task force for son i sworth mentioning even if you believed there is a major problem it votofraud which lots of officials in texas doe terrent county got a special shout out in the big twenty twenty election at at the texas dit for running its election smoothly a quot quolity trans parent election that was hyter the election integrity task force was one thing they also fought over the budget one he had been approved for hider to buy an expensive attachment for a mail sorting machin but o har would not vote to release the funds for it there was an awkward back and forth at a public meeting with o har questioning him why was this necessary is there is ter shome other way that is going to save money becaus that is not saving money no no theter this is not inves ment to save money its is an ivestmen to may ce le jo o sa earlier the son wa sav money no not i send bat a doving dingdoi can come up with a number to sigmenyit whet never dot a get a undre tifty dosen dollars back a ner one that that is not what i brtit its an vestment in a cleaner smollder more officient uperation but is not a case to save mone that this is a total wish oce this was a real change for hyter the golden boy of texas elections to certain degree what made terent county election secure efficient and transperen was the pricy election equipment hider was accustomed to getting his request approved hidter's previous boss a republicin once told vote beat if garcea tells us he need something than were going to get it for him around this time hyter and timohar met in his office where things clearly did not go well hiter mentioned it at the end of his resignation letter it ends judgeo hare my formula to administer a quality transparent election stands on respect and zero politics compromising on those values is not anoption for men you made it clear in our last meeting that your formula is different this my decision to leave i wish you the best terrent county deserves that you find success i reached out to timoher he did not respond but one thing that came out later on a radio show that o hair was on was he did not the way hyder talk to reporters at all that seems a central problem he had with hyder he said some one had given him a public records requests of hyder's communications and he did not when he saw in his tex with the press funny thas my favorite thing about heyder it was one guy that got hyder to go after dealing with countless voter fraud act of this over the years hyder and timohar had a meeting and then hyder quit or you could say was more than one guy o her had been put an offis by the voters and an election that hyder ad made sure was far hyder's last day was friday may nineteenth abry gave hyder a copy of the federalist papers she inscribed it thank you for your assistance with my current understanding of texas election proceedurs please take time to relax and i hope you enjoyed perusing these early writings of the founding fathers when we drove away from hyder's office that election night and twenty twenty two i felt we had witness this little scene that could be a model for how election's offices could be in the election conspiracy era were the administrator is in the sceptics would be able to if not agree at least co exist through elections hyder running around making sure's workers were gettng what they

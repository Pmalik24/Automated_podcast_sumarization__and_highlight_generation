donald trump is the presumptive republican nominate i know it is early i know it is the day after the iowa cawcases but let us face facts here folks donald trump is far out ahead of the rest of the field that no one else has a plausible shot at the nomination that was confirmed last night in the iwa cawcases when donald trumpet broke fifty per cent and none of the other candidates was able to break twenty two per cent that is an insurmountable lead for zonald trump in these primaries last night the ia cawcaes opend at seven p m local time and by seven thirty every major outlet was calling the iwa cawcses for donal trump nows bry controversal this controversial because the restill people who not only had voted they hadingben started the speech making process the way the coc's work on the republican side as the people show up in these local locations and all various candidates have their surgate to come and make speeches and then everybody votes the reason that all of these outlets were able to make this call early is because of course the polling data in froms o entrance pulling showed trump far out ahead that there was no plausible challenger not a lot of questions as to whether these outlets should have done that because after all literally zero votes had been counted had the one at which all of tese projections were made and tere 's lot of question from the disancis campat from the hailey camp about whether that affected what was going on inside the actual caucas calls that there are people whoere checking their phonesing the fox news for example had called the race and simply side ocawall i'm here anyway a mazels vote for the guy who an mazwall vote for trump here is what it sounded when all of these veryus outlets called the race extremely early seen it projects the donal trump willwin the iowa cawcases san in can make this projectin base dunk is overwhelming wead in our entrance poll of iwer cawcas goers and some initial votes thet ar coming in the former present pulling off a huge early victory in is bood to return through the white cou trm ci to e e eny anty thini ne nal pe ta a this hour at eight thrty three t te thre three ta co t thre threny toe thre th tae ci that con o then donnal t to well tity te thi wen inthe il caka ti n ten t o pese tha tal alacxan thobasto in the first firsalt an our foxis voter and alxis the foxins decision dath can out projact that former president donald tro twell wan te iowa cawcas that you the oe ir o the tix foorty deleganst this result really solidivixe his place has the co cro roner thror the nomination now agen many of the other candidates were crying foul at this point not because trump was not going to win he was but because they said that the may of shifted the margin o victory the associated press for example has a policy hat they will not call the winter of race before all the poles ind jurisdiction are schedual to close petty much all of them called not only before the poles were scedual to close but before some of the poleshad had even open now was that going to change the trojectory or the shape of this race i have very serious doubts that that is the case the final results in iowa again donald trump fifty one per cent followed by governor r n to santus of florida the got i would ha voted for in the primaries at twenty one per cent followed by former south carolina governor and you an ambassador n nikee hailey at nineteen per cent maybe t would shifted things at the margins o couple of percentage points either way it was not going to detract from donal trumps massive blow out victory the reason for donald trumps massive blow out victory is pretty simple republican voter see donal trump is the incumbent it is that simple he is being treated as the incumbent and he performed likean incumbent woold in and iwall cawcas if jobidon were actually running in and iwall cawcas this year if there were some sort of caucas process in i with this year you ould expect that jobidon would receive somewhere between sixty and seventy per cent of the vote and that a couple challengers might peel off ten per cent here and there that is essentially how the poles have been playing for donald trump in iowa basically since july of this year the truth is that whatever vulnerability donald trump had as a candidate it began in january of twenty twenty three and it ended by basically march of twenty twenty threy in january twenty twenty three donald trump was widely perceived by the republican bas as a person who caused republicans to lose because the twenty twenty to elections but really poorly and what you saw is tha if you go all the way back to the beginning of the year what you see is that donald trump had nan advantage over on to santis but not much of one nationally speaking desantus was perceived as a winner because yet a blow out victory here in florda and donal trump was perceived as a person who caused other candidates to lose because he had had a bunch of senate candidates who lost going all the way back to twenty twenty when he promoted the loss of two separate republican senators in georgia but the sanciton trumpin fast enough no one redo find trump as the loser and what trump did smart politics he kept clamming that he was the actual winner of the twenty twenty election by exipulling in republicans believe him the people who voted the iwall cawcas is seventy per cent belief that he actually one the twenty twenty election whether or not that is true they believe that and if youare that voter and you think he won twice why would you not vote for him the chief argument against donald trump all along was lectability who is never character because character at mattered than wout a mattered a lot earlier and it was i'n per formance because most republicans by inlarge were fairly happy with donald trumps policy performance as president of the united states despite the fact that the twenty twenty year was really bad for donal trump the real rut nok on trump was that he was not electable which means that there were two assets that donal trump had one was that people in therepublican party still realthe love donal trump thereis at that is just the simple fact to the matter is an enormous mount of loyalty among republican voters people personally him in what the exit and entrance pulse sho is that people who believe that the candidate carrying bout people them matters they voted overwhelmingly for donal trump that is number one nuber two donald trump is extremely lucky in his opponents jobidon is a dead man i mean ido not mean that he is physically dead although he kindidaes i mean that jobidon is ei terrible president who happens to be runing at thirty three per cent in the approval ratings and that means that any one including sliced bread look s electable agains jobide the entire argument as being made by donald trumps opponents that he was unelectable which was probably true in january of twenty twenty three is no longer true in january of twenty twenty four when donal trump in nearly every pole is leading jobidon the electability argment completely disappeared and with that argument when most of te opposition to donal trump in the re publican party donald trump was basically in control the iswele cokases by the puling data by essentially june if you look allthe way back at the beginnings of pulling in the iswel coxas will get may of twenty twenty three that is about when to santo centered the race and that was to santis high watermark and iwa hewas a twenty eight per cent and trumpas at forty per cent and de santis then proceeded to drop about ten per cent from about thirty per cent all the way down to about twenty per cent in the final tally here trump for his part rose from about forty per cent to about fifty per cent and tht was baked into the cake as early as ju as july as mid july donal trumpwas already up thirty points on the field and that is where he ended up in this race nickee hayley picked up some of the support that early on mght have been going to swem of the other candidates the chris christies of the world fort example and she cansolidate enough support to finish a close third to ron to santis in iwa but again they are far behind that none of that really matters illget to more on this in just one moment first if there is one thing that matters most to me in life it is those i love well thanks my friends a pretock they are beating to days in plation then making it easier to connect with those im portant people in your

primaries whellifyou look at the new hampshire republican primary which is the next one up to santus has effectively no support in new hampshire is not his state it is a very moderate state tends to be can amit romnesk kind of state with a libertarian ben which dwi ron paul tended ta per form over in new hampshire historically speaking right now the real copolitics pulling average donall trump has forty three poin five per cent nickee haleis at twenty nine point three per cent chris christy wholl only recently dropped out o the race was pulling eleven twelve per cent to santus as down at seven and romasuamy was down at five as will discuss in a second romaswammy is now out officially n he was effectively out a few weeks togo because again his pulling dato we are not sufficient to keep him golng in the race the romasuammy officially dropped out last night his five per cent will go to trump you would imagion which brings trump up to forty eight point five per cent the santusis per centage is probalycgan remains stable maybe at drops a little bit maybe that boost trump above fifty per cent and then christy's per centage points are going to go to haley you would imagine tht haley is going o be about forty per cent and trum s going to be up around fifty per cent thou be my predictid final result in new hampser specially given the blow out victor for donald trump herall if trump winds iwane who wins new hampshire he is not losing a primary the resc of the season and we are now done and everybody can kind of feel it an nickey hailey if she would really wanted to have a serious challengere needed to come in seconds here by coming in third two to santis hrumamentum was somewhat blunted the santis for his part is not formally dropping out at this point the santus is not troping out because presumably he is thinking that maybe something wild happens in new hampshire perhaps something strange happens in south carolina perhaps there is a health problem with donald trumper something and he is still sort of the nearest com petitor in turms of people hore stol in the rays who mera donald trumps policy preferences then mayor may not be true botoline hereis again i do not see the math there is no math for anyone else to win this nomination except for donald trump nots worth exploring here what exactly happened in iowa and the break down of the nenagraphics in iowa number one no one voted again this was basically treated an incumbent election in two thousand in sixteen thereabout a hundredan eighty thousand people who voted the io caucases last night a hundred and ten thousand people participated that is really really low ut' a very low number why because everybody basically assume the donal trump was going to win and that is they were right obviously as the walstry journal says in the end there is only one lane to victory and iwa and donal trump had it all to himself the candidate's challenging the former president had hoped to find enough to satisfaction with him to buildtheron voter colition nickey haley the former south carolina govenor ha tron signs in polling of consolidating college educated republicans such as those in the suburbs or college towns viowa as well as voters less committed to conservative causes rondo santus the florta governor had moved aggressively to whin voters who fear a liberal take over of schools business as in academia but trump carried those groups winning sum handily he won thirty two per cents of college graduates to nickey haley's thirty per cent he dominated among those without a four year college degree loge the walstry jornal exit polling what you find is among those with a college degree donald trump one thirty five per cent nic ge haily one thirty one per cent in the ronosantus one twenty to per cent among those with no college degree donald trump one sixty three per cent of the vot compared to thirteen per cent for both haley and to santus this of course has been trumps pitch since twenty sixteen is the sort of idea of a broad working class colition tha was going to vote re publican and lot of people have tried to creed and economic philosophy about wy that is i think tat as much less to do witht economics and much more to do with the fact that donald trump of all the candidates in american histore really does not look down on blue collar working people the democratic party does this is why tey've embraced the intersectional ideology and donal trum projects that holesail and he tends to tocolic a blue colla working got even though he clearly is nm ot and that translate among urban voters donald trump one fifty four per cent suburban voters which be were nickee haley wouldo the best hou wong thirtyrseven per cent compare with nickee haleys twenty seven per cent and in small towns rural areas he dominated again fifty nine per cent fifty nine per cent of people by the way who said that trumps role in januar six the zealegal voted for nicky haley but that is not a lot of people very few people in the republican colition actually believe that wen agat these are mirrored those results from walztergunall are mirrored in the washington post entrance poles donal trump dominated prety much every group thereis only one group the donald trump did not actually win and tht was voters seventeen through twenty nine as but nine per cent voters in iwa among that group rondo santissetu one that group thirty per cent again mirroring what happene in twenty sixteen and twenty sixteen ual re call the ted crews actually out performed among young republicans it was older boomer republicans who tended vote very heavily for donald trump tat was mirrored last night in the results all though donald trump did sweep every age group outside of the seventeen to twenty nines seventeen iw twenty nine donal trump actualy finishe third iwen to santis thirty haley twenty five trump twenty two roma suammiy twenty one whet among every other age group he dominated particularly those who are above the ge of sixty five fifty eight per cent of people above the age of fifty five supported donald trump bot above theage sixty five supporta donal trump only sixteen per cent supported nickey rondo santis twenty one per cent supported nickey haley and again when comes to the educational breakdown sixty seven per cent of people who had some college or less voted four donald trump among college graduates though he also one thirty seven two twenty eight over nickey haley twenty six per cent four run do cantis gand ze sweeping victory four donald trump and as you move four or tonew hampshire it is hard to see exactly how anyone else has a serious shot at the republican nomination he get tomor on this in just one second first it is twenty twenty four a lot of us are trying to get our financial house in order well there is some great news for home oners intristrates of now trop down to the five solot lower than they were last year at

he was a very clear prioriny for him because that was concerning dominent victory thas couple of last percentage points make a bit of a perceptionable deference now realistically speaking if ye want forty eight o twenty twenty one or something and a dominent victory fifty one books more dominant cause e means the got n assure majority of the votes in i want be no one could have taken him here is donal trum i'm i ronically congratulating some of his opponents by i being passimogressive i want to thank you very much i want to congratulate rononiky for having a o good a good time to get ther were all have it a good time together ai think they both actually did very well i roul do think tey bont then very well we do not even know what the outcome of second places and a i see carry congratulations a fidet e after an a teisistoa tovea senaor great cenator i petat rat can be a great centor and i also one of congratula te vet because hedid a hell of a job who came from zero and he sa at a be per cent probably ei percent almost a perent an that is a an amazing ja they all tid there are very slar very slart people very capable people now this the speech of a man who knows hes one the nomination and down from actually thought that anythes other candidates were i th rat to him s you hink hou be speaking about them in that way the vague dropped out of the campaign now fatually speaking as i say he should has dropped down of campaign earlierand that is pasably what from said to him i here is o vake last night dropping out of the campaign and i indorsing donal trump and i wanted to make a couple of announcements to night to get the business out of the way and then i want to tell you where we are going as of this moment we are going to suspendous presidential campaign and this is going to have to be there is no path for me to be the next president absent things that we do not want to see happen in this country and i think that i am very worried for our country i think we are skating on the nice as a nation we have done everything in our part to make and done every one of us in this room has done our part to save this country and i am proud of every one of you who have lifted us up but we are campaign founded on the truth and that is why we have made that decision to day and i'm also making the decision that this has to be and america first candidate in that white house as ip said tis the beginning there are two america first candidates in this race and earlier to night i called donal trump to tell him that i congratulateim on is victory and now going forward he will have my full endorsement for the presidents and i think ere gong to do the right thing for this country again unsurprising news and vevake doing the right thing obviously he has no chance in the race there is no reason for him to stay in good on fovake for not sticking around just for kind of the attention seeking of it meanwhile the others to candidates ronosantus ink and nickey haley are technically still in the race to santis itis tryings take solase in the fact that he beat out nickey haley in iowa now just to be completely far again rondasantis phenominal governor of florida a person i would have voted forward i voter in the iwokoxis but when your expectations art i i just be nickey hailey that that is a very lowered expectation from where rondosans his expectations wor when he entered the race and went to iwa and visited all nignety nine counties ronasans again does not have a shot in new hampshire h's nannington and try in new hampshir presumebly he can move his campaign to south carolina but i do not sekep ha foward for rondosantis that is a very serious paforges electorally speaking and again his from somebody whose big supporter of rondosansideologically here is at rondosantis saying that hes still in although realistically speaking again donals fromtos blue away the field an ioa we love you to they to a pe thin ut the ki i ti at us they tot us tifty million dollars ut tacking us no one tas that much all wat just through iowa they the beautyo was against us they were riting our o bit to er e mun to gthey'v been ca t lu to beoplor pple e g tint o but they were just o u sided about the fact that thever predicting ah that we would not be able i to get our ticken punce tour out o iwa but i can tell you because of yours o pord in spite of all of that that they throu out us every one against us we have got our ticken punc tot o iwa gat now again to get punched out of iowup that is a fairly low bar for presidential candidate and in an again it just shows you exactly how much we lead trump has if you say a candidate has his ticket punch out of iowa wa i woultd i would expect that your campaign if it is a durable campagn would have its taket punched out of iwas o the standards ase been completely lowered same thing with regardtod nickey haley wat to more on this in just one second first twenty twenty four it

thousand votes for third place she is trying to claim that she has nickey mentom going forward in to new hampshire again very hard to see her winning a victory in new hampshire even with all of the anti trum support consolidating trump has the numbers in new hampshire o whin a shire majority in new hampshire again mean assume that the vake support is goin to go directly to trump assume that is some of to stampsis support is ging a bleet over to trump and he is above fifty per cent pretty easily again nickey haley is claiming that this is now a two person race let us be frank about this this now a one person race again people i gon to say that i'm early on this but i'm sorry this what the number say is what the numbers are abut here is nickey haley i in ta ra tey ni i ma this republican promary ei to persan r i mean again let us be reo about this this is not a two person races donal trump is wa the hell ahead of everybody i was going to hold my judgement on that until we saw some actual results from some actual caukases but even if nickey haley were to pull a close second in new hampshire hell eveni nicky halewere to win new hampshire it is hard to see her going down south to south carolina and then somehow pulling a miracle out and beating trump that is really the only pat the nickey haley has ford jus giving you the pure honest analysis here donal trump is the republican nominat in twenty twenty four and maybe this is always hous can t be again if republican saw him as an incumbent presient which manyour publican see him as that mend who is gon win not just that ye there is a a principl in drama and fiction writing called chehoff's gun named after the writer antoncheckoff chekof famously suggested thatif you put a gun over the mantel in the first act of a play by the end of act to that gun has to be fired you doft put the mantel over the gu over you do not put the gun over te mantel unless the gun is going to be fired an i've said this to my busint partner chair me borring many many times chekoff's guns principl is not actualley a an imperative it is descriptive meaning that is how the human brain works that is how people act they act as though if the thing is there it is going to be used the idea that there was going to be a twenty twenty four election absentonal trump the donal trump is not going tobe a part of this story in what is now season nine of trump i mean his names the show rammye we are all living in the trumpshow since twenty fifteen is dnown twenty twenty four season nin an rump got greenlet and got greenlet during season six the fact that donal trump is stuck around this lunk it is not amazing durable story mea its it it is the most amazing political comeback story innocense since richard nixon write richard nixon ran as vice president with dwhite eyes an hour and then i nineteen sixty ran for pressing he lost very narrowly jeff kay and the he went out into the wilderness and thn he came back in nineteen sixty eight inu on a sweeping victory against hubert humphrey that looed alot closer than it actually was in the end this is that and mean this is what that looks the fact that donald trump one and twenty sixteen wast fairly narrowly in the electrol college in it twenty twenty and now has come back and it stuck around you really never went away in twenty twenty four is just on any level in amazing story and the american people do lovean amazing story and the kind of wont o see the end of this moveng thy wonto ee the end of what is the end of the trum oy how to season nine of trump end i that that is i think what is in a lot of american's mind wright left in center and the story is a lotless interesting when trump isn'n a part of it ev en starts see the consolidation of the of the republican field all ready a nickee hayley who is the person who would have the clearest all turnative path if there were such a path that i do not think actuall exus even even she was choose asked about whicdh you support donal trump over jobiding shlick of course mean i yes the coming home affact inside the republican party is on everybody is gon a flow behind trump end that that is that is the waythis ginning up ther at's yo support that you if it is not you it does not work out and it is donal trum that they are goig to go elsewhere i me look i i would take donald trump over jo biding any day in a week but i'm goingto makesure we do not have that obtion everything weve done to get to this one i mean keepin my people than sang things for mut back when we were there were forteen in the race and we were tue for set now we are solid second and i was secon new hampsur second an sout jolona we got wone mar fellow to catch out you were goin to get ta time and meanwhile kim renolds who in dorsed ronas ansis shoose asked about trump its the nomeny and she said yet despite the fact the trumps as mean things about me mean jobidons on theother side of corse i'll supporten if if it comes down to to donal trump is the nomany os support of ous supporterever or nominy is do you shure that you does the doviner dovener to sandishere that o why do not wei tt a tai ta a ai a i wel e re cublic a

sowen we look at thy pulling right now trump verse is bidon trump in the betting averages is way ahead of jobidon at this point when a comes to jgeneral election matchups right now trump has about one point one per centsage point leat against jobidon with regard to the the with reraud e the real copotic poll average ke is ahead accorig toraskuson reports by eight he is ad a coring sebes news by two and these are all in hthe te sebes news pole is within the martion of eror wbu raskuson is way outside the martion of earor econimist you gov has them tied of forty three writers ipsos has them tide at forty eight morning consult has bidon at forty three and trump at forty two at the very least this a dead heat or trump is ahead that is where thing standin whn you look at the state by state when you loo at the state by state polling data what you see is that donald trump is incredibly competitive in all of the state the latest pulling out of michigan has donald trump up in the real copolitics polling average five poin three per cent including a pole frum that is right news with trump up eight if trumplin's michigan he is going towin the election in pennsylvania it is basically dead even and by the way one of the reasons is dead even is because joshi pero the emocratic governor is posing his moderate samething with john feddermin the senator but if the mood of the country is pro trump he is on whin pennsylvania if you take a look that wistconson the poles there are tied but the latest one from bloomburg morning consult has trump up for in wistconsin and to take a look at some of the other battle ground states the trump lost last time he is way ahead if you look at aerizona he has had very solidly if you'lok a georgia he is ahead very solidly the pulling factor trump is ahead when you look at the actural factors in the campaign trump is also ahead why jobidon cannot talk the fact that jobidon cannot talk the fact that jobidon is ten run a basement campaign wall he is president is a serious probem for him running the basement campaign when the other guy is president is actually the right strategy becuse yeu want the focus on the other guy ironically donal trump is likely to run what will amount to basement campaign because there will be no tobate buidin is notgoing to bate trump it is not cin a happen for everybody who is hot and bothered about that it an't coan a happen bidn is not geting on state with donal trump beyond that donald trump did something ironicaly is thing about this yesterday i visited the white house in january t of twenty atin and i's talking with a very very high ranking member of the white house staff of trumpstaff and they said what should we do and i said heu should build a fake twitter ap andyeu should put it on trump's phone and it should lat trump tweat into the ap and he would get back a munch of warm messages and he would be superhappy on the inside and no one else would ever see what exactly he was tweating and then ironically this actually happened he got band from twitter and he created truth social and he is still on truth social and his exposure on trouth social is one one thousand of what it would be if yeu are on ext right now i ronically he actually is doing the thing that is likely to make him successful by accident donald trumps can go out there is gin to do rallies he will do occasional interviews and meanwhile the centere of focus right now will be on the president of the united states is very difficult to avoid being the tentro focus and all the indictment talk ni know the is a lot of talk about the indictments coming t this year but many of the factors of already shifted in those indictments for example in the fanny willis reko case in georgia the story there is shifting because a legedly fanny willis was basically using that case to pay her boy friends that could take cruises around the world together she man up in jail allegedly over what she was doing in that case the alvan brag case in manhatton thatloks that is going nowhere fast even if trump were to be convict in that case no one is going to think hat that is legin mate case the jack smith case in washington d c is that even to come to trial before the election or the floorita classfi documents case is dacking to come to trial demicrafts people who are using legal maneuvering against trump to get him off the ballet i am not sure that that actually is hurting trump because they went over kol if it were one truck let us hey were only the jack smith washington d c charges all focus would be on that trial the problemis when use a shock inlegal approach with trump it looks an overwhelming to nomy legal assault on trump which it is is any of that can a hert donal trumpers at ll bakted in to the cake of this point meanwhile he got a president who literally cannot talk here was jobine yesterday he is holding up a bag of apples and smiling wearily man o the feel bad for the guy he is isjus now with it he is asking some may hold are you cs elevnis 's wa wellli sran a the grocery in o maganus i make he can barely move i'm an it just it is he this is what it is o cate jobidan is not when you talk about him as a candidate i mean thatki should not have a licence to drive that is that that is where we are in this rase right now and meanwhile his back l p comel harrison somehow even worse of this here is comela harris yesterday trying to genup enthusiasm i mean i swear to god she may be a in actual she may be the first a i human she she is absolutely an inhabitant of the uncanny valley she is set up housing in the uncanny valley with electricity and plumming because she she is if she were to ever become presidents of te united states they would not need to build an animatronic of her at wall disney's holl presidents they would just import her here here she is yesterd a pancod shes it she is she is unwatchable she is unwatchable i the ar c an leme to tay lovtin the adaa tho ga for the elder a da i go va humblin the about the here with you if som one of eightyeas o te day they were going in two thousand five o wo wow yethet that this is this is your vice presidential candidat who will be president by the way because your biten an nockin a last another four years in this office ell all this is leaving peeple who oppose trump with very few options and that is why things are likely to get very scary and spicy this year i'm pretty much every frunt bt folks this year is going to be one for the history books no one can actually predicts what is going to happen mean there will be an election this year somebody is going to win but could be actual warfobon war in chyni the middle east do not mis out on a minute of the covers from the voices you contrust download the free daily wire plus ap right now keep up with all the latest to get all the shows up to themn it news coverage and a wholehost of entertainment when you eed little break do not wait downlo dailywire plus right now ok cam meanwhile with donal trump as the presumpt of twenty twenty four nomine and trobidin ailing and commala harris being the back up woo was that a stanker of ar decision by jobid the panic has set in on the democratic side of the allec full scale panic and this by the ways also an ally of trump because the more you keep telling us that trump is muselini that he is hitler that the world's can end if you elected president the more everybody looks at you your crazy because ye are here is the thing no matter what you thng i doal trump the notion that donal trump is in the same league as stallin hitler muselini is an absurdity hos already president once and what happened some tax cuts some supreme quort appointments pretty god forn policy a good economy some bad governants during covid and then he set a bunch of dum stuff between november fourth and january sixth and a few hundred people walked in to the capital building some of whom are ridings om who just walked in ad that within three hours they were cleared andthen he was not presedent any more that is the story is that soundlike musulini or hitler to you with it the march unrome was that hitler's rastag fire what what it what is that where is the comp i need the comp in order to really understand the claim that you are making by the way appoint that i've ben making recently to some of my democratic friends who her saying th well if donal trumple to win it would end democracy there' be no more elections quick point for you when o worder donal trump will have served two terms that point who no longer be elgible for president he will not be ellowed to be un ballaes across the united states actually if you want donal trump not to screw the elections any more neuthing he is really gon a scro the elections you ought toboe for donaltrump and then he will be in for another term and then e'llbe done and h he will go round talking bout y one threeterms is president all the res of it in any case rachell man out was leadingit off they'r turning up to spinal tap eleven guises here is the thing when you keep turning the volume all the way up everyone goes deaf and you spent nine years with the volume at pinal tab eleven no one has cokly at any more we cannot hear you because you will went nuts too many times too often big picture take away from that and i do not mean to be again too dark as heu said on this but it is not if we are worried about the rise of authoritarianism and this country are worried about potential ris a fachisem in this country who worried about our democracy falling to an authoritarian and potentially facioust farm of government the leader who is trying to do that is part of that equation but people wanting that ori say tot ungeaker part of that ettrastion and the american olector it is made up of two mator parties one of those parties has been flirting with extremism on the ultra riht for a very long time they have brought the men in a way bhut they have not been central to republican electora politics ever before and i know because i've been studying this but once you have rota callise one major partie that those are the preferences of the people who adhere to your party the leaders intare changeable and yes trumpetsom is sometimes what we call it maga movements probably better way to do it but there is not a foritarian movement in thaav republican politics that is not being bem boozle by trup they are pushing troteat more and more extreme because the more extreme things he says then what they more they and that is coming from a very large proportion of the american right that athears to the republican party not's why this is a republican party problem wore that it is the problem of one man and his andiet byway notise what she is doing here she is not shaing that donal trumps vashes she sant youre afashes if you voted for donal trump or wood would frenon trump against jobidon because let us sav for example an analagy that i've been using recentlys regarded donal trump the checks and balances of the offise prevent him from doing many of the things thet maybe even has an inclination to do the checks in the balanceis and ben working astually less well with jobidon donal trump surrounded himself with professionals those provessionals very often told him do not do this thing it is illegal that happened a lot during droduring donal trumps administration jobidon does the legal things on the regular and hi's people are eal call do it when you assess the presidential candidate one ofthe things that we all do we all do this is we assume that there is a filter that filter is the filter of governan's reality it is a good coffee filter s he pour the water on the coffee grounds and the filter prevents the actual coffee grounds from getting in your coffee a lot of the stuff that trump says is the coffee grounds and a lot of the worst stuff does not get through the coffee filter with jobidin the grains are too small thet yo find they get right through the coffee filter and he get on the other end is act yo worst coffee with jobidon then oe would ae donal trump that is the case to made but the omicras are aready turning it up to it is notthus trumpit is everyone if you vote for trump against jobidans because you aren olf thoritarian wantaby you want the federal government weaponized against you now part f the problem here is that the only candidate in this rate who is actively weaponize the federal government against it citizens is jobidon it is jobid who tried to use the occupational safety and health administration osha anadministrateof agency to cram down of acting on eighty million people and we here at the daily wire we sued him to stop that from happenin it is jobidon whos suggested he can unalaterally not in forse imigration law change all our emigration laws and let five six seven million people into the country legally that is jobidon who is doing that all of your talk of donal trumping a threats the country we can all see what is happenig here we can all see it it is notjus rachel mat outs of course joy rad on that same terrible panal men ama s en b c the level of ideological diversity there ranging all the wave from ten shocky on the right to rachel mato and joy read on left is pretty astonishming an i dint haen wetin i ma tea mi it thit the elephant in the room she is filla brown lady that is got to try to win in a party that is tite ante emmigrant and wich exfent the notion that iu can fay emmigrants or poitening the blood of our country sh's getting in o birthard by donald trum oh an i do not ear how much the dot a rada lie tedero to grap up a lot the better sin does then u aftir it fill a talen i do not see how shen becomes the nominy of that party with donald trump till around i cannot ficsure it thappenin may be can appen lon to tantis is only argument for sthing in it if he' the i thit he cans til mak the appeal towity bog and it is just amazing to watch the left talk about how all of the voter for donal trumper actually just racist against nickey haly by the way if nickey haloer the nominy they be saing alvis him crapabout nicky halebs this what they do meanwhile david french again somebody i can sider a friend but david is wildly off the resurbation on this particular david is now calling i know i's anta trump is benanti trumpsonce twenty sixten an than he remain anti trumpan now he rites for thn your time's being anti trump you literally put out a piece yesterday as donald trump is emerging victorias from the ival caccases called jist qualified trump or else the idea here would be th the only way to save america is to literally take donald trump off the ballet in twenty twenty four you want actural armed conflict that is a great way to bring actural armed conflict is to kick donald trump off the ballet entirely according to david frenc there is no doubt notkang trump off the ballt would ten shock waves through the american body politic but why would any one believe that i's inherently lesty stablizing if trump runs we already knowhat he does when he loses for him counting the votes is only the beginning of the battle if he loses he will challenge the results conspire to overturn the election and insihe political violans i'll go have a question how litterally how hewas president last time and he still could not do it where can n ethe mechanisms for which donald trump is going to be able to do that how is that going to happen outlick i want people at some point they saiy wild things there will be an armed uprising ofll getlic at's one to now spell it out step by step how do we get from point a to point b or rejust saying things now he says if heu wins youhavenan insurrectionist an command of th most powerful military in the world whose tell bent on seeking vengeance on his political enemies does anything at all sound stabilizing about that again you think the donal trump i's going to i understand everybody is very hot an but donal trumps con a proscutat now he is not i'm just telling you right now he is not going to of gelic if he does lut's pos bal be extremely shocked becauehe said the same thing abe hellerclin and then he did not you us can to happen if yheu wins he is tom we superhappy in is can be in the white house all day don wenee it before tweeting and let is aides make good policy that is what is actully gan o happen but but david french is now making the case that we need to take trump off the ballat to save the republic you on't get trumpelected there is pretty much no better way to do it than say stuff this ia gain the reason the pannic is setting in is because jobin's policy is coming clear to every one here is the biggest probem by theway for the world my prediction said yesterday i'm a continue saying it if we gets a junegili august and donal trumps up inthe poles the chances the china blockades si wan are extremely high they go from thirty per cent to day to probably sixty per cent why because they do not want on'l trum to be president when they blockates i wan they figure that jobidon if there is blockade of tiwan will pressure ti wan to make some sort of deal with china to stop the conflict and give them some sophisticated mikroships in order to prevent him from losing the reelect effort see in an election here the incoment president is very susceptible to foreign conflict this is why and twenty twelve you will recall in an act of cologen with the russians you remember the braklama actually sat with dmetry medvidev who is then the president of russia who sort of standin who is cut out for vlanerpoudent and he said tell ladimer i'll have more flexibility after the election in other words please do not do anything bad that wouldhurt my reelect topes and then i will help you guise after the election which hey did when russia actually took control of bothseria as well as crimia at bot the same thing is very much iavailable this year for america's enemies this is ta year to go man thisis a year to put pressure on jobidon this is a year where if you can create conflict you believe thet jobidon will simply give you a cooky to make you go away that is true for china it is true for a ron remember over the weeken the united states as well as some of it is allies launched a series of missile a tacks on the who thes in yemmon on i say the who tese i means to mempt you buildings that the who thes run and own but they givelic a week of warnings to nobody was aftryou there a grand total ithing six who these killed in this massively expensive air strike by the americans and our allies did that put off to who thes of course i didn' putoff the who thes why would it all the who thes have to do is survive and poke at the united states to clain victoryes this is the bazar maft of the middaeleast te united states israel western countryes are expected to completely devastate the oppositio n completely devistate them and all the badgis have to do is popped their head up after the entire city as laid wissingl i'm still alive you did not get ma a sets wor the hoothes are doing right now according to the guardian the aron backs whothe molisha group has continued to attack commercial shipping hitting an american own cargoship ith the bullistic missil in defines will wave of uus and ucase strikes on yemmon the strike against the martial islands flagg tubralter eagl containership representig a twidening of the theatr of war beyon the redsa to the gulf of aden the strike hat the cargo hold o the ship while his thoughts o ave casno mator damagewil adsefeers they uc and uc and yuout strikes on who the targe tonyemon have not degrated the hothese abilities to threaten commercial shipping catar became the latest major user of cargoships to announce it will not send liquid gas through the red sea for the for seopble future everythings can get more expensive and the hope on the part of these hoothy groups and the aranians is that the united states will then presser israel into stopping the destruction of commas in order to reopen the shipping lanes the basily they will conceede to the rag tag pirates and jobidon may well do that because t again jobidon is of the weird opinion that in the middle east concessions get you what you want in reality in th midleleast concessions generally get you killed and that is what is likely to happen over their sent com put out a statement on this yesterday they said quote on ganuary fifteen that approximately four piam sonaa time which is emmon aronian backd whothe militons fired n antiship bullistic missile from whothe controlle t areas of aman an struck the gibraltar eagal a martial islans flaggd uus own an operated containership the ship has reported no injuries are significant damage in is continue its jerning earlier in the day at a proximately shupiam s forces detected in antiship bullistic missile fired toward the southern redse commercial shipping lanes the missil failed an flight and impackted on land in yemmon therewere no injuries or damage reported meanwhile the aranians uping their game they a struck in aria near what they claimed was a uas pase in arock in erbil according to a bcnew several explosions are reported near the os consulet in airbale arock the rnian revolutionary gardcourt directly took responsibility for the attacks they said they were targning the quat headquarter of spies and antironian terrist gatherings in parts of the region the cordistan regional security councils had four people werekilled in six injured in the attack again this isaron directly taking a hand in a rock not a shock they havebeen active in rock for very long time here sommit a somvidio of what that looked tthecan sem the missiles hitting over there aron by the way andthat up attacking civilians as well the aronian bullistic missile strike actually killed a prominent business men in rocky curtistan according to forbes the target was not as initially speculated the large uus consulate over there or the american truth base in airbill international airbor airport instead the actually decide they areging to hit a well known local business men killing ham and members of his family they claimed responsibility for theattacked to the aronians directly as well s a simultaneous strike on syria they struck the house for curtish business nand man peshra dea zai the owner of the autonmos regions falkon group which is responsible for major projects such as the empire world which is a centrael business district known for a highrise a partment buildings basely they are using what is going on the midlies as an excuse to hit some of their enemies in curtestam essentially is t ar things getting less crazy in temidaleast no because it turns out tho when the united states lesy vacuum around tents to fill that vacuum meanwhile commos continues along it is merry way last night commss fired fifty separat rockets into israel proper again this words been going on for over a hundred days and tom they are still firing rockets from the center of the gosestripts while people are telling israel to leave the commosnics alone leave that leav the porcomos theyre still firing rockets it civilions in israel no sovereignsty would be able to low this geroza some f the vidover to look yoan see there e go thath iron dome is shooting down a bunch of these israel lows some of those rockets to a to strike open areas ut get would any state worth itsalt alow it citizens to have to live this at all of course not when bidon and th administration are putting pressure on israel to stop with their doing in commasastand the gosestrip they are out of their minds meanwhile commos literally release te clip yesterday of a female hostage talking about other hostages who had been killed and thy they made it a perverse evil gameshoe because this whatcomas is theyre perverseval group they took this female hostage and then they put out atweet with pictures of two other hostages sing are they dead or alive wew'll reveal the answer tomorrow this how sicties these people are here is what that vidio look the question mark for those you cannot see and t shoes a picture of three hostages and the question is what do you think are they dead or they alive one option one all killed thi slight itis evil option two some killed some injure option threes still alive and the answer is the female is om alive and says to night we will inform you of their fames it just that the worse people in the entire world the worst people thentime and that they are treating it a a bizare utuvidio and meanwhile the west is all israels commtting in geneal it is just it is pathetic on its face and the only the only currency in the middle east is in fact the currency of sheer power and i pisrael does not reestablished ta turrents view the use of power in the gosestrip that as when we very harmful not only for israel but for american interests in the midalise an men it already is considering that who these are not even being teturred by f twenty two strikes meanwhile the procommos protesters in the west continued to do their merry work given the fact that they are cans er i can see why they were protesting in anti cantser center they literally did this s they were marching ina in new york and they march past slone cettering which is a a cancer treatment center and they started protesting the cancer treatment center which make sense again people who are an ideological cancer protesting against a cancer centr makes some level of cense actually early a theyare standing outside memorials tone carrin cancer centr and protesting the hospita oslan centering is complicent make sure they hear the're in the windows oh you man the cancor patients you mean the families of the cancer patients those of people who need be heard by the procomosnics is why when you hear rachel shame on ou shime on you you have cancer shame on you unbelievable thethe this by the wayis why when you hear rachel mat out an joy re talk by the extremism of the republican party a guyse these are yours the people are protesting for commosipoes are your people that is your that is your crowd mayb that is just one reason why lot republicans are fine give us trump already coming up we will get into what is still the worst failure of the bidin

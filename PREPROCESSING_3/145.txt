democrat's turned to the race card to distract from jobidon's looming corruption problems the view gets very upset of me for not licking barby and bronie james suffers a cardiac arrest i ventsure of the sis the vent ferro sho to dashosponterback spresbe piansyou lec our web history being seen nd sold to advertisers now me neither at expressily pian right nowt expressby piansi com flashmen today hunter bidon is expected to plead guilty to a couple of miss demeanor accounts of failing to pay his taxis at a federal court house in delaware that is according to enb c news is the first time that the justice to parten has brought charges agains the child of setting press i but of course the charges have been knocked way way way down be's gording to iras whistleblowers this du to hunter bidon took in literally seventeen pointhre million dollars on be half of the family over the course of two thousand fourteen two thousand nineteen and then the i arrest and the d o ja and the af be i all waited untill a bunch of the tax evasion charges had basically fallen off the rat are they went beyond the statute of limitations and then of course they apparently according tothe iris whistle lowers denied david wiste ty was attorney in this case the ability to pursue the case as a special council which woave allowed him to do interviews in certain ways in charge in certain districts they did not pursue any lineso vinquiry about howexactly the money passed to hunter and then whether that money passed from hunter to the big guy jobidon the medargon a play this up as though d o jay and the fbe i really did their job hare but this is a sweetheart plea arrangement in everybody knows it according an by sonews bidons expected to follow the terms the pleaagreemen he reached last month with usattorny david wise outlining the charge is wice's off hi sed in a statement hunter bide receive taxible in comean axcess of one point five million dollars the annually in two thousand seventeen to thousand eighteen despite owingan access of a hundred thousand dollars in federal in come taxes every year he did not pay any in come tax du for either year nayman put aside the irony or the fact that jobidon is constantly talking abohow the rich are escaping their taxes now the rich do not pay ther tersharan o go do and how hisson is the rich or did not pay his fair shar i promise you i paid a loft of phoney in taxes lastri pad waymore and my fair share this dud paid pretty much nothing twenty seven twenty eighteen the fact is that hunter bidn is being let off to hook and because his father is the present aske por our usual arrangement bidon was facing a separate gun charge for legally owning a colt cobra thirty eight special hand gun but the d o ja said h hea reached a pretrile agreement tat allowed him to a sentially goto drug re hab instead of being charge before lywing on federal forms again put aside the ironey f the fact that jobdon his basically said that youthy lawbiting gun urner should not have a gun and that hunter bidon gets to go drug re hab after apparently lying on federal forms upping an drug atticts in order to obtain a gun which then ended up dumped in a dumster near a heigh school put aside all of that the fact is that this is not once again a sweetheart plea arrangement now there is a sor of leat bricking story with regard to the sweethart plea arrangement the your poste reporting it yesterday first son hunter bidon's legaltim a peers to pull a brdirty trick on tuesday to block the release of damming evidence i had of his expected guilty pleat to federal charges of tax ofation and weapons crimes the drom began in the morning when the house wasin means comme files an amicis breef to delaware youas district cudge mary ellin n raka arguing the fifty three yearold had benefited from quote political interference which calls into question the propriety of the investigation into his lledged crimes the fialliyg included the testimony from the two iress whistle blowers what happened next was outlined in a letter sent to the joj on tuesday afternoon by the committe's top lawyer theodor catilla quote at approximately one thirty pm we received word that our filing was being removed from the docket the house wason means comittee filed and amacas brief asking for the plea bargan to basicly be thrown out for corruption and werdly andoff they got a notice at one thirty yesterday that theufiling was removed from the doket we promptly contact of the clerks office as the wawyer and we are advise that some one contact of the cuort representing they work from my office nd that they were asking the cortz remove this from the doket we immediately advise this was inaccurat the clerk's office responded that weoudneed to refile we have done now katila included emal exchange s with quart officials and hunter bietin's attorneys in the fresh filing hitide following up on our recent telephone conversation the woman who called thas a just cup bangles can from quart official sman the grimes she said she works with theodoro catilla andit was im portant the document was removed immediately or tey could filemotion seal i do deeply apolojises for the confusion on our part bangles is the director of litigation service is at laththem an wakins a maskive nork baselawferm and ofm a hunter bidn t turning cris clark was t formerly a partner over there when cattila con fronted the first son's legal team huntersern hunters attornes tried to claim the filing contain confidential and identifying information even tough th whistlel or testimony's been public from more than a mont thetime stamps from the emals indicated the re quest to take the document down was made aftericatila refused to request to file the testimony underseal this is what hunter biden's torny rote quote as far as i'm aware the manageing a torny from lathem an wakens called the clerk's office to note that personal tax in formation of the defenden had been filed in a non redacted manner and to inquire regarding having the information seal as we told we would not as you said you understood as far as i'm were the cuork took the filing down on their own accord kcattilla then wore n eu shr politic a step back from your statements the clerk's office advised that i was representing tur the re quest was being made by my firm we will been vising judge norak of this and proper contects lay them an wakin saying neneno we just asked that it be taken downmic did not it contained identifying information but the houseways and means commttee is saying nno you called them up and you said that you were ofs and tht you are requesting as at os that we should take down the filing pretty amazing we will see how this shakes dout of course but one thing is perfectly clear if be person whose name were on the charges were anybody but hunter biden that is wou we going to jail as the walstry tjurnal editorial board points out i lean jao conter witing you would go to prison for what hunter bidon did prison for tax crimes is real in the nineteen nineties your cotellie wte on a helmsley served at nearly two years in prison for de frauding the government by having her business pay he personal expenses o clain taxoductions for them what 's been call hunter bidan swet har plea deal was not the subject of the ouse oversite committes julin ineteentheering where the two ires whistleblowers testified instead wall makers intended to explore ways in which iressations said the justice partment ad the ward eir proben again ye thwarting of the probe is really the big issue here becausetheire way deeper questions to ask than hunter bdanstax crimes where did the money go who was the big guy why are their text on hunter bidon's computer talking about how he paid his daddy's buills wh are their text on hunter bidon's computer what is aps two foreign agens saying my daddy is sitting right here why is it that all of this was shut down now the hunter biton prosecutors david wises he is the osattorney for the district of delaware apparently he will be allowed to testify before the housed judiciary committee that apartment of justise sent a letter to the judiciary comittee according to the daily wire whice's testimony would come after the announcemen of a plead deal where hunter would plead guilty the do ja appreciates the committee on the judiciaryes acceptance of our offer four weices to testify at a public haring before thecommittee that partment is ready to offer wises to testifie shortly after congress returns from the algust district o work period as described more fully below the potentrial dates for the testimony september twenty seventh or twenty eighth an october eighteenth or nineteen that is a wong time in the future you may notice that the date tho date is july twenty six s their time lot september october for wise to testify because he is apparently darn busy the doja added in his letter that there were misunderstandings about what exactly it is work was and why weics was denied special council stadus or if he was according to letter quote weare deeply concerned by any misrepresentations about our work whether deliberate or arising fror mis understandings that could unduly harm public confidence and the even handed administration of justice towhich we are dedicated well i mean i'm concerned about the even handed administration of justice given the fact that apparently according to the iras whistle blowers david weics was barred from asking serious questions for the iress agents about how money was flowing which is the exact topic of this investigation again one iras whistle lore joseph zigler he is the gay democrat who pointed that out during his testimony to say liss at our and have dogan 's fight he is disputed several satements madebi wises saying that hunter should face more serious criminal charges now david weics has been very squirrelly about what exactly he asked for him what exactly he received from the do jay apparently tere is an open meeting where he told the ires whistleblowers that he had asked for special council staduson was denied then meric arlan was well he never asked for it which ten oft e lides the question is to why you did not give it to him in the first place which is exactly at meric arlan did do with regard to for example the special council going aftordonal trump there meric arlans hands off you get special council status when came to hunter bidon it was wall unless he asks for it than i suppose i will not give it to him and then we sut have an argument over who asked for what wen whel all of this is going to blaubin public vew because the fact is that we now have too many pieces of in formations suggesting corruption involving jo we do beyond all the text from hunter again ththe most damming text remains the two thousand nineteen text from hunter bidon to his daughter at which he says he pays dads buills that is a wildly damning text but now we have information thas been put forward by no less than to of hunter bi ns business fider's talking about joe's invalvman inin the business at least to the excent that joe's being used as sort of the deotex maccana tat when something was happening and they needed to calld joe to demonstrate that they astually had some pull thy w call him on the phone davan archer who is john carry's son in law and and somebody who is businy partners with hunter bidon he is supposed to tast to fy behind close doors this week about all of that andof course we n tont twenty bobolinsky who is largely ignordan twenty twenty said exactly the same thing he said that hunter bidon would calld jobitin up on the phone heu'd bring jobidin to meetings all the rest of this sort of stuff o coven mc carthy for his part saze than im peachment inquiry well probably get under way some time in the near future it is very doubtful that impeachment inquiry does not lead to impeachment i've get to see in impeachmen inquiry that does not lead to impeachment an again it is e i i find it incredibly dificult to believe i laid out the entire time line yesterday on the show that jobidon i's pure is the driven snow knew nothin about hunter picking up bags of foreign cash all over the world using his name was on the phone with hunter and the formn business partners was squiring hunter on air force tos to places china and was impassing policy in the countries whe're hunteris pickin up the cash all this i's a big coinkininky o speaker mc carthy said yesterday that im peachment inquiry could be something very likely in the ear future now you have the president thing one thing that we provenis not true you have got ireswhistle belower thing something when it comes to government treating the bidins thefferent you have got an informent claiming that the bidon family had been bry should you ignore that or should investigate that the only way you can investigate that is to an impeachmen inquiry the committee would have the power to get all the documents that they would be what i said last nin and i continu is that it before when more thi continues to unravel it rises to the level of the chman inquiry where you would have the congress to have the power to get to all these ans i wen thank the biden family e want to answer these questions as well er bid the docinents instead of holding em back what is amazing about this is the democrat's response to all of this because again the evidence is there that there was something tho farry is going on i mean hunter and joe ar wr they are hand in glove for years on and while all this is going around and meanwhile he oup people jimmy raskond who again was one of the leaders of the impeachmen intu tonal trump who said that this is second hand years old alligations wa what would first han constitute first and allegate ammin it is not second hand twening bobolinsky was business pirners with hunter bided taven archer was business punters was business partners with hunter biton hunter bidoin textand things about jo that is all first and that is not second hand that is al t very very first tand these are people whare directly inbalved in the alligations at issue apparently according to jimmy raskin the only thing tht would count ass a first hand alligation is if jobidon raise his hand and literally said hindrig money from y rus on huntr or he got a punch bank reckords just pilled theman public view which something he absolutely will never do meanwhile the white house is tweeting out quote thei'r eagerness to go after bidon regardless of the truth is seemingly bottomless at a brief ing tuesday when hos pra secretary creen shon pear said we are not got to get int hypotheticals when asked about geo the efforts to impeach bidon now this was always going to happen ok ken because jobidon has been crupt for very very long time and en h judones a lot of houses for a guy who is on a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand a year salary as a senter and yet he had these very very nice houses in delawame andthere is been talk about jo bidon and the delaware credic card companies for a very long time this is not anything new or shocking yoleving its shocking is the extense which the media will go to not ask serious questions about this meanwhile other democrats of course are completely un intereste in this inquiry heare's representative madalan deine she is a democrat from pennsylvania just i've no questions about this all my questions have been answerd really i loves her o there answered and what questions you asked we are at a time of great contrast a democrats leading investing in america and republicans chaste in conspiracy theories on the subject of what could be a pending in peachwen inquiry into into president bind what questions if any do you have about joe bidons connection to hunter bidons business dealings i do not have any at this point that certainly there are questions that can be asked and and should be answered if there was any canaction wbut we do not see any evidence of that once ta wher or ta they are making yiu a whole cloth the're making it up everything is made up which is weird because it is not made up and again we let out the entire time line and we have crn contembraneos documentation and we have whistleblor allegations and wehave confidential human sources who explicitly say that the heads of breesma we are openly claiming to av bribed the hunter and jobidon and all this is worthy of questioning is it not and yet we are just told the handwave it away it is all old alegations who cares better but there there is nothing there is nothing to see here and here is the thing the smoke is going to lead you fire an the smoke is not there for no reason meanwhile and jobidon continues to wander around not knowing where he is yesterday he claim to a cured canswer which is out which is interesting i i figure that that is that is breaking big if true there is joe bidon claiming that he has cured canswer you doiny at all youre wer wer you do i shu cure cantywo camui wy can can's noine thinks we can that is why we can we mande canters re nowr we ended cancer as we know it i i've yeul i i would have heard about that if that were if that were true where is daniel dale an the fact checkers over its seean end the presiden claims that he is cure cants are perhaps next you will cured to mensha i i have i have have doubts and quibbles meanwhile in the funnyes tat jobidon story of thit it is funny because it its sha little sad now as a new dog owner letme tell you how your dog acts is largely reflection hawy tranerdog if youare good in training your dog your dog will not by people and yet jobidon has had not one but two dogs wo apparently routinely bite people according to than your times one of preside ent bidon's dogs has now bitten several sec ate service agents and even set one to te hospital pard of a series of at least ten incidents of aggressive behavior according to in ternal emals recently obtain by conservative wathstroll group the correspondente shows commander the nearly two year old german sheperd has struggled to a just ta life at the white house were ye arrived in twenty twenty on and delaware where te bidons own to houms early in november twenty twenty to a ficials on the white house medical team chose to send an officer whom commander had bitten own the arm and the fy to the hospital just a week later commander bitten angents on the left thigh that same month another agent was left shaken whenhe felt the ne ta hoist up the chair he was sitting on to useas a shield when commander began barking at him from the top of a white house staircase six of the inncents were bite thet result in some form of medical attention this af course is not the only bidon dog who is been a bad bad dogo in margh twentig twenty one the bidintedship two of their other dogs champ and major to delaware for two weeks of training after major had a biting instan withthe wite house staff member champ died later that year assassinated by hilery clinton apparently om yap he is e's a that gret grat great job jo bin meanwhile on the policy front a federal judge has now tossed jobidans ad ministration asylum rule for migrans according to the washington post a federal judgin californi struck down the bide administractions temporary restrictions on migrans seeking asylum ruling the government's plans to reduce illegal crossings on the os mexical borer actaly violated federal law s they put in placeo system and imposed penalize penalties on migran to crossdthe border legally trying to funnlem to ports of the entry where then they would be let into the country willie nolly and far that is ben the result then a lot fewer lines at the at the boarder there'v been a lotless chaos on theborder but a lot of those people tostenter the ountry wille knolli a a the bigger problem when it came to i legal migration was never the can vast seanes on the boarder the problem was what th problem remans which his people illegally entering the country by claiming asylum when they do not actually have a legal right to asylum but because the process works and is overloaded in this way that you comu clemasylum and then we basically give you a delly ticket counter and we say show up in three months for an asylum clan and then youshop in three months the we give you another tickets and cho up for a court at the nervershop again statistically this is what happens people show for the first courtay ben ot their sycel cortan this is why you have levin twelve fourteen million i legal emigrans in the united states will now a judge his argued that jobidon cannot even do that even the illegal emigration policy the jobiton design in order to get people to at least stands in line at the ports of entry now judge is said he cant even do that according to the washington post the judge sided with avixy groups that had argued the bidin restrictions violated federal law by indangering migran's fleeing harm and preventing migrans from seeking aslum if they crossed the border illegally which congress never intended even jobidon's a tims to regula rize his a bad legal emigration policy are failing on on every front well when democrats are failing when approval ratings are wo when it appears that the president of the united states is on weakened footing well it is i precisely that time that can expect the democrats ar probably going to start playing the race card jobidon yesterday honor emitill and his mother with a new national monument which is all that that is fun amato obviously was len hed ssassinated for the great crime of apparently having a legedly wolf whistled a white lady in the in the pre civil rihts eur a south anda his mom made the brave move having an open casket in his funeral anda and pointing out that these are the wages of racism and to now the federal government is going to establish the ematill and manitill mobly national monument which is going to be in a few different places it is not is not just one place the monument honors not only amatill but also his mother who became a renowned civil rites advocate according to a white husoficial the new monument will protect place to the tell the story of emitills too short life and racially mode ivated murder the unjust a quittal of his murderers in the activism of his mother who courageously brought the world's attention to the brutal injustices and racism of the time catalizingt e civil rites movement and it will include things the robbers temple church of god of in christ in chicago that is where tills funeral service was held also the grba landing and mississippi where its believe the tills body was recovered from the talahatchee river that will be the second location in the third location will be at the calahatche county second distrecort house in mississippi where tills killers were acquitted e all of that yoll it is worth remembering the evils of american history in order s that we can see how far we have come but that is not the real reason why jobidon is doing this the reason that jobidon is doing this as you conceive from the announcement the real reason that jobidon and comma harris are doing this is that they can pretend that there are bunch of republicans who are just the murderers fvemito that is the way they do this if really is gross again the shuld be something about which americans are fairly united i would hope universally united ameri american racism is evil racism is bad the murder of people onthe base of their skin evil rigt we shouldall be on the same side of that why is it that this administration is now using this announcement of the monument in order to go after ron to santists and florida and falsely claim that florida is replete with the same kind of racism it is really grows bind le it off yesterday he is talking about complicity in complicity in racism and as you will see this mumore morse very very quickly in to an attack on jobidon and comela harris's political opponents less i learn a comin ot ot i really is a tois o ik cim out a to i whois ki conley to fendan ie to an is to say has something as good an ma goway he div e jis hits an is'n te ruks an giv o lit oo in ibad heopl come roar atout an as tot all f us to do with that ato all us stop a t all as th essin it is o tha tru as tiny is not o a con tex is thinkis opi a plies ser silas tis com plicity ie all a sl i all when we we si o nay again when he says things i guty does not go way it tides under rocso first ofault racism in the united states has a b ated beyond any other western country by a longshot theyn lok the pollin wit the grach ofor example intoracial marriage and went from virtually knowing the united states was in favor of intoracial marriage to every one in the united states is fine with intorrcial mrriage by the polling data eh but according t jobida never goes wates goes to hideso what does he mean by that what dis he met what athe implication is the implication is that even though those evil republicans who oppose jobidon will not openly be racis quietly theire very races come alla herris who you kow is obviously ramping up for the possibility tha jobine just keels over any day because he looks he is going to keel over any day she really just sis the quiet part ot loud she just goes right after ronto santos and florida again there is a reason why they are linking these two issues to day there are those in ournation would prefer to erace or even rerigt the ugly parts of our pass those who attempt to teach that enslaved people benefitet from slaverytthose who insult us in an attempt to galide us who tri to divide ournation with unnecessary to bates let us not besides into the lieving that somehow we will be better if wef forget i'l gate number one no one's forgetting people get twaught about emet till in florida schools what she is saying here which is that tese are it is unnecessary tohave dobatestover america's history reallease since you gites tof the one to push the sixteen nineteen project you are the ones who suggest that america's racial history means that today the only solution is quortinphat racial equity when it comes to government policy i e reverse racism in american government policy this is what they are doing this ates it is supergrows it is really grows honestly find me the american politician of either party today who is ya i'm a big i'm standing for ementill's murderers who are those people they do not exist what does it matter because commalharris believes and she wants you to believe that really dounsy republicans are very much in favor of black people being murder for no reason at all she did this byblish who saying all of this during the emet till announcement wich is superdisgusting i mau really is grows here is jobidon doing the same exact thing e time wen on those who see to ban wos very iseo we are making clear cristal cristal cle ias ana iles n con hi wich they race nothing e gen hi bat they race nothing we cannot jus shose a lonwi wine no wet or we should ie he is yo lofintion know about our cunchr we should everything the goa gad the truth fere ination there is such gaslighting liars there'e such liars they are liars oo gay all this gets taught in florida schools nothing that ronisantis has passed in the staye of florida sining the onestad of florida bars the teaching h m american has toree on the contrary it presu rves the teaching of american history y preventing the inculcation of lies into the corriculum lies if you are black your inherently victimized in te united states and if you are white you are inherently privileged in the united states of america and that all systems of power in the united states are created for the te splicit promotion of white people that is what critical race theory teachers that is what theyre attempting to man in the state of florida not teaching about the evils of american history or white to premisy what it is a lie they are liars and it is disgusting it truly is gross hes again there is no disagreement in the united states about the evils of american history when it comes to racism and whites yo premisy there is no disagreement about that the only disagreement is that you guise all say at the white supremisy is still there lurking underneath america surface and that all america's kee institutions from capitalism to the meritocracy ave been infused by that evil racism and thus if you oppose the democratic agena secretly you are a white to premisese secret lear in league with emitil's murderers that is the case their trying to make some them are even more open ab se nuses mery bruce actually openly tried to connect rondissantis to the lynching of emittill now the presidents an nounce ment the president who is roughanthing ane that talle would have been it comes as mere seeme this controversal and very polarizing debate in this country over the teaching of black history that move by the flord aboard of education to teach that some flames mayve tenefitted from the skills they developed its parking a fire storm but rob in this white house says that monuments this to till well help to teach the complete story of our nations history robit yes hw about rondissances and the evils meanwhile emasand to see host andriamatchal another objective journalismer she common to quote this is also happening as somstates are being accused of chipping away at the teaching of black history the accurate teaching rondisances has been accused by the washington post editorial board just yesterday o frend to quote whitewash slavery it is it is discusting it is clearly discussing and then there is the secondary discusting is greg gotfelld e's on fox new is doing to show and he was talking about all of these false accusations with regard to rondissantis alall the lies the coma herrison tor bidenar talking about about how american history will not be taught lack history will not be taughtinflors schools any more which s a lie i is not true it is a lie cay gotfelld was talking about the part of the corriculum that says that some slaves cultivated skills thet could use for ther personal benefit after slavery which is clearly true and he makes the pretty much unobjectionable points that even in the worst circumstances human beings could possibly be in they cultivate skills because this is how human beings adapt and survive and demonstrates their rasiliency even the worst places human beings can be they cultivate skills that they can then use for the personal benefit afterward and he makes the comparison to victor frankell writing mans search for meeting after the holicost the notion that he was able to cultivate certain spiritual levels through suffering in the holicost anda and naturally then the left cumps on that it is just it timate here here is greg gotfeld do you think that she red the whole thing and thi socide to tariapick something i i do think that she rd the whole thing and i think that it is ten incradicallan complex pet anel its a hingr ninety wh passages you have thound good and and frankly i'm just find omantally uncomfortable whin the tantente that black banefeted at all from this and i ini made ma fanka some one oi ty i'm not black but i'm thoish what is someone tay about the holicos for instance that there wore some banefets for ces right while they were hangon concentration camps yo learned a strong workafhec right made me yo learn in in a skale that you ever naht man searts for meaning thic frank old talks about how you had to survive an a cos aganon camp by having skills you had to be useful utility you must hadlity capt tu ua a talking about meddle scoars here o get again what god felts as there is absoly un objectionable as an orthodox true no and thank god my my immediate family our family line was in america since the early twentieth century but the entire extented family was in europe at the time oa holicostor we lost a lot of in o distant relations and family relations in europe during the holicosin of course i'm deeply in sconsenageros communityes o pon wich everbody knows a holics river what he is saying there which is that the durability and the adaptability of human beings the resilienty of human beings in terrible circumstances leads them to cultivate skills that are useful to them in the rest of their lives even in the worst circumstances one o the glories of being a human being that is unobjectionable to what is the white house to they medially colmanantisemit and now hed even bring it up right justkatarlov brought it up but wait for the wait for the the usual cast of characteris to sounds off andrubates as what fox newtos allowed to be set on the air yesterday is an obsenity and if anyg a horid dangerous extreme lie that insults te memory of milliong of americans to suffer from the evilman slavemen a fox nos told another horrid dangerous an extreme lie that insults the memory of the milliongs people ho suffer from the evils of the holicost there was nothing good about slavery there is nothing god about the holicospels ut no one said there is anything good about slavery of the holicost they said the resilient human beings some times are capable of making the best of theire their herrific situations which of course is true that of course is true that is the story of the heroism of the slaves makingthe best of one o the worlds worst situations in human history same thing of holicos survivers by trying to trying to survive trying to cultivate is skill set well undergoing the wors hors o human being can imagine but of course thay've to lie they have to lie first wall i do not want her this wite house talk about antisematism becaue this whie house is replete with antisematism this white house is perfectly willing to roast on a spit the state of israel in front of ron the perfectly willing to do it an tht they are perfectly wiling to bend over backwards for the likes of rshetof to leav an illhan omar is it them talking about antisematism i ne it is you on't talk about ridiculous gaslihting that would be it anyway ththat the white house con play the race card because this is what they have to do meanwhile on the right side of the isle it appears that donal trump is cruising toward at the nominational talk more about that in just one second first yere say very saud statistic merige rates now hidden all time lo n the united states more people than ever believe than a meri certificate is some m weird piece of paper or to now they did patriarical tradition others ofe lies them selves in they think they do not need a spous they they think they would rather be a dogmob or something well here is the thing men and women are both con vinced tray no thetr beter ofpings single that is a lie it is not true despitewhat the left would have yeu believe marriage is a profound good professionally personally mentally physically that is just scratching

master's program to day o cam meanwhile the republican side of the isle donal trump continues to lead by leaps and bounds the rest of the republican field in in turms ofthe national pulling wone o things that is ptropping trump op a top the re publican field is the fieling by republicans and pulling tet to shows this that he actually is the most bible candidates to go up against jobidon that that is ot wat thie tistic say this to sic suggest that ronasantus for example uld run better then then trump wood against bidon in swingstateslike wisconsin arizona george a but there is some national pulling that has trump up against jobine there is a latest messenger harrisex pole from july twenty first or twenty fourth and shows trump up four on jobidn thre's more ing consult pole that shows him within two of jobidon tere's a harvard harris pol that chos m up five on jobidon there' some pllin get ti suggesting that trump is actually outrunning bidon at this point and again in the race ford the republican nomination right now the republican nomination race has trump with a thirty four per cent lead on average the latest morning consul poles show him at fifty nine per cent sixteen per cent for to santis eight per cent for romiswammi six per centropens and meanwhile there is a a harvard harrispole showing him with a forty point lead over ron to santis am on with pole showing him with again a thirty point lead thirty to point lead over ona santis fifty four to twenty two the big story the campaign thus far as that no one seems to have broken loose from the rest of the field trumpish is sticking around fifty per cent and everybody else is engaged in this con of scrum near the bottom now the ethe expectation early oun in the race having for lot people inclo to me with that rondo santes gen a brake loose in this race right now he is in themiddle of a campaign shake up he just had to fire about a third of his staffers you spending too much on staff in to now he is a tempting to recapitulate his campaign i would assume at some point that he is going to get aggressive with the media i though that e's good interview with jake tapera last week the the issue with the rest of the re publican fieldis that no one else is going to start jumping out from the rest of that republican field maybe that will happen in the future right now that is not happening to santis gn to have to recapitulatin hiscan havf to relaunch his campaign in fairly short order now that has happen before to be fair john macckan was abandon left for dead intwo thousand eight in mid two thousand seven mid to thousands haven goes eemen charting in poles rudiguleon it was leading in all the poles in two thousan and seven mit romney in twenty twelve was baselo the front runner all the way through but the ar people jeb bush were running really well at this point the race in two thousand sixteens but' still very early butt things are ginto have to change rather dramatically there is a reason why the trump campaign is is folksing all is fire on to santus they the put ou a bazar statemen yesterday the trump campaign accusing ron to santis of collooding with the bidin d o jay which is superweeard on you kno what that supposed to mean they they they literally put out a letter s saying the santis and his establishment handlers have resorted to directly paroting the talking points of ratical leftists when ron to sanctemonius was most recently summon before doners to explain his flaling campaign his top lictendints admitnt to lighting donor money on fire though even more telling a top to santis funderies are confess their stratagu relight on endless political prosecutions of president trump by radical left is prosecures now their claming that toe santis is that somehow in league with the dogamin this is really week stuff here is the thing is that going to translte to a general election for trump this is the big question people should be asking themselves again i love to see the data supporting the idea that the strongest candidate not that he' stronger than by maybe is maybe is not an i have douts but the the data that he is the strongest candidae agains bidon is somewhat lacking and that is particularly going t be a problem for him given the fact that again a lot of the people who are around donal trump are now putting trumpet un comfortable position to day in a court filing rudigually on e tjust admitted that he made false aligations about georgia election workers and no longer contess the outcome of the georgi election tormember was reguallyon whos leading up a lot of the election narrative twenty twenty the dow trump actually one in georgia he was putting significant presshrum people in georgian now he is admitting that he was making stuff up in georgia a is any te of con matter and primary absolutly not is any of that stuff going to matter in terms of a general election a certainly not going o help president trump but right now trump is by farthemost orable candidate in the field he is proved that he has the support of about forty five to fifty percent of the re publican base and unless some othe republican changes there strtegium breaks loose it will be trump for the nomination that is at least how to pears right now now r publicans oure facing some retty up hill battles in the twenty twenty four situation over all according tothe wallstr journal york's highest court is now set to waigt in a n new set of congressional maps in the state a ruling analist say could position democrass to pick up as many as five uus house districts in the closely held chamber yourk republicans on tuesday appealed e most recent ruling in democratic lawsuit that seeks to throw out thistrict lines that were in place for last years lections and help the go peep pick up threseats in the empire state democrats said those maps r only mean to be in place for twenty twenty two the york stake court of a peals apparently is likely to rule along those lines and that means that if republican redistricting north carolina and ohio happens new york will then re redistrict itself and a presumably had a bunch of houseseats back to democrats sut's can be a closely held house of these battles are going to be on going to country s split very close to fifty fifty on every available line o gan meanwhile the latest an the continuing fall out from menot liking barby apparently the sugested endless national story and i'm confused as to wy iexcept i'm not confuse as i mentioned a couple of days gone the shop the reality is that i stepped upon the idole you are not supposed to step upon the idol you'r nots bpost to mention the barby is a bad movy our nots post to mention the radical feminiss radical feminism is complete failure hat's what to mention any of that because the idolatry of these movies of these cultural totems must be complete and you must be made to bow before them this presumbly is why the great intellects over at the view we are a de crying my specific cretique of the barby movy as always i'm perfectly willing to goon of you not only y perfectly willingy i'm perectly eager to go on the view it has been several years since i've suggested that i come on the view and i yet i'm shot i've never receeves an invite now i know for a fact why that is in i'm friendly with makin mckane who is on the show for years she retinely aske the producers if i could come on the showin they roetinely said now i wonder why in any case we will be golberg leading light and i any person who believes that apparently hitler was not erasis i in what wi'll be golbrg had some views about panning the wolk barby movy o be apise has no gene tail yeoa fof can has no gan tn e cannot be ats a doll movi and wol the cants no

capacity willy that is that is that is a stranger i look i should be in the barbey movy because of my stunning rying gossling wid looks i wo what we time by her o case just a few comments on this a few comments on this number one the insane gaslating by people will be golbrig's amazing they made barby into a cultural moment it is a cultural moment and the movy is staked with politics every single review left and right points out the movy is stcked wo politics they plise dumb ask game it is a really ridiculous clown knows on clown nosoff game well it is political i's important every one should see it has such important thngs to say bout the state of modern womanhood ndthe we are ye out what it has to say is garbage and stupid and wrong and bad for girls and the the it is just to move about at doll it ishus to move about at doll why supsed bout a movin about its all i know why you soupset that ouside about movin about its all because it is not just to movin about a dolg yet idiot's obviously you are really li or som mean thatit is not a movy about e doll only i's a movy about men and about women and about feminism an about the patriarchy we will tellyou that grat gerwick who made the dam thing you kn we will tel you that every member of the media every includin will be golberg but that this wholl retn al well i do not even know why you'r upset about this hunt inthen know why you care g firstof all the movbe's bad i'm upsid i wasted to mon two two hours of my life on the movy but what really is upsetting is the gaslighting is the lawing you do not get to say look at the superimportant thing and hen i notice i ya i thin it is bad noic it is not even i porntnt at all why youve noticing it it is irritating kit is thats snumber one number two a less a faragriffin i'll case i know a lissup catlesses to work in myke pencis office the first time i' visited the white house elisso was in aid to my pence an shofs a fan of the shel ga and o i'm only making this personal besolicit decided to make this personal let me points out here thongh we are talking about amasculation and all the rest it is kind of a masculating moving from mike penceis office over to the view were you get to be the designated conservative that all of your friends you are sudo friends dump on every single day and were you in points of favor and they pat you on thehad n give you little schoopy treats if you save the right thing as far as feeling amasculated on a personal level i jus that my fourth kidman ik gimmabrag i ii i my re productive success has ben assured at the point folks i'm not'm not particularly concerned about the amasculation charge from a liss of fair a griffit by the way again you guis i notice that you spent a lot of your air time on this a ye obviousle's important enough for you to comment on here is the over all tay the over ill take again is that for a group of wine moms who ar daytime drunk watching the barby movy by themselves crying an america forera wining about being a woman and then they go on the view andthen they talk about it and thn you mention he movie's back this is idolatry yyou must never ever ever speak ill of the gredigar wigs of the word you must never speak ill of a movyis importnance this and if you do then they will pretend that the real story is that why weave a note why it is it is a movy about adoll by the way america for as barbey speech apparently tok two days and thereach of fifty takes to film which s incredible couse it sucks you's get a points out it is a bad it is a bad take it thirty to fifty takes filling citizen cane here thirty to fifty takes for america for her to gives winy speech apparently greda garwig said that when she gave that speech every one on the sit was crying the men the women they were all crying yes only the most self absorb people in the world would cry over a speech as pathetic dull and and honestly shallow is as that particular speech and meanwhile in other news that made a lot o headlines yesterday brane chames whos labron chames his sawn and is expected to be or was expect to be a first round pick in the envya draft tat somepoint of the very near future apparently suffered a cardiac orrest hes since been released from the ice to you in stable condition according to a statement from the u s galan center yesterday while practicing bran jam suffer a cardiacaras medical staff was able to treat branie and take him to the hospital he is now instable condition a longer in the ice to you we ask for raspect and privacy for the james family well up tha media whe there is more information a bronics van i'l wished tou publicly send thei'r deepes thanks and appreciation to the you essy medical and athletic staff for ther incredible work in dedication to the safety of their athletes this of course led to a a massive amount of speculation on line that perhaps the reason that broni e chanhatacardiacaras is because of the wild spate of cardiacaras thof in experienced by young men in the after mauth of the covid pandemic if an a lot of suggestion that the vaxinations in particular because they cause a higher rate of mio carditus than the norm that because of that that is what is led to things branciv now we do not have any in formation about that nsoi'm not fond of speculating on the medical situations of people because it is quite possible it is a congeneral harty fact rite long before coved or vaxin ins were a thing people reu bouis to play for boston seltics literally dropped eat of cardiacars us a star for the boston sultics this sort of stuff has happene for a very long time thoke hundred the rates are are much higrer it is unclear just to give you the data it is unclear whether those rates being higher is entirely due to young people taking the covid vax or whether it is due to young people also acually getting covi because there is or rate of in creased mio carditis among young peopl who get covid as well now for the vacasas as vast majority of young people they are not going to have a cardiac arest it is true that the second dose of the vaxine particularly raises the risk of mio carditus four young men in particular according to a systematic re view of the evidence thots released in april of twenty twenty three this from pub med apparently the highest incidents of miocaraditis range from eight point nine to thirty nine cases for one hundred thousand persons in studyes using for stratifiers six studies reported in incidents greater than fifteen cases for one hundred thousand persons or doses in males aged twelve to twenty four after dose too of an m arna base vaxine they are lot f questions above the miocarditus of facts on young men i know that therer people why speak to friquently doctor martmacary over johntopkinswhos deeply concerned i thing we shuld ll be concerned over the rates of miorcarditis arising in young men after the taking of vaxine is also unclear at this point whether what the sort of differential is just to give you the data again is not political point is just what data we have ofvailable it is unclear the differential in mio carditus related incidents for a young people who have got in covidverses young peoplhe ave gott in the covid vaxine the evidence seems to show thet miocardas post vaxine is lest severe than mio carditus post covid but it may be that many more people who are actually getting miocardtus are gettng it from the vaxine as opposed to coveit we justont have solid numbers on any of that apparently there is a study by penstake college of medicin this came out october of twenty twenty two and found that the risk of veloping mile caradadis was sometimes higher with covinintin infection than with the vaxine but again we'v seem to mixed evidence on all this the only reason i'm pointing this out is because in the same way that i'm not fond of suggesting that everydays every time it is a hot day outside that is because you drove your car i'm not fond of jumping to conclusions about brane james is vax stadus or whether it was the vax that did this based on pure speculation we can wait for it it may very well been vaxine i do not kno you do not know nobody knows except this doctors at this point we will find out in short order and some very much o found of waitin until we have the evidence to u to determine what thecase now does that mean that if your eighteen ears old i'm saying usho geth t no i'm not saying that in fact i did not get my kids vaxinated nor do i think hat tat would be a wise decision i i think that basically unless you are morbidly obees or above the age of sixty five the evidence is very dicy on whetheryou sould be taken the vaxine as supposed to just getting aabout of omigran but wit that said again i think the wise movin all these situations and that the fact has become conversial cennicrazy is wait for the medical evidence to arrive as to what exactly happened to bronnie james before engaging in speculation ok can meanwhile over in israel the media are blowing up the situation in israel s of the country's about to collapse it is not it is really stupenens peoplewho are taking advantage of the situation in order to exass or bat perceived global weakness in state of israel i only comments on this becaue again is being treated ats top of news for everyone it is on top of news for anyone this is an internal de bate in israel over a fairly small judicial reform measure yesterday for example there is an attempt by the u t j as i mention united to ar judiis much is a haradi party of nultra orthodox party to push forward in actual bill that would have said that toristudies equivalent to army service and the colishan of which you teachas barbrling up were not putting that up becaus bad were not doing it that did not get the sort of coverage that the j that the judicial reform has gotten is quoting what a devicive factor in is rally society this is why wewent when you see for example the stupidity of moody's down grating the dat of of israel it is just ridiculous is really really stupid moody moodi's giving a negative report because there are people who do not agree with the thing of government did is really foolish it is also worth noting at this point that the media coverage of while look at that ten thousand reserve a say that they are not on to show up on a volunteer basis to serve first of all if there is war the showing up number too thereare litterally hundreds of thousands of reservice who we will show up but nobody ever pays attention to any of that all i'm cure to say when it comes to this particular issue is give it time it will calm down just ther are massof rites and france and thy din't get this sort of attention and the rites and france are much more indicative of bleeding social decay in france then the current conflict in israel is indicative of some sort of internal collapse ook a time for a quick thing i and then a thing that i hate things tat i i will admit that i am laughing about the m a santa barbara suburb that is very upset about somebody moving in princarrian magan markell according to the yar post when locals in the secluded sana barbara california onclave of hope range hurd thet prinarrian magn markell might be keen on leaving near by monts ceedard by a home in the exclusive subard they did

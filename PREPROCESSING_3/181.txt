account before listening any further o kan we are at act on exits strategy here is amy boom sunday january twenty sixth twenty twenty j f k international airpork this trip to zuric is a new not quite normal version of something bryn and i love travelling as we usually do we take a car service to the air port we can be fancy and also avoid the park in schlap and even before brian had all simers our combine lack of direction ats twenty minutes to all transportation transitions we have a restaurant meal before our six p m departure i buy a stick of lipstick and a small to with hand cream bryan by

business class trip to zur dignatasses office is in zuric and that is where we are headed dignatasses a swiss nonprofet organization offering a companyed suicide and it is one of the very few places in the world to go for painless peaceful and legal suicide in our swissa r poets bryan and i toast each other and we say here is to you a little hesitantly instead of what we usually say chanton where we have a hundred years a very italian toast there is no chantani for us we will not make it to our thirteenth wedding and iversary awei've insisted that we do not bring proper suitcases because i will not lug home a large suitcase full of clothes he will never wear and medicines he will never take and will not dump his clothes at the swiss version of goodwill and leave his meds for the cleaning stath basically i just will not deal with it with after after bryan has died and i have to leave him my goal is to get myself on a plan with my friend who has offered to a company me home then my daughter sarah will meet me at the airport and sarah and i will be met by my daughter ketlan and the two of them will say good night to me and my fantasy is that i will fall into my bed and not get up for two weeks this is absolutely not what happens march twenty nineteen stony creek connecticut bryan's memory loss began in twenty sixteen and it was small and then bigger and then startling names disappearing repetition information turned upside down appointments and medication scrambled suddenly it seemed we argued endlessly about everything a gregarious man he did not want to see friends except to fish he now talked only about the past his childhood and football i could not steer him to any other subjects in the evenings i said because i did not know any better that maybe we could talk about our life now as its going on him and me and his retirement and the kids and the grandchildren and our friends and he said sure but we did not and the evenings were ours of telivision one spring morning i've been weeping because bryan seems distant and in that moment weeping the harder because although i could see that he was concerned and truly sorry he had upset me i could also see that he did not really know why i was upset and reminding him of our long pointless fight the day before was not helping we still had the occasional sunday morning conversations that we would always had and cherished somebody hurt somebody is feelings and somebody is owd an apology which will be forthcomings sooner from me later from him but delivered by dinner time bryan was not i mune to the lure of the i did not say it or if i set it i did not mean it approach but one of the things i loved was his willingness to own up there would be a burst of anger the black cloud would pass and my husband would dig a little deeper and usually come up with a genuine apology my favorite i'm sorry i was such a knucklehead the clod did not pass now the apology was thin or weary or cold i could feel him through a glass and i was banging on it screaming at him why is there a glass between us where did it come from take it down and bryan looked at me with puzzled irritated concern and seid in effect what glass and please please stopped complaining about this thing that is not even there monday january twenty seven twenty twenty zurich we landon zurich in the hotels car service takes us to the pretty hotel in the cobbled stoned old town section the city's warmer than we expect and it is drizzling i feel shifty and out of place at the hotels front desk bryan wanders around in and out of the lobby and when i see him walk through a pair of swinging doors at the end of the hall while i am searching for our passports my stomach hurts as it does every time he leave s my sight when he comes back a few minutes later ie pulled myself together everytown the concierge asked me a question i fumble a suspect why are we here would be a map of all the stores on ban offstruss goucchi you bleau cartier may they show me the bar in the library i want to say to bryan that it reminds me a little of a hotel we loved in amsterdam but i am afraid that he will not remember the trip the hotel i am afraid that he will not but he will pretend that he does and i will not know if he does or does not which is awful or i will know he does not which is also awful and i do not say anything which is usually the choice i make now we are both exhausted by the time we get to our room spring twenty nineteen stony creek our normal life have begun to require a level of effort that i had last had to make when i had had an unhappy marriage a full time job a teen ager a toddler and a baby whith none of the joy having barely looked at another man or woman for fourteen years i was now imagining myself having drinks on a roof top lounge with pleasant but unlikely even i'm promising companions bryan and i were always stickaly close we liked a grocery shop together now i exhailed when he went for a long walk and ruminated late at night that maybe i could get him a small apartment in new haven with some kind of helper if needed how i could have contemplated helper and managed not to wonder why i was thinking that my sixty five year old husband who read falchner and worked out three times a week would need a helper i could not absolutely could not say i did not tell anyone in the world that i had these thoughts i did tell close friends that he was driving me crazy with his male mid sixtys early retirement loose ends and it will pass i said to myself and look he is making stayin glass i found the teacher made the appointment for the lesson and located the studio and he is going to his bookclub i scanned the planning emals when he felt overwhelmed and i ran to library for the book and he is pursuing the occasional zoning fights and our little town and studying the towns by laws with great enthusiasm really what is wrong i could not say but i knew that this man was not the man i'd married and the change had happen not over fifty years which would have been very sad but not puzzling but just over the last three years end of life it is amazing to me that people said to me well why go to switzerland i mean why not or agon or colorado or hor why your vermont there are right to die laws in those states that some people said this to me right before and right after my husband died was more than amazing the right to die physician assisted dying laws in california colorado oragon for mont montana new mexico district of columbia an new jersey main who why and washington require that you be or become a resident of that state sometimes quick and easy not always in order to pursue your physician assisted suicide and also consistently that you are mentally competent medically assessed as having only six months to live and can express your wish to die usually three times twice oraly and once in writing to too local physicians practically speaking you have to be damne close to death's door to get a doctor to swear that you will be dead in six months you have too physician interviews some days apart in which hou was sert that you are not pcsycotic or suicidal or depressed and hope the doctors agree with you you have to be able to swallow whatever the doctor for scribes without any assistancs choosing to die and being able to act independently while terminally ill is a deliberately narrow opening many people cannot get through it they cannot swallow well enough they cannot talk well enough they cannot hold the glass or mix the drink on their own and helping some one hold the glass is a crime in much of america people who do wish to end their lives an shorten their period of great suffering and loss those people are out of luck in the united states of america septembered two thousand and five durham connecticut how we met bryan and i fell in love the way some middle aged people in unhappy partnerships and in small towns do liberal democrats an a republican town ethnic types in a town full of northern europeans opinion ated loud mouths and people who were willing to man the durham democrats hot dog stand hot dogs and sider every september at the fair i overlooked his bad haircut and aviator glasses i'm sure he had to overlook my lack of interest in sports an my impatience bryan could talk about a plastic a zebau or aditional parking at the library for hours we have been walking together since our partners were not walkers and talking together in public at our local democrats breakfast club and then suddenly talking in private he said i was of three sport captain in high school and i laughed he said it would have been foresports but you cannot do look cross and baseball is that right i said and he took my hand he said what is your family i said jews from new york you he sid well were a football family we have three higesman trophies in my family i said what is a hihsman and he kissed me i kissed him back and sensibly we avoided each other for the next year after a year and some artines and new haven at the end of the day he asked me to take a walk with him he said i'm not stupid i know how this will end you will tell me we should not do this to the people we love or all tell you and we will go back to our lives where we should be and i will never get over this or we blow up our lives and be together i just want to say this he sad before we walk back to our cars i know who you could be with some one rich some one fancy some guy your sister finds for you but i know who you should be with you should be with a guy who does not mind that your smarter than he is wo does not mind that most of the time you will be the main event you need to be with a guy who supports how hard you work and wholl ring you a cup of coffee late at night do not know if i can be that guy he said tears in his eyes but i'd a shot we married thursday august fifteenth twenty nineteen new havin connecticut we have an appointmen wint the neuralogist we get there in plenty of time the secretary reception as nods at us from behind the glass there around six million people with all heimers in the united states and many many more with m c i mild cognitive impairment often one of the first stages of all heimers but not for everybody and although reevaluation every six months is recommended to people with m c no whepsite can tell you why frequent revaluation is recommended as there is no successful treatment for m c i or for slowing the progression of m c i to all timers or really for all timers itself almost two thirds of these six million people are women almost two thirds of the caregivers for those all heimers patients are also women there are lots of theories about why more women than men get to mensha but only theories i do not have the scientific training to assess these theories there are no comparable theories about w y women make up two thirds of the unpaid dementric care givers because no theories are needed who does not know sisters dauters wives of course they couldnto take care of some one with dimensia thursday july eighteenth twenty nineteen stony creek em ori day the appointment for bryan's emari is at eight forty five and it is only fifteenmenutes away we both wake up at six thirty bryan lies in bed for a while grumbling at his phone he takes his morning meds and tells me his contemplating a shower i encourage the shower because he has a bad case of serasis on his scalp and the only thing that keeps it from trailing into his eyebrows and erupting around his nose is the medicated sham pho he uses every day we have been talking about the seriasis shampoo used daily for about a year and a half looking back it seems a lot of frauht conversation to have about continuing to do something he is done almost every day for the fourteen years we have been together he is a good looking man my has been always smelled great and looked good and was vain about his good looks his wolfish smile and his dark thick hair i did not mind the vanity which was not excess of the mostly shared only with me about once a year he grabbed hi stomach and said if it was free i'd get a temy tuck after he had his cataracts removed he drag me into the bathrom to look with him into the mirror these bags he said you never told me six weeks later he was getting an eyelift when we would go out to dinner and look out on a sea of men his age even if weave been in a furious argument he grinne tap me on the hand and say how dy alike me now and i'd always laugh i did not understand why i was now having to say washer hair honey or honey take a shower now i undert dan and now that i understand i wish that it wis middle aged man laysiness or retirement blues or a man's response to being told what to do it is not i've been weading and as miled cognitive empairment which as far as i can tell our informative post emari meeting with the nauralogist will be next week a wildly uphomistic name for the early stages of dimensia the clock drawing test and the many mental stateis exam in our second appointment the nauralogist gets down to it bry an probably in a tone that says definitely has a dementing disease it is probably allheimers very very likely i say that on the websides they described the allheimer's trajectory as three to four to twenty years the nauralogist disagrees eight to ten to ma b ma be twelve but remember he is had these symptoms for at least two i'd say three years the nauralogist makes clear that those eight to ten to twelve years for bryne would be the end of life the end of his body's life i have now watched enough allhemer's diary vidios who records this grief and postsed on you two who does this i think even though i am as grateful as i am horrified that it is very clear that the end of the body will be long after the end of thi self by moving to the practical the nauralogist signals that we are coming to te end of the appointment she says that bryan probably should not be driving even with the g p s not because he will get lost because bryan jumpson i might be in an accident you might kill some one the nauralogist says we are both silent we get home when we cry for an hour in each other's arms we agree not to do much talking for twenty for hours our whole week end is crying and talking and binge watching teeby at night i was sure thet bryan had alltimers before the emarie i thought it is not a surprise but it was a surprise the way every bad thing even as you see the flames in the distance even as the terrible thing oves upon you breathing in your ear hammering on your narrow bones is still a surprise before we fall asleep bryan muses alowd about his wish to control his deast and how i will arrange that for him he made up his mind after forty eight hours and never wavered we cried and i agreed and he said to me you go research it you are good at that stuff which meant that while i was looking up exit international in the hemlock society and websides that would sell you both the plastic turkey bag and the helium machine for your own do it yourself suffocation i was also researching how to get fentinal an fena barbatal and sidian pento barbatal on the dark web i research at the public library not on the phone not on my laptop the internette tells me again and again not to search anything for my own computer and that if i need to know something call do not text and do not use my own laptop i was discovering the limits of my friends with medical degrees and the possibilities of carbon monocside poisoning in your car in your garige but it is become more iffy since nineteen seventy five when the car industry adjusted the ceo emissions and then a plied catalitic converters also we do not have a gorage bryan's dearest oldest friend his tishing budy since nineteen seventy nide ays to bryan if you think you do not need to go right now and you want a waigt awhile i can just shoot you myself in a year or two in a field bryan hugson and look up how it feels to drown lots of people have first person accounts about near drowning and they seem divided between peaceful brain fog as the white light shines brighter and clawing one terrified way through terrible suffocation and mention that drowning is away some people and their lives bryan looks at me hard do you kity me it is cold no and the depth of googo wormholes for end of life for assisted suicide for youth andasia for terminal illness and for making end of life choices in august i finally find dignitas a swiss organization to which even a fareigner can apply for an accompanied suicide if you meet their criteria be a sound mind have medical records supporting this have ten thousand dollars to commit nd be sufficiently mobile to get to the outskirts of zuric fall twenty nineteen stony creek applying to dignitas is pretty much my second job now dgetting medical records from the distant past and autobiographical essay from bran current dental records his birst certificat but every mistake i make ands up costing us two weeks and the thing that takes up much tide is a careless note on a form from the nauralogist that describes bran is clinically deprest he is not but it is exactly the thing that dignatas will not support i have to find a psychiatrist wo will certify that brya meets all of dignatas is criteria bryan is a certain kind of co for this project it does not want a particip aten discussions below his paygrade he does not want o over here troubling or puzzling discussions e does not want any bad news he does not want any unsolve problems presented and regular progress reports are appreciated no meeting should last more than ten minutes occasionally when we had a speed bump of which he is aware he says this is crazy it is my life i should get to decide how to end it most days he seems to feel that i've got the situation well in hand that the end is coming too soon certainly but not right around the corner not before we can do she in a movy many more times and that nothing bad will happen in the process which will unfold as we expect this is not true that nothing bad will happen and therefore not comforting to me it leaves me quite alone with reality but the way he feels is exactly what i want for him talking with a friend i rant about the american health care system our refusal to let people die dignified and comfortable dess the money made off suffering the doctors unable to face their limits and meet the needs of their patients nobody can talk about it i say nobody seems to know with their doing there is literally no treatment the most advanced all himers research in the world says eat fucking blueberries ghet enough fucking sleep my friend nots and if november twenty nineteen stony creek it is the day before thanksgiving and dignatas tells us we now have the provisional green light this is the call we have been working towards since august bry an hugs me hard because we have accomplish the thing we wanted to accomplish and done it together and he loves team work and then the light changes and dims and i am in the world without him in it he sees clearly the world going on without him me alone in the kitchen and him not next to me we cry in each other's arms and without speaking we go right up to bed for a nap at eleven a m and only come down when the kids come through the door ready to start thanksgiving prep i start dropping things i dropped the syramic piwaights on to the kitchen floor i drop an entire open bottle of corn syrup into a bowl of butter and eggs i burn the toast i actually set one pie on fire in the oten and quidruple the amount of bourbon in the other that no one who is not a contucky drunk could eat it thanksgiving is done christmas is coming and is my mother in law bran and i already knew a lot about all himers from my mother in law's best friend of fifty years joann yvann's best friend was an ant to bryan a regular dinner guest formidably well dressed in the nancy ragan mould a great golfer a devoted philanthropist to causes i reviled and my mother in law's boon companion for movies dinner and drinks at the club she had descended into all himers these last few years as if on an express first she complained about the cleaning lady then she complained about her occasional guests then she complained about her son then she complaind that valuables were being moved to odd places and probably stolen then she could no longer navigate not even on roads she driven for fifty years then she became violent and tearful afraid of the terrible real and imaginary forces beyond her control and then she did not have the capacity to behave well in the communal dining room were dress appropriately for the yoga class or even to keep herself clean and get along with her health care aid then her son moved her into a memory carry unit aen she still knew my mother in law and weeping at every visit begged her friend to take her home evan shared every detail of her dear friends to climb with bryan who took note i love my mother in law bryan often quoted a favourite saying of hers we are not here for a long time were here for a good time you can imagine how often he said that i had not said anything to ivan over the phone now i stand outside her bedroom door on our second floor until i hear bustling sounds i knock and she lets me in she is already nicely put together i sit on the bed beside her and tell her about our plaan with dignitas she pulls away from me and wipes her eyes and i waight with my hands clasped i do not want a scene but if there is one i wanted to happen while bryan is still asleep then she says i am relieved i realized that last night i was praying about this and praying all night and or realize that what i prayed for was that he would not have to suffer as joann does i'm shock that i'm relieved but i am we hold hands and cry and she says that i was a gift to her son and i throw myself in her arms as if she is my own mother discember twenty nineteen stony creek i am practising being a widow preparing myself to do things alone taking down the strings of lights by myself listening to brittney howard and having a snack it is about as much actual widow hood as our granddaughter ive making a fist and waiving at overhead saying ferociously when i do this i am magic and you cannot catch me monday january twenty seven twenty twenty zurich we have an appointment with doctor g at our hotel as i understand it doctor g is both our guyde through the process and a possible speed bump the friend of a friend who brought her father with braincanswer to dignitas told me that it was very important the bryan open the hotel room door showing that he is in charge of the process i tell bryan this and he nods but i can tell he is not going to jump up at the first knock bryan is not some one who rushes period to host at any gathering we have ever had he loves being the guest and he makes up for it by doing a ton of dishes after i do not know how to make sure he answers the door or even if it is important i just keep saying the doctors gan a knock on our hotel room door am also worried about ettiquette will the doctor expect a cup of tea does he look the grim reeper no and no the doctor does knock on the door and i almost scream bryan strolls over to the door and is his most amiable and pleasant bryan self we us to say the bryan could talk to any one he could make small talk with a stump and in the end that stump would be hugging bryan good bye thanking him for a great evening and inviting us all to the next stump get together doctor g is a small man with large lovely mournful eyes we all shake hands and bryan and doctor g sit across from each other i asked doctor g if i can stay for the conversation and he looks surprise he says gently that of course i should stay as this all concerns me as well i begin crying and both men look at me kindly i pour myself a glass of water doctor g moy she sys that is my father's name and i feel lightly bless somehow and i know that i have lost my mind asks about our flight he mentions complaining lightly just on passon and what i can only describe is the jewish fashion of complaining while assuring us at the beg inning an end of each sentence that he has certainly not complaining that he hapt to come late at night because he was at a concert in the city and it was most convenient coming after the concert because he lives by the lake and does not come into town every day but since we chose to stay in the old town he had to make a special trip just to see us not that he is complaining i beg him to take a glass of water and he does probably i'll stop crying he opens a folder and says to bryan after i read your application i knew i would see you but i did not think it would be this soon bryan says it is not a big window i mean no one knows how long they have how much time they have to make this choice doctor g looks he might argue but insaid he says your absolutely right he says to bryan i will ask you several times many times if you are sure that this is what you wish to do and i want you to understand that at any time at any time between now and the final act you are free to change your mind and not do this i hope you will not do this he says softly and bryan nods doctor g says are you sure that you wish to end our life on thursday bryan says that he is sure i start crying again and thank god both men ignore me again doctor g smiles and nods it seems to me he says pleasantly holding up the folder you do not believe in anything mister michi bryan laughes and says i believe in a lot of things but religion in the after life are not among them well doctor g says chucoling youill find out before i will let me know bryan smiles doctor g's tone changes let me tell you what will happen you will arrive at our apartment building and the suburbs assuric in the morning by tenn a m do not be late you will be greeted by two people from dignitas they will invite you in you can take your time he says there will be no rushing there is some paper work there are chocolates they will give you an antiametic he says you will not vomit you have up to an hour after that to make your choice about drinking the drink if you need more time they will administer the anti ametic again and again you will have about an hour after that to drink the drink ofter you drink it it is a little bitter he says and i wonder how he knows after you drink it you will fall into a light sleep then a deep sleep then it will be over mis is emichin you can sit with him for a long time i'm glad he calls me missis emichi i know bryan always gets to kick out of that bryan nods attentively doctor g says at any time in this process you may change your mind right now or thursday morning no one will be surprised or distrest we will all be glad for you i do not know why this would be perhaps i would be glad too but only if it meant the spell was broken and my whole husband was returned to me and to himself and these last years turned out to have been just a terrible test one poisoned apple after another to prove that my darling deserves the life he had before bryan shakes his says i know what i'm doing he says this is the right thing for me doctor g nods i see that he says but i will keep asking bryan and i sit back down after he is gone i say that doctor g seemed nice and bryan agrees bryan says it is going o k and i agree we sleep side by side finger tips touching thursday january thirty if twenty twenty zuric the night passes and the next morning we have a car take us to fafacon where dignatas has its apartment or house i could not really tell it is a residential structure in an industrial park two nice women in nice clothes sweaters and slacks amay i feel that an effort was made they did not just throw on their sweats and come over read us they have dressed for the occasion of shepherding us across the river and they take it seriously i have never been treated with such seamless attentive tack they walk us in up a few steps to the door and i see a snow covered garden the kind of gesture toard a garden that you would find in an industrial park and into a large odd imaculate room the seating in every corner two small arm chairs a large pleather re clainer a pleather sofa and a hospital bed as well it dawns on me later that it is important that everything that can be sat on or laid down upon be washable in the center of the room there is a table with several chairs the ladies bring our paper work to the table and point out the many bowls of chocolates they review all of the steps which bryan and i cannow both resight they look at him closely and say at any time in this process andcluding after you drink the antiametic you can choose not to do this we will be very supportive of you changing your mind rest assured we are assured the only sine of reluctance on bryan's part is what he warned me about his making conversation before taking the sodium pentobarbatol he said to me that he thought he might be inclined to just bulsh it around for a while when the time came to take it i know i have to go he said i know i'm going i'm ready i'm just not in a hurry he does not hurry he drinks the antiametic and gets comfortable on the couch i sit next to him holding his hand but i have to let at go because he is gesturing while story telling the stories are all about football at yale and his coach carm cosa and i could tell them with him bryan and a friend winding up and jale because of a young don fight in front of the ancher bar and carm cosa stern and forgiving bailing them out bryan talking about quitting football because he did not get to play enough his first season and carm telling him that he e carm would let bryan play when bryan was good enough and not before and bryan resolving to be good enough bryan's father and carm cosa playing hamball together one time his two fathers i cannot manage to look interested in these stories because i'm not bryan says nothing about his life about our life about our love about the children and grandchildren nothing about the beautiful public housing he desined and cared about deeply were the work he did for conservation and open spaces were even and i must be reaching here about fishing but i do trie not to look i'm an agony which i am the ladies weight in the back room a kitchen i think and after about forty five minutes they come out again they tell us that the antiametic has now worn off and if bryan wishes to continue i do he says he will have to take it again they say you can take your time and i roll my eyes because of corse ye will he always does i think as if we are in some other room on some other occasion and then i remember where i am and i am ashamed of myself bryan smile slightly but times youre plain he says and i have never felt bad about being me and my entire life he takes the antiametic again and the ladies put an airplane pillow around his neck bryan fall silent and now i long for the football stories i take both of his hand s and he lets me i love you i love you i love you i say i love you much i love you too he says and he drinks the sodium pendobarbatol i kiss him all over his handsome weary face and he lets me it is impossible to think about the next twenty minutes i keep my eyes and hands on him as if i'll forget what is to breathe next to him or feel his presents i do not not for a minute i hear his breathing when i go to sleep and i feel his body heat when i wake up he falls asleep holding my hand and his head falls back a little on the neck pillow whose purpose i now understand is breathing changes and it is the last time i will hear him sleeping breathing deeply and steadily the way he has done lying beside me for almost fifteen years i hold his hand i can still feel its weight and warmth his skin coloure changes from ruddy to palor pink i sit there and sit there as if some other thing will now happen he is quite pale and i see that he is gone from this world i sit holding his hand for a long time i get up and wrap my arms around him and kiss his forehead as if he is my baby at last gone to sleep as if he is my brave boy going on a long journey miles and miles of naught there is not much else to do the ladies would me to go before the swiss police come it is simpler they say i does not feel that we have done something illegal but i can tell that it would be better perhaps better for me for dignitas for me to not be around while a swiss policeman identifies bryan's body that is what his passport and dentle records are for as i understand it i call an uber and huggd the ladies i hid to the airport in the zuric airport i sit in the fancy lounde and i look around for faces people watching since the moment of bryan's death i find most people especially men disgusting not just unappealing but disgusting lik yesterday's oatmeal liked eels in a bowl i find hetero sexual couples dismaying in the lounge i feel an alien examining pairs of earthlangs what is the meaning of that how could a creature that be the choice this other creature makes how can one recognized choice in these random movements september fifteenth two thousand and seven durham connecticut our a wedding day my mother is not there to see it and that is my only grief the last time she was in the hospital bryan dropped me off and went to park my mother waved me into her room and kissed me is bryan coming up she said when i said yes she practically push me off the bed and began firmly and pleasantly directing me and how best to help her bed jacket come losh and lipstic

sheis folmd the first commedy special she sho on tik tok was the rooms in your city the most famous headgine o still and o what makes her act unusual is that it is happily and was gitaly from her point of view is an immigrent mm born in india here she is telling a raudience pesimly she truly did not know about college in america till zoya got to stamfor i am ungoin te os bigest tat did you li non tan in thi san sin te banins don gen in ti si whon the gids an a study you los o no y o a mii ls to i o olita an sa ls a os i go she wa a on iane san ai e on asiaay she dells te audience about the fun non computer class that her daughter wanted to take it stamford seais e sa as do i a as do oaaes t aatea ta iao mysi aaaaai saa oin main i as zen is entire act is this tricky thing of embracing every steriotype of the emigrant indian mam while also cnan winking at the audience i know this is over the top i know how funny this sis she does is bit about telling zoya not to become friends with kids an stamford who might por down the ron path youde n ransa an the woundi atins majorno io yos i o ioo dama re who a ais do i n have to say agasa this is bot the joke and it really happen at cafe one day she told zoya the kinds of majors that she might look for hen she makes friends at school odo sh i thought she was joke ga an y when she first said i rat up i was among you r hilariasn't yhusic whyy are you laughing her mam is jroking on stage and it is real to get where her mam sina is coming from in all this of some background cabyt the pivital moment in zarnes life was when she as fourteen back an india her mom died and this completely crushed her dad zarna was the oungest of four kids i needid not one to keep razing one last child he went aget her married off soon as possible and i did not wante gat might i was that kid who was curious and loved education and wanted to read about the wood and and olso i was heavinly influencs by american botcugion i read arche is comics i watched trees company that te besha of course i was said no ones married there an just living i evr rey seems fin she said known a marriage her dag kicked her out she had to make her own way in the world she remember standing out in the ran front i the ouass embassy whe would not accept her paper work to come here sfindly made it here got a lod agree placed an ad to find exactly the kind of husband she wanted which is a wholother story and since then she has devoted herself completely to or three kids get them to a life that is safe and secure and very unlike her untean aged life soya is the oldest of the pilot project i eversoya this ment just years of mathcamps and tutoring every summer and volunteary jobs at her mamaranged and after schoolectivities all to get a good college and ultimately a safe comfortable job in teck or engineering or may be medicine e ten grit wen soy was at home and high scholl but now it is stamford threats to this plan or just everywhere oneof the biggest threats this american idea that a college kit should explore take the crasses they enjoy find what makes them happy as a berit n the happiness of my child is a last thing on my line again she lovers it punch ine it is totally over the top but also she is not getting it is the last thing it now if beoming eating gandin makes a git happy but ti do not giveer to them do you think she is being tricked and to thinking happiness is important by by people in america yow ye absolutely hundred percent hundred prsenti something soni says to a bunch of my questions does she know what is best for her family yes hundred per cen does she thing her children would thank her one day foreseing the hard decisions for their lifes that they might not just now a hundred per cent with this i mind zarna is still trying to control soya's life from the other side of the country to a remarkable stem i princence she tacts the ara and soya' storm ocheckonsoya's room to make sure she s working she has veriest people that she knows or just meats call zoya to givin couraging pemptoms about how great a life in computers her medicine is goin to be she consults wi soy and pretty much every aspect of her life this up impulse hor control her daughter is instinctive and thorough that after i interviewed zarna zarna called zoya who i had not interviewed just yet with instructions on what to say to make well she just said on she just said when they ask you do you control me you should say now wait but is not telling you to tell us that she has not controlling rather controlling i think that that is the thing about my mob is she does not think she is of a critical ecause it all comes from a place of just pure love and and she give me i little lines of explanations of what i should say and wife i'm sorries i should tall and i was just kind of yod those are good ideas and she was ike eger to dearan is i yeknow i might em promalise and jusic no improvisation we nen to play i gra somebody is not s ticking with a plan but since she arrived at stamford zoy has been pushing back on her mom more than she ever has and the biggest thing they disagre e about the most serious boutle front in this war over how much control zarna gets of rezoya's life is what classes it should take when a saia was your mam's voice in your head when you er picking your classes her answer showed just how much her mam's voice is in her head a hundred persit if i last year when soy was a freshman her mind dids think very unusual for a stanford parent she sat in when i is zume meetings with her academic advise her mostly lurking off camera and making her wishes known tozoya but sometimes speaking up he remembers one call for insance with an viseher i think the most embarrassing part of the call was my mam saying zo i is only supposed to take competer siets but she should only take cam peer's iyes and then i think what was embarras sing was she had said that right after i had gone on this whole tandand about how i loved learning about ladden and ancient cultures and then she was but zo ia needs to take com peter sianse almost as if she had not heard what i had said and the i cadomace adviser was her face just dropped it was just embarrassing i think she is thinking all tipiga an ma grant ma once to controll indian daughter to do stap which i just a hat bet cause were not even a stereot tipically cultural family and just was the worst feeling i did not want to be seein as we that i did not wnt seen be seen as id worked hard to create this i daity that was not just indian girl does stap that important to me i want to be complex and interesting and seein as more than that nd i feel i'm cot in this miss match of culturers and miss match of understanding of what education looks and to be crer she does not think her ma mis entirely wroa whene mamm says i'm paying for this why shouln't i coet to pick your courses part of sory thinks thi ca why should she be spending her mamm's money to take an english cass her mamm does not is not that selfish of her but sha just how messy and complicated all this is between them i need to tell you this next story zoya nows her mam well and is such a forceful forward looking kid the zoya is the reason that her mamm sarna became a stand u commedian at all four years ago when she was sixteen i saw how unhappy her mamm was she traind to be a lawyer but did not it an stop when she hat her kids she ehol raising the kids for years here zana i was dying but i gouldn't for get out what der do i could not for get ot what i should do and she said to me mam on my friends love hanging out with you because they think your funny why do not you no comedy and i was not whan she talking about whos scom mi come and watch whan i have to sand what am i n on der say i do not know what gomedy people do and she is no ma i really think you should do stand up gommeny and i thought she had lost her mint she had much fear going in to stand of comedy i mean it took me six months of being mom you can do i mm you can do t you are good at this you all my friends would wont to come to my house cause she was just funny and lively she just had such a geft a her all always her answer was oh i'll just be a secretary somewhere or i got a law degree i could to go exercise my wotic e could go practice livesit wome you hated practicing lalic you love telling storys it took her all this months to convince her mamm that she should do what she loved and now it is not lost on zoa that this is exactly what she is asking her mamm to let her dou at college i keep telling her that where i'm mam the reason you have your careers as i said do it you love and she was a yow but you shouln't do it your life that is too starry andi lok i lwhen i ask her mmm about this she says it it is different for her the vizoya when she started is commdian the famme was financially secure they were fine zoya does not have that her mamjeu she needs to invent a life for herself whis she supporting herself and some she manage to gree a job is a writer a job in the arts i mean it it is a very unsaven unknown bat you do not know what next is tis hard for her to put that feeling oside given her past can i say for my experience with my parents who grow up without money and fought the way to professional jobs in the middle class i'm really not sure there is anything that zoya can say to sarno orzarnan disoya to convince each other is almos the parents did too good a job creating a safe wife for zoya and now she is not scared the way they are about how badly thinks e gof we live in fear at least my husband and i she does not and fo dat a'm grateful she is very american in that way that she is a little but fearless she is at whatever happens wit fi goured out but my husband and i in mygrants ad wed live in fear is it sarna does not trustoya to pick her own future because i do not see her as the burson whois driven by the mad to survive i ran that bisoya wow i think if i i needs to i i oi o arted re refond of o dat's 't say do my hed hav neverea i vervolates wit wit that yes she thinks that her advice is better than what you think you want for yourself because she is more scared for you than you are she is worried about you surviving but i why dof desisions have to be made out of fear all of the people that i look up too as rol modes all made ther career is out of something that just love to do even my mam why cannot i be motiveated by thain sead of being motivated by fear constantly i i thint she i wish she trusted herself as a parent a little by too she really raised me right and it is all there everything is sitting in my brainso i just wish she knew that and dit could trust out alof that zery said the hearing that it took

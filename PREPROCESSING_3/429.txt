welcome to the uberman sciencescience patoi mander hubermen and on a professor of nerbology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor wendy sezuki doctor sezuki is a professor of neurosience and psychology at new york university and one of the leading researchers in the area of learning and memory her laboratory is contributed fundamental texbook understanding of how brainarea such as the hyppocampus which you will learn about to day how the hyppocampus and related brain circuits allow us to take certain experiences and commit them to memory that we can use that information in the future doctor sezuki is also an expert public educator in the realm of science a few years back she had a ted talk that essentially went viral you have not seen it already you should absolutely check it out in which she describes her experience using exercise as a way to enhance learning and memory and on the basis of that personal experience she reshaped her laboratory to explore how things meditation exercise and other things tht we can do with our physiology and our psychology can allow us to learn faster to commit things to memory longer and indeed to reshape our chognive performance in a variety of settings as such i am delighted to announce that doctror sezuki is now not only running a laboratory at new york university but she is the incoming den of arts and science at new york university and of course she was selected for that role for her many talente but one of the important aspects of her program she tells me is going to be to incorporate the incredible power of exercise meditation and other behavoural practices for enhancing learning for improving stress management and other things to optimize student performance to day you are going to get excess to much of that information that you can apply those tools in your daily life as well doctor sezuki is also and author of several important books the most recent one is entitled good anxiety harnessing the power of the most misunderstood emotion and a previous book entitled healthy brain happy life a personal program to activate your brain and do everything better and while that is admittedly a very pop science type title i will remind you that she is one of the pre eminent memory recearchers in the world and has been for quite a while the information that you will glean from those books is both rich in depth and breath and is highly applicable by the end of today's discussion you will have learn from doctor zezuki a large amount of knowledge about how memoryes are formed how they are lost and you will have a much larger kit of tools to apply for your efforts to learn better to remember better and to apply that information in the ways that best serve you before we begin i'd to emphasise that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire in effort to bring zero costo consumer information a o science and science rely to tools to the general public our first sponser is athletic greens i letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic grens and the reason i still take athleti greens once or twice o day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essetially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you' to try ath letic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer theyl give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of datad now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if forgetting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athltic greenstock cam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolites are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok cam slash hubermen and yofll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dok calm slash hubermen and now for my discussion with doctor wendy sezuki wendy great see you again and to have you here been al a while it is been a while to geat to be herin t think hes to much for having me ha delighted i'd to start off by talking about memory generally and then i'd love to chat about your incredible work discovering how exercise an memory interface and what people can do to improve their memory and brain function general yes but for those that are not familiar you could just step us through the basic elements of memory a few brain structures torhaviser youknw what happens what i frnceis this mug of a te a it is pretty unremarkable but the fact that now i've talked about it i do not know that i'll ever forget about it a i wel ma that will not what happens when i look at this mogan deside that it is something special for whatever reason yah well i to see there four things that make things memorable nember one is novelty if it is something knew the very first thing a for the very first time we have seen something or experience something our brains are drawn to that our tentional systems draw us to that and when you are pain attention o something that is that is part of what makes things memorable second is repetition if you see that cup of tea every single day and every single time you do an interview you talk about your cup of teayou can remember it that is just aa how howour brains work repetition works third is association if you meet somebody knew that knows lots of people that you and i share many many man many people that we both know it is easy to remember it is easier to remember you especiallif you were somebody knew that i had not met mefor we have met before at association am and then the fourth one is emotional resonence we remember the happiest and the saddest moments of our lives and that also includes it funny surprising things a that is the interaction between to key brain structures a the amigdala which is important for processing a lots of emotional particularly threatening kinds of situations but a those threatening surprising kinds of situations the emigula takes that information and makes another key structure called the hippocampus work better to put new longter memories in your brain that in fact is the key structure for long termemory this structure called the hippocampus an tas i novelty repetition association an emotional resonance es it tells a bit more about the hippocampus i think a at least for my generation a while ma nerl scientist but for most people my generation i think they first heard about the hippocampus from the moving momento o yah where that as hippocampus yam and ifever those we have not see that movi it is it izarly constructed movi but an interesting one none the less am about memory but it is a nerrol scientist sometimes i perplexed at how a the hippocampus works e miybica if you would not if you would we step us through out what this structure is what it ae o meybe o few of its subregions because yo unlike vision the nomini've worked most of ye rear on where we know ho the ietis this parts an the thelemis is is porn the cortix is upward i mos milll perplexed about the hippocampisrincly o and i've read the tex books hat i've heard the lectures ye i love to get the up t you what are the general themes of the hippocampus is is structure ya it is function yet m what you think everyone including erl scientis i should know about the hippocampis absolutely let us start with the basics the word hyppicampus means sa horse it is shaped this structure shaped a kind of curly cu sh s horse that is accurate everybody including ourshi scientist should know it is a beautiful structure it is tisually anatomically beautiful with these kind of intertwining poorly sub regions within it and i think that is one of the reasons why early anatomis who ere the very first nurou scientists got attracted to it because it is this interesting kind of curly structure deep in the heart of the brain that is anatomically functionally what does it do well it is easiest to understand what it does when you a look at what happens when you do not have hippocampus any more what if you what if by some disease or or you have your hipocampus removed by accident what happens well we know this from the most famous neurological pace patient of all time a his a initials were h m all psychology and or scientists nour science tnts know him a he was operated in nineteen fifty for and the paper was published nineteen fifty seven they remove both this hyppocampi becaus he had very terrible epilepsy and they knew that the hippocampus was the genesis of of epilepsy and this was experimental his epilepsy was bad that they decided not just remove one hippocampus but both and what happened was immediate u immediate loss of all ability to form new memories for facts and events think about that for a second all facts or events you are not able to remember i cannot remember this interaction between us i cannot remember any the facts that we were just chatting about in our nurro science lives none of that can move into or long term memory this hyppocampus does something with all of these perceptions that are coming at us every single day every minute of the day and not for all of them but for some of them that have these features that we just talked about maybe thei're novel maybe they have associations may be there they are emostioally relevant maybe aa maybe they have been repeated some of those things a in the realm of facts or events yet a included in our long tern memory and im that is that is the textbook of of why the hyppocampusis important i to always ad and mean this is why i studied it for many years the hyppocampus and what it does really defines our own personal histories it means it defines who we are because if we cannot remember what we have done the information we have learned and and the events of our lives that it changes us that that is what really defines us that is why i wanted to study the hyppocampus and i think the exciting new new ideas about the hyppocampus was im is that it is it is in o hypocampus simportant for memory if you say that you will be impress all your people at your a at your coctel party but what people have started to realize that it is not just memory it is not just putting together associations for what wherein when of of events that happened in our past but it is putting together information that it is in our long tormemory banks in interesting new ways i'm talking about imagination without the hyppocampus yes you cannot remember things but actial you are not able to imagin a events or situations that you have never experienced before what that says is the ippocampus i's important for memory is a too simple a way to think about it what the hyppocampus is important for is what we have already talked about associating things together wit large any time you need to associate something together either for your past your present or your future you are using your hyppocamphus and it takes on this much more important role in our cognive lives when we think about it that that is kind of the new the new hyppocamphus that that your ascientists ar study in these days that is ventes is i somet it really sex context but it can do that with elements from the past the present your the future yes and a the topit fell for nursientist t the phrases domain we say the time domain amaing as wasjust value anythings in space it something the time domain of hypocampel function is incredibly interesting it is and and even the fact that we can have short ter medium termin longt ter memories n we can go down any of these raticls a i'll ask you a truer false most because i just really want to know the answer a few years ago the theme in various higprofile reviews seem to be that the hyppocampus was involved in in coding in creating memories but not in string memories and that the memory storage was in the neaqortexer the other overlying airies of rain is that to general a statement im that is a that te tricky statement because i think that ultimately yes that long to memories are stored in the quartex but those memories are stored in the hippoicampus sometimes for a very very long time how long is too long where you sail it is not the hippicampus and more if it is four years is that does that mean that it is it it is not stored in the ippicampus i think that is a that is a tricky question and yes it was coming up a lot because people were debating it and and some people did think that you should not think about the ippicampus as a storage area but i think it is a long long long term kind of intermediate storage airy may be not the long term storage area that is why it is hard to answer that question great as i recall agm could remember facts from before his surgery yes he could not form new memories correct and given that he had no hyppocampus it would at least partially support the idea that some of memories are retained outside the hippicampus however he did have part of his poster hippicampus intct a that is the tricky thing i think initially in fact schoville the the a ner surgeon over estimated the number of mill maters he had wont he intended to remove of the hippoicampus and then when they did this o the that the very historic em ori of chm later in his life they showed that in fact he did have that poster hippicampus part of the poster hippicampus intact now it makes makes it a little bit more complicated to interpret what is going on not that it was never uncomplicated any interpretation of a letion in innopation as is complicated but hm had this mithical role in in ner science an neralogy and now was it was it was complicated pbecause he he does have more the hippicampus ntact i did not know that athere are some memories that can be formed very quickly and called one trial learning a and i'm just looking at this listy a novelty repetition association and emotional resinence a it seems some experiences can buy pass the need frmultiple repetition o absolutely a i and unfortunately it seems that our nervous system is scewed toward creating one trial memories for negative events ragh has a survival adapted the mechanism a what is the neral connection that allows that to happen is it the imigdola ta hippocampus connection man as you and i know the seems every brain area ultimately is connected every ages ashion of out through how many notes just every sidy is connected to another city is not thequestion how many flights and w have to a traverse behem a get there what is it about one trial learning of it at at a gat af topcon tor level how d we how can we learn certain things fast ya and o her things are are tricky an now every time y look at this white mug it is giving up something special that simply by virtue of saying it ye ather was at one trial memory but a ell what is it what is it about very emotionally salient events that alow memories to get stamped in ye i mean i think you you ou've already alluded to it that is there is this protective function im of our brains that has evolved of the last two point five million years that you need to pay attention and remember certain things for your survival some things that get stamped in am that their memories but there there fear memories if i get mugged on the someway or the'r terrible things that could happen on the subway of is as we just learned im but if something terrible happens at something very scary happens am you remember that and that that fear and that memory of all those things i mean i have one when i lived in washington to yu see i went to work it and i ate on the sunday afternoon an i came back and when i rounded the corner to my door of my apartment it was crowboy barred in somebody had taken a crowbar opened up my door and stole all of my all of my the nicest things in my apartment which was not that nice cause i it was not making thot much money but ever since a ever since then whenever i round ot that corner i still had that memory was terrible because put me in a terrible statewen when i was just coming home and that thoes ta survival mechanism do you want to a be alert to possible danger absolutely yes part of those one trial memories i think is often taking advantage of this evolutionarily developed system to tamp in things that could be potentially dangerous to you into your memory you forever will remember this particular corner or this this uphallway because that is where something really that happened to you it seems a location we telk about condition place aversion which i es i geak pek for wanting to avoid the place for something bad happened or condition place preference wanting to go back to a place wor something pause have happened we an looking at a photograph of where you had a wonderful time with somebody in that can evoke all sorts of a positive sensations it seems at some level the yas complexas the brain is the basic elements of a feeling good or feeling lousy our ar states within the brain and body and linking those to places seems it it is a pretty straight forward formula yo link place to state link state to place at sat as your a description just provided when we learn more complex information youknw a a poem a ay a concept were we have to ratch it through a set of ideas athat also in wolves memory yw i'm sure that wll talk more about this but sto any way that you'r you are aware of that state bodily state can be leveraged to enhance the speed or the the quality of the of memories and memory formation because that to be clear about it it seems there is something very important about this forth a younthis emotional residenspant yon right a nowvelty the crowbar into the doors thank goodness is a sonething it was novel it was not gan heeted in ry an iveness repetition is out and the association is very very strong but for people trying to learn information that they are not that excited about right or that a repetition is hord or the the novelty is simply that it is painful yem i've been there ia as as have i is there something that we can do to le to leverage knowledge of how the memory system works naturally to to make that a a more straightforward process i i immediately turn to a the thinks that i've studied that you talk about beautifully on your pod cast which are a strategies generally to make your brain work better i was just reminding myself of your pod cast about cold a a because i use that overy oney oh you do coing to i just take a moment and and get tell to what is your cold exposure tein o in o con back av said my cold exposure protocol is a at the end of every morning shower that i that i take a yyou the showers is warm but i give myself a big blast of cold at the at the end of that and it makes me feel good and because i've been doing it for several years it is much less painful ocan that it was really painful aat the beginning a but it is much less painful i could i could handle the cold water and my pipes ar give nice really cold water a and it just i could feel i could feel the the awakedness kind of come come up in me after that and a and i miss it if i forget to do it sometimes i run back in and give mya cold blast because it is it is opping young i think you talked about this on your podcast what is hoppening in the brain basically the cold stimulus that shock yea yount catching your breath et cetera is a drentleane from the adranals but also from what we understand now some new neur imaging there is ap an effernan norup an effron r release from locusts trulyas nach agas a brain structure in the back o th brain got sprinklers the the rest of the brain with with a kind of a wake up chemical and there is a long ork mmomming release is not paper back in two thousand showed that it is a steady increase up to about two point five acts of circulating open ye a wort looking directly in the brain admittadly but it goes on for four or five hours now sarthy improve mod and the feeling of alertness is a real thing ye ye ye i use that i mean basically i use my morning rutine what is my morning wrwoo tean i get up i do a for if i minute tea meditation meditating over the brewing and drinking of tea that i learned from a monk i'm who has a institute in ciwan where teaches tea meditation lof it i've learned all about tea im different kinds of tea a and then i do a thirty minute cardio a cardio waits work out then i take my shouer with the with the cot cold contrast im and o and before that tea thing if i want to learn something and and i want to be able to i'm get over the ththe difficulty of repeating things are just just push myself to dea stuff sleep good good sleep i've learned that over the pandemic i did sleep experiments on myself and i learn that i was sleeping an hour less than i really needed i really need seven and half to eight hours asleep and i was getting six and a half and now i get get that seven after eight hours every single night and guess what i come to different difficult taks and i am more willing to give it a try to try longer to try harder and my brain works better and i think probably if you go back to all of your pod cast you will learn exactly why each one of those things that i do which i would bet that you probably do too is helping my brain i guarantee they are an a a'm impress that you do all thse things although not surprise and i should say that the extra hour o sleep is really impressive and extremely beneficial i'm curise you get that a in the early part of the night by going to bed earlier an y trivic and and i should just mention caus you are too humble to do it but i'll say it again that yes not only are you a ful professor running a a tenordful professor in running a laboratory you teach undergraduates you have a important roll in public education multible books and youre now dean of the the the college afarts in sciences at en why you the extra hour of sleep is benefiting you and in and as a consequence benefiting everybody else as well thexs for sharing with us your protocaul i took you off the trujectory whn i can do but i i think that people and and i aappreciate knowing you will come with the practical step o ye ys knowing the science is important mechanism i do believe is is important for inbedding a protocauls and people's mines and why they might want to do them but realy hearing that the the mechanics of it raseful it isels everything together takes about an hour it is not an excessive amount of time but it probably gives you an outsize po s of a fataa on your day absolutely i definitely notice it am if i not able to do it a and and when i do not s i i do the seven days a week it is also not just five days seven days a week and when i cannot do it it is usually early morning flights or things that an an am and i get over it it is a critical critical for the working of my brain lof it and i'll just high lihkt one thing that you said i before we move on which is tat you said when sometimes if you get out the shower before the cold you will get back in that is to me a a really beautiful example of condition place preference nowtheran ow they call showers and come something that you a sort of look for ird i you see that nobody is i mun from the a drennaland increase of cold no matter how cold it this is what is interesting about cold ere's one ofthe reasons why it is such an important part of the screening for special operations users or seal teems but o a other he branch is a military to which is that the're fir very few stimuly that you can give any one and consistently get in a drennalan oh intereselease from that without horming them o eat eventually any to use much he you din out tissue ye or with exercise yet to u much exercise you can damage join to te and it is this very kind of em a brilliant i do not know if it was intentional or not this sort of unintentional genius that they the special operations has figured out the ba sending people back into the cold over and over it never mandly gets easier nhod over time people at she start to crave it ye and it provides tis reduction and inflammation et cetera ya andom a beautiful practice thank you i want to learn more about your tea meditation later in the episode a in any event returning to ways it that we can improve memory formation ye maybe if you would tell us your story around this i know you have told it before mutton he'l lot of members of the audience and i loive here youhow you came to this because e drawing up in ner science i knew you as one of the i would say one of the three or four and they are all alongside one another not a this is not a hierachical statement at three or four top memory researchers in the world riht textbook materials szuki a in tat my text books are filled with the is not your last tame a according to the information on memory and memory formation you were doing that and doing the things that icademics do and you are till doing that by yes er in i still it a very high level but then things took a different direction yi be we could talk about your story and how am you came to the place you are at now ye because i think it provides a number of tools that people could em implement themself ya ye this story happened am as i was working to get tenyore at an wy you an an as it is a s a stressfilled process they give you six years t o show your stuff and you are judged in front of all your collegues and eher they say o kat you can doin the club or they say sorry you are humiliated in front of everybody this was theys going o o do tell people believe yav you on'l yget gen er you you have to leave youre institution and am you work really relly hard nd my stratage you was im i'm just going not do anything but work and i'm just going to work and i'm i'm going to ajust work as hard as i can for the six years and m what happens when you work and you do not have any sort of life outside of work and im you live in new york where there is all sorts of really could take out i you gain twenty five pounds which is exactly what i did and you get really really stressed and you start to ask yourself how can i'm living in new york city and i leve broadway and i've never i have not gone to a broadway show in two years am and i i i i twenty five pounds over weit i am i decideto go on vacation and a i went by myself coside of friends and i went to a i i did a adventurer a a river aftening trip in peru and i go by myself and yow meet other interesting people and am i i was the weakest person on this whole trip by i was i ther were much in better shape it was embarrassing and they will not say this they want admit this to me but it was true nd i kint came back an is o ca i cannot be the weakest person i' in my late thirties i have to do something i went to the jim and im i said o mi got in twenty five pounds o or wait let us let us try at least to a am looses wait and i go to the jim i notice how much better i feel when i go to just a single class i remember the very first class i went to as a hippop dance class o terrible hipp pop d answer but i still felt good after after that class and then that is forward year and a half i've lost the twenty five pounds froud of myself much hapfier and i'm sitting my office doing what you and i do a lot which is writing an i che grant which is our life blood rit and im writing writing writing and this thought goes through my mind that had never gone through my mind before which what during this six years of grant a frantic grant writing when i was tryin and get tenure and that thought was grant writing went well to day non't th that that felt good i inever had that thought before what what is going on here this is really weird i'nl know that any one is ath to i hte ir sur repli ti tat bught but am i thought maybe i'm jus have in a good day im but when i thought about it i thought it is it is not just to day my grant writing seems to ave been getting smoother i'm able to focus longer it the sessions feel feel better to me and at that point the only thing that i changed my life it was a huge thing but i had become a gimrat rather than a workoholick and that is when my spity cents for nur scientists popped up i said what do we know about the fex of exercise on your bran because if i think about it what was better about my writing is i could focus longer and deeper very importantand i could remember those little details that you trying pull together for your million dollar and i he grant from thirty different articles that you have opened on your screen all at the same time that is the hippocampel memory i was studying that i was writing the grants on on hipocampel memory and a that is when i got really interested in the effects of exercise on both prefuntle focus and attention function and hippocampel function because of my own observation an this kund of i still remember where where i was sitting which office i was in when i had this revelation but the thing that really sealed it for me that made me think not just oh this is interesting but i i want to study this is right around that time i got a phone call from my mom who said that my dad was not feeling well and that he had told her that he got lost driving back from the seven eleven which was literally seven blocks from our house that i grew up in and am i knew that was that was hippocampel function i suspected dimentia i suspected though did not admit als himer's dimention which he which he had and it was funny because i mean it was not funny but my mamand dad are two sides of a very different coin my dad is the the ad the engineer not active all his life but witd lovedan sit sit in read books all day my mam was the aphlete she she played tennis team tennis into her eigties and a and it it started to show at at that point and a then i had than i had even a a more pressing reason to think about what the effects of exercise were because i notice tha all the things that were improving in my brain suddenly went away my my dad's bring really really smart guy engineer in ly no sylicon valley helped helpe that push in sylicon valley ing the seventyes happen he had no more memory he could not focus'ss attention his mood was rock bottomi's of very happy guy and everything was the opposite in me and i started thinking this is not just something to help somebody who wants to get tenure this is something that could help millions an millions of people most importantly are aging population what if what is happening and the thing that makes me wake up in the morning is when i realize fat every single time you move your body a you are a releasing a whole bunch of nour chemicals and some of em we have talked about the the good mood comes from dopening in ceretonean nour gentlmin but the thing it gets released also particulary with erobic exercise is a growth factor called a brain derived nortrofic factor or b d an at and that is important because what it does as it goes directly to your hyppicampus and it helps bran nou brain sells grow in your hyppicamus we all hae that even if your couchpetator you can get new brain sells in you hypicamus to grow but it is giving your hypicampus a a a boost with this regular bedina if you are exercising which means that we all have the capacity to grow a bigger fatter fluffier hyppicampus and what i to give people is this image of every single time you move your body it is giving your brain this wonderful bubble bath of narrow chemicals what is going on i i mean my bubble bath of nor denalin and dopening in ceretonan and growth factors and with regular bubble baths what am i doing i'm growing a big fat fluffy hyppicampus and i'm not going to cure my fathers demenha elshimers temensha but what if i go into my seventies with a big fat fluffy hypicapus even if i have that in my genes ind it starts to a kagain it is goin to take longer for that disease to start to a fact my ability to form and retain you long trmemories for facts and effects which is my motivation for getting up and doing my thirty forty five minutes of averobic exercise of a day fantastic uem quick question about your protocall gea becas a and then we will discuss a few mechanistic things related to what signals the body might be sending the brain and alill bit more a detail on obedient aftin some circuitry you thirty to forty five minutes a sounds lik cardio vascular exercise might be special yes bat as i say that i and i think about the literature that i'm aware of in mice and somein monkeys an certainly in humans looking at the effecxts of exercise on brain function and typically the outcome is improvement and it ist always i yid only have ever seen a paper showing that when animals or human's exercise more than the brain gets worse no em i just cannot t think of a single paper does not man it does not exist i'm sure some one but one in the commen secti they will find that one and and thank you for if you can find that but em but it seems it is always cart of ascular exercise and experimentally in alabits lot easier to get a mouse to run on a tread mill yup than is to get a mouse to lift waihts allthugh you will have wat i ike awaits o ice an da the and that ways of getting mice to do resistance work is actually a little bit barbaric little fassin times thel the will incapacitate a limb to overload another lem yot an a som etric thing an nones it same as sending them into do squats ri i more dead lifts or something yeso a but carty of ascular exercise might be spatialye e what your thoughts on that and please first thoug tell us your routine you retin is thirty to forty five minutes of are you a pelaton pcycler an does it matter im i think that o the data suggests that as long as your heart raite is getting up for these long term effects on your hite campus and prefuntle cortaxyo you also a get better at shifting and focussing your attention am for that you need carty vascular and when i use is a avidia work out that i started even before the pandamics called daily burn and is just thousands of different work outs but i love they are thirty minutes that i sometimes at on a ten to fiften minutes stretch at the beginning at the end but m i love the variety sometimes i do i with weight sometimes i do it without weights i left kick boxing they have a lot i kick boxing in there it just fits my a fits my fits my routine and it is always there and i do not have to get a'll just up to go to the gim to ldot to work out that is that is what i do and that is a daily thing seven gas a week ye sevenys a week fantastic a in terms of that the way that some of these changes are are being conveyed from the body to the brain ye that fascinates meen as yn i know and m a'm sort of of repeating record on the a podcast always saying yuyet a brain we alse have a spinal ard and then your nervous system connects everythingevery organ in your body ibasily signal to buy the nervous system and back to the nervous system it resplining everything but let us imagin your morning routine you you you your cartyof ascul exercise ocasiete your pumping more blood is te definition ofhire heart rate stroke volume of the of the heart goes up over time you can fitter blood flow the brain is increasin do we know how that gets translated to a signal to release more bedient an y and then it raises this other question which is does it matter where your mind is when you exercis yeas ultimately the brain of course you can anchor your attention to the exercisu communicent to a podcast or anything else balways wondered about this ye ye t can we enhance the eff ex of exercise by combining the enhance blood flow with cogniv work juring exr yes yowis it simply matter jis getting more blood flow up to the ampus ye i wish i have the answer to that question to my instinct is yes it matters partally because of the work of your colleagally a crum on on mine set in the power of that change ho physiologically our body is responding how could it not work in her experiments and ar work in her experiments and not work for my my morning or our morning exercise routine but but are their studies point to a tudy i do not know if wen exercise a a nor a scientist out there i'v love to see you o that that that study done am yes it works am before i go into the a robic thing i was to start with the least amount of exercise to get something really useful because i do not want people to saocot a hay enow sweating i do not want i listen any more i was to start with am studies have shown that just ten minutes of walking outside can shift your mood that is part of that narrow chemical bubble about that you are getting dopening seritonin nor drenolin uam and ten min an anybody can walk for ten minutes am and that is a for all of you thinking that out there what is the minimum that i could get some of these banefects ten minutes of walking anybody can do it that is outside inwere note big believer in getting soto ya yes it am i think that that study was done indoors on a tread mill and and the comparison was not done but moving your wi which is great i some in the middle of the pandamic i walked around my partment for thirty minutes sometimes just for some variety a felt a rat on a running wheel bat e but am a yes that that minimum amount of movement in your body can get you the those mood effects but what about the big that fluffy bacampus what about the better performing pifuncl quartec that is were you start to need tha the cardio cardio work out and from my reading of the literature there have notbee eno studies am a directly comparing contrasting kick boxing with running with tham whatever whatever other cardio that you need to do but any cardio work out that is done pas these pas of effects i gong to say my interpretation of that is that whatever way you get your heart rate up including a power walk a power walking at your heartwaight up that that is beneficial and what is happening there are two pathways that have been studied about how you go from moving your body to more beady enough that that neuro chophin that is athat is a increasing the growth tof new hipicampel bran sells the two pathways of the fallowing one is a mio kind which is approaching released by the muscles and not your heart these are strided muscles am in your body and by running this these recities done in rats on running wheels they showed that the running rats had am more of this mio kind release the mioe kind pass the blood braingd barriers got into the the a rarefied very protected bloodstremg of inside the brain and that mile kind stimulated the release of beaty enugh in the brain that is pathway number one pathway number two comes through the liver a because exercise is a stress on generally how do we know that well cartisals released whenever we exercise it wwe need we need a that sugar in our blood and that is how the physiological a mechanism's work and a there is a a keytone am a bat a hydroxybuterate that we have known for very long time that gets released by the liver during exercise and we also know that that particular keytone passes that blood brain barrier and it is another stimulate for beat enoug kind of the final common pothway seems to be a beat enough stimulation in the hyppocampus is it the only one probably not but that is the one that has been studied most most clearly it is yew it comes from all of our physiological systems our muscles working our liver a responding to the stress of of exercise and what is it doing it is making our a a yo giving more beat enough peakersers to get into our brain to cause the upspike of beaty enough om which is part of your bubble bath they yure getting appotime you move i love that description of a factor from muscle in a factor from liver because any time were thing about movement of the body in translaying that to the brain as you clearly pointed out that needs to be tin eats tos traverse the blood braing barrier not everything that happens in the body is communicated to the brain ya an these seem really important signals a bit ha joxybuterate a you mention is a keytone a i just one a under sqort that does not mean folks that you need to be on a kedogenic diet i think people hear keytone and they think it you knon't i know som people are most people are not i imagine a there are keytones that are released in your brain and body that can function even if here am injesting corhydrates and oheetegenic just for a point of clarification a this is sue of nuwnerons is one that you hear a lot nourogenisis seanina grom ne nerns newneros and in my understanding is that the rodin literature is very clear en animals that run on wheels more often theturns out runs love to run only as ther studies by hoppy hosster of which are pretty funny a the're very col byway hopy as investigator om am not making light of the they put running wheels in a field a hono rote wild no as we run to the running and run on that running a eethet ther something really enjoyyi find amusing ave reasons that probably only a nerl sins ay ra musing a in any case in road ins it seems that a running more on a wheel can trigger neurogenisis an literally tha the the birth of new nerons an the adition of uwnerns to the hyppocampus in monkeysis has been controversial it seems it does happen in the hyppocampus and the meal factory bull yo probably not in the neel cortaxi ng back to the de not a moral controversy between lisguld and poshka rekech i hope they settled their their differences there a no scientist lof to argue ams on what we do am and in humans i think it is been a bit controversiali some people say absolutely yes other people say absolutly know ther nunerons added to the adult brain i have not followed that literature down to the detail yem but i do remember one study that i do not think it is contested which is the work of rusty gage at the sall canstitue where they actually injected a a sort of die type marker into the brains of terminally ill humans ye who very graciously offered to have their brains removed in dissected after death ye and in these vere in some cases very old terminally ill humans they did see evidence for nu nuron yes being born in the hippicampis ite can i trust that idea still is that a generally accepted well after that study which was quite a while ago ut there are more recent studies still controversial but im showing and demonstrating using even new and better techniques than were use in that that original resty gage study which was ground breaking at the time that im that suggest and i think sho that there are new nurons born in a adult human brains into the ninth deccade of life they not only did this i think those those patients were in their sixties than they they dide of cancer i but but these new studies alooking across the time line can we see because the other thing was ya may be you have some when you are twenty but by the time youre older and you might need these new nurons you have no new nuron growth and these studies seem to a suggest that yes yes you did yes you do and we all do even into old age ye great and em i'll just take a moment to say that i am personally not aware of any studies looking at other forms of exercise besides cardy of ask claritos side for sake of brainhealth and this i think is an important am gap in the literature that oht to be filled whether not for instance high intensethe interval training or whether or not wait training am which has other effects on the muscular churce you can imagine perhaps the myl kind to many enough pathway the pathway one that you mention might be signal but maybe not the liver pathway maybe yes i'm speculating here tho studies meed to be done ye my knowledge they just have not been done yet em and but they should be done if you would could you tell us about some of the more specific effects of exercise on memory o won memories abroad cat yourang of of e facts and phenomena thngs at what comes to mind is shorter medium and longter memory reaction time am learning math at least for me is quite a bit different than a learning histor am although there is certainly overlapp in the norl no lunder pinice what has been demonstrated in the laboratory in animal models but but especially in human yes and and if you want to share with us any results from your lab a published or unpublishe after that ye aughty to be delight to learn about them absolutely let me start with a kind of the immediate ffects acute effects as there called af exercise on the brain this is asking what does a one ff exercise session do for your brain and there a a there are three majour effects that have been reproduced i've seen in my lab many lads have reproduced this what you get with the one off this is usually an arobite type type exercise session thirty thirty to forty five minutes what you get is that mood boost very very consistent you get a a you get a improved prefuntl function typically a tested with a stroop a tast which is a test that a ask you to shift and focuss your attention in specific ways a it is a challenging task and clearly dependent on the prefuncle quartex largely and a significant improvements in reaction time youre your speee at responding often a motorr kind of a but cogitive motor response is is improved a over the pandamic one of the unpublished studies that i did looking at the effects of thirty minutes of age appropriate work out am in subjects raging in age from their twenties all the way up to their nineties what are the a the things that i saw morse consistently irrespective of your age everybody got a decreased anxiety in depression and a hostility scare which is very important it al toits it is not just decreasing your anxiety depression but decreasing your hostility levels making al al the letter what is making the world the better better place energy the feeling of energy went up and a what we found is in the older population even more thanthan the younger population we saw improved performance on both stroop and am ericson flanker task which are which is another task dependent on a really focussing in on different letters and pain attention to what letter is being shown a these are consistent e effects how long do they last one of the stadies that i did publish in my lab showed that the immediate effects of exercise lasted up to two hours unfortunet that was the longest that we last ther were still there at two hours am that is onou that is that is a pretty big bang for your buck that is one thirty minute sorry ond get up ta youg one to makes your understanser if when you say the effects lasted up to two hours do tet me up to two hours after you finished exercise were up to two hours of memory challenging a a work a yu thats just just to be clear yat that is a great question am my study looked at a two hours after you finish your work out we gave you these cognive tasks during that to our period a you ere free to do anything except exercise or eat and there was no no a extra load on people but two hours later you did do significantly better on these a focus attention tasks am compared to a group that a what vidios for for the exercise pared this was an hour of im ficling that they did these were youngyoung subjects in their twenties i am if i finish my exercise at nine a m even if i start this cognitive work this mental work at eleven i'll still see benefits yes at least by eleven because i did not go farther than two hours it could last even longer than that bu that i have evidence at last for two hours and and perhaps if i had starteed te cognive work and forty five minutes after my exercise ended it would also be helpful yes thi no reason o think that there is a yect to wait before starting cog agwer no reason at all i'm asking questions of the sort that i get and l comona that we are going togain the common ou an you always strive for colarity here what this tells me is that am exerciseing early in the day may have a special effacts right ai realize thit some people cannot exercise until later in the evening but you mention something earlier that i want a cu people to i's very very importat ho thing i've ever mention this on the podcasts which is any kind of physical activity will increase quarters all to verying degree yes and sometimes its to healthy increase sometimes it is did unhealthy ncrease if you do two hours of really intense exercise and you are not prepared for it ythat is a big spiking qarters all probably not a good thing prmost people but if you are going to do your carty of ascular or wait training later in the day that increase in quarters all can promote too much wakefulness for sleep tcetera shifting that quarters all spike early in the day as associate with a number of important things for lat to mood et cetera but more and more what i'm thinking and hearing is that exercise early in the day as key our former dean of the medical school fill peso what was in is kind of famous still for a jogging between the hours for and five a m hive and six and then running the medical school ooand you are up early doing or exercise and clash hour and mediantion will talk about meditation but this is more and more of a push i i feel the or a stimulus for us to think about moving our exercise earlier in the day yei mean i to say that i i know there there are moms and dads out there and they just they luck i've a kid that the kids more importanthan my doing my exercise you will get benefits if you if you do whenever whenever you can that is great more power to ye but wut all the nerh science data suggest is the best time to do your exercise is right before you need to use your brain in the most important way that you need to use it every day and that is why the morning for most of us is beneficial that is why i do it in the morning i'm enough to be able to do that am but yeit it it makes sense with all everything we know about how hw this works and how it benefits oure brain i think about our colleague a erican dell not incidentally hasn a no wbell prize an out y's memory and and a rumor has it that he is been a a a swimmer for a lot o years ye o put in i think nowadays he is in his nineties now he will put in half a mile but used to swim a mile a day something or i i heard that too that he was a swimmer and he does it very very religiously there thereare few other narrw scientists that do that i ginthing a lot of narw sciences that probably should exercise more and i do not say that is a poke et them i just would love to see them doing their incredible work for many more decate yes and everything they were time about to day indicates that if one does not ye unless you have incredible genetics ye we all experience age related to mension i dom in the story of your fathers is a a salient one and we should remember d that as we go forward i also one empecize an love to ate your thoughts on just memory and memory lost in general ye it seems we all get worse i remembering and learning things even if we do not get altimer ye when does that typically start for for humans i think there is much veriability am not only because we are individuals but because our stress levels are different and everybody's anxiety levell has gone up a in the last in the last couple of years but that also has in a fact we we do not remember as much in highly stressful highly anxious situation uas it is hard to answer that question people sa wa just tell me how much exercise have to do ilol ke to thirty day whari mo gan i to day but but i love them very day i've been doing this whole thing of telling people all the day to say a hunder and fifty to two hundred minutes or of zon too cardio which is kind of yet a moderately hard but not excessively hard but i love this every day the because what whenever i do that the questions that come back are would if i take a long hike on the week ends people certain ny gotiaty there is soreting thats vreaat powerful about non negotiable every day yes sunning your eyes every day even through cloud cover exercise for thirty for yo owward if i tit classh our every day every day u you don' mi understanding of the literature is that somewhere in our fifties or sixties we start noticing wll hiccops in memory ye i am for some people younger for some people later ye but i have to imagine that doing the exercise thro out one's entire life is going to help offset some of this and ike is in the bedi enough an have other downstream of facts ye ye i mean thats that is what it suggests when my favorite studies and then i went to get back to a yo wanted you invited me to share some of my unpublished dat o lase fabsolutely long frm exercise that first of one to share a when my favorite studies which is a launch tunal study im done in swetish women and this is published in twenty eighteen and what they did was back in the nineteen sixties they found am swedish women three undered sweet swedish women in their forties and they characterize them as lowfit mid fit high fit pe and then forty years later they came back and found these women theyd let them do live their lives and they asked what happened to these women as a function of whether they were low fit mid fit high fit in there forties they are now in their eighties i'm and what they found was that am relative to the lowfit or mid fit women the women that were high fit gained nine more years of good cognition later in life now this is not around mys control study im this is a correlational study but does it agree with every thing that we have been talking about to day yes does it agree with this idea that the women that were high fit were giving their brains this this bubble bat it' all maybe not every day but very very regularly for that entire forty years and that built up their big fat beautiful hypicampi yes it does i'm my favorite studies ye another caus for getting the exercise in consistently yes yen there is us i m impressed by this ten minute walk an the improvements an mood yen just atten minute walk a but again i i think that daily repetition also i have to imagine has effects on the very pathways that allow plasticity this is onething we in the realm of naral plastisy we do not often hereabout ors think that you as nar cisist which is at the pathways for engaging plasticity probably can be probably em speculating here can be made better by engaging in the sorts of behavior this stimulate plastise another words if one ye has better calming themselves down onestress the circuits get better a yan win that i isolutely no circuits gain proficiency ye and because blood vessels can grow caplaries can grow in the brain you can imagine that more pumping of blood to the brain delivery of yeus a various muscle and liber factors would also establish larger or more efficient portals to having that stuff there ye you could imagine i a cound of an amplifying effactof excess and agam speculating here but i i've seen this over and over again in collegs the ones who exercise consistently ye seem to be really really smart and doing amazing work well into their eighties and ninety and the ones who are not some of whom i should pride themselves on how little the exercise ye m they get worse over time you see them each meeting each deckate ar not poking fun at them at all i should ih cuite hard to see ye and there kind of a fading light they are starting as licqer yaum theres this incredible relationship between body vitality an brain vitality ya em that is of course it is not an excuse for spending all day an the gim right right the gimrats awill enjoy working outs i can imagine you hat but that does not make us smarter unfortunately ye soul have to do the cogneove work also i it is not yest th exercise right right id love to hear about some of these new unpublished ata yah ye o kate when i jumped into the exercise work everybody was studying people sixty five or older because that is when cognative decline begins and if the ideas exercise can help you with your cognition then make sense however i thought well that it is great there is lots of work there i wanted to know what happens in people in their forties in the fifties maybe even ther ther thirties in their twenties why because that is when we is humans are able ready will it wt willing and able to increase our exercise and gets us set set up to build our brains as we go into our sixties and the first study that i did looked at low fit participants from their thirties to mid fifties and we wanted to ask this question how much exercise you really need to start san benefits do you see benefits or maybe you have to wait until you start sheincognat decline to get benefits that was one of the the theories out there and that is what i wanted to do and what we did was three months of two to three times a week cardio it was a spin spinclass onspinclasses a great for cardio and the the comparison group was two to three times a week of competitive vidio scrabble no hart rate a change but but they hade to come into my labin and bein a group just they were in a group for the for the u spin class at we test them cognively cognitively at the beginning on the end of the session what we found was two to three times a week of cardio in these people theyere low fit which means specifically that they were exercising less than thirty minutes a week for the three months previous to the experiment they went from that to two to three times a week of spin class what we found was changes in baseline rates of they are positive mood states when up relative to the vidio scrabple group there a body image got more positive because they were exercising wi chist great and really important their motivation to exercise when up significantly compared to the vedios crabl group which is which is great the more you exercise the more motivated you are to exercise what about cognition what changed in the cognitive circuits of their brain nuber one we got improved performance on the stroup task but a we are headed towards my favorite structure which is the hypocampus what we found was improved performance on both a recognition memory task which was a a memorying coting task a and a that is can you can you differentiate a similar items that we are asking you to remember and and spacial episotic memory task where we have them play one of those dom games when they went into this spacial maze and they had to do things in a virtual city the performance there got better which is very very classically dependents on the hypocampus this i it was satisfying to to do the study because a a i've been wanted to answer this question what is a minimum amount tor duable amount of exercise that well get you these cognitive benefits and now i can say in thirty to fifty year old that are low fit two to three times a week is that duable absolutely well it be hard if you are low fit yah it is it is going to be chalenging but absolutely duable and that that is a it makes sense with all of the all of the a mechanisms that we are i did not study the mechanisms just to be clear but with all the mechanisms we are imagining are playing a role here that absolutely make cense and and it is duable this is not you have to become marithon runner to get into these benefits this is you have to stert moving your body on irregular basis two to three times a week and i i i love that for its realness how long are those sessions again forty five minutes forty five ye aske forty five minutes it is a typical spin a spin kind of class is warm up for five minutes ind cool down for five minutes as really a thirty thirty five minutes thirty five minutes of that they are worthy pushing you ya in tor their breathing reasonably hard harrate harrates op hartrad aressonly a ya n i find that the all those results arereally interesting that the result soing improvement in motivation t exercise o n think as he gets back this is you a cond of a self amplifying if thact and a the nor sciencis in me wants to a think about can of premoter circits in the fact that we have a motor system that can obviously you things lift cups and walk and ron if yo wanter any to but that a it is possible to create a cond of anticipatory it actin ain our nervous system where our body an craves a certain stimulu mention the cold and i ye yive the cold a whether or not that is eu gendleman in the dopamin et cetera or whether or not somebody who exerciseis start it going from zero less than thirty minutes per week two two to three times a week for the forty five minutes as your you describe for the study ui've had the experience before of if i'm jo that the cardio that is i tend to battle the most and i by i love lifting heavy objects and he seady for me i i'm happy to go to the gim every other day and just lift heavy objects for an hour in just makes me happy i likewat feels yet and o my beendoing it since i was my teen thirty years cardios a litle bet trick yere i to run but if i stop running for a little while i find it very hard to get back in yow an if i start running three times a week from thirty to forty five minutes and an't do this pretty consistently on the days i do not wait train i find that i start to crave it it is almost as if my body needs that in order to i always say clear out the cob webs mens it my mind does not function as well clearly now a ask gan why in why exercise helps but also my physically i almost feel my body needs to engage in that movement wen the remoter circuits i cont of reven i hav reving the engineor car wale a yet hark ya ya m the motivation to exercise obviously could be multy fascinatit could be purely psychological but you think there is any reason to speculate at least for believe that we can build an inticipatory resent reverbatory activity anos is not am ye ye i i agree with that because i also have the same kinds of foughtson and i do have anticipatory exercise when i i cannot do it i just got back from a week and we can a half in paris where i got to do a book launch of of my last book goot anxiety and i i i really i walked round a lot but i did not do my exercise for that whole week and a half and but there was a lot of strass cause i to do all these intervies in french i gave myself rigk yyou doty french i speak frant a sa otherwise o be ra at o would be reall a i thav your really an cres tati devilys ar exerci o ash i would follow your morning rutinto it but i can very ompress iv none the les it is but i got back and and coming back this direction from from paris i i live in new york is it is much easier an si was able to get get up in er normal time the next day and that exercise cession that first day is ok han back in my home i'm back in my envfironment and it felt good as i wanted to come back and and i know it is because i i worked up over years now i could truthfully say seven days a week but it was first it was four to fi ive been it was five to six an yat seven but that includes a yoke a day or sometimes i've do ou for ten minutes instead of thirty because i have to leave but but that habit of you do that even for five minutes you do either the the the wait ten minute thing or five minute thing or or stretss im that is tha a tiny habit it that somebody at stamford that invented this idea of tiny habits iot ot wese well we have got a number of people there there is em and i'm i apologize n advanced all the people i neglect in this statement but i'm happy to put in the comments foks em be j fog is there has done yes and that is who ia ynae jas done really i a great work and then chames clear rod o book about habits and i has has a very popular news letter about habits you have done in episore byt habits that cover some of their i work and and some of the the more laboratory iss ye not ish laboratory science pure revuted work on yes daily behaviors also daily behaviors performed at roughly the same time ai you having one thing we know for sure is that the circadian system is part of our nervous systems way of anticipating when things will happen yat just what will happen i'm telling you things you obviously yet no already but for the audience performing your exercise it roughly the same time each day we will make it easier yei suppose you are saying om in into it seven days weeks some time to day but of course thany as donehard sometime is better than not getting it o yets absolutely absolutely wel thethose are impressive of facts and i love that youre starting to look in populations that are bit younger not because some of these older populations are not important but i think that building good habits in across one's entire life inally what it is about right you as i was say with anything relate to longevity or offsetting an age related decline we do not it is hard eno things work because nigh there is no within subject control o what we also know for sre is that you do not want to be the control exrat i rai aga i you abso we do not want to be the control experiment especially for something that is purely behaviorl a meare not talking about in jesting a particular supplement you are not knocking about changing your diet in any way but i am curious em do you do not diet is a very barbered wire topic an on the in ternet which diets whether not they work et cetera but in general did in any of these studies to they value whether not people change their eating habits when they start exercise more ye i think i've seen one study that that controled for that but i feel for them because it is hard enough to get people to exercise at the level and at thi time and that you you need for your study if you also ask the ocat fill out the survey to tell us exactly what you ate all day they are goingto they forget forget you i'm at joining your study it is e critical question and a am again there is only been one that i've seen and and the evidence was that that dits got better when they a less process foods when when they did adhere to this exercise but lot more information needs to be gathered in that in that well the second study that i wanted to share on publishd were we are writing upright now is a part to of that study that i just described which was the lowfit people next woe move to midfit people what about us we are already exercising whow how am i going to benefit from increasing my exercise here again we collaborated with a great a spin studio that had a whole bunch of midfit people that that by our definition we are exercising i'm two to three times a week on a regular basis that is great all you people out there that are doing that you should know youre already benefiting your brain but our question was what if we invited them to exercise as much as they wanted ap the spin studio for three months from you do not two to three times all the way up to seven times a week and let tus see what happened and the control group a we asked them not to change their exercise a and what we ended up with was a nice big array of tarting with midfit people that exercise between stayin at two to thee times a eek all the way up to seven times a week and the bottom line from that study is every drop of swet counted that is the more you change and you increase your work out up to seven times a week the better your mood was you had lower a lowere amounts of depressian anxiety higher months of good a a good affect and the better your hypocampel memory was with the more you worked out again this was for three months i love that too because it gives power to to those of us that are you kno regularly exercising and wondering for really need two ames it really can help me and the answer is yes i mean not all of us can exercise go go to a spin class seven times a week but a i love the message that our body's responsive to that and and you can get better hypicampel function better over all base line mood affect with with a higher level works for the midfit o people as well tasy the more i learn from you the more i'm stoing o conceptionalise the brain as an orgin that is privileged in many ways you has his you need blood brain berrier a as his incredible quality of being able to predict things and its jobminglis of course to predict things among among other functions of course but that our brain is not necessarily going to stay stable or get better over time that it needs a signal ye ithat it is not sufficient to you say that we cannot take it for granted that that or brain is actually an organ that requires a signal in order to maintain its own function and it sounds enhanced blood flow ind these pathways that you described earlier these two pathways a are at least among the more critical signals a i'm tempted now to move my frequency of crardy of ascular exercise from i confess its about three days thirty five minutes lately and should be more at to daily there is something really again really special about daily the asnot negotiable ritgous do it right a and it sounds if one word to do higher intensity exercise in a spinclass i've never taken us been glass but i've seen theire times when they are standing up on the by conpeddling very hard yet that that is included in these kinds of work atsrotly i mean that is what the instructor is doing i cannot control we did mat monitor hartmat iof all the subjects and it was clearly in compared to the vidiouscraval wis i ley think i would hope sir yes gussa depenson tow intense that gaim a scrable a could we just briefly talk about a mine set and affirmations you talked a bit a before about a affirmations and as you mention that the beautiful work of my colligut stamdford aleocrum a and who we can sumrise her work pretty simply although we will not do it complete justice by she is already been on the pod cast at just to say that one's beliefs about a behavior also impact the outcomes o that behavior yef you learn a lot of true facts about stres bing good for you then you will experience stress as better for you than if you only focus honor learn about the negative effects of strise if you learn about the posif exs of exercise you actil derive greater benefit from exercise believe it or not nots incredible incredible effects but they make sense when you understand what the brain is doing which as lot of this predictive coding and mind sets do not seem as mysterious and wo any more once to understand what the brains is really doing but what is if any the value of affirmation of telling yourself something positive about yourself yar of exercise on not the exercise itself but on mood self image y memory and brain function yeso i am i i looked into this because i am also a ter bid exercise instructor and the form of exercise that a teach is called intensati that it is a form of exercise that was developed by this amasing o is instructor patiscian morano a and she combined physical movements from kickbox and danc and yoga and martial arts with positive spoken affirmation each move your punching back and forth as you would do in a kicks box class you do not just punch you say something i am strong now which every p unch is associatind with a word and you you can am crate your own series of affirmations with the moves that you put together and im the first time i did it i just wandered into her class i did not know what it was and it felt idiotic as what it i'v gav into the wrong class i clear i do not want to come into this class but then m i thaw they idn't care whether i thought they were they look silly saying these affor younot seeing yelling these affirmations out loud while doing the choriography at the same time and then i tried it oki did not yell out i kind of whispered it at first ah and then but by the andois really yelling it out there is something about the declaration using your own voice of saying things that you do not often say yourself i'm strong i'm inspired i believe i will succeed are all the kinds of affirmations you say and you walk out of that class or i walked out of that class thinking ah i feel really good now a li wa i cannot way to come back to this class which is why i ultimately ino took teacher training to veel to teach that class and im i a i started to look into what was known about affirmations and they were never combined with with physical activity but it was clear that there weres a literature showing that that a positive affirmations seeing them or reading them am could change mood in the same ways were talking about you knowlias crumbs work if you if you have this this it is a belief yonce you start saying these things is are not difficult things to believe but it is amazing how much you you do not say these kinds of things to yourself or with your own voice you might say them about somebody else ah you are you are strong yet you are smart do you say thom about yourself that is a thing about the the self affirmations it really gets you intou a habit of of saying good things about yourself and then you start to remember a start to realize whem my god i'm mean to myself i i have lots of negative thoughts going on about about myself in my head and which as part of the other reason why i loved this this particular form of exercise what you get in intensati is the mood boost from the positive spoken affirmations together with all the other brain and affect boosts that we have been talking about for this whole a podcast from the exercise because it is a sweaty work out as well interesting u there is a book i confess i have not read it but i ha had the a pleasure of having a discussion with the psycall just from my believes that universy a michigan in an arbor you can cross whet a book called chatter which fokes on a the fact that much ofour in her dialogue it is int he negative ye certainly was it the first to to a point that out but that explicit statements to counter that negative chatter i believe is one of the hallmarks of of readjusting one's own nonscious internal reference frame but actually self image ganerally yes it and it is o fascinating and and i think a very a impordinary of psychology in nerl science because and iand i acknowledgs were talk about this to laboratory nerw scientists who record from nerons and label nerns and look it stuff down the microscope we are now deep in the territory a deep water of what some of our colleagues and and a people who think about nor science would consider a really out there on the kind of subjective edges yand yet i think it is worth pointing out that youn the brain does all these things it is responsible for simple reflectes and motor behaviors but also high level conceptiol a ideas about the universe and what it might look in ten years or a hundred years or a thousand years but also high level concetioble understanding of what we are in what yare about yeand yeuven though it might seemil of it out on on the fringes a dere i say i think that these are some of the more important untried landscapes of nerl science yeand i i just one acknowledge my appreciation for the fact that i'm going t o connect the dots here and say you went from somebody who did not exercise who went on this rafting trip yethe discovered exercise in its benefits for your grant writing and then and then on and on and on and then became a certified yetexercise id instructors se a you do not do anything half wa theras it is clear a i'd to touch on a something you mentioned earlier but we have not a wiinto it all in any dept which is meditation ya a you mention this tea meditation you have had a publication recently on a ten minute medite meditation yet right cant if yo could tell us about this ten minute meditationas ye halike such a tractable amount of time right am and then if you would maybe tells il ab about the tea meditation yet sends i you have discovered a minim a close to minimums threshold meditation that can really benefit us ya yanmay bo tell us about that that is yany to the study was a as you as yo a very stutely pointed out very practical study a just ten minutes not thirty minutes not an hour meditation that is too hard ten minutes guided meditation they logged into a sight saond we can tell that they logged in and they listened to a a it is a body scan very basic but easy to follow kind of meditation and we asked them to do it how often daily seven days a week just ten minutes a day and the shock in the most tackang thing about the study is that we got moritetion adherents to the ten minute daily meditation than the ten minute daily po cast listening which was our control the highest retention rate ave ever gotten in any this cond of study that i've done exercise or meditation they wanted to do it ten minutes a day it was it was great a mente to start leading meditations the ator three hours as asten three our prodcast am we looked at cognitive effects a before and after this it was eight weeks of daily it was actually twelve minute meditation i'm twelve minutes of bodyskan meditation and a what we found was significant decreases in stress response to we did the strier trus stress tuss to see how how you responded to a unexpected dstressful situation the meditators did much better their mood was better and there a their cognin performance was also better and this was my first litle forray into meditation after i had started my my personal te meditation am a that that really shifted my relationship with with meditation and a am but but it is consistent with many other studies showing the beneficial effects of am meditation and but the unique thing was we tried to make it duable that many many people out there could actually follow this this typical megimen and a a and were were continuing that in fact my my research in my laborate now is all about those duable short things that and my you college students will do not just at the beginning of this mester but at the end of this mester when the stress and anxiety levels are now at record breaking high levels and they need something to bring that level down that they could show their professors what their brains can actually do and it includes very short meditations sound sound meditations visual meditations walking things that any college student but were obviously focust on in my eastudents m will do to a and i i want to get at graduation rates i want to get at the class performance with these kinds of a interventions but it started with that study that i just described meditation am if you would a and heres were we can highly this again as som educated spe highly educated speculation yast coming from you a what you think is going on turing meditation at i meen a bodyskin inballs a that intercept of awareiness i no interception f course being an intention to what is going on on the surface of an within the confines of our skin as supposed an the exoutside world am drawing our attention to anything inside uster outside asid balsforebrain i should prevon the quart expresebly an and other s tybically eyes are closed tybicallit is relaxing oother a lot of variables that can be feeding in to y number of different effacts yet but as a nor scientist what do you think it is going on that just that this period of conofin e self induced what unusual state what o you think it is going on in terms of net work behere and am that wore shoithin the brain that it can have these long term of facts beg out to some of the ones relate destream of exercisea in i i think there is much evidence i know there' much evidence that meditation is beneficial yes i d you think it is working or what it what you think it is doing ye i think that one of the most important things that gets am worked when we are doing a simple ten minute or twelve minute body scan am meditation regularly this ten minutes a day twelve minutes to day is a the habit building and the practise o focusing on the present moment i think that is very hard for as modern humans to do because i'm worrying about the thing that to do a a at the end of the week that that i need i need to do in how many hours a my going o have to be able to do that or i'm worried about whatever the female that was not as polite as it should be that i sent in what would the repret o reprecussions for that instead of focusing on this moment which is fun i get to tock to you ah it is a beautiful day outside it is a i'm feeling good right at this moment and i think that those all of the meditative pratic practices am that i i'v that i've don and this one also a whether it or not is getting you to focus on on this moment and think it is even more important in this day in age where anxiety levels an the next varyant might come out in what what are the reprecussions there and i have a mother whose older and she would's more susceptible to it and there is a war and an what is going to happen there a those are all future possibilities and and we should be worried about that hat that is a possibility you need to plann for that but you allso need to focus on this moment right now i'm i'm healthy i can breathe i get to have this interesting conversation right in this moment if i start thinking about other things than it takes away from this moment a do i know what circuits are being are involved not exactly that is not my area i think there are some studies that have have focused on that that moment present moment kind of a activity but that is what i think is most important about about the practice of meditation or one of the impo rten things that calms us down because if how to do that that gives you this powerful tool for the rest of your day you are not locked into that fearful future thinking that many of us have or that that that i just re living of the terrible past but you could enjoy enjoy the present moment i that really resonates i think that am going back to the earlier part of our conversation in this the hyppocampus has this incredible storage capacity and ability os set contact about past present and future and that is a beautiful thing because as much as i to think he had some semblance of the healthy life none of us want to be h m none of us want to be in the position of not being able to form new memories and have no contact to the past or were the present we are grateful that we should all be grateful that our hyppocampus a can draw from past present in future in various comminations and we should support it through the daily exercise another a habits let us call them habits that people make them habits that you have highlighted but if we are not deliberately anchoring within past present in future according to what we need and we are just shuffling between pas present future that is not a good way to live now it is not effective no it sounds meditation can really help us am go to the right stack i gets people on in the libraries and any more but in but in the old days you may go you may go to the right location n librat yos she cannot get to stracted by the the books that your interestinf you need to go a just reflectivele you need to go study a particular topic tha's come how i think about it ait makes us more lineer perhaps in our yar way of being i think in it actually counteracts not that i'm against tachnoledgy but having our phones and being connected to every good and bad thing going along going on in the world to day is incredibly distracting and and takes you away from the present moment virtually twenty four hours the day and we have to work extra hard right now compared to in the fortings when we did not have all this tachnolegear at the same level am y it becomes even more important practice thi think for for everyday life or even ten fifteen years ago am still smartphones were't disintrusive ya one final question and and may be a a a request you get am as the new incoming deen of college of letters and sciences and i must say am delighted thrilled actually to hear that a lot of the practices that wee been discussing to day and that you have pioneered are going to be incorporated int undergraduate education i i predict and i be willing to wager that that will become a templet for how universities end on university systems should function because if indeed and it is true that there is this incredible relationship between physical movement and mental deliberate practices and performance y any corporation school household would be crazy ywould be self self limiting and even self destructive to nodding corporate those i'm happy that you'e ging to do this and collect ata the askoplese will have to touch back with yet and here of what what comes o that u one the main things that i hear much about tay are issues with attention we have not talked about attent re mainly to time about memory and yandition yes but a lot about attention and and here i'm not being disparaging i think people have done what 'm about to say as of as a consequence of need and lack of other resources there is an immense amount of ater all use riddleing use from a daffinal use and kafine abuse ta i have not' kafin i i do not use the other compounds i described but is just incredible to me howthe the date on this are a collygamine at stamford clims it you'rl something two thirds or more of college students use these without prescription radiatty ye o what can we expect in terms of the effects of regular exercise on attention and are there any other things besides exercise and meditation that you would to see people do in terms of trying to increase their powers of attention yas i think the ability to a to focus an attend ye is really the distinguishing feature between those that we will succeed in any endeavor and those that wontand that is a scary thing for a lot of people to hear of yes a lot people think they have eightyty they may they mayt not but i bet that a number of students at both stamford and and why you feel challenged with holding their attention ave the thing that they need to hold their attention ya ye i would say the top three a tools that everybody reat this minute to day can use to up there capacity to attend where they want to a include exercise for the reasings we have talked about has a direct effect on function in the prefuntal cortex meditation also cleare clinical study showing inproved ability to to focus and and particulary focus on thethe present moment im and the third has to be sleep sleep is you you cannot it is out of the three it is the most physiological i mean i could i could live my whole life without meditating one minute could i could i survive without sleep no none of us cut it is it is it is more basic physiological but it is important for all coor coctiv functions aa including attention including creatiivity including ai'm just just good good basic brain brain function im that is why it is it is cridical to get that information that basic nor sience in formation into the heads of these students that are trying their best to show us how theyre brain wrk but but being hampered because they are not moving enough they are not meditating and am there is all these distracting things that they include in their lives some of which a little bit is is good but you do not twenty four hours a day on your phonein and linked in am not linktdin but but linked to your phone em is damaging to your attention exercise meditation sleep can help you learn retain an perform better than if you do not have these feethings in your life wonderful a music to my ears and also a either very low costors zero cost considering that the exercise does not require a class it one could do use the a freely of their available resource of gravity tan yua to do jumping jacks or birpies or gashafs or whatever ya or sit up sir all those an do not feget you to the freely accessible millions of you to vidios if you do not want to to your jempijects by yourself i ways say this i i talk about breath meditation in am for my book good anxiety and you dnos you you do not the one that i suggest there is only but a million more on you to with with radings from one star to five stars im yeuse that reserce it is a wonderful resource and you are an amazing resource a wendy think you much for come here to data have this discussion and share your knowledge about not just existing data but new data coming coming out soon and for your leadership in the universitye system for your leadership in public education for the decades of important work on memory and nerl circuitry which a got to learn about to day as well thank you ever much thank you antou fun conversation thank you for joining me to day for my

supplements are certainly not necessary for everybody many people derive trementous benefit from them for things accelerating the transition into sleep and getting better deeper sleep as well as enhancing focus and learning and other aspects of human performance and health we are excited to announce that we have partnerd with momentous supplements the reason we partnered with momentous o severalfold first of all we wanted to have one location where huberman lab podcast listeners cal go in order to find all the supplements that we talk about and to find those in a form where they could systematically try one or the other this is a real issue in the supplement industry a lot of supplement brands out their combine different ingredients and ways the do not really allow you o pin point exactly what you need in what you do not need getting supplements that have low doses or just the minimal effective dose of particular ingredients and being able to mix and match those ingredients yourself and really establish what is best for you is really key in addition we came to realize that a lot of our listeners want supplements but they reside outside of th united states s were pleased to tell you that momentous ships both within the you ask and internationally and of course momentous supplements are of the very highest quality ingredients and the precision of the amounts of those ingredients is tightly regulated if you'r interested momentous supplements the catalogue of supplements related to the huberman lab podcast are growing all the time a good number of them are already there you can go to livmomentous stok calm slash hubermen in order to find them and there will be additional supplements added to that sight as we go forward if you are not already following huberman

howard stern provides ha case study and how to avoid the consequences of your own vile public behavior through left wing pandering jobidon heads to the uen and mumbles in coherently and vlodmers lensky pushes for more aid and cooperation on climate change i've been furless is ventfaro show tenasho as ponsor by expressvepien dyou your wibe his our being seen and sold to advertisers now mean either yet express we pian right out express vepiansi com fleshmen the rule is in our media and in oure international politics as it turns out that if you mirror the priorities of the left that you can e pretty much do whatever you want long as you are not caught on camera doing it any other thing you are pretty much o k the reason i say this is because you look at the disperate consequences for public figures ranging from s a russell brand on the one hand to to somebody howards stern on the other the public consequences are quite tisprid i muse russell brand as an example here for justa second i've talgktd about rusell brand at length this week russell of course has been accused now by for seperate women of actions ranging from sexual assault to rabe to sexual harassment and whethers allegations were not i do not know one thing i do know is that at this moment they are just allegations there has been no actual criminal indictment brought against him he certainly not been convicted of anything but you too has now suspended russell brand for making any money on the platform on tuesday days after that report broke from channel for and b b s and tese are outlets that use to pay russell brand while he is in the midst of his most flaguantly vile behavior and as i pointed out the other day there is some irony to the fact or something curious to the fact about that that russell brand when he was at his most vile is being paid by all the same mediolets that are now investigating him when he is married has a couple kids and is preaching hederadox's political opinions when it comes to you to but bran's channel with six point six million subscribers going to dailywire has now been suspended from monnization folloing serious allegations against the creator according to you to bagain thes a very strange standard the ugop is now prvaying if theyre serious allegations made against you of any sort i suppose now all of your vidiosos immediately get dooumonitivs wichus then be very bad news for half the rappers on the block as well as a significant number of actors mean seriously there are these allegations out there about an enormous number of public figures if if the new standard is and allegation is tantomount to a conviction in the qortor public opinion and an allegation alone is sufficient to have your ability tomonotize your vidios remove from you by you to thas a horrible standard you have now created a mass of incentive structure for people who make allegations against people true or falls in order to destroy their careers now again i'm not sayin tht the women oour coming on saying the stuff about bran are lying i do not know whether they are or not what what i do know at this point is tha you tob i i do not know how they could possibly uphold such a standard that a public allegation comes out that dugly about somebody and they immediately demonotize everything having to do whith russell bran not does that have something to do wit the fact that rusell brand is a gan a hederadock's political thinker somebody who says things about for temple covi that you two does not it very much somebody who says stuff about jobiding that you two but might not very much these sorts of standards our certainly not going to be evenly applied obviously than i can t be evenly upplie and and this is what brings me to howard sterns howards stern has been making heavlines last couple of days by pushing very loudly to the left now howard stern spent pretty much might in tire life from the time i was eighteen ageer on the one most famous people in america being in absolute deviens in a a a degraded person beyond all measure just remind you who howard stern is the kinds of behavior that howards tern has regularly engaged on in publicly throughout his career ar disgusting in theire disreputable they are vile toward women and all the rest just just remind you here was here is a compillation of howard sterns ranily disgusting comments ojust female guests on his show you ere in pen whowyou wre thong ory do how you look amout ho you or one da hat's ri eo take up i erten wit your ret ar an no e n no a we you wa r or i e a i moring who he er to tan lo i boty ha this some en milder stuff that howards tern sow n his show for years and years and years and years and this a person who literally had women into his studio to sit on vibrators s that he could record their reactions and blasted out to millions of people in his audience he is oneless bile people in public life for decades on an but now hwards stern is apparently one of our moral exemplars over the last couple of days for example he has ripped into lorn bober now lorn bobert engaged in what i think is disgusting behavior and we we talked about itnd i made fun of her on the program because it is just insane to go with your boy friend to a showing of beetle juice and then get handsy with your boyfrond while vaping and then to yellow people who do who i am when you are when you are removed from the venou he is really gross behavior but you kow does't nove a leg to stand on talkn about gros bot public behavior is howard term howars tern apparently has no he has no compunction about doing any of this now heu nove the same reaction whe t was built plent in the oval office receiving favors from moniclinsky i i remember but but here is that here is howards terin geting very upset about lorn bobert suddenly he is a on my side of the of the isle when it comes to apparent prudery lran bolbert is a disgrace to this country i not because of the thevi you are a hundred pes a right forget the goigs she is in aatress if you saw the vidio he is in h trss he is with some du looks h es obviously vating bt also looks she might be grab in is peenis during yor beel jews she was wearing a tih odress i i've seen point stars ware more when i watch that taper dor she must be much funtoo my a she is a hot girl friend bat you now di we meet her in congress dio not when you reach ain eater at a strip club and i me meat arto de lack bances a me meder tat plae gis an that it that is howards stern right again now now we do not ean r in congres she is a disgrace to congress says howards stern now howar the howse howards tern able toget away with all the suffeas again he murrors he political priories to the left you means wos is youon to be long's you murrer the political prioritie to te left get's more on this en a moment first fladiner pouten has called you us dollars tropan dominant objective and iuriversible brazil russia india trina an south africa have formelly agreed to use local currncies in trade instead of the united states doller is that the first sho to fall i donnow but one thing i do know is that it is smart to diversify investers and

get started in vesting in at precious metals aret he an back to howardstern again howards tern has discovered the magic a lixer that wipes away all of your pas an present sins and that is be far enough to the left howards trn last coup o mont he is getting more and more to the left here he was just a little while go couple months ago going after kidrock and trap is strect claiming that they are transfobek for pointing out that for example dulin mulvany is a not a woman ni wish i could cold kidrok am come on the showing to tell me what is it you why you p said about this howis it birtful i really gumfounded by white some one would hare much that they would blow up a can ut bud likes te can is or bood i do not get it now again remember that because howrds terns the converson who bats omage to our secular religious priesthood this means deing get away with prety much anything me here he is committing sacrifices to the secular relige priest ad that the great sacrifice of all which is tos suggest tha youshould get as many booster shots as humanly possible here as howards tern litterally yesterday talkg mahow he is now wok that he e's awok guy says howrdstern i get every bacxeen that good and and for those of youthink i the governments trying to kill you or implan ships y way av shaping ou idolihe shipping youw o for those conspirts but i am wo mothe and i love it i want to be a wake i want o reed lexitimate new stores is here is i awoke i am i believe the election was not rit a gagain he is saying all the nostrums that everybody on the left really wants to hear and that means that is find from to do all thisi why is this important why is the sort of stuff important because when you have an inmunized class of people a class people were imunized by their association with certain left wind causes first of all an incensive ise is bad behavior by those people but second of all the alsecrate this massive double standard where if you are heterodox you can expect to be targed but if you are orthodox in your practice of leftism well then you can expect that youre can be given an enormous amoun of brethingroom an everybody understands this that these secular left priesthood that now prevails in the media in holly wood when it when it comes to our government that secur left priest wood gets to deside who are the favored and whare the disfavored to take this to the international level the're something sort of fascinating happening with you crane war and i'm not talking about the ashal on the ground fighting i'm talkingabout the perception of you crane in you crane war one of the things that started pretty early in theu cranevers's russia war is this bizare left wight split that did not seem to murer reality the beginning and the very beginning there is lot of talk on the right bou russia was in a religious statewar you crane was theur religious whale by all available holding the opposite was true far more people in you crangle to chorch on average than than people in russia they go to church far more frequently you granis a far more socially concerntive country then russia in a lot of ways despite ladimer poutens attempts to be more socially concertiv from the topdown it is a far more secular atheistic state is russia than you crane but the presumption on the part of americans was the opposite for for lot of americans you crane tbecause it was immediately adopted by the democratic party and because jobidnt decided to make it his sort of cause on the international stage immediately the asumption was on the left r you crane had to be some sort of san francisco on the vulga which is absurd i mean that that that it is not true but very quickly you do not you crane learned wha you crane learned is that they actually were were able to gat left wing support by pandring exactly to this it is a truly astonishing thing for example of lot of mer slensky he goes to the ou en and yeu's trying make a pitch for further funding andhe makes the usual pitch you starts off by talking about how russia is going to crossnads borders in it isit is going to engagin mass destruction this exactly your expect to here from a country that is in themiddle of a war but then he moves beyond that yet heras lenky's original pitch which is that it is really all about russia and t balacin russian you crane for territorial integrity and the rest terros have no right to hold neu gtor wepes no right but truly lovdin use o this cerisca wile ops very man an face the mes destruction is gaining it is momantum the agressir is reponizing many oves tinks and old tanst i ause not only agast our contry but atgist all of yours bes well ioflget you knowed this casing disagreet this kgase but zolensky then spent an enormous amounts of his speech not talking about the war that is killed hundreds of thousands of people in nu crane instead he spent enormous amounts of speech talking about climate change hat f a question doyou think people you crane giva good bleap about climate change of this point right now that bombs falling in their cities the're in the midst of the biggest continental war in europe since world were to and vladmer's lenskyis over thoun talking about climatechange why is you doing that why 's heu doing then hes we talk about climate change then this gives this the goldin ticket to left wing money it is what earns you support from the left if you talk about their favored topics wat same with hat hours turn buys a dispensation a left twin people dispensation by talking left wing talk vladmer's lensky has realized that he can do the exact same thinge that the the bizar split between right and left over the assume politics of rushoverseas you crane if yes youl please the into that he get you biding to sign on more cashion ton get the left win media to support him in a higher order this presumaly his wivs lensky is talk about climate change here is olensky lecturing the world about climate change which again is superweird even tou humanity is failing on his climate polisy objectives this mans that extreme weather will still impock the normal globe alive and some eopl stat we will also weponize it is out cops what is that what in the world is he jabbering about why is even talk while the reason his talking about this is because this is the admission price youon he pare of the club the mission prices you talk about the heredissues he did not more he tock out ou people can h use climate as a weapon thank god peoplevin learned use climat s weapons as lodamers lensky what how was this have to do with the price of a missilean you rane dout te fiso in telligus could be traine to combatwell efore it would long dol the humanity fan got people have an altya lot to use climate as a weapon in presumably this is also the reason why you crane is now trotting out he spoke's person for the military who is a transgender woman a'm not getting you an now same sex marriage in nou crane is not legal you crane is not a left wing country thi simple fact o the matter is that it is he culturally right wingat country in ea twenty ten european study for example only twenty eight per cent eucranians pull believe that elg b t ku individuals should live freely and however they thar's lowest number of all european countryes pulled except for russa rushis the only other one that has lower numbers the the notion that this a wildly left wing place is ridiculous it is not a wildly left wing place by by any stretch of the imagination but they understand that if they want by in from the left there can t have to pretend that there are left toin place presumably this is why they are currently trotting out serah ashton serello a trans woman from nevata who came to you crane and march twenty twenty two and has now be comma spokes person for the countryes territorial defence force last week according to france at twenty four russian telivishn sho n outolong special calling astrons rillaa terrible disgrace to the cranian people and a monster nineteen monts in she is a junior sergen and host live ou two shows as friends twenty four from her studio called you crane in the no and russia heats the truth ashon s rol does not even speak at you cranian herrol includes monitering internatinal media by the way these are obviously french twenty first pronounds is he du in august she announced a boy cout of sean and ater they called forign fighters in u crane mercenaries hitso this wat you crane is doing you rane as a propagandaploy is playing to the left which is what they have to do bcs the united states has now established a baseline standard which is mure the priories of the left or you will be excised or least you will be rit at risk of being accised it is more on this momentarily firsce you knon't i' missing right now my helik slee mattress i'll be ancor to and yoan see i'm here in amazing jerusalem during the jerish holidays the thing that oring my family overheri means that i lose a bucket load of sleep and right now i am missing my heliks sleep mattress man i wish i had the helik oleet helicks his harness years to exstensive mattressix pretties to bring their

their best offers of the year twenty present off all matressor s pluss two free pillows for my listeners o case why exactly is lenskeep mirroring the priories left because this is how you get the money the way get access to the cash is by murroring the priorities of the left an jobidon spelled out those priorities of the uen by the way and when he was not mumbling in coherently sohe spoke at te ou n yesterday and i'm as you would predict he sounded absolutely nonsensical here he was just babbling goble t gok from his facehole atearn peter dri prardo ne partner bute be clear sern principl of ae atreer ar sac sacrisi thet may be clear shartevs of corjames goa anro an is s a steve corral from brus almighty i what in the world the wrongdi i but when he isn' speaking incoherently an at least out physically and coherently he speiking in coherently about his values wone of the values that america most champions according to jobidon those values are climate change in l g b t k i a minas tifided by sign rights here was jobidon stumping for elg b tku i a plustifided by byna sign rights in a room with a bunch of countries that do not believe anything remotely what your bidin believes after continue work an hure the woman and girl it your equal right to reca participation of e society that digis gi ricoetni religs morard people i deso go do not have her protector stifer a

is a eling to jobidon's favorite priors that is the reason guies that is the reason and a a standard has been set up and fufil the standard i access to the casio if you do not you do not youre tapped on the shoulder by the angel of lefetism and it gives you blanket immunity for pretty much anything culturally internationally that is just the way that it works these days by the way how radical is this administration when it comes to climate change commel heirs now mering most insane lessons of the climate change womens she suggests thatt's reasonable to now one to have kids beas of climate change which is totally wild ie herrd young leaders talk with me about a a term they cline t call climate anxiety iaint whic her of of the future an the unknown of whether it make thenthry even think about having children wether make thenstr you to think aba a piring to buy home to ge what will this climate be this sout crasy thse people are and those of the priorities youre expected to meror if you wish to be welcomed into polite company in the international meetings it is a more on all of this momentarily first let us say they you are a captain of a small boat living in a small massachusetts town and at ther couple shark attacks in the area and youre called upon to go out there and you into go and stop the sharp whell before you head out on a boat that is too small with a

just beking of the the value system over at the u an one other piece of valu sist we should ad is it if you do not mirror the left wing prescriptions they will censor you just as we mention with russel bran this is part of the gar justinto ardurn who had to leave for job as the prime minister of new zealand after basidly turning it into a fasious to island where everybody was forced into lock down and then nobody gove accinated as it turns out which which turn out to be really really by policy and who pursued censorship with tremendous enthusiasm wul shois over it the you an bragging about how we need more censorship because free speech is a weapon of war how do you taka climate chan if people do not believe it exists how do you insure te human rigts of oters ar halt when they are tetitoto hateful and dangerthreter an idiology the weapons may be different but the galls of tars to copituat them is otenesine to coth caoth and reduce the apility of others to in themselv to despan community to codet tecri ostrengt of country tho wi tigiva but we have an opportunity here to insure that these particular wepons of war do not become an estepepa owarfia i mean this is crazy talk which shes talking out but it is parten parcel of what many governments are now pushing for in part of the necessary platform for left is tue censor all the voices they do not which presumably is why the u ka is now about to pass the calle online at safety bill its ready to become war according to the government of the u ca the ouline safety bill has now pass its final parliamentary debate it is now ready to toecome war what exactly thos it do well take ta one what zero tolerante approach to protecting children and makes sure social med o platforms are held responsible for the content they host if they do not act rapidly to prevent and remove illegal content and stop children seem material that is harmful to them such as bullying they will they significant fines that could reach billions of pounds in some cases ther bosses may even face prisons were not talking here about pritting algrythms that get rid of justy legal activity it goes much further than this this goes to things bullying which is pretty vaguely defined or inappropriate content pretty vaguely define and making social meeda platforms res ponsible for all that obviously puts them in danger of bankruptcy it is setting standards for p latforms face book you to but tik tock take nology secretary machell donaon said the bill was ake quat game changing piece of legislation hsaid e you caye will be the safest place in the world to be on line well why do i have a feeling that the government setting these standards is going to be very interested in what sort of material is now considered two dis information laden to be a loud to cross your screen now no one is in favor of cornicot harmful social meedia content the question is what constitutes harmful platforms have to show they are committed to removing illegal content which again i her but apparently they also want to extend is into the realm of for example hatespeech which is really really dangerous stuff thereis a reason why the why the monopoly an informational desemination has to be maintained and that is again just another watso creete a barrier to entry for anyone who disagrees with the generalized to genda wel all this is going to crata back lash it is goting crato back lash internationally andiscon a creete back lash right here in the united states mondri donal trumpets pling well a lot of it is because if the agenda of the united states supposedly is a climate change in transgenderrights that and censership on the back of those two things that is not somthing most americans t are for if you want to make the ucrane war a proxy for cultural issues it will become a proxy for cultural issues ies one of the reasons why republican enthusiasm for the ucranian war and for back new crane in that war has waned a tremendously the men tet became a partisan issue the enthusiasm began to decline marketly represent of byron donals on florta he says listen on the houselevel we are not interest in providing more funning for you craned at this point what is yer mafet to the len emany com te happet on tes ta won to mor money com conge he clan ae eany tee teriinportan tostopping the waring you rane what net e e

that we are spending a boatload money but more importantly it seems as though the leadership class in this in this country particularly on the left but ithing over all just does not have any connection to the things that people actually care about the country at the same time that the're driving the economy into a brick wall they are simultaneously pursuing mass illegal immigration for example on the one hand you e the economy that is driving into a brickwall according to the walster journal the fat is about to face one hundred dollar oil in almost uninterrupted rise and oil prices now push bench mark a brent crew close to a hunterabout to barrel posing a new challege for central banks in their battle against inflation the rise of victory for saly arabia which sought to bolster prices to fund a planned at transformation of its oil dependento c onomy russia is another winner the two countrys spark the ralley early this suren this that theywould restrict supplies until the end of the year now what is exasperating that obviously the unfriendly attitude of this administration toward more drilling and refining that obviously has been a matr problem meanwhile the administration continues two back unions the u a w as the u a w puts the car industry in america on very very tentative footing as the walstry journal points out the united auto worker strike is going on day five president chonfane has reject to the latest offer from stalantis of a twenty one per cent pay rays over four years he keeps suggesting that corporet greet is the issue yet it was telling this wekgend when he refused to discuss the unions to impact on future job creation astins she gestis face the nation how he would make the case to detroi automakers to invest in more expensive union shops rather than moving to riht to work states tan doct he said that u a w worker pation't be compared own pintiful testlopays their workers and other companies pay those workers he added most of these workers in those companies are scraping to get bys who greety c os and greedy people ylon most can bild more rocketchips and shoot herself into outer space mister fane can criticized muscolly once is the walster jounral but teslat is the chief competitor to the detroit automakers in the government mandaed electric vehical race according to the as he see the median worker at tesla earned thirty four grand last year in total compentition compared to eighty grande g m and seventy five granded foard sylancis that it the average workers are in sixty eh grand thes internal calculations include non pruction level workers as well as employs located in other countries yet the os a counts for a larger shar if tustles work fors than it does refort or stalantis a large reason for the pa tisperity detroits higher atirement costs s again the unions ni negotiated incredibly lucrative contracts and it is killed a lot of jobs into troit what is the bie administration doing about all this thei'r backing te unions again randy wine garden who is another union had whist is a radically discusting handing glove relationship the bin administration who is she who is standing four square behind school closers for two years for no reason she is been backing a w strike look at what is happening in bo tu a the intertanmen inistry and look what is lapen an ato industry lookin what is happening in ternday i every in dusterbo a revolution tariaman such atr every industra revolution that is happend not a lin the country but the world ther are winners an there loters tand the workers always same to me the loosers in everyone in ti transition i would actualy root for the people in america the hapa better life the hpest new in dutral poy what what has happen manufacturing is coming bacto america made in amaric in o la actuly and bat and the workers who a aculy made this companyes more propibb o thav they have not made these companies more profitable union contricts the company's less profitable the only ig they made the comin's more profitable ver t e last couple of years was mass of supply chain defacts and e which is why the prices are coming down and why in the end the biding push for electric vehicles is going to make these companies far less profitable how is the bid administration responding to all of us to at in i'm going strike in one of americas chief indistries well they are sicking tey're go ganilon musk if they if they cannot make a deal between th u a u and big three instead they are going to go after tesslaw the competitors of the w at this point according the wals fr gernal federal proscutors are scrutinizing personal benefits testlamaa provided elon muss since twenty seventeen has part of a criminal investigation examining issues including a proe posed house for the chief executive now if you think has nothing to do with the lon musks politics and nothing to do wit the fact that thestele is the chief competitor to the destroy three you ha another thing coming of course it is political of course it is political the reason te do ga s going after lonmusk on this thereason they went after him on spasacts remember they they are right now the scilerite sivision is suing elon musk for not hiring enough for refu gs over its spasacts despite the fact that as musk says you have t have security requirements fulfilled in order to work at spasacts because the federal contractor with access to classfied material the reason the're coming after musk is eminently political he violates the rules cross then and this is what you face down meanwhile the same administration that is pressing forward with e with e stagnating economy with inflation that is privords has in climate change that is par titting l g b t ku plus mines divided by sign issues over the base line kitchen table issues every of everyday mericats meawhile the're facilitating the legal imigration or record levels get's that momentarily first are you a feuw decades or years out o school

climachange there just allowing you legalimigrans to flow unimpeded into the country quernn griff at jankins a national correspondent for fox news in the past four days friday from mone day total migrant encounters at the south western border exceeded thirty five thousand at an average nearly nine thousand per day according to the border patrol the exact count is thirty five thousand five hundred seventy three encounters nearly nine thousand daily average that does not include known godaways thos are huge numbers obviously and as it turns out the illegalimigration probem is becoming a permanent feature of american life according to a fascinating report by spenser linquist over at the daily wire there is a community called colony ridge in texas and apparently it is become basicaly a giant settlement spot forty legal imigrans spenser t weeed have you heard about americas largesty legal imigran settlement that said to be a hub of cartelactivity i visited colony ridge for daily wire

exactly is it the you are asking for it it makes it makes very little sense at all when you are etting made funter by john federman you are doing things wrong here is john fetdermen who i will say john federman he is been appearing on to view lately i with mustache to the beard is gone remember he had the lincoln beard now he looks in old time e western bard tender who is once kicked in th had

as not fully functional and were now or settng up asturall sentat rules to accommodate the fact that he wants to wher jim shorts even thoug i'm not sure that he has ever worked out in his life byt by by the look of him but then matter when john federman as making fun of you in succeeding that is not exactly a wind for republicans and meanwhile again there tons of things forepublicanst to talk about in the selection cycle ranging from jobines in competencs to his corruption all that stuff is on the table two talk about what a republicans talking about what whatever is the latest revelation in the donal trunk cases of course and again that is not to trump now because he seeded that ground when he took activities particular with regard to classfi documents that put him directly in the cross heres if you are a person who has the biggest target in human history on your back which is probably the case of donal trump in terms media hating you why would you put yourself squarely in the crot whi ul you make that target gigantic we are now learning according to particular sources that one of nonal trumps ads a a a woman name molly michael she apparently has told authorities then donal trump attempted to obstruct justice or sublorn perjury according t abes he knews sources said michael told federal investigators the last year she grew increasingly concerned without trump handald recurring request from the national arcives from their turn of all government documents being kept in boxes in maralago she felt trumps claims about it at the time would be easy to disprove according to the sources sorce is said that after trump heard the ote i wanted to interview michael last year he said quote you do not know anything about the boxes it is unclear what exactly he meant by that but this leading a lot of people to suggest that he knew that you knew about the boxis and therefore the hus basely telling her to pib to the afbei gaind none of the stuff is particularly good for donal trump in just is not on the other hand it is amazing how the d o j continues to show it is corrupt hand as many of you now there' been a large controversy surrounding ray ups raps has been targed by people including tocko carlson he was a participant in the january six riots there is tape of him telling people to go into the capital building there is hip of him the night before telling people to had over and invade the capital building and all the rest of thus ad then he was never charged and because heas never charge the suspicion was on parfa lotof people on the right d he must have been some sort o government plant whell now apparently the deog is charging him but they are charging him with one misdemeanor accounts of disorderly or destructive conduct on restricted grounds now lod people on the ragosay why does he get charge with pretymuch nothing when they are other people who did not all that much on generous sically wander around the building and spent months wer years in jail why why is that he is goon claim laudforcemens con clements because he cooperated th when he saws at nam on t v he call thup law in forcement apparently he is gon ta plead guilty to the charge but slap on the rischarges post fact o do not look much justice to the vastmontuary people who watch the suff lay out meanwhile over in pennsylvania jo sho pero s the governor of pennsylvania is promoting pennsylvania's brand new program for automatic vojor votor registration it is pretty much californie's motor votor law their apparently half a dozen states or dozen statesthat aredy have this on the books they youare automatically register to vote hen get a drivers lie sinceres josho puro champion this in pennsylvania i am proud to anounce the for the first timever pennsylvania is an automatic votor registration state that is right from now on when you get or renew your drivers licions or an i be card ot the gamp you will be register to vote unless you chose noti made a commitment but i was campaign for this office that we would bring automatic votor registratin pennsylvania and break down the barriers for legal elitobl votthis is a c step to make our e lections mor secure having important levels of verification to the votor registration proses and by expanning votor registration at aur tampy will sae taxpars time and money reduce the number of costly paper registrations i's im wondering how t actually adds voter security to have people simultaneously register vote automatically but o cat let us assume that is all the case this this makes pennsylvania the twenty fourth state to actually roll out this sort of automatic votor registration process now i understand why theyr lit people on the rivery exercise over this lot people think that now this paves the way for for example ballad harvesting and they are not wrong in the fact is that according to real clear pennsylvania dod com athon couldseo rombus writing america's ballat harvesting capitals in suburban filly he says prires o vandamic pennsylvania had passed an election r forma law enabling mailand voting unlike in person voting which requires no votor idee pennsylvania's maland ballat process requires the applican to rovide id either are drivers licens or social security number count yeo boards elections are required to verify the information or aballic camp be cast pennsylvana's malan voting has more fail states than traditional in personent voting for fraudwell car with maland ballating at a skelican effect to state when election has to have an at two points harvesters legally obtaining list of drivers licenses or social security numbers to complete applications and then cast ballats ofthout voter's knowledge or bord of elections workers conspiring to invalidate applications is there a lot of ballad harvesting while gathers hons of ballad harvesting in pennsylvania's suburbs is that going to be exaster ma ali sure i mean the more eligible voters there are the morgan ay have people whare baselly paid by the parties to go pick up the votes but republicans have a couple of choices here one they can wine about it than complain about it two they could just go out and make sure that ever re publican's registrd vote they could balla harvest themselves and one of the things i cannot stand is when republicans complain about the the playing rules with no plan to change them well simultaneously ignoring actually being able to win with these rules the reality is that in florda mout of these rules already obtained and guess what florida is a big republican state in the fact is that if you look a list of the states they have automatic votor registration that list is not all leftsling states some f the tates that already have automantic votor registration those include for example west virginia michigan they they include the state of georgia the laudistates that do not have all those things but there is some of the states that already do is it the end of the world in those dates kno thear's the answer when the answer is win you can make excuses or you can go out and you can win and it seems to me the republicans he disnot making excuses an go out and doever the can to do do in order when these lectiones by the way they are doing some of the right things in pennsylvania i am impressed with the fact that dugmasteriano whois apparently considering a a senatorial run against dave mc cormic in pensylvania has decided not to do h is instead indorse mc cormic in his potential senate run mc cormac was an excellent candida who probably shoud a ben the nominy last time against john fedderman you probably would run stronger than memodas him running again i think his a is a very good move o ga time for a quick thing that i and then a thing that i hate things that i to day the odyove credit were credit is due the ladies the view occasionally are correct and apparently theare now saying that it is domb for the senate to change is dress cod just because john fedderman likes towear gimshorts well good for them we know really congratulations on saying something occasionally right and when constituents came in then when ye ta drop dro up thin te ti ther tier campers that aper camlincan walked in john mac cane tat john at cann e lin an jo tan there is a hollow tourt of rown to a evenat a times or crt representatives

did not see that one coming o a time for a quick thing that i hate as you may notice i am here an israly can see the back drop of jerusalem behind me tere's a new pull out from e p and r see and it fines that while americans generally view isral as a uust parter or ally many question whether the two countries shore the same interest in values first of all no two countries shriedensical interest let shou be real about this the u pay dis not share identical interest with the united states noither is france i neither is germany countres have ther own interest thet jus the reality however the notion that there is no cross over between israel the united states ans from s values is obviously untrue israel is in fact a multite religious democracy it is a jewish state but it has a sizibal arab minority musle minority many christians live here it is a partisan breakdown question and the reasoning to partisan break down question has less to do with israel and more to do with the left view of what american values are according to this pole about four in ten americans said israels a partner the ust should cooperate with but does not show the ust is interests in values those results reveal t a partisans split more than half of democrats said israel is a parter that does not chair american values and interest but should be cooperated with compared with thirty two per cent of americans of of republicans who said the same because it turns out that republicans over all believe that israel dushere values with the united states why cause israel's values generall include things patriotism and judao christian dolt in the judao part of judo christian judaic o values religious values some sort of communal value toreligion ar the do things left forcibly dislikes and when they look at a country israel they do not that very much ther do not that israel is a nationalistic country despite fact that america has historically been a very nationalistic an patriotic country the fact that is a partisan breakdown it is pretty clear its happening here and has less to do with the redefinition of israel and much more to do with the redefinition of america along hard left lines jobidon for his part here as is really help to fracts or relations between the state of israel and the united states that is because he has been effectively intervening in is raily politics in domestic politics in a way that that is rather unprecedented mean israel as far as in ler has never really sounded off on for example how the supreme court af judicates rovers's waide buthat is beastly whith jobidon has done with regard to judicialreform in the state o israelh and that is because he believes i suppose that he can a gett an ally on the left to be the prime minister of israel if he pushes hard enough but don again i set i'll say again it that tat is much more reflection this poll of how the left thanks ofout america and american values than it is reflection of of israel changing in any significant

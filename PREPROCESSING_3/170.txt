sir valry yes you ar produceer here in i shell i am your your tone of voice betrays a lack of enthusiasm for the storyo about to tell me yes i do not find this funny i find this deeply uncomfortable very goodness is one of our younger and newer producers shere she is working on the shiffor lessin a year and it was other staff members who urged her to come into the studio with me a tell me this story os i think it is funny even a valy does not ok i takes placon a subway o can i s i get on the subway and i see this person i now the same subway train but that is'coincidence it does not happen very off no i'me never sein this person n a stop before know and i'm i i should say something to this person and i'm thinking in my had in likeerage see something i should see something and then he looks to me he makes a direct i contact and i'm a great that this is my chance i'm to say something right now and i open my mouth and i'm and then he starts looking at his fot i'm mk go he that actually was not direct i contact that was staring through you my contact how far you from him six feet sixty cost right but far she is by the subway doors he is at the pole the middly how then anyways in my head on my ohet he will probably get off fon the next stop the soun a a deal he has not seen me i'll just por ten i do not see him but then if he stops later he has not gotten off and he comes to stand right next to me shoulder ti shoulder and i'm li odly i i he is deubtfully notice mes and to say something i should see something back and i'm looking and he just freentically scirling on his stone reading something really important listening to somei i do not know a'm i will not say anything again bcause you do not one interrupt him you because im if you wanted to talk to me he would say something she geeps thinking he'l get off any minute after all he went to stand by the door right byer but yesn't get off not the next station o the next on the next isomewhat he realizes does not be along ridt this is not one or two stops as is a thirty five minutes sobeway right where this person that i know very well is sat hig next to me an i'm not saying anything and our shoulders or next to one anotheris and the subways dulting and i feel his shoulder on my shoulder and o my he is notice but it is too late to say anything at this plaint weary o ma jus pausin that because now

their personal life send sweet messages the try to earne trust before stealing your money and disappearing but what mrk was telling me about his relationship maybe believe that this was not that mark

he would not disturb his room mates this is common most people in salon live on roughly two dollars a day mark had been making a little money playing socker in some local leagues but it was not enough to get by hearing about how mark was struggling made loddy upset she decided to start sending him money two hundred dollars covered rent for the entire year at a place all his own she also paid for his grandmoss funeral it was not a huge amount just what she could spare here and there but it made her feel happy to help hem te ten you gentsio u tades to culd nat as at he ad lit yes ye that se did

were giving her how were you li contributing to the relationship because she is contributing money and she is contributing mi financially what do you think you were contributing to the relationship love love an cali wel a aga see that a lot of relationships involve some kind of transaction each person brings what they can offer to the maxes with lotty it is money at least partly and with mark it is his time and care wont i think about the contours of their relationship the fact that they have never met in person and live thousands of miles apart not to mention the difference in age and experience it makes me a low uneasy did you gas talk about sex lik di you talk about sex evereveryting tell abo sax what eve giting how did that how dies that if you do not mind me asking ho how do you wol mak sexon the fon yads you gotsat fosex fonsex lat wu tak an landon clemonto maces alke i da connt got go up was something ther oke dilet me ask you this question actually d do are you attracted to her ye she what about what about her you attracted to what what turned you on about her iven in she sai ite has o sestel lav bak abai set just a think you man ajocate icneges e you think when you and her me in person you have no issue having sex with er havelo issue what if from being real my worry for mark is in just about whether or not he is attracted to lody this a darker place my mind wanders off to it is hard not to see their relationship in the contexs of the exploitation that tappening in wesst africa right now sexual torism has been a grown problem and the gambia for example older women have been tesending on the country and spending their money on sex with young african man the phenomenon is rampin the gambeing government stecped in demanding foreign visitor stop this practice but is still continues i do not think that whats happening with mark an lotty but there are enough similarities here to make me question and if half of me worried that myr friend was being taken advantage of theother half worried for lotty because mark talk openly about what he hopes to get out of their relationship what did you about her whitwod what did you feel does't that tie i ad that i thougt's o accompish my dear ti gont to looking ot as tits oh you that is not that is not feelings you have for her that is feelings you have for your dream those are two different things yet then if if if she is goin if if she is e one lis gin to take me from yet then then then the feelings for your dreams become your feelings for her i have whatl it is said lesit you take me hout of yer tustme thog mut that i different as sot to my life will be to get sinc god send to one home you told her you told her if you take me out of here i'll i'll love you for ever basically s she she knows that you there is something that you want she she knows that there is something that you want beyond a beyond her yes shell i've been reaching out to lotty for weeks wa no luck to get her side of all of this then finally early one morning around three i m alo holo alo she call me back yand we talked for a while i did't know what to expect but loty was very open about her life she told me more about her work caring for the elderly the grand son who put a rup in her own apartment when she got older and then of course we talked about her feelings from mark i no o no i n i o o o o i na o a no yon a a an lotiy can be a little heart to understand sometimes it is because of a bot since tobation she went through years ago but have to say despite that she does not come off as a kind of person who does not have agency over her life it' seventy three she can clearly hold her own an o a ni o you o i no i yer yar init o a ia o my mother deathonlly taught me better than to commen on a woman's age but i will say and lotti's profile picture she has a very youthful energy about her and ar conversation she confirmed to all of what mark said about their relationship and how in ten ser connection was from the start i na i an any i in i me o o i o i o o e o a well when you emark that id not hurt year or what was going on yeur lie o i i a we no o i a e o o oi an o iiam a o o yo i am we o o i i o i a i o o i ma o o omini o i o a o a ut you you eal you love you who you are yam lottie said that had been a while since ment her age gave her a chance it had been more than ten years since her previous relationship and with mark she felt she found something real but some of ther think she told me about her life were had spenni she told me about a violent fight with one of her a dull kids and how in a supperate incident in two thousand an two she was convicted of child abuse an was sentence to two and a half years in prison it made me worried fror marka little bit does he really know this person when i told him about what lotty had said he told me he was not aware of any of that stuff but he did not find at alarm im he seid after all the good she is done for him he is not on a turn his back on her now after six months of a long distance relationship and countless meriton fon sessions mark got what he was looking for lotty agreed to marry him the inicial plan was for her to go to salon but her doctors told her the travel would be bad for her health instead they decided to bring mark to the states hears mark she even what deling what everything mo sut everything for to read she even juse my best men a je tha did chusin demfor te jutch yes a e one e one was vitzin for for for do not yo witness tis malied mark wont ahead an applied for a visitors visa to the uess and lottiy wrote an official letter to the uess embassy in salon inviting him to come next up was an interview with the woman at the american embassy she sat tom what did you nam i sor he my nam an who is this to as i she is mar lova the intervie were asked a lot of questions carefully grilling him about every detail of his plan mark was nervous but he was prepared he knew lotty's address by heart he toe luckye'd answered every question right until the end when the interview ere looked up at him sad wel i'm soe betsta look next te she said that she said better luck next time i'm a commashe is jesi bettelok next to haw did you what did you say back tella lik se has s ta that fotin do ma my eyes what ye touted crying right there e te ca i dade bat w i was not surprised that mark did not get it it is always hard for some one mark some one without a job or a house to tie them to their home country to get o visitors visa to america officials are afraid that people that basically poor people will not have her reason to return it is mest up and i feel for mark in an instant all the physical and emotional labor he would invested to get to this point was rite the way erased by stranger behind a desk i've known a lot of folks in salon who have been denied a viza and mark responded to his rejection the way they all eventually do with opthemism because what other choice is there in a situation this tha's the oppies woments for me that official thing was very official yet formin to lotody what can till make him as you o ant yo missy fon insive well even if even lene do not ishe me she sa i'm stabodat i'm lohappy it is hot's me what is at sim tim i'm happy cot ta idnt ye forn insi got to touch her piece of america ant it is gillylylya lessin to me after the failed interview at the embassy markan lottiy tried to regroup and come up with the different plan but her health worsn then one day last year lotty did not answer the fomon mark called for weeks he could not reach her until finally she messaged him on face book she told him she would been in the hospital at one point her heart stoppe it took them eight minute to revive for whet she got out of the hospital mark sas she is more isolated than before and her life felt more difficult tin salely hat for her what i she is all alon in in ma house people do not come to hed sometimes that cedties for her its is really pilin me i p fiftempse evrideapi for ite lacabas talkin a mark i can tell that hes generally troubled about what loddiy's been going through it is also true that since the downturn in her health his circumstances have gotten worse he tells without the money she was sending he got a victed he does not always have money for food but he insist even though lotty has stoped supporting him he still feels responsible for her then she also whats an event she was she was olcash was not si now if she is in is difficult toam she is nots even walkin i think i should beta to and a man my doty to look of to her lothing does not be love don ot stoll because i love abgavoeis to i lova labe loly lisionship i love the way mark is talking about loty here it reminds me of a business person talking about some cost some one who is reluctant to give up on something they have invested in for a long time it brings me right back to my initial worry what does mark actually feel and what is he convincing himself he feels there is a part o me that believes you but then there is a part o me that sti this does not tis tis mixtt is does not look this does not look right it does not feel right a lette littly it look it looks yet looks your using her and she is using you it looks she is lonely and she want some body to talk to she is using you for that and you do not have money and you need somebody to find you and take you out of this place you are using her for that is it looks you gos er mutually using each other and yet you gos love each other you could very much love each other through that but it still looks very obvious to me what is happening here it looks very it look very clear for me that is you day us on ihe set back to use you and i i just one o i just want to know what what you think about that what you think about me saying that and an nobody's nots using any one bit you me on latesy ont you glad deandyat is it i the abilians heain the abillions of people wen no one sees me here only laty is semtiti as or oon sees me it is really blissin for me the you est population is actually in the millions but you get the point when i talk to lodty she also seem to question how to think about the relationship you no he la you lo yer er yer yo an y lo ne you i thin he love you yet i got the sense that a lot of people wen her life have asked her thi same thing for years and honestly it was a hard question to answer i ra i tak mark love you ye way you love him i ta make her it did not make sense later she asked me again mery nan ia im the same question loty i a

from the hospital at the tank the idief did kill those terroris undoubtedly the w cho will condemn the death of these supposed hosca workers commas uses the most vulnerable members hve town population is human shields even the e u acknowledges this fact yesterday they released to statement wil condemning the use of hospitals and civilians is human shield ba comass thet this a basic truth the members of the media wildly down playe despite their own reporting on the subject dating back for over a decat it is widely known and understood for example hat the allshefa hospital lies directly at tap comases military headquarters the washington pos in your tans reported as much in twenty fourteen none the less the media have popood comases war crimes in humanrizes violations instead they have focused i'm comases constant claims that fuel is running out in these hospials even as comas steals the fuel every single day we ben told all shifa has run out of electricity and then conica oil turns out not trute they have dum their damnedist to show the warfine situations really cause by comas in thoses hospitals will the media have steadfastly refuse to mention that is comass that has refused to evacuate the hospitals here for example was emas and b see yesterday doing omasis bidding at allshefa hospital there is no electric to day there is ti tbere min ama o medical operations going on at this point their comticconticacion en at the hospital ansia but no case is more eartion than the dozens of prematurely orn bape who wore being held in the nea natal unit there the electricityis gon

tel te three of tec new born ha ti far gay doing everythin they cant kep em live except evacuating the hospital is rom by the way has helped to offer to evacuate that hospital by the way it is also worthy of note that if the in the emason b s framing of that actual report if they had panned out just a little bit you actually see the electricity operative in the background of the hospital the is what the media are doing note the moral equivalenc in the report sure israel is trying to provide fuel and commoss is actually actuavely stopping the entry of that fuel but really should not isrel

have been doing t they are damdist to to promote commosses propaganda andra mitchal of emason b s played that game yesterday here she was asking the anesa spokesman john curby about wheather commos should not be kept safe because they are hiding under hospital here is the catch twenty to if commoss dozn't hide under hospitals then obviously they are not terrible people and isrel should leave them alone nif they are hiding under hospitals then they should be left along to ther hiding under hospitals here is the andry mitchel even if it a cla that hamas commanding can tal theys under ou

squols and they ihave the tottls under residential complexions they quick a the innocent people of gas a at res in harms way just by how they headquarter themselves t well according dandry mitthel though warfare is a game of tag and safe it is not a free it is a hospital long as you are terrist if you hide underneath the hospital then youare now immune from any sor of retalliatio whih by the way totally undermine the rules of war if the idea is that your best security is to violate the rules of war which is what commass is doing everyone will then hide amongsivillian populations meanwhile israel continues to go abov and beyon any semblants of humanitarianism in its attempt to protect gassen civilians yesterday israel actively sent incu bators into gozal four those same infants you are being shown on emasand b s even while kommass is holding is railing infants hostage you can see this picture hure are is raily forces literally shipping medical ecquipments in to help tasan civilians well commass attempts to get those civilians killed to his credit the state department spokes person yesterday slap down members of the medea who are doing propagando work for kommas here he was you would love to see hommoss vacate the hospitals an susing command pose immediately we would love to see all people that are calling for israel to take steps to pthack hospitals call for hammass to vacate the hospitals and stop using civilions as human suels we would love to see hammass take some of the fu reserves at sitting on and use that to supply hospitals in northern gosa a we would love to see hamass have taken the fuel that israel operidat yesterday that they declined for use at i'll see fe hospital since a very difficult situation a and i would say as a principal on thi tre say what is tat the tops we do not want the civiliens coe cospir unfortunately the bi administration is beginning to cave just as israel reaches the central headquarters of commass wlocated beneath alshiva hospital at this point even yous intelligence has confirmed the ommasas place central resources underar al schifa according sian and quot ajous ifficial with knowledge of american intelligenc says commss has a command nowed under the alshiva hospital uses fuel intended for it and is fighters regulelly cluster in and around gasas larges hospital while israel is now at the gates of al shifa according to the walstr journal israely troops reached ae least one of the gates of gass's largest hospital where israel says commas conceals the major centere of operations while medical staff reported deteriorating conditions inside beause of a lack of supplies and electricity the journal also reports that thousands of people in the hospital have been cut off for three days with gunfire around the building thatgon fire is being initiated by a commas israel has been warning for weeks the hospital ought to be evacuated with the fully established the commas is using alshivas cover israel does not have a choice but to take the hospital to do otherwise would be the equivalents of leading osomaban ladan's compound in backastan alone because there were in fact ic children in the compound and yet now president bi de has chosen try to curb israel's ibility to take out commas here was jobidon speaking foolishly yesterday or wal i you ni aame mat cpes macan sas cya i is i acpectation acte o ea les tisaioata hospi an som hospital mospi the hospital must be protected while there being easy watto do that and tou' be for commas to sur under what exactly by the way does hay less intrusive action look israel's not bomb tholl shive a hospital israel is known from the beginnig of the conflict and for a decade before that commoss commanders were located beneath all shiv a hospital and the heaven bom did and now presumably they aregoin to have to send in special forces to clear the place what would less in trucive action look a sege of the hospital whele that is been called t a human rightto bus by the semexact people we say israel should leave the hospital untouched no the only less in trusive alternative would be presumably a sease fire which israel cannot and should not do strategically or morally it is cowardice pure and simple for the bide administration to try to hamstring israel and s pursuve comoss and even more cowardly for the bide administration to continue to play in idiotic game that they continue to play where by members of the administration claim theyhave to continuously hold israel's leesh to prevent the idea from violating human rights the reverse is the truth the idea as they have for literally decades abides by rules of engagement no other military would dream of and yet her was and us say sullivan refusing to answer if israels abiding by the laws of war is israel operating according to the rulet of war woldata ognokano sit here and play judge or jury on that question what i'm going to do with state the principl of the united states on this tissue which is straightforward israel has a right indeed a responsibility to defend itself against the terro screw might you just say israels abiding by te laws of war because they are they are going well beyond with the laws of war require in such situation her's only one reason for such wavering fut for such pucilan imity the bid administration is constantly attempting to thro signals to its left wen base even if that makes israel's job harder in destroying commas and saving its on hostages and you can see this in how the laf the hard left is treated by this administration ll get to that in just one second first there is loted stake this novembersodo not be a chicken and shop at the grocery straelic usrael instead head on over to good ranchers where

your gift no matter how small makes a difference in a very large way whofl that baby become what life will the baby live and what about themom a small donation of just twenty ept bucks gives amom the

calm slash ben right outs preborn dot cam slash ben caso the left continues it is raticalism pramilogipals the ead of the congressional progressive caucas a she is openly threatening the bidadministration and this is the the great li thet members the hard left or talking bout they theyre saying to bidon that if you do not put the pressure on israel than we are going to abandon you really for whom ferhomletsberel we all know everybody knows at the minute donal trump is denominy or anybody else of the right is the nominy all thes people fall backin place none of them are going to not boat for jobidon because of gaza but here is framlogipol trying o put on the pressure but as amand i also think that we cannot take ar base poters for grantive and particularly young people and folks of color across the country a who are reacting right now to the war in the middle east a ar going to be very important to are electoral success ind twenty twenty four and i think that we have to keep our petal to the metal we cannot get complasent and think that aborsen is get to save us it is certainly going to help us but it is not go to save us and we have got ta maketure wer paing atsention to our base poters first law do love the the language use by've left abortion is going to hlp us and save us great but the argument cheesemaking is being murred all over the place by the hard left that would include in york times us at by stephen worhim a historian annalist of euisporn policy the nur times is just a propagandopage forcomas at this point the end of this article says the quipart out loud quote young boters in araban muzzle americans constituences key to mister bn's election victorying twenty twenty our gas at his handling of the war they may not turn out from ext november such a calling of mister bion's collition is just what republicans booe by polls showing tow trom p leadian key states need to put they are un popular candidate over the line again the the basic idea here is that jobidon should lead a surrender caucas to comas in order to preserve his lectoral prospects in twenty twenty four which of course is precisely the reverst of the truth the truth is that israel by every pulling metric in the united states is wildly more popular then comas and the idea of putting serious clamps on israel in their efforts to destroy homas after the worst genicidal attack on jues since the holicos is wuld be pure political insanity but if you'n get enough very loud people in the democratic caukas to shout and scream then presume believ the idea is that somebody will cave this is presumably why you have entire article agand in the urtimes shistoen prop again to effort for comass come oss as the same strategy as i said before as the vicong get a bunch of whild left people on campcisen in the halls a power to yell at their bosses and hope that those people undermine western war eforts that is the generalized goal here this is why you hve an articl tne eur times democratic aids in congress break with their bosses on israel commass war now again here is the deal if you are congress person and you have staffers where marching in favor of commasyou should fire them you have no obligation tout to keep people employed in your congressionally public funded office in order to stand with comass you on need to do that but according to the nearer times they are many many of such staffers quote as they tens political tomat rageous across the country nd on the senate and house of floors there is a more personal and n many ways more emotionally frought discussions taking place inside the offices of members of congress the vastmajority of law makers an both political partie have rejected calls for a seas fire but many democratic con gressional staff members most of them under the age of thirty five have found themselves in stark disagreement with their bosses and the bidy administration on an issue that cuts to the heart of their values ye ther their values do involve the oppressor oppress matric whereby even the most evil human beings on the planet come oss and they are supporters all those people are actually the oppresse if they are poor and if they are disproportionately non white that is the way that this papathetic logic works they say they 've struggle to reconcile the personal convictions ofh their professional obligations which by definition require they keep teir opinions to themselves they 've voice there are senting opinions and internal meetings and grafpled with what to say on calls with constituent while they cannot take it get the hell out for lot of people this is a real red lines a jeramy sleven senor viser to illhan omar it is horific what is happening yaf we definitely nee the comos cockis signing in on this one at am gentleson cheef of staffor sentor john feermen of pensylvania recently rote on x come ostrs broke a seas fire to slauhter innocens something commossel now magically abye by seas fire some of us think this unrealistic and offers up more inocence for slaughter john fetderman has been excellent on all this actually shockingly good but it does not matter aids have been whining and then theyare leaking to the media ore eager to hear about all of that that is the goal to create this internal pressure and naturally democrats because they are afraid of their younger constituents they have decided that they are going to signal they are going to signal say you have vice president harrising people have a right to protest give these procomosnics in the streets from in gon american place thyve the right to protest we should listen to their voice an just t point out here gidnt feel the same way about any one protesting against coved mandates at all i remember feeling some way about the keeparty but here is how she feels about people qhoare legitimately tissuing calls for the destruction of the state of israel and genecital fashion youn we have to hear their voices hear

very good during this conflict but he too is signalling to his staffer's guises i'm listening i'm wory could just tel hem to shut the hell up becaus they are wrong that is something you could do according to the washing ton post moving to address tossents within the ranks of the state department over the bied ad ministrations policy on israel and the waran goza s secretary of state ansony blinken told tdepartment imploes on monday that quo we are listening to those who disagree with the proaches we are taking and in all department message circulated after blinkon returned over the weeken from a trip to the midiestan asa the topyos diplomat acknowledge that some diplomats have expressed reservations about the os backing for israel as a presses in assault on commass that has hd hy civilian death told that is heavy moli more than eleven thousand palstonians ind gos have died in te assault accoring t the commosron gofs helfministry by the way do not believe their numbers thereasn i say doft belive the numbers as they live out the numbers literally all the times sure many many people have died in the assault against comass but i've noticed how quick they are to tally all this recently israel lowerd the estimate of the number of dad in the october sove the tacks from fourteen hundred and twelve hundred why but you took that long to literally weeks because all the bodies were burned in charre it took literally that long to determine how many people were dead five weeks it took to determan that it was not fourteen hundred was twelve hundre becaue some of the people whoere dead we are actually comos terras and some of those people were moltable pieces and they warent to be counted as sepperat human being becaue they r originally one human being dismemberd ore burned beyond re cognition tick israel which they highly sophisticated government five weeks to come up with the actural numbers meanwhile commosters trot an otlicke we have eight hundred thousan lesbe an dans majors who are killed in latest attack and everybody in thes welcommosses ministry of health does say it but bout a mine her is that antony blinkin wrote a letter to the statesdepartment in which he said i know for many of you the suffering cause by this crises is taking a profound personal tol i know some people in the partman may disagree with the proaches we are taking ore have views on what we can do better we have organized for it in washington to hear from you and urged managers and teams 's have canded discussions at posts around the world precisely we can hear your feed back and ideas we are listening what you shares in forming our policy inour messhes messages i certainly hope the helmas because yone buncho morons working at the state department but again this is

these streames cross between antis metic conspiracy theories on left tis conspiracy theories the basic left win conspiracy theory is that there is a codray of super powerful shadowy people who are disproportionately white and emissaries of western civilization and it is their patterns of exploitation t ae been spread all over the glub ook ka if you just r place white with jew then you come up with just the normal anstto metic conspiracy theory which is german corban cannot say the thing because in his view it is just a normal rebellion against exploitation what comos id on octobersem than anything is justified in pursit of that that is why the sort of stuffiscene is legitimate everything is legin met by the way for peoplewho believe this everything lying violence all that is legit tbecause it is in pursuit of a higher gull an youtopian higher gull the reestablishmen of justice in the universe by the ripping down a civilization that is what german corban and people who are him

very much over the weaken shes speaking in new york city at one of these procomos protests and dum and she said that the real problem with people putting up posters of kidnaped children by comosses that they are the provocatours and this is always the backwards logic the backwards logic is that colonialized exploited people they are never responsible for ther own actions at any point if you put up a poster of a cinap child and thy rip it down it is your fault becuse you put up the poster you are tempting them there are no expectations at all they are not expect ted be decent normal human beings no they can dowhatever they want and in fact you are inf it is it is a sting it is a sting operations as linis ar sor do not do not not rip down the posters ors wrong grip down o posters do not do it because you might get caught doing it is linissaur sors prorspective on all this gand absolutely shameless absolutely shaminis now the good news here is that israel is making incredibly significant progress in the goscisstrip for all those people hor in a rush this war is not going to last rever it has been a grandtotl of five weeks since october seven in israel has thoroughly destroyd comas is military capacity in the northern gossistrip an presumbly they are now gonto have to move into the southern areas of the gosestrip and do the same yesterday a picture emerged of is raily's sitting in comasses parliament yahomasas parliament the haven ha an election since youe tasan sex but they still have a fake parliament anda is raily soldiers where there flying these raily flag is pretty dispuriting for all of the members of comas and all of their akalites who have watched all of their positions of power absolutely ravaged by the s raily defence forces as they should be thea the proto the defence minister of israel y of gallan he set on monday the comasad lost control of the gosstripts o there is no force of comast capable of stopping the idea we are advancing at every location the comass organization is lost control in gossip terrus ar fleeing south civillions are looding comospases they have no confidente in the governments andit is absoly tr does not mean that this thing is close to the end but it does mean they israel is making incredible progress over there if the west can get over it is faint heartedness at comas propinganda in just one second we

states it is an entire article in the wall stree journal mits pretty amazing it is about skoky which is a chicago suberb it is mostly famous because way back in the nineteen seventies the kkk do to march through skoky they pick skoky because i is e largely jewish suburb and noscoky really well ashly because my grandmother lived in skoky and large parts my mom's family lives in skokisoes to go their multiple times a year its it is a really nice area of chicago will now apparently it is beset by division why will quote the sendents of holicos survrivers and a growing muslin population live side by side in this tiverchicaga suburb that prides itself on safety and civility that tolerants is being put to the test as war rages in themiddleast skoky is long been known is a welcoming village on chicagoes at northern borter with one and two story homes on mataslots and good schools a major attraction the is the illinois halicos museum and education center an addition who substantial juishon muslin communities scoky's population of sixty five thousand five hundred speeks more than seventy five languages over the last several weeks a bom thread cause the evacuation of a cinegog students stagestay citen in support of palsinins at local high school and one pull up yard tines expressing home oners support for israel a unota noticed about all that is that that is all anti israel another words the jews and skoky whof been there a lotlonger frankly then the vast bulkom th muslin population an skoky means skoky again as when the older jewish neighbourhoods in the united states every incident cided by the walsterturnal is an incident in which presumably allies of kcomass friends of koms supporters of comass were doing things to jews this causeis tension this one of the things that we see constantly in h media tensions har rising tension who ise causing thes tensions rise whire thess tensions rising swell a braverman the former home secretary in the uke was fired from her job because shust causing quotiquotensions to rise by noting that here were giant rallies filled with hundreds of thousands of komass supporters that the police orn't doing their job inactually prosecuting the law shot fired for that because i was whose creating tensions tensions csycle of visland these are all the happy words the media love to us when it comes to conflects where they just do not wish to take a side between no good and evil or decency and non decency and and the contrast is absolute clear to day there is a march four israel that is happening in washington d c hundreds of thousands of jusican a shop there i promise you there will be no violent chance therellbe o rip down american flags here'l be no burning of a merican flags there will be no ther'll be nothing about genicide against muslims to sam wher therehas been chance baut genicide against jews or'l be notes of facemen of white house property nothing that be perfectly calm woul be perfectly peaceful or receive one tenth the attension thet the media have given to these procomas marches an the not giving antention the prokomas marches tbecause of the outrageous behavior he're giving the attention to the prokomas marches to suggest that the behavior is correct and justified again the basic matrics for the media is that the angrier you are and the more left whin you are the more youare justified in your anger and that means the giant protests hundreds of thousands peopleles are being ignored largely in the media in favor of coving the descend of people par prokomas and tatstrually ugliness making life worse for lot of people these again when you incentivies behavior you get more of it is just the reality okie meanwhile with regard to domestic politics remember that time that kedmicarthy the speaker of the house was he oustead for no reason that any one could really discern by matkatson company he is really bad you remember and and known carilly explain why he was real ybad supposedly is becaue he is cunding deals with democrats and spending to much money and sinding on to continuing resolutions an all the rest meanwhile many of the people whoid rebelled against mc carthy had voted against better versions of continuing resolutions that mc carthy was trying to negotiate and it is all really stupid and then we waited several weeks five weeks and then finally there is a new speaker of the house and the new speaker thas agreat i ma johnson i'm big fanamic johnson i'm is cun a point out the mi johnson is preparing now to pass a continuing resolution that looks exactly the same as the continung resolutions that cen mc carthy was passing maybe maybe more maybe bigger maybe bigger spending why it is not because mi johnson is not conservative it is because the incentives are not a lined the stars are not a lined the political votes are not a lined in favor of a hard cuar con sorver of gendal en ouhaving democratic sendt and democratic president and a slim majority of what eight seats in the united states congress and this whole idiotic thing ballats gebered mc carthy will get some ody elson att'll change the entire magical structure it is changed literally nothing ac coring to brightbart the house is under new managemen but is operating under business as usual as hi prepares to pass a continuing resolution and once again extends it spending levels and policyes pushed through by then speaker nanciplozy and last decembers lame oc session speaker my johnson is it moving a latter s are that extends ccurrent spending levels for agriculture energy and water moltar construction veat an transpetition hud spending bills through genduary nineteenth with the remaining eight bills exsended through february second sent a majority leader chuckshumer took to the send of flormondy afternoon siyes pleased with speaker johnson for choosing nots persu spending cuts or policy writers in the spending package he says house republicans have prursued a responsible measure then send at minority leader mach mc conall also indorse that particular plan now again this not me ripping on johnson thisit me pointing out that the incentives are what the incentives are and you have been liged to by an enormous number of politicians and commentators who tell you that if you just shout pure slogans from the roof tops than magically you can manifest reality that if you just shout we nee lower spending over and over you an auge to lookat the vote count af the lookad whippdally and if the look at who controls the sendate or controls the white house magically things wichcand if somebody refuses to do that if thy do not shout loud enough if then't make loud noises tham we just ouse them unless it is myk johnson which case i avsume mackates ogonmosign on o this as mackates fired is bullet and he had speaker mc carthy and now ther speaker johnson because a mackates and there is no market improvement in the actural legislation because of course there is not gon o be market im provemen in legislation the constituency of the house is what the constituency of the house is represent of chip roy who is been absolutely consistent in good on thi stuff member of the rules committee one most conservative members of the house how the press conference monday and he said we got nothing he said speaker johnson continues to perpetuate the very system mac constituent sent me here to oppose they omady continues spending money we do not have and one point six trullian dollar spending levels pollocy spending levels other conseveris joining roy in the opposition included represent im i s marjery callegreen tom birchet and and rew clid of georgia while continuing spending set by democrats at johnsons clean sy ard oes not include supplemental spending requested by the d an white house that included millions in fornade fhree crane israel an tiwan as well as a few bmillion for the border it is done clear exactly how funding is getto gat pastthere becaus gobidon continues to insist that funding for u crane be connected with funding for istrael which gain is an idiotic proposal becaus ese eare two very different wars by the way i support continuing to fund you crane in its war against russia if there is an actual end point and because you got to prevent ou crane from falling to russia that does not mean the en point in that perticlar war is is similar in any wayshipper form o the end pointed israel's war on camas in the gosi trip biding into son linking the two but that house cantin agai the incensive structures just you not a line thomas sowell famously seggested correctly and when it comes to decision making the problem is generally not the decision maker the probmis generally the decision making structure and that decision making structure means you cannot expect that mag johnson is gin a magically able to ram through a budget cutting to vites it is not going to happen by the way you kno ht else is not happening apparently a small member of house republican sided with democrats in moving to punt an effort to impeach homlan security secretary alehondro mayorcas if there is one member of th by deministration who deserves impeachment most ecide from bide himself it would be mayarkas whois presided over a complete collaps at the american border millions and millions and millions of illegal imoigrants have crossed the border under mayorcas been released into the interior ta total of eight republicans voted with the democrats to stop the resolution that included cen bock of colerodac who remembers on ofth people who a voted out cemicarthy virginia fosan orth carlinato isa of californa tomicclintock of california patric mac kenery of north calina they voted with democrats to refer the resolution to committee there will be no impeachment of the home land security chief at this point some of the re publicans who voted agains sending the resolution have not come out an support of impeaching mayorcas there is even a wa are largerpool of opposition within the gopi conference to getting rid of maorcas they said that these are not high crimes or mis demeaners but again impeachment is now a completely political tool as we know from the multiple impeachment of donal trump without natural criminal charge attached to any of them in just one second we will get to the eclip of the day proof that there is a god in facts will get to that momentarily first the benshipuristura is supported by grand canyon universitys an a fortable private christian university with a vibrant camp is

day well meanwhile now it is rare tat you see poof of god at work in the universe but apparently magan repeno has has uncovered it sud yus had the note this clip because it really is astonishing magan ropino who is one lost of noxious human beings on planed earth rich and famous for being a female sokr star which again only in america could you be wealthy and famous for being a female socker sta that is not even a profession in any case magan repino i'm she am she was injured in another one of her farewell gans i thoght she was gone already when i she leave she is mostly famous for yelling about america is terrible and kneeling for the national and thum because she is les bein or some such nonsense and im she a she was injured in this latest champian cheb that no one had heard about until she started jabbering about it and a she talked about her belief ina that that atheism has been proved by by the bad things happening to her here we go eee the o e e ye e im yees z a a y is e e yo know i mean that that is definitely proved that that there is no god n as as we have all asked many many times before why do terrible things happen a terrible people why is that that that is certainly that is that is the big religious question why do bad things keep on happening to bad people making repino a perfectly perfectly solid disproof of god's existence right there fromfrom that classact meanwhile the supreme court has now issued ethics rules now the reason for this is absolutely silly and that is because the media have decided in the aftermath of the overruling of ruverse's waighed at the supreme court is just chalk full of people who are corupt and terrible for violating literally no existing thics rule and to now because justice john roberts she justise john roberts is constantly in this ridiculous sisifian battle to reestablishe the credibility of the court or some such nonsense he is decided to issue a code of conduct following reports of undiscloshed trips and other favors that sparked criticism and put pressure on the justices to adopt a set of ethical rules what exactly happen a clarence thomas hadrich friends and they offered to pay for his vacations with them wicchum is not rare at all at all msuican point that out not rare at all does not violate ethical rules these people did not have business in front of the courts they were not he was not implicated in their business in any case the fifteen page document set it largely combiled practices the justice is in formally followed bot says the wallstr journal the lack of a formal document has letten recent years the misunderstanding that the justices of this court regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethic's cot the code says justices can see guidanc from colleges judicial decisions lower court judges and the supreme courts in house legal counsil as wellas from scholars scholarly criticis and articles ie creates no single ethics officer adviser it does not provide penalties for violation of ethical standards all mine justices signed the documen which suggests that it may not be binding on future appointies unless they formatively except the cote nout the reality is that a sell finding cotis completely arbitrary and non justiciable the the only way o get ridof justice on the sprim courtis ti peagium congress is free to do that thenn ofe the grounds to do it the court can assume whatever standard at once but there is no penalty tha can actually be applied here the court had been considering a coat of ethic since at least at twenty nineteen when justice elanikagan told the house committee that chief justice john roberts was weighing the idea after the metu movements parked a reexamination of workplace culture throughout society but in recent weeks roberts has as shoved this thing through again oneof the reasons this stupid is because once you actually express a coat of conduct it will unavoidably be used by pponents of particular justice go after them as can be true left it is can be true right itscan be true centerscan be true everywhere because again there is already a standard for a high crown or mis demeanor a supreme court justice can' be removed by congress that is the punishment this offers no actual punishment is just can be used for further fodder to to disable the court as always chief justice john roberts doing the doing the work of undermining the court every time he attempts to actually prop up the legitimacy of the court aradagized the rest of the show continues right now you are not going to want to miss it would you believe if i told you that many of the people who regulate your banks are our perverts we will begettinginto that momentarily for not a member became member use cote chipero at chack out for to months frional

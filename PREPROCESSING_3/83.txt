immediately in without conditions and thi espectlyfly note the presence among as of membes of thet famulis excellencies it this important to also recognize the effects by amas the northapan in the facuns the polistinin people have been subjected to fifty cixcias of sufulcating occupations this is simply put juw hatred full stop juw hatred it is apology for terrorism it ignors reality the vasmotory palicinians live under the direct palestinian rule whether commas in the gos a strip or the palcinian authority in the westbank but worse than that it reverses reality it lavs the blame for a genicitle mas slaughter of jews on jews contextralizing massmurder of course is par for the cours for the evil organization that is the united nations and theunitinations is in fact in evil organization as will discussing moment guterrison stop there he blamed commases perversities on settlements meaning jews building homes in the hartlandobiblical israel judaa and smerria clearly the

the engal is obvious stop israel from defending itself perpetuate the called cycl of violence make it harder for israel to survive continue the u ans mission to destroy the jewish state the united nations is a garbacip of epic proportions is not merely a useless organization that cost the united states over twelve billion dollars every year it is an epic failure of an organization thet provides covered for the world's worst human right tobusers and actively foments ju hatred and jumurder in the mideleast the united nations general assembly is dominated by nations who hate israel and care little for human rites which is wy from twenty fifteen to twenty twenty two the u n general assembly adopted one hundred and forty resolutions against israel it adopted one against north corea one againstaffganistan zero againstvenzuela zero against comss zero against china in fact the entire rest of the world combined merited a grantoral of sixty eight resolutions of condemnation israel supposedly merited a hundred and forty the u ans particular hatred for israel has been a long running theme which of course make sent some fifty six member nations are also members of the called organization of is lamic cooperation the vast majority of which are directed overtly against israel but it means that u n has served as the propagana arm for juhators olover the glube for decades in nineteen seventy five at the behest of the sovie union for example the united nations general assembly passed a resolution to claringzinism the political movement for jewishome land racism prompting u s ambassador to the u n daniel patric onehand to declared that u n had made antisematism international law one hand added a great evil has been lused upon the world nothing in the nature of thuan has changed since th united nations has an entire department dedicated to forting anti israel propaganda and terrorism the united nations relief and work agiency was founded in december nineteen forty nine with the purpose of dealing with refugees from the nineteen forty eight israely war of independence arab refugees that is the eight hundred thousand jews expelled from arab and muzlin lands in the same time period those people ware simply taken in by israel the arbnationsof course took in none of the palestinian refugeees the u an ar dla is in fact the only agency at the u n dedicated to one specific population and it has helped keep that population refuge he camps fort seventy years the u and our ta is almost entirely staffed by members of the palsinian ar community it is in fact a globaly sponseor welfare organization with twenty three thousand palisinian arab employs and just one hundred uan professionals from elsewhere it is not u n organization it is a ma work organization that works very very closely with comass is lomi g hod inthe palcinian authority yu an r w has never condemn comasste genda e routinely hiers members of comass and is lonic g hod one of w and r ws chief tasks is running dozens of palstinian schools yu and r w s might predict then helps in doctrinate palstinian arb school children in ju hatred according to a marks report from united nations watch u and w a has overseen the broad indoctrination of palestinian ouths into toxic and viol antisemitism that report names forty seven cases of incitement to violenc by u and r w staff one hundred n thirty three u and r w educators an staff who promote hate and violence on social media and and other eighty twou educators an staff involved in thorty u and r w schools who create and distribute ju hat in content to students for example one reading comprehension exercise for nine grators at all magosi middale school for boys in the gossestrip celebrates the burning of a jewish bass as quote a barbicu party fifth greaters o that same u n school were taught that maredm and g hat are quote the most important meanings of life the sort of stuff is not un common by any stretch of the imagination in palisinian schools run by the u and r w which is wy commas's political leader is smalcanea is a and r w graduate as b rzs r onts the forme comas chief sos rham macadama he master mi behind comsses military structure yu and r w resources are also dedicated to elping terroras scroups more directly yu and r w vehicles have been used to transport terroras and weapons that incluses ambulances u and r w a schools hav been used by comass to store weapons yu and r wa also helps from out comass front groups including the palistinian returns hunter yu and rw has been used by camass to cover its tunnels last november yu and rw a in a rare admission protested te quote man made cavity on the ground u an r w school that is the uphemism the s man made cavity not territonnel they calle hit a serious violation of the agencies neutrality the statement of course made no mention of comass in twenty twenty one comassac sh prevented entry to an investigative team from the u en ta shaft built under a u and r a school the whole purpose of this is that if israel tries to strike a terratunnel it has to hitoschool for all these reasons the trump administration cut off contributions from the united states to the u and r w then presenent bidon in all of his vast wisdom restored hundreds of millions of dollars in funnin much of which undoubted wen directly to commas over the course of last couple of years the administration gave the u and r w some seven hundred million dollars of your tax par mony the is why back in february represent of schipbroy of texas called for the defunding of u an r a noting quote yu and r ws lengthy and detailed history of promoting antisemitism violence and terrorism through educational materials and its continutize to comass should completely disqualify this corupt entity from receiving any u s tax par funding it did not happen an such n surprising that after the october seventh massacre many implo s of the u and r w wen amine to celebrate the mass j mur for example principal mn hassan who glorified commss is murder of babies as quote repayng in justices and her friends burn burn burn the burn burn burn of course was directed its villions or you and art a teacher mahamed adwan who defended the commoss masscer quote what we do is resistans regaining arrights and then youlegized terris or for example you and artl a school councillor nevin afana on the same day of the massacre she prayed for the murderers on face but quote o alla have mercy on the martyrs steadfast are mushakidin grant them victory over the unbelievers and a good ending how about you an arl wa teacher osama acmad on sunday morning as commass terrorists invaded is really towns going to hillanur he celebrated allah is the greatest above imagination hav out you and ardl impeate trition by sheer hamis ganam right after the massacre he sharet a post praising the murderers ask quote martyrs of the alamic anarabnation were marted in defending their home land and nation in none of this is a surprise this is what the uan is all about it is not an exception it is not a few bad apples theu n as been run as an antis metic organization from basically a few years after its inception until right now the united nations is the disgrace it has never fulfilled its cormanding the purpose of the uan was originally expressed in its charter quote to save succeeding generations from the scorge of ware which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sara to mankind and to reav from faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights tof men and women of nations large and small and to establish conditions under which justice and respect four obligations ariseing from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintain and to romote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom the uan has achieved almost none of these goals th united nations was establishe primarily by the united states in the aftromafabl relord to an an attempt ot creating a called family of nations it has been a full skilled disaster area ever sincs serving more as a propaganda tool on behalf of third world autocracies then on behalf of the institution for defence of democracy that served ats its initial mistion the united nations should be disbanded th u us should defunded theou and building should be fumigated and rededicated to something more useful manufacturing manure never again shuld anyone pretend that the united nations has the power of the moral highground in fact it really never did in just one second we will get to the latest on the grounds in israel and we will see the rest of the middle eastern autocracies again ciding with camass that is one of the things tat is happening right now which is prompting a call for cas fires a in moral clarity disappeared that as magic first last month ha g twenty announce to plan to impose diginal currencies and digulizies on their respective

figuring out what to do for their part obviously they are fighting mad add the secretary general of the united nations making excuses for comas and suggesting that basically burning babies alive in their bads that is just the predictable response to land disputes a's effectively what the uan is is now claiming gilad er don who is the isrally ambassador to the united nations here is what he had tosa the you an thes fanin in you mis te secretery genera hav lost old moradathe and impasiality because when you say those terrible words then these hanis the fact did not happen i of vakum you are tolerate thin terrorism of course that is absolutely trup hat's absygbut of course whats happening th uan is in happening in avacuum either meaning the constituent nations of the uan the people have to vote in you and general assembly the people just proportionalely comprised the you and general assembly are in fact nations that are either autocracies or sympathetic to terrorists and that is just the reality of the world an notes an ugly reality for for us in the west to contemplate is the fact that not everybody things us that people do not agree with us that we cantall talk it out over a cup of tea across a table but the reality is that many of the same people who you see folks suggesting are rational actors in this region are in fact dedicated two the destruction of the west they do not the west they think the west is bad one of those people is the president of turkey the dictator of turkey recepate pay up erowan erowan who shifted turkey away from being a a seculert quasi democracy in the early two thousands and toward being in aslomic fundamentalistic tatorship erowan is a sponsor h's a statesponser of terrors im he sponsors komas you will recall that just recently there are some commentators who are suggesting that he ought to play honest broker between israel and comas which is a joke it is ridiculous well yesterday he just came out squarely in favor of kamas he said the mas is not a terrorist organization instead they were a quot liberation group fighting a battle to protect their land which is weired because i did not realize their land included kfar oza iand realize that their land included kubut berry but apparently according to erowan it s os becaus worse all of that is islamic land erowan then claim that israel had taken advantage of turkey's good intentions and thn he cansell the visit to israel because he said tht israel is fighting in inhumane war against camas that is rich coming from the same country that retumy violates human rights whether it isagainst armenians or whether it is ins others in the region he said comas is not a terrist organization of course this the st t that he says to is own parliament one of the ig things to nderstand im at eleast is that what many of thse dictators say too western media is not the same stuff they say in their own language to their own people but they hashually mean is the stuff they say in their own language to their own people he then blamed the united states suggesting that people outside the riginal quote on quot adding fuel to the fire in the name of supporting israel turkey is suppose tobe moderate states turkey you will recall is a member of nato which is ridiculous the idea that if their reverent tack on turkey that nato members would be obligated t come to turkey's defence is insane that is totally grazy it is not of course just urdoon seanan last night had on queen renea of jordan let us be clear about the hashemite kingdom of jordn the hashemie kingdom of jordan exists because the wet the westpon youn o by a colonial outpost the hashemik kingdom of jordan is colonial aupost her literally a tribal family those elevated to royalty in a made up country calld jordan if you think that jordan has a historic basis with hashemi kingdoms it does not it does not it was created from exactly the same cloth it was it was british mand a palistine and the jordan was carved off and the hashemites were given control of the kingdom tbecause the rland disputes overt over control of syria for example and in order to placate the hashemites they were given control of jordan but the the land of jordan is populated almost entirely by qon qui palistonian arabs meaning people who wore descended from people who were living in british mans a palistine at the time of the creation of jordan queen ernea is one of them by the way queen renea is is a palisinian arab but she is also a member of the hashemite royal family if that hashmi royal family would cross the population the population woul kill her and her had would geniple that is effectively what hawt goes in jordan shoofse interviewed on tuesday night bysianan she is supposed to be a a quasi western moderate here she was pretending the commoston comittatrocities now do i really think that queen renea thinks that commasin comittitrocty's course not of course not but truth does not have quite the same value in this part of the world as it does in say the west anda she also knows that again if she were to come out against comas if she were to condem comas there is a good shot that she and the rest of her family would be dead again the younto talk about colonial outpost colonial outpost would be the kingdom of jordan hat is a colonial apost that is a that is a left over from the britishmandate in any case here is queen renea denying that commas committed atrocities i am not arguing accuracy at christine i'm arguing equivadence and and doubletandet here when the present of the united the is is told that the ino e has evidence i in evidence of children behead o only to a tra because the idheaccent e isnal proop of that that is confimation by is even ats your netwer christangano the the thianan wepsite a at the beginning of the confidect a report e headline of at is threety children found butsen in the istry to cobots and when you read tohe story thet's not asn't been independent they verified no my question to you would you p bish and fu an daning yet unbir bar fie cane made by a petithinian o queen ia ii just tany tos sit up an you right thet because the the have been pictures shown by thes radies and an o john its the been down ther i'm not tooking about beheadings i'm tokin about babies bodies wriddled with with bolits and things of course she is standing for commass of course she is but just the full on hollocoss level denial right there from the queen of jordan that is what this region is and if anybody pretends otherwise they are blinding themselves to the reality 'll get to mor from queen renea ins they ar again she is a western moderate wors pos to where else pos to preten that the this a moderate kingdom here moderation i is not

minded nations just have to talk it out is ridiculous is why the united nations as a premise was always idiotic it was always idiotic pretending that the united states in china are going to gets gothern room in side on world policy is stupid it is stupid it is always been stupin that is the that is the security council deen stupider is imagining that the general assembly is anything but a collection of some ofthe worst nations on plantergalic sudan making world policy yet england given the same vote as as libia it is it is wild and insane and stupid n the fact tatnybody treats this this way is once again evidence of a cultural athno centrism that comes with the west oneo the reat ironies of the anti hatno centrism at movement from people edward siyed who are th book orientalism suggesting hat the west had a a dim view of of qoquote the oriental cultures and that that had led them to colonialism and a partide an all the rest of it and really really that that is that those ignorant we should study those cultures from the inside ironically that has led to a new sort of ethnocentrism in which selest assumes that everybody things members of the west and thus everyone can be trusted and treated as moderate e queen rnia again is welcomed in capitals around the world as some sort of moderate while she stands for commoss me here she was yesterday talking about its glaring double standard for the world to defend israel defending itself from terrorist in the last couple of winks we have seen iu n agnaring double faunted in the world when october seventh happened the world immediately and unequivocally astod by isral and at tri to defend itself encondemned a the attack that happened but when wes looker thing that as couple of weeks we have not was sing silenth in the world and in od the countries ta stop a just expressing concern or acnoneging the casualties but always with a prefase of decoration of support a for israel and e are we being told that it is wrong to kill a a faminy an entire famiy at gone point but it is o k to show them to death an in there is a clarig to letanit sch trashn i such tration as obviously morally equivalent trash by the way this is the same kingdom that massacred that massacred three thousand palistinians in nineteen seventy and expelled twenty thalsand palistinians just to get rid of its radicals ous em bring that up ever everever by the way the tordanian security services are not known for being particularly nice to palistinian radicals ou kno likes if they were they be overthrown but again this is all it is all funnin games when the west pretends moral equivalence and that moral equivalence allowis them to to pressure israel into cunquld two state solutions and all the rest pressuring israel to bring fuel into the gossistrips that commoscan use it by the way aerial photoshore the commos currently has half a million gallons of fuel available to it its husing all of it presumebly to support it is terraced operations meanwhile the called peace process partners that israelspos we are lying pon a paliscnian authority whilst returnal today long before commossmilitons burst out of their gossi stronghold mask or scores of civillians with hand guns and assall rifles a rand on tis allies that accelerated efforts to smuggle weapons into a different part of the palsonian territories the west bank using drones secret airline flights and allan brige the traverses hundreds of miles ad at least four national borders the smuggling operation is raising the feder of a new conflagration in the war between israel and palistinians itpose the growing thread to jordan a staunch youus ally which borders israel an th west bank and has been struggling to contain a growing flow of drogs and arms around once yo turn jordan into a transiteria for weapons going into israels at amer all sabila you uonder why jordan is standing for comas because they are also held hostage bacomases allies that would be the reason and et at the same time it is the west promoting the idea that israel has to make concessions to these same exjact people 's the palsin an authority which is allowd all of this tay happen and which pays by again they sign checks to the families of the terrorists with your taxpare dollars by the way since youre the one to ar sending money i'm sending money to the palsinan authority right now it is absurd meanwhile israel continues to fight an exostential war for it is al them tat accistential war is notgoing to end with th destruction of comass because that warsgoan continue cosbalon israels northern barder as i've said before i is a ma is a much higher threat to the existence of the state of israel than comasses commass is dangerous to jews causblaw is dangerous in the higr rexistence o the state of israel s the israel is stretched thin that has to fight a war with comass in the gassi strip and has to simultaneously fight a war with palsinian authority n this lomic ghod terrace in the called westbank and a has to fight a war with cusbalat in the north maybe with syrael tat's an extistential threat for israel israel's facing a long turn battle for its survival here benjamin intin aw whose spokes person talking about comas silizen we least have to take commass of the table when i can live next to a genicitle threat here was bebes spoke person at talhinreth all right now we have war than seven thousand and seven hundred gockets that have been firedthat is really terrytory since the outbreak off this war that we did not star the war that we did not ont we did not even expect we were drag and drag into it by the comastereganization and we stand ras a nation we have taken this very important decision that we can no longer live next to an exestential genicidal threat this is the only reason why we are operating in gasza right now and we will ring and ends to the comas regime in gaza whence we are done they will not have any kind of governin bodies ror military wing a comaskan simply be no longer now the only question is whne of the west is going to actually allow israel to do that or wit thegnan trie to tie their hand far the by dministration has been sending a few mixed signals yesterday in good signalling john curby the annis a spokes person he said that a the idea of an immediate sees fires ri diculous and hal's komass which of course is true in i an why ti o ming to t thin in a ibegin to speculate on that i know that that si that those aure potentials steps that havent happen yet and at may not happen all i can tell you is we are get tit continue to make sure isral has the tools on to capabilities that they need to defend themselves gen tin continue to try to get thet tim inti teir assistance an were en ti continuen to try to get hostagesn' and people out of gosaappropriately and as thit think youe heard us say a sea fire right now really only benefit tomus yo secretary state ansony blinkin also added were not seekin conflict of the ron we a ron to back off but if eron attacks american forces obviously wle respond how we have respond and let me say what weve consistently said to aronian officials through other chances the united states does not seek conflict with a ronwe do not want this for to wit but if feron or its proxies attack you us personel anywhere make no mistake we will decend our people we will decend our security swiftly and decisively the question is whether that is going to be true in action far the aronians hav been launching attacks on americans and american allies throughout the region according to the wall stre journal from more than six months arnia back milicia groups fore frained frm launching drones or rock ets against american troups in rock and syria that came to an abrupt end when you as official sent aron back grops launch ten drone an rock at attacks against you as bases you as troups use in arock and another three on uospace in south east syria the attacks were carried out between outtober seventeen and october twenty fourth in one of the attacks at all osid air base in a rock last week you as trouops shot a militian groups drone out of the sky and then fellontobin of american drun in destroyed it in yemmen eroning back truthes fired five at ronian pvided cruws missiles and launch about thirty drone sort is ral and attack those larger than initially described by the pence gon last week yhou as sets carney guided missile destroyer which was operating in the northern red see shockd down four of the cruws missiles while fifth cruws missile was interecepted by tautyarabia protecting its on air space the pens gon has deployed nearly a dozn't ar tifend sistems to contryes a cross the mt a least athead of istrals expeckted land invation of gos of thy move missil launchers to a roch syria and the gulf according to you as officials the pens gon has also sending aterminal high altitude aerea defence or thad two salurabia and patris surfacs har missiles to quaite jordin eroch saudyra about cuttar and the united aerbemerats in the expectation that eron goes blistic if israel decides that is going to go in and wipe out comoss comosta obviously is in aronian proxy and aron does not want sey them taken off the board the question is going to be whether eron tries to call the us's bloff the be worst mistake never made by the way a i i truly believe that even a as much as i am afraid of the weakness of bid administration as much as they send make signals if american bases ar fully attack if you a ship ps ar tac it will be the worst thing aronever did for itself thet be a huge mistake which is why in the end i think the ron is signalling alobut i do not think theire actiln can in do anythng overwhelming right now what they are doing is pursuing low level conflict sufficient to let everybody know that they are upset they are pursuing low level conflict sufficient to type is really forces in the north for examplein to signal to comoss they want them to continue what they'r doing but again i do not think that theron is irrational enough to step over the line with the united states in the region meanwhile the bide ad ministration again those mixed signals our wild yesterday i playe to clip of crreen jom pierre the press secretary for the white house absoletin compen en teriblator job being asked about rising antisematism the united states pretending it does not existen that immediately launching into speech about is lamaphobia yesterday she had to walk that back because again she is terrible at er job i want ter make something clear at the top cause i understand how important a more clarity is especially at this time when jues are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity when israel singled out because of anti jeish hatred that is antithemitism and that is unactheptible there is no place for antithemitism full stop period this is important to the president it is important to me personally and to every one in the administration following the hamosh teratacs an israel which were the dedlios for ju since the holicot the president has been consistent and clear we must all do our part and forcefully forcefubly speak out against antithemitism and we must incure that there is no place for hate an america may you now be a great start would be expelling or shuted to leap from congress is still have yet to see any members of congress actually asked about reshuted tly who continues to maintain by the way falsely that israel bomd the hospital in gosit she continues to mantain that despite all evidence of the contract does not matter her be of course she is a paphological lir any terror supporters that of course is no shock ell one of the reasons that the world feels capable of slipping back into this ridiculous moral equivalents the the soft lukewarm bath water of moral reltvism is beause the media do it for them the me tou make it supereasy last night for example see an en to earn burnette wis talking bout the conditions under which hostages are being held theire still two hundredpluss hostages foar being held in bondage by hemoss an again the world community seems to have far less words for comossholding hostages than they do for israel trying to kill members of homos an na is here is he earn brnette weardly praising the conditions under which hostages are being held i've never heard this before ones thy've never heard a situation which a hostage is taken babies the elderly and the year yes but they do have sinxs what the what the at what then thinks stand out and there then londane necessity right your talking about tunnels we know these tunnels and thantilation we now that they they known that there conditioning thatt this is all been ording that we have heard from thes railyis over the ars but the fact that she sang she was held under ground for more than two weeks im that there ware shamp poo ther was ana piotics there was a gard per hostige an the experience she had in that there were matics and parametics and ot this sa she is elderly the other woman who is released also elderly and hagmatical means and that they had the medicine needed in an efnot something ot similar to replace it im it is pretty stunning because you't got a contrast that with what is happening above the ground right where there is not water never mind shamp oo hoke they do not have water there is not toilet water there is no warphine for any kind of i amputations ana piotics no right but homasat stock piled all athat and has all athot under ground and that is at we are learning from her that is that is we are whyre why we describing the maject of the to tat works amean wht what sheu should be saying an bernett the logical conclusion of what sheu should be saying there is because commoss cares about keeping terroris and does not give a rap battone sovilions but of course sianan is never going to go quite that far again morel equivalents to hellvedrog by the way in a good move from the other side of the isle florda's university system working with governor rotosantis ordered colleges on tuesday to shut down a propalistinian student organizations be a procomos organization the students for justice in palstine which is leading a lot of these procomas protests all over the place administrators have said that national esta identified itself as pat of comoses attack and was a fellin he under flortal law to provide material support to designated foreign terrorst organization that of course is a positive move i've seen some people claiming that to santis is somehow not pro isral enough that is a bizar statement considering he is the most pro israel politicion in america and the most effective on that score by an extrordinarily long shot and meanwhile you'r staring s e fall out at the university level tlhe universities have always relied on these major doners wh been giving to their almamaders in order to prop them up well now finally some of the liberal jews been givin lot of money to these organizations are realizing that actually they been contributing money to people who do not care about the murder of their co religionists at all d the're starting to pull their cash well get to that momentarily first the regular basepelseason is now officially over that does not mean the fon has to end

terrism and anti sematism all over the globe that is not relegatedts forn countries tht is very true here in the united states as well which is why you are starting to see some downers and major american universities look at te universities in realize exactly what it is that they have done the universities have full skale embrace the d colonization narrative than narative started with people phronsfanone back in the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties claiming that the wa that the third world was going to d colonize would have to involve violence against western institutions those western institutions were evil an they had to be done away with the is going be a violent movement tere's a lot of simpathy for that in left wing circles marks a circles particularly that united with the intero sectional critical fury movements to produce the idea that d colonization was not just to project for the thirdworld os something at happened had happen here at home which is why you see black lives matter united with the frans panon revolutionaries this is why you see queers for palistin for example that is what that is and that is the leeding bleeding edge of the ideal logical revolution at these major universities it is why you see mass protestat universities in favor of commoss in which you see again the local trans group marching and does not heu make sens from the outside accept that uift understand this o deconcld coalition of the wretched the coalition of the oppresse and an they are rising up against the institutions of the west ies not attack on israels and attack on western institutions as western institutions a lot of people who are sort of liberal hollowmen fellow travellers we are fine with this for a long time ous the toght ocame wwe we also we know wheren't we do not love the institutions and and it buies us some street crad wit the left wing if we pretend along and the the hollomen fellow travellers the people that the tom wulf described in a very famous assay written in the late nineteen sixties called radical sheek that party at lennies which is all about lenard burnsteen the left winger who hosted te black panthlers at his apartments an the black panthers were telling allthe why youl tat the want to kill him anallthe white people ware patting them on the head in posing for pictures with them becaus that' what they do beause it meant that they were cool tow that that that sort of attitude has lasted until now except for at a certain point exercesin that these people ashyg you want a kill yun the'r not joking and that they are not actually yar friends and that in fact they are perfectly fine with watching your compatriots get murdered unto your starting to see liberal jeishtowners and majour universities and and other liberals we are not happy with the start to pull their money according to the walster journal theavid makourmen was an israel celebrating a holiday by dancing ith t a tor in sinegot when homas attack the country earlier this month when is all moda the university of pensylvania but out a statemen a few days later that all the assal terrific but did not explicitly con themhomas he was on cens he simply pulled his money top university such as harvard an pen oure facing back lash from alumni angry about the schools reactions to the attacks and they are after math some say t was the final straw after years of groing dis enchantmen with the schools over what they see as they left word political shift that includes people president very summers used to be the the president of harvard university retell billion are lesle wexlers foundation said that it wel cut find natural tizes with harvard and o program it funded at the school for israelies wexoner n his wife do not nated more than forty to

at leadership pen is facing a giant do not revolt fror people ronald louder and a poligable management shieve executive mark roan they are pulling their money as well as whell they should it is beyond time all all the masks are coming about the only the only thing that i can say about what what has happenin the last three weeks is thar all the masks are curently off all of them they are are nomore masks and that is why the world look ugly today and you see the west struggling to please put the massback on please put it back on lhet's pretend that everybody's moderate let us pretend that the two state solution is really the answer let us pretend that wa's happening on college campsiss just another fun aspect of free speech liciost pretend but just pretend but everybody can tell that is bulgrab everyone can tell all the masks are off and people are being forced to take sides pople do not taken sides and again they are rushing for the moral equivalents they'r looking the're grasping its tros begging for any excuse to go back to stadish quo anty but gess what the world was never statisqlant gis all got it wrong and a certain poin you canto have to recognize you got it wrong if you wish to live in the real world and make the rael rorlds better place it turns out that the world of fancy an i lusionyou bilt up in your mind where everybody is your potential friend and the introsectional collishon the're all o your buddies and all these people who have been openly calling for revolution against western institutions with t israel is the tip of the spear that all those people we are not lying they were saying ing directly your face and you in your great sophistication and wisdom decided that they did not understand they'r own little hearts you were more broad minded than they were you understood what they really really wanted and that was a lie you are pretending the some them were lyined you some of them ere pretending that they what they wu want its two state solution in israel what they really wanted was a little bit more lee way when it came to criminal justice reform but it turns out that lotiless people they w're lingd you then's hw they wanted it all andwat they said to their own friends is something very different than what they said to you and people are starting to realize that and and what maybe that is the only silver lining to horrifying situations the is is that reality tends to generate its own solutions a meanwhile the republicans continued to battle over who will be the noc speaker of the house this battleicantinued yesterday when tom emer when down to flaming defeat tom emer of course was a minisota congress person who was running for speaker of the house he was considered by some people to moderate because he was prosame sexs marriage donal trump tri to torpedo in but the reality is that he was going down flaming to feet anyway was not really trump that did it trump istaken credit for it but trump backim jornin that and put him over the top but this makes trump happy according to political just ours after tom amer one ther publican conference is nomination to be house peaker on tuesday former president on trump took to truth social to deride him as i quot a totally out of touch with e publican voter's globilist rynow hethen got on the ful members to express his aversion framer and his bid for speaker by tuesday afternoon he said he is done it is over i killed him and just minutes later mer officially dropped out of the race now again the chance is that that mer was going to move ford anyway were pretty low not just cas trumptan support hid but because he jus did not hav the the can m under the table friendships that enough people needed in order to to get to two seventeen the the latest nominy is apparently mike johnson is my johnsongan gets tosentin who o the helmos first the epublicans had to hold an another celebration about torpedoing another nominy matr tal agreensias it is good that tom emer is out here wus yesterday i youl conmue to cate to him ta you your could not change your cinin your your sort of werd lock im on opposing in i i cra te maen lan the comrats tim i in our well call tat and a wis awis ta len a er ma i there was mor comversation that wit and when on an the comprats bat i he te cronono and and i think e peier e co the top he comprats that chann and its changing toe plak o maria pirst i and wer cublican paders taver welmingly te per prasidat trum and the toy comrats anespeakera co i did the than c i mean that that is all lon good accept thet maccarthy also supported trump and trum support od maccarthy and gets ouse ed him anywaye that was weird now matr hav agreen who voted gainstousing mac carthy but for what i's worth but there is no question that hurting the republican to this point as republican represented mike flood of nebrask is had is hurting methridden cavs not an an accurate comparison are you in was spear i was speaker of the nabrat an uni camere legislatur which by the way is officially not partis tan i lik ortin cap an ta than an o m an and what i got tho washington i thought be uni cameral folloo me to te bra to washincan be the a no party that the len no party leadership a it it reminds me a little bit of forty nine individual state teniters running roud but no i think i deal of it one o o much to do that job ye i meanthat nobody really wants to in any case make johnson is the guy whos up for the job to day will get to h is chance is vactury being the next speaker which are better than tom emmers and apparently jim shordans and stevescaleses and kepmac carthees by the way we are only bout two hundred and sixteen member s away from getting back to kepmac carfees we go round the endless wheel of speakerse get to that momentarily first mity knows that i need to have my black rifle coffe every morning i need it i particularly lately it is been a lot black going on i need my coffee last night i was speaking i

republican house speaker nominy actually get to two seventeen poletical seems to think maybe the answers yes maybe this long national lightmare fore publicans is coming to an end quote late tuesday night representer of mike johnson became the latest jope conference nominy this time there is no backbighting nole to mde hims notes and arky comments oreports just cheers and an overwhelming cense of relief is not over yet three law makers voted present during a roll call pole of the comference twenty two chopee law makers were absent 's possible thre miht be decisive handfull of never mikes hiding out there but the lack of vocal opposition and surfeit of genuin enthusiasm that was air last night on opposing sides o the house jopee marked a significant shift after three weeks of chaos mike's the straightforward leader who can unite us as re publicans wrote represent him carlos hemenas of florta was one of the sentris who has been who is been not voting for some the nominies johnson is the right gueye theright time as representiv chiproy who is of course on the right of the coukis represent of kenbuck of colerado he said i think he gets it to morrow johnson is not anyone's first choice far from it on the first ballet on tuesday mornin he garnered only thirty fourevotes but he does not have a lot of enemies because the lot lower profile then a lot of the o the republicans fuar in the house all the other people have made enemies johnson not mutch he is a fifty one year old shree port native he came into elective politics into thousin sixteens he has men in the house all that long but he is the chairman of the republican study commitee as the former arisy chairman an current chair of judiciary sub committe he is sort of a wonkee guy he does not have a lot of outward ambition and he sort of the guy who they came to in the end he would be the least experience speaker in the history of the house he is in his fourth full ter andh's never served in senior leadership at all he is not big fun razor hehsome of some of things that can come up obviously is that he w as in oreganizer of an amicos brief in faver of overturning the the certification of electoral votes but it does seem the r publicans are finally tired of this and johnson is the least offense of guy on the lock i'm sur he' we find tat the job i'm sure he well because everyone as the same on times of structure youknowho to find any of these people the one thing that has to changes if he takes the job hast get rid of this idiotic rule where by he needs republican uninimity in order to go forward he he he cannot continue to b speaker of the house with the rule in place that any member at any time can call effectively for no confidence but against him that neats to stop right to hell now here is represent of johnson last night announcing his speakership bid what if they gall the restor wait it as been qiter r de mocrecy is messys sometimes bu it is our system this concretthat you see this hounse ropopican majurity is you ninted and well that would be nice because it seems their some things to do perhaps the re publicans this timewill get their act together and if not then the endless weeld speaker candidates will continue o ki meanwhile the economy continues to cool down a gn re publicans have been provided a target rich environment by the bi n administration e ove the world on fire nearly everywhere you have the economy continuing to overheat to spites radically increase interestrates right now according to the wallstr journal we have the highest bond yields in sixteen years quothe the yield on yus treasury ten your treasury touch five percent on monday for the first time in sixteen years after climbing rapidly in recent weeks that is among many borrowing closs including for other long turment govrment det mortgages credicards auto purchases business lones that could slow the surprisingly resiliens economy rising rates come on top of other potential impediments for the economy those include the conflict in he iddle east the long labor strikes meanwhile hire yields lift borrowing cost for the ost government amid ballooning national dat the economyes rain strong over the past year if hire long turms rates persist they could increase the risks of a broader and deeper downturn rather than the called soft landing those higher rte are can a crim consumer spending but more than more than ever what this means that it just very hard to take out nu dabt as the bond yields continued to increase what you are going to see effectively speaking is very difficult modnitization of the dabt that is we also canice money that is is now being shifted away from the tock markin toward the bonmarket when yields are this high and you can secure a five per cent yield on bonds that is u as a pretty solid yield on bonds are gen a bed in the stock market on the other side the only reason not to is because you think that the federal government is cn a raise the interest rates and the old bonds are can be worth less thn they are even now which could happen all the suns certainty is crating enormous friction in the economy meawhile jobidens plan is tou spend more money not just on foren policy he is now calling for fifty billion dollars more on urgent domestic needs thi ky just he has one solution ands more cowbell he us needs of firehodes with money and he sh can are fired everywhere the proposed legislation we will all for more funning for child car high speedintern at access n natural disastra lef and fire fightales fire fighters battling wild fighters among other domestic policy priorities according to the white house office of management and budget director cholansa young is the washington post reporting it is non clear how much funning the president will propose for each program again the white house just recently on veile that one hundred and six billion dollar eight package primarily focasing on funning for you crane and israel an includes tiwuan aid and include some bore security stuff and now he is hattng on top of tat another fifty billion dollars gis why the hellnot it is non as though if we just keep spending into an inflationary economy the inflation will continue that tha that that would that that be crazy that is exactly what he is doing by the way and it is going to continue meanwhile the u a w continues its strike that as now been going on for weeks and weeks and weeks unions all over the countryare looking at the byd deministration as a patsy and somebody they can play in force into a position of taking in anti management position and more and more unions are looking at the possibility of striking and cregating friction in the american economy jobins gan have a rough reelect road if republicans do not do what they are fond of doing which is jump on a rake repeatedly jobin has been awful on every available front it is possible to be awful if republicans could start to makes to

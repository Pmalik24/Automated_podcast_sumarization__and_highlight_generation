country he allowed us to tag along with him we were hapby to go he and one of our producers of we chase at the road together to see how the presence of these stopped the stealers is changing things if they get ther way it is gointshift the party and when we do elections pretty fundamentally for years to come from bsy chicago its this american life i mor glass stay withus at one magazona i'm dodanna jogan lokgen how all this is playing out in arazona a place that some at maga people to call magazona and wech has ourizona because the movement there has really been sending the pace for the rest of the country people who believe the twenty twenty election was stolen tried to recall republican officials there they also pushed for a hand recount the millions ballats thatbecame a model for other states around the country who tried it even though in arizona it revealed the jobidan one the election with even more votes than they had thought the audit narizona gavanized tons of people who wanted to do more and lots of those people jumpted to the recinct strategy an arizona you can really see the effect that strategyis having that is what isaac and soi had been out their co reporting here is isaac all over the country almost everywhere i called georgia florida texas there were local level republican officials who were getting flooded with new people wanting to become precinct committee members a lot of these officials did not know about the precinct strategy they had not seen stev banans interview with dandsholtz and there were frankly a little puzzled by what was happening cathy petszas in maricoblic county r arazo ea ones a ran storm and people all of a senan houn of the wood work were wanting to suddenly to come precinct committemen i used to get two or three people a month and i with gettin forty o fifteen ye im not yenig i see or li o forty o fiftapplications thrown atme i some times tin a week cathy as old school and oj republican she says she was stuffing mailors for the party when she was twelve or thirteen when she was the tea major she was a worded outstanding teamages republican she got to meet president ragan in the rose garden put sone me canesign on her lon every year for his birthday she is been a precinct committee member for forty years as district chair she had four hundred fifty four precinct committees lots as she had a clear idea of who a precinct committee member shounsome one who knows the neighborhood and the people in some one knowledge able about local republican politics and cathy wanted to know who are all these new people who suddenly wanted to do this un glamerius job she started taking the aplicants sout to mee one on ie at aand copy with a hundred and fifty six people iave never met befar and got bati ni mean sometimes of is mortful times to day i was yone with pee they would start bringing out the things that we have all heard about the viteos that the asanot now this is out ther you really should watch tha since shul ra thes to kind of explain to me how i really did not know anything about the election and the prosipi bee sicply saying there is a conspiracy rigging thi election you have been involved in localpotics for a long time bat you do not understand the depth of the sams orsa and now they would and in i would have an interesting conversation i do not mind payin for their cofeees i was interesting no one rational no one who has a is voted over and over and over again actually believes to be clear not all the new applicance thought the election was stolen but a lot of them did and cathy felt what they were saying was nots as the district chair cathy hathy authority to appoint the new precint committee members or not other chairs in other districts were cool whatever side a ut but cathy decided she was can screened the people and after every meeting i would go back an kind of look at tit man lookd up ther cot er history only to find out that some of them actually will not registerd republicans some many ad only recently registered tot had never voted but in a coffee or meeting or something with them they would tell me about mass of frod teys and i ti to never vot it if only it is my i'm the one signing off very i want to feel pretty comfortable about what i'm signing off on and it is my pridef it sense in our violets it my choice those people who just registered to vote talking about massive fraud ry pleasure to met you see around cathys can a look for someone else to fill that slaw it is was also your sneaky criteria for a limineating some of you nou stot the teel i yolike main was not sikin i could that been sneakin gets to the i thing what i mean by ord sneaking as you could say if you believe the election was stolen than you don' get ti e it was a fair standard you want to talk about the election i want a tonk upon it witd people who actually prerticipat in election cathy did not think people who were telling her about massive votofraud would make good messengers for the party they were wild about her either oo i spoke with one of the people cathy was trying to keep out of the precinct committee merca hamilton and when i brought up cathy's name marca lunge lobbing the worst insult you could against a fellow republican athy pata supported quietly supported bitin she went an that hpeople be comprecing committeemen iif they supported trump have you interview cathy patsas yeshe is lying to you cathy patas did not support trump she told people to vote for bitin she was a never trumper a bold never trumper cathy actually seemed to be a once trumper says she supported him in twenty sixteen just not any more sill cathy insiyst she never supported bitin did not tell anybody else to either the ideas in athema to cathy merca says she heard that cat hy even recruited democrats to switch parties and become re publicans in order to install them as precinct committee men under her control to keep control for legislative distract this may have happened in only one case i think and i believe cathy did not know the republican doner she recruited was actually a registered democrat in her mad dash to recruit peces who did not believe the election was stolen anyway marisca found out the kinds of people cathy was recruiting all while people her were being ignored and she was mad also cathy stopped holding regular pece meetings she says because of coved merca thinks it was to keep people out she would have to hear from those who disagreed with her within her legislative district people say el d here i thought that the frustrations nthat we saw would stopp the steal came from people not knowing how to operate their government not knowing how to participate but if you are if youre living in an alde where the cheeir will not let you participate then of course it is going to nanifestin to something stopp the steal because people are going to have no other outlet than soul just be mad this feud is not just kathy versas maressa everywhere you go there is some version of old school republicans getting overrun by maga election deniers at this ground floor precinc level of the party merca believes the election was compromised we will never know who on she says but thinks of herself is more reasonable another stopp the stealers and a dad expert of sorts cause a work she is done in the past and supply chin management right after twenty twenty she wanched her own recearch projectand to how many dead ceople werevoting she claim to have found thirty three the ttorny general than looked at it and found that only one of those was real it was not an afarious ballat harvestir from the democrats it was a republican woud voted her recently deceased mothers ballet and she was indicted marissa says kathy ridi culed any research an to the twenty twenty election which made her especially mad kathy says she is no idea what mercis referring to but kathy does not haveh any patience for that kind of resrirch it is true it if she is one of those wo ons on toa it hear's an idea that everybody's i making hay oda that iam going to do it to is that in have anything else golenona might as well ty this and that her deal she is a good corecter really good grifter harshca but it is ture thit is ot she could she could do good but she she ises to missle he all that i have no space for that marisca started rallying other peces and wanted ne pcas who been walked by kathy katas to do something about her and i was what you wanto do ye was we are firing petsas i said oh ka that is just get people organize to whork in the district they called a meeting a meetin greet w she called it i others called it a resistance meeting we had almost forty to fifty people shut it quickly turned into a very loud routy conversation they wanted to fire kathy petsas they were mad that she was not letting that participate tes er acted these are active sitting peces that are elected peces then marisc in her crew found to work round in the bylaws it way to go over kathy's head to get people hind to athy's precing committers she could send the applications to the republican county cheair who was not on seen kathythen she could have preving give it to their recorters office you got a hundred to two hundred recentmattymen appointed that way es that is what marissa says athy says was more twenty five to thirty people who got in over her head in any case that is how marissa and a whole bunch of new stopp the steal recruits got on cathy's committee kathy was trying to jama lit on a pod that was boiling over even before this atempt to take over precinct committee positions the heirs of a republican party was pretty dominated by bater people and after they trid to recall the republican elected officials she curtified the election and after they spend millions of dollars recount ballats by hand their next target was this election the mid terms they wanted to put stop the stealers in office who would actually do in future elenctions what republican officials would in to i twenty twenty is e wei i la issa a carryla fore wo hies a her now candidate for governor she sayd she would not have certified the twenty

everything turn on at seid well do you i geg wits yere ats hard is that yina we had in great grip of congressment from arisoner and now we have her this ad venture ina grip that went off on thes crincin conspiracy farries noe this is your party this is where the new energy in the partiis coming fom all this stoin lections to if the party really a curious about winning than they look at who are the best candidate they can win in general olection we are not here there is a big wop of us we are not here for half time erizona is known as a fairly conservative state at least until twenty twenty but actually only about a third of the states registered voters are republicans a little less than the third or democrats the rest are independence whoever win's the general has to win with independence catty thinks the cury lakes of the world cannot do that ut that is not whos voting in the republican primary not who ise filling of the precincts lats in the local republican party what of the biggest things these stop the stell newbees ar doing that is their part of the party organization at the bottom rog as precent comitee people is shet ther setting up an infr structure to watch all the voting locations in the deterbs to catch the fraud they did not catch in twenty twenty they have signed up as official republican party polwatchers of voting occassions wit ther on primary day outside one of those locations a big suburban church in may we meed up with peggy do mats someone who never paid attention to her precinct until she just became a committee member she is got her snacks permitting a notebook and a pn to take notes it is her first time por watching she picked a quiet poling place why i thought peggy would be excited to get a piece of the action to catch the cheaters red handed but actually she did not wat that i an wr o man a ani bro we wo thay sically she scared shes get a halk out i have to confront the mony ino an nao a o i hav tan wac me a wwhent you imagine apning e not nowly notiin i think if e an e no e wacin going with her as she voted just before her shift peggy was supersuscicious that something was cemico down she brought her own pen to them because in twenty twenty some of the polling places provided sharpypends when tan as a conspiracy theory that the machines could not read those palais ow ca what can a anse we tai bot i a ar no i no isn' telt to tats no ain peggy is a classic new precincts committee member before it was the sharp ease it was the birth certificate ie really got it involved in it proways sence i would not bald in a tea party bact during now o mamma are you doing ircots an obama as oyou dont wan a nou you do not want to goin all that that that is done an over with here is nothing we do bout it that or ah that is what me got me of all then an then or course what thus a lection toni toni this was the tough time for peggy and away she says she quit her job during the pantamic she thought she might be ready to retire her job was she helped o people who were under water figure out ha pay off their debts she lives alone with her dogs whom she dotson and she ended up spending a tena time on her phone reading about the election being stolen byng a various actors the gloto peep likes or to the raticallizing moment for peggy was the moment that focx called the election for bidin early at just seemed obvious to her that the fix was in there must be more trump voters than bid in ones and air isown out long car caravans in then rallis with thousands and thousands of people the only way biding cout one is cheating and for peggy just the frustration that nobody did anything about it she saw the bandonbidio she signed up as a piese the piecy stratagy you te way to take an now to write peop det the write people it his period yet the rinos out i do not them either i just the ros were son of democrats your suppose to be republican and you do not support us i i just them wors is the far as i'm concern their trainers now that all these people who believe their s traud everywhere argonto by stationed inside the poles i wanted to find out what instructions they were getting mor were they gang to do once they were there we tried getting into one of these trainings in arizota but the state party wheln't let us but this is happening all over the country it is the same idea and we were able to listen in on the training in georgia noor also a young est most wac her e emty you man dog e t e ar onter bae ang on the deal with this an lots of states cincluding georgia it is ha legal to deliver other people's ballats except family in household members there are a lot of conspiracy theories about democrats going around with bigstacks of fik balacs and sticking them in drop boxes if that is what you see here is with the trainer says you should do you go immediately to the pole manager an an question enin say i thin i to somebody comein and drop off more than one bat and maybe be more than one bat and see whet they do i win o run ae tin er then and eni wyin or in ta to them i wn go o it i and in e pito th and ia e o there they li i daeote a its no evidi e teet this is the point they keep coming back to over and over gather evidence that republicans con use in law suits to challenge the results not just in this countiy in georgia but everywhere sa in wei ha at and open an investigation an that an a i butd you not aen do you not aen ison do you noten a ten do you not any o i'm not sure that following someone out to their car and taking pictures of their license plate would not lean to confromtation but the thing that really struck me wis the people taking the training they were not shying away from the action peggy they sounded they were spoiling for er flight they wanted to catch wrong doers o the act feeling thak yet fon mis poll watching thin as they were watching waging in all were doing takin def yes i wer a a rabin sala and be able turn over t the police wa an hour later at e hoti it you ges a this is what were heur for this i this is the definition of this job o er we are noting and te clerly and document then gen i get thats simplicitic i explanation bat if there is a problem we can address it riht away we have a turney and we are noctin a way and we are nokin a way for a lan secretary state o not do anything i do one to give you the wrong impression most of this traning was pretty by the book a power point with lots of porting details about the state law the pol watchers get long detailed checlas of all the little things they are supposed to write doln an photograph even the serial numbers for the ziptize that are used to lock up the voting machines tons of stuff that could be used in e low suit challenging the results backan

wigor toes for him may rn' settling jugg about everybody should come to school under bathing suits and is he school ier continued hi will not go from howwen was a special target ands om i would remember him we stopping the class to make remarks about her her appearancs or calling her pet names making lik a play on her name u ut in lik nursery rimes or songs he just started conversation with her individually in front of the whole glass talking about stuff that was not related class just to make her laugh you can notice she is nervously laughing yor blushing ot a theother kids in th class were weirded out by it everybody sits there in lik awkward silence as he do that did you ever talk to her about it im not that year know but she did not make comments the next year about how she hated when he would do that he says other girls may comments too hey would say oh he is weird they would not youe to creepy they she is werd to us he is weird i do not him i do not him being weird at first some six gradi kind question madbe this is just normal how teachers act how some treat girls but my friends all confirmed ther now this gus creepy i'd said it to some my friends on the buss some people at the blusstup too and they would be o ya i notice that too he is really creepyin did he said blaba blod he did blaba blod else okt's obviously much just me thinking and was not just the way this teacher was with the girls the six greater says he was kind o jerk with the boys he says any kind of off task behavior get your reprimanded if you are a boy send o the office he says the teacherackly brag they many kids o complained about him in the past for banks tred he said they culd tried themselves would not do any good all thits bothed the six greater enough thathe went too different adulls one of them was his man and he did not going to lout of dat but he told them thes teachers a creep forts with the girls in class he is a pato and both the dolls were wobabababo take a brath they do not make such accusations do not throw such stuff around cause that is that is a very serious accusation that is perfectly understandable i understand that hen his friends could not got ta go though they talk about itwhen they hang out en they were a myind puaying mying craft or supersmash brothers he just seem wrong and i cany power to do anything else hey talked about it jugged about it finally they decided do the one thing you can do when ye cannot fix wats wrong with the world but stofills strong sense of outrage they became watchers they decided to document everything the teacher did with h girls that seemed weird or inappropriate to them and discord chanel they set out discored if on now was a messagin plotfor him they called the discord channel pedo dayta mase did you gest think oh this is this is that is we came o with a great name we just said o yow we just didnit cause the name was funny to be clear he knows hese using the word peto loosely the peto datebases was an inside joke between small grupe boys who hated this teacher cause ye was harsh with them but thee are totally serious about the way he was treating the girls and and is the idea that you think you might accumulate enough evidence that you guises will go to the authorities at some point i do not know what that was i mean in the in my log we just said on this is now the official chat that we later uses evidence against him about petafelia that is the word i use in case anything does come up in the feacer and we to turn out to be correct and i said whenever he said something creepy towards the girls in our class postin coats with the date here ogging the date was actualy saying they got from watching tevian moves true crime keeping dates keeping times keeping stuff loged on paper and when we gave i gave an example of something he had said that day and tht's how it began what was the thing he would said that to i'm he had it called the girl of the word he had said bad to them bad dog type thing but ten use her name right right bad malanay ye exactly i had under it said in e flirty wa motable times to take towards muntable girls in the class including then i put ther names and evidence post will be kindn this that is that is what i said that was the establishing thing there that is wher that everybody just they understod and they took it seriously about putting the dates and and every few weeks the teacher did something not worthy enough that wone the boys woed jotted down on a pad secretly wrighte then and class but tipbet directly into discorder on his throne hadding an intreated the date bas co is cits finised with that teacher tomoved on to the next teacher but to keep the log going they was to keid you had in the next dyear and they read the new entries it do not we wanted him to say bat things but it was satisfying when we did o them me'd be a great another piece for the resterd every time everytime he said something we it is we pictured him punhing himself in the face it du think him me that was all boys during this i would think that girls would have wanted to get in on if they knew it existed perhaps they would have but we did not bring it outp but i'm sure maybe some of them would we just did not really have any girls in our frent groop i right right meddl school yes exactly ithe reporter wher broke this story and re vealed the pato da tobase to the world is a man o malcabits o the boston gog and the reason it became public the reason't yhou wrote hi story is it an april of this year the teacher was removed from his job

pay off that that it was ever ging to be used honestly i did not think i mean thi sko was there for long knowing to do anything about him im and for all i knew they would when i brough tis up to a lawyer at bot maybe they wuld just all lak that this that it is this cord chat with the punch of people with funny profile fotoes and names i did not know if that could be used as actual ev idence

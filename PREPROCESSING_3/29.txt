well folks last nght was the new hampshire primary and as expected donal trump blew away the field this of course was not a giant shock the polling just before this particular primary hadonal trump up twenty plus points in many of the pollson trum actually went and visited a bunch of the sites tbig crowds there and heo was very trumpy here is what a sounded bi crowd yer e toeti er a b i e i i we sto r we stop e a li ti we i e a ra a we ma stop e wi wor a ad nobodi do we wi o e ti i ree ma i wi li an in e e i owher te re er no no te at i don e i tas a let e o t e e to wa to ti a lat i a i sa

i'm not sure what else there is to say about that it does raise the question of just why nickey haley failed to resinate as sort of the anti trump cansidate now part of it is that there just is not in anti trump wing of the republican party sufficient to actually overcrump overcome the the protrum wing of the republican partyments on trump became the nominy in twenty sixteen everybody came home and then are became hme again an twenty twenty and eave we's coming hoe again an twenty twenty foure that is not a giant shock that is in fact away politics works and people who are looking and his results in say neu hampshure in twenty sixteen and saying he 's gon a replicite his thirty five per cent and new hampshire in twenty twenty four are ignoring the fact that in the intervening period he became the president of the united states and then ran and entire nother election cycle and now is running yet a third election cycle but the outsize the animus for nickey hayley that you see on some parts of the ranaduthing its outsizes part of that is because if you oppose trump tere's a part of the basthit just is angry at you for having a post trump and allove it has to do wit that im in nicky haley again was his uan ambassador she was someny worked for him she summody whose praised his presidency and the idea that she smirct a wild anti trump force i think is wrong but what nickey haley does have is an affect problem that is out of i would say pattern with the modern re publican party the republican pary at this point is in fact a party that is angry and i think justifiably angry on a number of squores one of the things the the republican party is angrabout the base particularly hey're very angry about hearing about racial divisions they been lectured since two thousand eight since brakmon round for presidenty thousand seven they been lectured that america was coming close to racial unity only to have that ripped away from them and andto watch as everybody sort of retreated back into tribalistic corners and this is haw you went up with critical race theory and d ey an equity throut the by administrations en the hear from members of the re publican party about how america is a place that was replete with discrimination even twenty years ago or thirty years ago they ttende think i not sure that the person who saying that is the person that i want fighting this fight today nothin people are lying about their experiences of twenty oar thirty years ago but to point out that your experience of twenty or thirty years ago is does that make you the person who is best suited to fight against the d e i culture to day the reason that is coming up is because there is a clip of nickihalyw the one vibral just before the primaries in which she was talking about her childhood and again whet she says here i do not think is actually wildly controversial except that it is very much at odds with the attitude of many members the republican bays which is to say are you going to stand up against the predations of the d i c ar t culture are you to stand up against the idea that america's a place of racial devision with sufficient alacrity or are you going to try to play a little af identity politics for gain here is the clippinickihlo un totally virel we were the only in one family and our small southern town i was teth every day for being brown any one that wants to question it can go back an look at what i've saide on how hard it was to grow up in the deep south as a brown girl what i will tell you is thang that i had blate friend as a thorce of pride thaing that i had white friends o thorc of pride don'f you wan i know what it was white grawing up i was this qualifihte from a bandy patchet because i was at white or blad because thi did not know where to put me the look i know the hardships the paing that come with rah of it is the rathen that i fighte bolite everyday when it comes the racom antithemitasm or hate and i always well at the reason that clip won firal on the right is because agin the question is is she saying that servivs uff to panner to legacy media or is she doing what tims goss word did during the campaign ra says look how far we have come i've suffered from races i know what that is but america is a place of opportunity and to pretend that america to day is when america was yesterday is foolish or is to say iam a diverse candidate bote for me kind of play i think lot re publicans took away the latter message from clipse that one and a obviously did not help meckahaly now again i think that is combined with the lot of people who are very protrump and very angry that anybody would daign run against trump whatever the result it did not end op well for nickehaly in new hampshire over all that she says that she is not going to drop out of the race just yet she said yesterday that she was not going to talk to litical abit uaries i did not get i ai o oan o a a o ti i ao a o ta o t e ta iweitai o tao i ta i we a o ii i wor ar ni o o o i a rn now it is couple weeks until south caolinean do i think thet nickey haleis can a stay in all the way untill south carolina i'm not sure exactly whysh syou would make you us to rack up some delegates in case there is an act of god an something happens to trump an they go to the convention she says i'am the person with the second most elegates and make her case there maybe sheu wans to trade her delegats for some sor slot inth administration that is that is quite possible to whatever it is the primaries are over they have noverse than tiwaw everythng else is merely a a sort of wast of of time and effort i think spending more time on it now with all that set yive you'r a democrat you sort of yeel trap maye just snap closes on youroponents for a long time dmocrafts proticting the legs simedia bein saying that all of donal trumps opponets thei'r terrible the're awful they are no good their very bad except for nikey haley who is kind of okt and the resinus tisuous kind of voke is because agan of that sort of softer affects that sh has but do not worry if nickey haley had actually become the re publican nominasuemen just the bat os trump worse than trum because she is more seductive in terms of her politics and interums of her mean than than trump is and that that that woud av ben the play but now that trump is the nomine yourstaring see poles that are emerging in th swing states to pull from pennsylvania with trump down at to jobidon the the attempt to move from donald trump is the scarious person in the world you can nominate him plus all donald trumps opponents are even worse than donal trump rip on to san tis rip on haley rip on everybody else in te media by the media and then trump gets the nomination all the sudden sike all look at that he is losing in thes wins watch for that move from the legac meda and of course it is way to early to tell whose gon when the selection who is got lose this election enj keep your ey

stephen benow he calls himself destiny amine gut a big following amon and frankli really had not heard much about him or viewed his vidios much until i agree to debate him on lecs freedman's sho and can listen to the entire debate over at lecis utup gental and i's really i thin worth the listenits couple hours long the reason ant sort of fascinating is because we covered a lot of ground and one of becaus pieces of ground re covered is the debate between bidon and trump and tdonal play a little bit of that for you rihte here because i think that this is going to be the debate obviously going into the twenty twenty four election his the debate between bidon and trump the the debate did not cens ore particularly much on jobidon's record because the truth is that jobidn's record e's deeply flod and gng to get to more of that in just one second instead it censered on hes central contention that isbeing made by people who are voting for bidon which is the donal trump ought to be ruled out just right away just right off the bat donal trump is cannot be president of the united states because he is just to scary he is too devicive he is too torrannical what destiny said was that donal trump is the most devicive political figure in american history and when i pointed out to stephen is that jobidon is in many ways more device of why because when donal trump came into office donal trump was expected to bedeviciv he were any secrets about donal trump being a device of character he came into office he did not have a positive approval rating for but maybe two days is entire presidency jobde was expected to be ae person he united the country and then he completely failed herei her's what i had to said canasc for our head of state aur chief executive should oretoric be arguably one of the most important things that he does iean the answer would be s and now ben given a choice between a person if i think incalibrated ways says things that are devicive in a person who an uncalebrated ways says things that are devisive and the evidence that jobidonis devisive is every pol taken since essentially august ive of twentytwenty one he he is by all available metrics incredibly devisive a huge percenate of americans are deeply unhappy not only with his performance but do not believe his uniter ad this is one of the things that i think that democras ought kep in mine is that democrats are our thinking just right off the bat that donal trump is devicif because it wis rhetoric ind all the things he says but our people disappointed with trump or e's trump kind of what he always was because one of feelings i get is that people are deeply disappointed in jobid n that is a very difficult feeling to shake if you are disappointed in a political cansidite he attend to turn away from that political cansidite that was actue the story the twent tof election between two thousinate two thousand twelve brokamama acthi lost votes he is the first in commed president to lose votes and somehow retain the presidency now why did that happen how coun he retain the presidence in the answer is he got people who were largely unenthusiastic about voting to vote and tha's particularly true for black voters an twingstakes a per formance that is not et ben replicated by any democrat helo clan or tobiden when it comes to presidents wh are expected to unite and then divide the american people do not that the cin would rather know what they are getting thand be disappointed in a promise that is unfulfilled there is no promise the trump is made that is unfulfilled good and bad but jobidon came into office on the wings of eagles jobidon came into offices pledging tat he was going to unite tho country is on t bring honor and the adults back to the white house and instead he is provided terrible leadership and divi sofrederic and speeches in which he libles half the country terrible and awful and threats democracyn we also tralks about the idea of tyranny stephen focust a lot on january six he focust a lot on the idea thae trump would if he could be a tyrant and the point di made is that donald trump yo would he would he exercise power if he could exercise power in ways that i would not sure he is said that he would he recently went on as wittersprig or a truth social spring in which he claim that the president has what he caled absolute immunity for any crime ever do i think that he would effecturate that if he could sure is he going to do any of that no he is not here he here is hi explained it to stephen when we are talking about o which character is more tyrannical jobidon has used executive power in ways that far out strat anydingthat as that it has been stretching a stretching a stretching executive powery o jo tobite is going jobidon has gone well beyond anything trump even remotely attempted to maintain vo i just pure executive power jobidon literally used the occupational safety and hazard administrachion shour try to cram down bax aman aan eighty million americans that is insane surelyd right tat i an not relief student londet and then try to relieve the hundreds of billions of dollars and yet but what ot that they got struck i mits rom and then they still did it they still did it bidon brags about it hes again i think that a lot of the points that are being used against trump are not actually dispositive and and i thnk that really is the name of the game for democrats if they cannot kill trump right off the bat if they cannot kill as cannacy right off the bat they got a probgs what exactly is the fuel they are going to add to the fire between now and november what exactly is the information that is going to come out about trump this going to change anything i do not really see i andthe biggest probm of all for jobidon is not just that he is bad on policy which gn will get to in a moment the bigest prom for gobidnes that here is a conflict of visions between jobidon's view of the world and what the american people think he is guided by in upper cruss liberal elet a codery that does not think the rest of the united states thinks and that refusees to to kind of engage in the kind versations that the rest of americans are engaged in thereis a appoll that on to get to in just one second that explains weare a lot of the democratic party aten is coming from it and is not coming from the same place that most americans are coming from wllgeto that momentarily first in a world filled with uncertainty you need to be prepared for any possibility what you actually need is my

story of not only this election but the election of twenty sixteen between domel trump and helery clinton there is a a person name youvall noaharari you have all no harari is in author and a professor in the priman of history toe hubrew university of jerusalem but do not let that title fool you he is sort of a a pop sociologist jus certais a pop anthropologist and he happens to be a militant atheist and here is his view on life an the reasonn bring this opasis i think this is actually the view of a huge number of liberal minded eleats in the united states and it is completely at odds with the way that most people i think think here is ouval nova noharari he is giving a ted tog here is wha a sounded mamy may be most lega sistens of bate on this idea tis belief in you in arits but you in arits ol just heaven and god it is just the fictionless storie the thweve invente and spuderod states and mations o also youanrits and god and heaven tha too of o o jest stories isre o you not it tates thelo just stories very pawful stories stories we might ont to believe very much but still felt just stories you contoiy se the not it tates you cannot contet you cannot smellita theire realities once you create this fact dalu disconnect whonce you get rid of that ivine or any rational basis at all or faith basis for fundamental first principles then you all very quickly into moral relativesm and once your moral relatives mat is very hard to escape it and that is why there is a really fascinating pull that came out recently from rasmuson and it looked at the people who are sort of the we describe as the elets here is out the raskies an pulling group describes it they se the people who run america or weast think they do live in a bumble of their own construction theve isolated themselves from everyday americ in realities to such degree their views about what is and what should be happening in this contry differ widely from the average americans and analysis of their thinking conducted for the comitte to enlese prosperity finds that on a variety of economic social and political ations there exists a wide gap betwen how the top one per cent the eleates think things should be and hove the rest america looks to them how do they to find the aleats these ere beu to fined as people having at least one post grad degree occase of thse are people than scraduay college they have a j d an m b n m d earning at least a hudred fifty grand annually livin in a high population dens to ty area sad be lake a new york lawyer who graduated from an joy you or something and then in compares what these eletes think to what the rest of america things nwhut they find is this vast disconnecthe serious and vast disconnect for example in in time when most americans have suffered a loss of real take compay seventy four per cents ovy letes say hey are financially better off to day than i the past for su twenty per cent of all americans and that this connect make sense loe tese people sat home during coven and they did just find and they do not realy understand why other people do not feel that way i got that have lot of friends who who made money over the last several years but that is not the experience most americans that is really not these prencs and if you do not understand that than y u have a disconnect the enough to experiencewhen other people experience to understand thatg what they'r saying is correct when most american say the economy is not wood for me they are right the economy is not good for them nearleys six in ten of these aletes say there is too much individual freedom in america double the rate of all americans ohow do they get to that these are people who are experiencing the highest levels of freedom of any subgroup in the united states they more monitary freedom many of them they have more educational freedom they have more freedom to move about they have more choices in life presumebly but they say there is too much individual feedom in america why because youvall kno haraty they do not believe that freedom is not inherit right because rights are social constructions there t their stories that we make up to tell ourselves to night and these are the sophisticates and these sophisticates are interested in building a system of their own making for you more than two thirds of these people favor rationing a vital energy and food sources to combat the threat of climate change again that is because they can avoid all of this they do not believe that they sould go back to living in a nature or preserve or log cabin they may say they do bes they are actually have to live that right now and that seems very far away frm them easy for them to say but they say that sort of stuff again why because to them property rights ore kind of relevent cause they already own the things in fact the people w need property writes the most typically are not t people ardy own but he people who are going to need to own

to this fascinating pool of the eleds from rasmison apparently somewhere between half n two thirds of these aleades favor banding things as su veds gastodestheire conditioning not e sential air travel to protectie nvironment about six of these ten of leates have a favorable opinion of the called talking professions be lawyers lobbiest politicions an journalists now again i think normees in america look at that the lawyers those are people maketings more complicating costry money lobbiests those are people who work for industry and then engage in regular fory capture politicians those are people who stand in the way of my prosperity journalists are people who lid to me hav thin its how many american feel bout er institutions right now but the eledes because these are the circles in which they walk have a lot of faith in institutions that the rest of america has been disabused about well here is the the key statere present and bidon hasn'nt eighty for per cent job approval rating from this group there is roughly twice as high as the general public that is that is a massive gap a massive gap again when it says does the unitedstates provide too much individual freedom too much government control ors the bounds ofout right fifty seven percent to americans say about too much control ivey ly graduates fifty five per cents a to much freedom a that gap tefinds the by dministration the by nimistration is defind by this gap now again i think that normal people are not thinking this o on't think normal people think that things country and borders are artificial abstractions created out of thin air thei're stories that we just tell ourselves arbitrary stories that we can change at any time and in fact i think that the stories that that replace those stories even if you buy uvo nohorares frame workere the stories that are place thoss ories are much worse then the stories that if historically been axcepted by human beings the the replacemen for stories about church for example has not been a better story that we olostovs has been a much worse story this is why it is fascinating during that debat with destiny the liberal streamer the the question of low birth rates came up and you vol mo horari might ha wr leats because of a story that we tell ourselves about human freedom in contraceptive freedom o gat fine but the answer to that story is the better story in that that story could be answered now with puzzlement and bewilderment but with the simple with the simple three word answer her's what that sounded the one kind of weird thing that we are coming up against that we havebeen coming up against a now for firs o number of degatesble continu to is a societyes progress sames people are having last children and i actually do not know what hun set what the answer is to that question a an you at ii mean an implementable answer that works that we know we can get erybody on bord with by the nswer ma m answer was good church frilegon yes actually yes now there is two ways for people who are liberal to get out of that one is to say let us a story you tell yourself to false story and were jus not king o do it the other way is to say whall maybe if the thing has worked over time it is worth actually examining whether it is a true story maybe there is some truth to that story but that is the thing that they leads cannot abide because if there is truth to many of the naratives thet pre exists them then they got a problem is tese hare the intellectuals these of the postgrabs these of people heard these successful elead in our society they want to restructure society according to their own story but what if the story that preexists them was not in arbitrary story maybe that story was there for a reason ashallyov all people deem philips the the democratic ministor to congress person i think andam stumbled upon this he was jousting with the mediu he is run against jobidon in quixotic campaign in new hampsure against the crin president but he went off on the mediubies the're asking much questions and he said listen you are not even asking the questions americans care about and that makes perfect sense his journalists many of them are part of this seleat cotery who have a different value sistem from the rest of america saydis eighteen thousand times i'm only doing us to the feet tom trom nobody seems to want to do that in the demoe cratic are you rght now other than we because ju bitn cant is might proposition because the dat is ays he cant no one in the country rin out peres an tact most of people the country going to the troub rally right now tus he is listening to them no one's asking about this to just frustrated out we understand why i'm getting tired of it you are doing your jobs but you are not asking the questions that americans you about he happens to be correct he happens to be correct democrats are not giving answers to the questions the americans care about and jouralis are nots even asking the questions the americans give a crap tat in fact there definition of freedom is wildly different from the definition that most americans hold that 's gon to get tem in an awful lout of trouble for example senter tammy duckworth was asked whet twenty twenty for was about and she said freedom ans the question is what would he man by freedom listener answer why think that its abo freedom right its bout protecting a out to but protecting freedoms and one about creedings is the right to control our bodies and con tro or win prodout tor pcycles also talking about the right to the freedom from sodent loans the freedom to walk on the streets and and not hav to worry about being tr rgit oh raceal as ha those are all freedoms than we concernin talk about and i do think at free on forecing on policy and and describing freedom in those tarms would be helpful desimazing how does shou described freedom she names three things freedom to do abortion which again i think there a lot of americans who are not on board with the idea that freedom is abortion most shocking lyn she says freedom is freedom from student lones at's an amazing statement freedom is other people pay your bills and that is true freedom and that is the alede version of freedom if that is the society the hon structure freedomers from responsibility say theolets that is almost americans are talking about if that is the democratic proposition for twenty twenty four i think that that is a vast gap from a most americans feel remember a few months back there was this song that when absolutely viral and and that that song who is oliver anthony and the the songs alled rich men north of richmond you will recall and the lurits of richmend north richmond absolutely puzzled many members of left the literally did not know what he was talking about because in the song he talked about people basedly taxing to much and also spending to much money and he talks about the abuse of welfare for example and people who are in the sily cotri what is he wining about he is he is a blue collered i should't he be in faver of that should not he want are restructured way of life an when he is talking about is the things that most americans actually careabout the things that are the stories that ave always work the sores about family and freedom and the ability to use your merit to rise to the top one of the things that that he sang about was he he he said if you are five foot three and your three hundred pounds taxes ought not to pay for you bags of fudge rounds theyoung men are put ing themselves six feet in the ground his all thes dowm country does to keep kicking them down and people whis he whise he doing the welfare queen re well it turns out that most americans actually are not in favor of the basic proposition that freedom means freedom from student lones for example and this is jobiton's cor problem jobine is not speaking a language the american people recognize and thats goingto come back to byd min thabut along with his policy failures which we will get to momentarily first let us talk about sang healthy on the road we are on the road we are in polan you just wen to oushrits with with

have two dead navy seals the this annylate how is this not the biggest story in america thest two navy seals actually died theye ware lost it sea during an operation attempting to seize oronian made missile parts theye are bound for who the rebels in emmon all this by the way an outgrowth of the gigantically weak form policy of this administration with regard tuoron sent com sedness tatement the military had declared the two deala seals dead it was now conducting recovery operations folloing a ten day exhausted search the search coverd twenty one thousand square miles apparently the seals were reported the lost earlier this monthwhen they took part i an ighttime operation to boarteboat in the international waters of the arabian sea according to the uus military that is an attempt to inshure freedom of shipping which has been completely obstructed under jobidon through the red sea a jobidans attempts to fire missiles that hit camels in the ask has far had very little a fact on the actual prevention of who the terror attacks onship in which continue un abated meanwhile we have two americans dead in n attempt to stop the who thes we have other americans whave ben severely wounded including one with apparently brain injuries thanks to aronian attacks on american bases in a roch and jobidnes is trying to walk through this thing there is jobidon literally just trying to stumble across grass and avoiding questionsabout these two dead navy seals erylafdon trum likes to say looking hes at trying to walk on toothpicks and again its notchust these two dead navy seals according to the walster journal aronan back militious lanched another missile and rocket bragia you ust forces in a rock on saturday several americans may hav ben injured will ron pay any price for this latest assault snt com sediness tatement most of the missiles were intercepted by the all aside ar base are dofend systems while others impactod the base damagercessmens are on going and added a number of yose personal are under going a valuation for tromatic brain injury at least one arocky service member was wounded this is one of the largest of the one hundred and fortyerso attack by ronian back malicios since octobersem against the united states in a rock and seria and all that is designs but pressure on the united states to put pressure on israel to stop and leave comas in place in the godstrip after the worst terror attack onjus since world or too now whise all that happening the reason aron is doing this is because aron believes that in an election eer gobidon is all fired frighten of getting into a warthoron that they can push the united states around to the harts content that can shutown shipping in the red sey theyn continue o have his bll off fire missiles into lern israel and kill jews they can continue to fire directly at american basis they nave their proxy forces fire directly in american air basis in a roch and jobidon well run away in fact that is not a bad analiysis by the oronians because that is how we jobidon is peter baker the eur times reports as much he says another day another baroch of rokets and another spark that american officials fure could set off a wild fire of violence across the middle east the assault on american troups base at all aside air base in western rock satery night was by one measure the most successful believe to be carried out by a milicious sponser bi ron since the hamas terrace attack on israel ontober seventh two out of the inestimated seventeen rockets an short rangepallistic missiles fire to the base made it through errt defens systems american forces have the times at mountov retaliations but in limited fashion to avoid instigating a full fledge conflict by deministration officials have regularly debated the proper strategy they do not want let such a taxk go without respondse but on the other hand they n't wanton go far the conflict would essolate into a full fledge war particularly by striking oron directly they privately say they may not have no choice if american troups are killed that is a red line that is not ben cross but i faronun back militias ever have a day of better aim or better luck it easily could be what heu calling have two dead navy seals ind an attempt to stop the whoo thes from shipping a munch of missiles into their territory again the fear of aron is dictating this administrations forin policy and iv sictating oron digression now the reality is that aron really really dis not want its rect ward the united states but they do wantod do is humiliate the united states and pressure th united states in opressuring israel to leving their proxy force in comass in place that is their goall but there is an entire article n the ner times by rule market gerret and rate take talking about exactly what aron wants now what they say correctly is while aron is clearly assorting its military strength amid the widening regional tormwel that does not meanis leaders wanto be drawn into a wider war they have said as much publicly perhaps more important the meticulously avoidd taking direct military action against either israel or the united states the regime appears to be content for now to leaninsto its long time strategeo proxy warfare the groups they back are fighting orons fose far neither israel nor the united states has signaled any interest in retaliating directly why but because thei're afraid that if they go to war if they can a direct firing war with the united states or israel thei're afraid their theirisume is over the elderly supreme leader iatoll olicamani is seeking to secure his legacy that means not getting dragged into a wider war ther busily round ding up protestors an executing them right now now oron does not want to war certainly more than than the west les wl want toe work but jobid is making clear just barocoboma did in twenty twelve to the russians tye if yeu has one to get aggressive now would probably be a bestm because if you please please please do not make me get aggressive with you because i want to get reelected and jobin's basely saying that sof aronians in the arneus whale that gives us a window of opportunity now their could be amis calculation near oron could go to fir in the united states might be forse even under jobidon to do something but the best way to do this would be to be predictably unpredictable the res n' thy never did this under trump is that they did't note the whole trump was going to do trumpita fire to missile and taken out the iatoas he might have done that nobody believes that bridon is going to do that instead tobidon continues to signal to the aranians and their proxies that he will in fact do their work that he will in fact attempt to leverage down a bad deal on israel after the comass attack according tothe walster journal a proposals submitted to isralvia the united states suggest a postwar gaza thel crate a pathway toward policinian state in exchange for souty recognition of israel now the reason that totally insane is because if israel gransa pathway to a palistinian state on the heels of the worst terror attacking is raily history you are simply saying to people that if they attack you in kilosoper citizens you will give them stuff that is what you are doing by the way comoss for its part does't edn' want a seas fire accordig the associate o press commoss was offered a two month full seas fire in exchange for the release of his raily hostages and some palcinian security prisoners being released as well and alowing comos leaders to relocate to other countries to get out comass rejected bat to for all the we municsees fire ing out crowd commoss rejected ta seas fire again and bidan's weakness on foreign policy is radically increasing the risk of the actual serious war in the middaleast moving beyond what is already going on over there and it is not just obviously the adaleast is also continued cass on our southern warall ges that momentarily first lady ballers is the hilarious story of how group of mal loosers o count winnagain souther men decide to identifies women enjoin a women's basketbolly yes it is absurd it is ridiculous and laughable and also it is kind out happening light right now there is a quick look an wht is being caled the most triggering movin of the decate le ssriandinrr wa i se tho lady ballers wobe meeds to be far finget t lot is sotoleven etrirstreaming exclusively on daily wire plus do not wait watch lady balers the movy hollywoud did not make we did exclusively at dailywire plus right now meanwhile again democrats are now connecting with the american people and they are trying to walk their way pass to the issues the latest example comes curtesy of the neartimes this is not ininthing the nearatimes printed a piece in which they claim that there is by partisan pullerisation round imigration therei times runs this headland things fall apart how the middle ground on emigration collapse and what they show is pue research centre polling with regard to feelings about illegal migration and open borders and for those who cannot actually see the graphic that wereshrowing right now is why i should subscribes se connectually see it because it is hysterically funny basically what it shows is that the american wright has had perfectly consistent feelings and emogration since nineteen ninety fort but with very little plan the joines thand when when asked whether they support broader and looser emogration onlyabout thirty per cent republicans said yes back in nineteen nety four and that number is thirty eight per cent to day and it is always been between those to numbers is just a straight line between nineten ninety four and two thousand nineteen for democrats the number when from thirty two per cent pro more open borders to eighty three per cent to day but what the ner times dit is they drew feight tren lines suggesting that there was a radical de creese fort republican support for borders efer for open boarders an aradical in crease for democrats that is not true republicans have been perfectly consistent for thirty years on this question democrats have been utterly inconsistent they have move from thirty two per cent support fropen boarders to eighty three percent support for more open borders what is the ner times trying to do there trying to per tend that there is been by part is in polerization when in fact there has not when in fact the the reality is that democrats ith ones who got morratically contrive whistlingyor pat way past this graver but man it is a stupid political move in fact fascinating piece over at bary wices free press to day by a reporter olivian ringold talang about black democrats suing chicago over migrans according to the free press black residence said that chicago which calls itself welcoming city has been very welcoming just not to them since october twenty twenty two chicago is greeted nearly thirty five thousin new arrivals with hreesources lanry services mental health screenings and fifteen thousand dollars in rental support per person all funs that could ave gone a long way in amonson park in chicagos austin district we are nerely twenty eight per cent of recens live below the poverty line lack docktober a day before the field house was send to come a migran shelter a black democrat rush to local court house along with three of her eighbors pluss the had of local and ulacy p chapter for moral support and then drafted a lawsuit in a nobook ripped out the pages in hand them do cler now black democrats are suing over this and we say there is a disconnect between the eleats that run the democratic party and the rest of the the country weman the rest of the country that this connect extends threug out american policy and things are only anyat worse by the way because again weakeness on forgn policy level is likely to make things really bad economically speaking agrigt now for example china could effectively quarantine or blockade tiwan is a pole from axios a an expert opinion pol ond whether basion coul effectively quarantine blockade or invade tiwan according to these cuonqua experts a law enforcement led quarantine of tiwan almost almost ninety per cent rof american experts strongly agree or somewhat agree that there could be lawenforcement led quarantine of tiwan how it up have at a chinese army led blockade of tiwan well ver eighty per cents of you us experts believe there could be neffective chinese led blockade of tiwan how an am fiviest invasion of tiwan wel that that is less likely because that woul involve masdeath but they do not need to do that a blockade would do it a blockade of tiwan in which the time lon strates are effectively clothed to all trade in which michroships just stop being ships all over the world because china looks at what is going on in the red sea an the say hell the munch ragtag pirates can do that inthe red sea why cannot we with a very very large gray water and navy and a huge army why caun't we do the same thing blockade tiwan until they cry uncle and give us more sophisticated military michroships why cannot we actually do this now gan that blockade would be involved both commercial and military activity that would be a disaster area for the world economy and it is becoming more and more likely becas and imagine this the chinese government right now may be the're holding out for bidan victory becaue they think okave they get a full second term of jobidan they can push him round as much as they want but wha if tonels from is leading an a couple months to they just say you nought forget it let us gulpher broke at this point interesting article over it the walstry journal from a couple of years ago talking about what exactly a chinese blockate of tiwan would mean for globle business and the answers a gigantic disaster tiwon accounts for oughly seventy per cent of the worlds at michroship supply it is its next to pacific shipping lanes thet channel shrillions of dollars worth of trade flowing in and out of estasia chini a chinese blockad of tiwan would result in ship shortages for carsonal itronic to drive up in flationary pressures as well pretty much every major industry would be ratically changed by such a blockade and thats becoming more likely everyday because jobidon is a weakling because he is a wekling and he is busy with the priorities of these eleats whose value system is unlike yours and who are much more concerned about say globel warming than they are about say global trade cand meanwhile i know what you are waiting for and that is my analysis of the oscer nominations i know you are waiting for that because after all who washes the oscars any more but still i feel its worth while to go through some of these oscronominations because it is fun to sea where in oll people who disagreewithrough culturally a r are sitting to day in easily the funniest story of the day barby which as i loved i though it was an amazing film by which i think it was absolute overated trash and the as unwashrable i think that people who say they lik it are lying i think michaelmost i think that this movy makes no sense it has plot holds it is badly written all of those things also this silarious it was nominated for best picture which is oka i know what you gises were doing yes it we made a ton omoney and all the critics pretend that they love day becaue they had to becau thy d gone to their head but it was nominated for best picture i'l gay find that stupid but the funniest thing by far the funniest thing is that the only thet it is that the the acting nomines for barby ar ryan gosling who plays ken america ferera is nominated in the best supporting actress category for her garbage speech about how women have it tough and all mi got it hard to be woneeh s she wis nominated but who was not nominated ken was nominated who is not nominated barby margo roby not nominated well's not nominated the greatest director of all time greta gorwick who is the greatest we all bov all for work because she is the greatest director ever directed and because everything she says is wise and brilliant and shes wisenh she was not nominate either ken was the only major part nominated from the barby film o the patriarchy the power of the patriarchy even overcoming barby itself and and the picturarchyou will rule supreme ex i'mn to predictorato right now that open himer win's best picture the barban himer fight opan heimer which is an all time great movy is going to ifee barby which is which is trash and it shud th est picture nominees ar american fiction which is the parently a kind of weird werdly anti woke piece is what i have heard i have not seen et anatemy of a fall which is about a relationship because ie'salways a relationship movy the oskers the whold overs which is i guess sideways in high school killers of the flower moon which is really over long but it is directed by martins corsasy and we have to pretend the we all loved killers the flowermoon and gaen i'm not superans i scorsasi i some of his films but killers of the floer moon is drag mistro which is about lennerd burnstin being gag bopan heimer an will be called passlives and will be calld poor things and will be called the zone of interest no i will admit that i'm interested to see this onom interest mainly it has amazing reviews and also it covers ground that i litte rely just walk demanded is it is about ashrut some kind of fascinated see that moby but those your mest picture nominees in the best actor category this is where somebody actually got robbed and it is not margo robby and is not gredigerwig is glenhowerton from blackberrys o yemseen blackberry yet it is actually a lot of fun it is terrific little film and glenhowerton is excellent in it he is best performance of the year excellent who got nominated killian merphy from obanhimer and he is admittedly great jeffrey right in american fiction i'ven't seen american fictiong att i wontsee it i'm but he is a he is a rellygood actor pollgamodi hos not in a wind for the hold lovers and i es got i got a put out that not a huge polgy motican i feel he is the same in every single part polman a mingo in a mul be called rustin which i have not seen and bradly cooper playing lenner burnsteen in mistro and overplaying the part chewing some scenery for best actress you have a netbenning and ind wel be called ne odd which nobody has everseen and no one nows what is about or what it is or the netbennin wath live milly gladstone in killers of the flowermoon she is fine sendera holler and anatomy of a fall carry molligan a mistro and emastone in poor things i'm't a bet that it is emistone in poor things cas poor things apparently a feminius tracked about how represt victorian wome then there is best supporting actr robert donero got a nod for killers of the flower moon which is a late career nod to robert to narrow playing a part that he is forty years old to play robert downin junior and openheimer he is excellent in openheimer ryin gossling i do think by theway ryn gostling is can win here i thing ryng gossling i think he is goingto be the honerary barbia ward because everybody loved him in barby even i thought that he was the most amusing thing in barbey and again i think tho that that movy's living death and i thought that rying gossling was still funny in that film and mark ruffalo in poor things for i hope loses because he is a he is not a a prosomatic person he is too busy standing for coss best supporting actress amily blunt open heimerdaniel brooks the colord purple america for era in barby for tat garbaric speech jody foster in neab againd do not know what t is and divine joy randolph in the whold lovers best director gredergery got shut out i think this is no ones yeare i think no one isging to take hom best picture and best rector this year those are those ar thebigga wards what is the take away the take aways that it was not an amazing year for film is te take away which seems to be or are usual take away licke i do not see any films that i saw this year and it thot man that thing shouldbe nominated for best picture that was not it openheimer i think it has the most nominations thirtee nominations it should have the most nominations it is truly great film barby again is goin t be the story because it is the only movy that aside from openheimer any one saw this year a bottomline low ratings but i 'm rooding very very hard for ring gossling to win for barbey because it is the funnyis possible welcome the funniest possile ou come for the mova barbey is for ken to win the only award i jus tht i'm i'm there for it i wanve that the academy accidentallyted this and a and more peit i want i want ken to win and i want i'm just ken from the barby movy to win those are my demands and a and i will i will hold some one hossage to make thos demands happen i wanted to lose costume design i want et tht i want t lose every other category but only the men win beatn not even cause i care but because it is hilarious o be superholarious if the patriarchy and a winning an a movy made abyt hot terrible patriarchy supposely is there is that ary coming up we will jump into

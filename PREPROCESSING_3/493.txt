welcome to the huberman laponcas ts of science science space to i mandrer hubermen and am a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens ath letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on thereason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentally with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probiocs to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will giv you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if woer getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien invitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock om slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fifree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar a've talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolites for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodiu magnesium and potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemen t dok com slash hubermen and you will get a free element sampl pack with your purchase thei're all delicious again if you wan a try elemen you can go to element ele a menti dacalm slash huberman let us continue our discussion about nerrow plasticity this incredible feature of our nervous syctem that allows it to change itself in response to experience and even in ways that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it that is an incredible feature no other organ in our body has that capability are nervous sistem which governs everything about who we are how we feel in what we do does have that capability the issue is most people do not know how to access neral plasticity children readily occess nerl plasticity and they do not e realize that theire doing it adults want nerro plastcity and that is what this entire month of the huberman ladpodcastis been about we h've exploredinero plasticity from a variety of different perspectives i talked about representational lasticty we talked about the importance of focus and reward we talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect of the vestibular system how altering our relationship to gravity and in addition to that making errors as we try and learn can open up windows to plasticity but we have not really talked much about directing the plasticity toward particular out comes and thus far we really have not talk yet about how to undo things that we do not want i've talked about learning and i say learn a language learn freethroes learn a particular motor skill et cetera but what about what we wou call unlearning or about removing some aspect of our experience that we do not want and to day we are going to explore that aspect of nero plasticity and we are going to do that in the context of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic which is pain regeneration and in some cases injury to the nervous system now for those of you that are fortune enough to not have or had a concussion we are not have or know some one whose experiencing chronic or acute pain i encourage you to stay in here with us because a lot of the information that we are going to cover has direct relevants to nerro plasticity for other purposes we as always here on this podcast are going to discuss some of the science we get into mechanism but we also really get at principles principles are far more important than any one experiment toward one description of mechanism and certainly far more important than any one protocal because principles allow you to think about your nervous system and work with it in ways that bast serve viou they are very flexible batches of information we are going to talk about the principles of nerro plasticity for removing pain and wound healing and injury were going to talk about acupuncture of all things we are going to talk about modern medicines attempt to try and restore youth to the aging or injured or demented brain and we are going to definitely talk about tools got a lot of tools i consulted a number of fantastic colleagues at stamford at harvard medical school and in the greater community of tissue rehabilitation injury and pain management in preparation for this podcast i do want to be very clear and just remind you that i'm not a medical doctor i'm a professor i do not proscribe anything i profess things i have my beliefs but the podcast is for information purposes i do hope that the tools that we discuss will be of benefit to you but as always you should talk to your doctor or health care provider about any tools that you plan to add or looking to explore as well as anything that you might look to remove from your daily prodicales in other words do not change anything without consulting an expert first your responsible for your health not me and i say this not just to protect me but also to protect you please keep that in mind as we move forward and i'm very excited to share with you this information because i do feel that it can be of great benefit to a number of people let start our discussion about pain and sensation and regeneration and wound healing with a discussion about a very important system in the nervous system which is the sematicensory system the somematicensory system is as the name implies involved in understanding touch physical feeling on our body and the simplest way to think about the sematicensory system is that we have little censors and those censors come in the form of nurons nerve cells that reside in our skin and in the deeper layers below the skin and indeed we do we have some that correspond to and we should say respond to mechanical touch in pressure on the top of my hand or a pin point or other censors for insance respond to heat to cold some respond to vibration it a huge number of different receptors in our skin and they take that information and send it down these wires that we call axons in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord and than up to the brain and we thin the spinal cord in brain we have centers that interpret that information that actually make sense of those electrical signals and this is amazing because none of those censers has a different unique form of information that it uses it just tends electrical potentials into te nervous system the nervous system you somehow decode what a given stimulus on your skin is mave it is the wind blowing om gently and deflecting some of the hairs on your on your arm or maybe it is a a sharp pin prick or a hot stove or the warmth of a glowing fire that all arrives in your nervous system in the form of these electrical things we cal l action potentials which is just amazing and then the brain computes them and make sense of them we have periferal censors and we have got stations up in our brain and within our spinal cord that makes sense of all the stuff coming in painn and the sensation of pain is believe it are not a controversial word in the nurow science field people prefer to use the word no susception no susceptors are the censers in the skin that detect particular types of stimule it actally comes from the latin word no cera which means to harm and why would norsine does not want to talk about pain well it is very subjective it has a a mental component and of physical component we cannot say that pain is simply an attempt to avoid physical harm to the body and here is why they actually can be dissociated from one another a good example would be if god forbid you were exposed to high levels of radiation such as working with some sort of material that was radio active or ah you where near a former radio active plant or some some radiation excessive ex rays et cetera you would not feel any pain during the ex rays in fact you do not if you have ever had exrays as i have you do not feel anything they put you under that led blanket they run behind a wall thand they in mik is t take these pictures of your teethens really scary if because you what something really terrible must be happening here but you do not feel anything but there can be a lot of tissue damage that can be mutations introduced to cells et cetera i've had ex ras i'rl not saing people should't have ex rays but excessive ex rays certainly are not good for human beings likewise with excessive exposure to any radiation there can be tissue damage without the physical perception or mental perception of pain at all as well there can be the belief of pain or the feeling of pain without their being tissue damage and there is a famous case that was published in the british journal of medicin were a construction worker i think he fell is how the story went and a fourteen inch nail went through his boot and up through the boot and he was in excruciating pain just beyond anything he would experience he he reported the e couln' even move in any dimension even a tiny bit without feeling excruciating pain they brought him into the clinic into the hospital they were able to cut away the boot and they realize that the nail had gone between two toes and had actually not imimpaled the skin at all his visual image of the nail going through his boot gave him the feeling the relegitimate feeling that he was experiencing the pain of a nail going through his foot which is incredible because it speaks to the power of the mind in this pain cenario and it also speaks to the power of the specificity it is not he thought that his foot was on fire ary he thought because he saw a nail going through his foot when it was going through his boot bhat he thought is goin through his foot that it was sharp pain of the sort that annail would produce and there are thousands of these cinds of case reports out there that is not to say that all pain that we experiences in our head but it really speaks to the incredible capacity that these top down these the enhire level cognave functions have in interpreting what we are experiencing out in the periphery even just on the basis of what we see and the example radiation speaks to the fact that pain and tissue damage are dissociable from one another why we talkng about pain during a month on nerol plasticity what turns out that the pain system offers us a number of different principles that we can leverage to a insure that if we are ever injured we are able to understand the difference between injury and pain because there is a difference that if we arever in pain that we can understand the difference between injury and pain that we will be able to interpret our pain and during the course of to day's podcast i'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain from both ends of the spectrum from the pariphery at the level of the injury and through these top down mental mechanisms a lot of times on this podcast in fact mostly i tend o center on the physiology on the really objective things that you can describe and talk about diafhramatic movement or sunlight of a particular number of photons et cetera but to days are really exciting opportunity for us to discuss some of the more subjective things believe it ore not we are going to talk about love a collegue of mine at stamford who runs a major pain clinic on is working on and as published quality pure reviewed data on the role of love in modulating the pain response only there is a twist to it and im not cin reveal it just yet but it turns out that the specific type of connection one has to a romantic partner actually dictates whether or not their love for them will alleviate physical pain and the effects are really robost it is an amazing literature and what we are tognot to day is plasticity of perception which has direct bearing on emotional pain and has direct bearing on trama and other things that we discussed in previous episodes a little bit but that we are going to explore even more an entire month about those topics let us get started in thinking about what happens with pain and i wilsh describe some examples of some kind of extreme cases for instance i will tell you just now that there is a mutation a genetic mutation in a particular sodium channel of sodium channel is a one of these little holes in nurons that allows them to fire action potentials its important to the function the nuron its also important for the development of certain nurons and there is a particular mu ation there are kids that are born without this sodium channel one point seven you want to look it up those kids experience no pain no pain whatsoever and it is a terrible situation they burn themselves they tend to rest on their limbs too long they do not make the micro adjustments you migh see me swivelling round my chair moving round a lot those microadjustments are actually normal healthy microadjustments that prevent us from going into pain they do not make those adjustments they do not get the feed back that they are in a particular position and they never make those adjustments and their joints get destroyed essensially ah they do not tend to live very long doe to accidents it is a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance some people have a mutation in the same channel where they make too much of this channel they feel too much pain in fact it is reasonable to speculate that one of the reasons not all but one of the reasons why people might differ in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation and how many of these sorts of receptors that they express people who make too much of this receptor experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuly now the good news is there are good drug treatments that can block specifically this sodium channel one point seven and those people get a lot of relief from taking such drugs pain and how much pain we are sensitive to or insensitive to probably has somgonetic basis and then of course there are things that we can do to make sure that we experience less pain although pain has this adaptive roll let us talk about some of the features of how we are built physically and how that relates to pain and how we can recover from injury first of all we have maps of our body surface in our brain it is called a homunculous in a rack believe it are not i'm not making this up its called ha ratunculous in costello my dog is snoring behind me it is a dogunculous i can get into the noming clatur and why it is call this but it is basy a representation of the body surfacs that representation is scaled in a way that match is sensitivity the areas of your body that are most sensitive have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them your back is an enormous piece of tissue compare to your finger tip but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it and the representation of your back in your brain is actually pretty small whereas the representation of your finger is enormous the how big a brain areas devoted to a given body part is directly related to the density of receptors in that body part not the size of the body part and that is why if we were to draw your homunculous or costellos dogunculous what we would find is that certain areas the lips the finger tips the genitalia the eyes in the area round the the face would have a huge representation whereas the back the torso and areas of the body that or less sensitive are going to have smaller representation to be a very distorted mat you can actually know how sensitive a given body part is and how much brain area is devoted to it through what is alled two point discrimination you can do this experiment if you ant i think i've described this once or twice before but basically if you have someone put un maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart on your back and and touch while your faceing away and you they will ask you how many points their touching you and you say o two but if they move those closer together say three inches you are likely to experience it as one point of contact where as on your finger you could do th play that game all day and as long as there is a milimeter or spacing you will know that it is two points as supposed to one and that is because there is more pixelsd more density of receptors this has direct bearing to pain because it says that areas of the body that if dense or receptors can be more sensitive to pain than to others and where we have more receptors we tend to have more blood vessels and glea which are the support cells and other cells that lend to the inflammation response and that is really important just as a rule of thumb areas of your body that are injured that are large areas that have low sensitivity before injury likely are going to experience less pain and the literature shows will heal more slowly because they do not have as many cells around to produce inflammation and you might say weight i thought inflammation is bad one of the things i really want to get across to day is that inflammation is not bad inflammation out of control is bad but inflammation is wonderful inflammation is the tissue repair response and we are going to talk about subjective and objective ways tomoduly inflammation after tissue injury even after just exercise that is been too intense hoque you have this map of your body surface its sensitive in different ways now why you have got your neurobiology of some ati sensation one o one under your belt now we did not cover everything but we will touch on some of the other details as we go forward i thought it might be a nice time to just think about the relationship between the perifery in the central maps in a way that many of you probably heard about before which will frame the discussion a little b better which is phantom limb pain some ayy youare proutly familiar with this but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger or some other portion of their body imputated it is not uncommon for those people to feel as if they still have that limb or appendage or piece of their body intact an tipically unfortunately the sensation of that limb is not one of the limb being nice and relaxed in and and just there the sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain or its contorted in the specific orientation that it was around the time of the injury of some one has at a blunt force to the hand and they end up having their hand amputated typically they will continue to feel pain in their phantom hand which is pretty wild and that is because the repursentation of that hand is still intact in the quartex in the brain and it is trying to balance its levels of activity normally it is getting what is called propriaceptive feed back propreception is just our knowledge o where our limbs are in space its an extremely important aspect of our sematicensary system and there is no s propriaceptive feed back and a lot of the circuits start to ramp up their levels of activity and they become very conscious of the phantom limb now a before my labas at stamford i was at you see sandiego in when my colleagues was a guy everwon is calls in by his last name romachondren who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon and developing a very simple but very powerful solution to it that speaks to the incredible capacity of top down modulation and top down modulation the ability to use one's brain cognition and senses to control pain in the body is something that everyone not just people missing limbs are in chronic pain to learn to benefit from because it is away to tap into the our ability to use our mind to control perceptions of what is happening in our body and this is not a mystical statement this is not about mind i i guess as much as is brain to control our perceptions of our body what i romachondren do romachondren had people who were missing a limb put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it such that when they looked in the box and they moved their intact limb the opposite limb which was a reflection of the intact limb cause are missing the opposite limb they would see it as if it was intact and as they would move their intact limb they would visualize with their eyes the the limb that is in the place of the absent limb that is all by mirrors moving around and they would feel immediate relief from the phantom pain and he would tell them and they would direct their hand toward a orientation that felt comfortable to themb then they would exit the mirror box houd take their their their hand out and they would feel as if the hand was now in its relaxed normal position you could get real time in moments remapping of the representation of the hand of that is amazing this is the kind of thing that all of us would to be able to do if we are in pain if you stub your to if you break your ankle if you take a hard fall on your bike or if you are in chronic pain when't it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick but it is not a trick right because it is real visual imagery to remap your representation of your body surface and where your body is that is something that we could all benefit from because if you do anything for long enough including live you are going to experience pain of some sort and this again i just one remind you is not just about physical injuries an pain this has direct relevants to emotional pain as well which we of course will talk about the romachondran studies were really profound because they set a couple things one plasticity can be very fast that it can be driven by the experience of something just the visual experience he had people do this mirror box thing but not look into the mirror box and they did not get the remapping it require visual imagery coming in we also know for instance that in cases where people are concongenerally deaf the coclear implant which is simply a way of putting a it it is not simple but it is a way of putting in a device that replaces the coclia the the device that were normally born with in the ear that has these little what are called hairsells that deflect according a sound waves and allow us to hear by replacing the the normal hearing apparatus that is deficient in death people with this coclear implant the brain can make sense of this artificial ear basically snot the outside yeare not the pinna but the the inner ear and they can start to hear sounds now some people really the artificial coclia they really benefit from it it rerestores their ability to hear and they it other people do not some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything can be very disruptive to them some of that might have to do with the need for further better engineering of these artificial coclyis but all this really speaks to the fact that the brain is an adaptive device it will respond to what you give it it is not a device that is fixed in fact the essence of the brain especialy the human brain is to take sensoryin puts and to make sense of those meaning cognitive sense and then to interpret those signals and this may come as a shock to some of you and by no means in my tryng to be insensitive but pain is a perceptial thing as much as it is a physical thing it is a belief system about what youre experiencing in your body and that has important relevants for healing different types of injury and the pain associated with that injury in people's pursuit for norl plasticity a question that comes up every once in a while is people say you knowif i just a brush my teeth with the opposite hand for couple nights in a row will i get noral plasticity and the answer is probably yes i means a deliberate action in your focussing on it there is an engoll youre very likely to make errors yonjovment of anherorlips angomes at first and then getting better at in is you heard in last episode making errors is really important cause those errors of the signal that plasticity needs to happen and then when you get the actions correct then those correct actions are progra med in i'm not sure that brushing one's teeth with the opposite hand is the most on effective use of this incredible thing that we have which is plasticity it is not can open up plasticity for many other things if that were really important to you on for whatever reason maybe en crowded bathroom and its easier to on one side or the other than fine but it is gun a hard to imagine why this would be a highly adaptive behavior unless of course you have an injured limb or your missing a limb and that gets me to some really exciting and important studies that were were performed mostly in the nineties as well as in the two thousands and that for now there is really a solid base of data this really a centr of mass are round a particular set of experiments that point to particular protocalls for how to overcome motor injury and this may resinate with some of you whofv ever been injured to the point where you could not walk well temporarily i hope or even longer think about a sprainedankle cenario or broken arm cenario we are all familiar with the stories of people having a cast on and then getting the cast off and that the particular limb that was not being used that was casted is much smaller in actrophed most of that atrophy you might be surprised to learn is not because the muscles are not being used it is because the nerves sending signals to those muscles are not active and therefore the muscles are not contracting work done by ginname timothy shaller and his graduates dudnts in postocks teresa jones and others in the ninties and two thousands idid showed something really wonderful that i think we can all benefit from should we have an injury and even if we simply want to balance out imbalances in our motor activity and i think all of us tend to be stronger on one side or the other side usually a right handed person will be stronger in their left arm not always for compensitory reasons o some other time we talk about handwriting the leftees likely will be stronger in their right arm although it cind oft depends on whether not people are hook rities that is when you can hook around and right from the top or hook lefties thereall sorts of theories about this that we can a talk about right brain left brain math proficiency et cetera any event what shallertin collegue showed was that if we have damage to our brain in the censory motor pathways any number of different sense ry motor pathways or we have damage to a limb could be a leg could be an arm could be hand there is great benefit to restricting the use of the opposite better performing uninjured limb or hand or other part of the body they had about a dozen papers showing that if there was damage centually in the brain or there was damage to a limbs a unalateral damage as we say one side the thing to do o is not to cast up the damage side although you need to do that to protect the limb of course from further damage it he broken arminy to cast the arm re to brace the arm but that the keything was to restrict movement of the intact uninjured opposite limb and when they did that it forced some movement in the injured limb and remarkably through connections from the two through sides of the brain through the corpus colosum this huge fibre pathway that links the two sides of the brain they saw plasticity on both sides of the brain this makes sense when you hear it you let' say i injure my left ankle and i'm limping along or amusing crutches you would think will the last thing you want to do a start is injure your opposite limb or or not use the your opposite limb my right ankle is perfectly fine but if i lean too hard on my right limb and i take all the work out of the left limb at left anle that is ichally setting up a a situation where there is going to be run away a symmetry in the central pathways and the nerve to muscle pathways on my left side and what they suggested and what they showed in a variety of experiments was that by encouraging activity of the injured limb provided it could be done without pain and importantly not just exercising that that limb or part of the body but restricting the opposite healthy part of the body that the speed of recovery was significantly faster now i want a repeat you do not want to go injuring something further that is pody the worst thing you coul do but in some cases where people have damage in their brain the limbs are perfectly fine but the motor signals are not getting down to the limbs and in that case the limb is fine you actually are free to use the either limb as much as you want and in that case you do not want a relie on the uninjured pathway too much in fact you want a restrict the uninjured pathway i find these studies remarkable and theyve been followed up on at the molecular level at the cellar level many times and i think the physiotherapis out there and some that the rest of you who involved in sports medicine and some of the physicians will they will of course that makes perfect sense but oftentimes this is not what happens oftentimes what happens is it is all about resting and limiting inflammation and et cetera of the injured limb or the limbs corresponding to the injured part of the brain and these experiments and the collection of them point to the fact that the balance between the right and left side of our body is always dynamic it is always being updated that the level of neral circuitry the romachondran studies with the mirror box support that too and that even slight in balances in the two sides of the body can get amplifide and when you are in a situation where one side is injured or the brain is injured representing one side of the body the keything to do is to really over work the side that needs the work and to restrict the activity of the side that does not need the work because it is healthy and this has great semblance to ocular dominance plastisy which i talked about it couple episodes ago i will not going to it in detail but where the noble prize winning norbiologist towrncs of veasal davit yu will show that if one eye is closed early in development that the representation of the opposite eyein the brain is completely overtaken by the intact eye this has important means that all of our senses and our movements are competing for space in our brain and the way to thing about the principl is any time youare injured and your hobbling along you do not want injure yourself further but you want to try in compensate in the ways that respect this competition for noral real estate and what that usually means is not relying on where you are still strong because that is just going to create runaway plastisy that is going to make it very hard for you to recover the motor function and in some case is the sensury function of the damaged limb some of you may be wondering how long and how often one should restrict the activity of the intact or healthy limb or limbs in some cases and the answer is you do not have to do that all day every day these experiment centered on doing one or two hours of dedicated work o sensery motor work or on for instance if you had te sprained ankle on the left you might spend part of the day where your left leg provided it is not too painful can be exercised gen in away that is not damaging to the injury and the right limb cannot contribute to that exercise this might be peddling unalatterly on a on a stationary bike a if you can do that for a different type of liminjury an arm injury this might be o reaching provided the shoulder is mobile doing reaching might be even writing with the the damage side a and then intentionally not writing with the preferred or undamage side this has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity and the recovery of function which i think is what most people want when people are injured they want to get back to doing what they were doing previously and they want o be able to do that without pain now this brings up another topic which is definitely related to neral plasticity an injury but is a more general one that i hereabout a lot which is tramatic brain injury many injuries are not just about the limb and the the lack of use of the limb but concussion and head injury and i want it emphasize i'm not a nauralogist have many colleagues that are at some point we will do a whole month on t b eye because it' such a serious issue and it is such a huge discussion but i want to talk a little bit about what is known about recovery from concussion and this has very important because it has imimplications for just normal aging is well and offsa it setting some of the cognive tocline and physical decline that occurs with normal aging we should think of t b i is just for the football players are just for the kids that had an injury or just for the personthat was in the car actsent we want a learn about t b and understand t b i for those folks but we are also ging ta talk about t b as it relates to general degradation of brain function because there is a certain a semblance there of t b i to general brain aging tipically after t b i there number different things that happen and their huge range of things that can create t b they are all just and the mergency room physicions are going to on to know was the skull you was it was the skull itself injuredor did the brain rattle around in the skull om was there actually a breach through the skull om is their physical object in there was how many concussions as the person had an every one situation with t b is incredibly different but there is a constellation of symptoms that many people if not all people wit t b i report which is headache phodopho b a that lights become kind of aversive sleep destruption troute concentrating sometimes mood issues there is a huge range and of course the severity will not very et cetera in a previous episode i mentiond the kenard principle the kenard principle named after the famous neurologist named bi and after the famous nollogist market kenard said that if you are gong to get a brain injury better to get it early in life than later in life and that is because the brain has a much greater or height an capacity for repairing itself early in life then later but of course none of us want t b i and you cannot pick when you get your t b i you can avoid certain activities that would give you t b i but really when it comes to t b i their couple things that are agree to upon across the board the first one is as much as possible you want to avoid a second tramatic brain injury or concussion now that is can be a tough one for some of the athletes and even recreational athletes to swallow because they want to continue in their sport and i'm not here to tell you that you should or you should not but ah that is simply the way that it that it is om for folks that are in military or that are in a certain professions o construction is a place where we see a lot of t b it is not always just football lot of construction workers are doing with heavy objects swinging around in space om they were those hard hat helmets which unfortunately do not protect much against a lot of those a blunt forces and certainy not against falls and things that sort many people in order survive and feed their families have to go back to work it is very clear that regardless of whether not there was a skull brak and regardless of when the t b i happend and how many times it is happen that the system that repairs the brain the adult brain is mainly centered around this lemphatic system that we call for the brain the glemphatic system now the brain was not thought to have a lemphatic system it was not thought to have circulating a mun cells but about ten years ago it was sort of rediscovered becauseif you look in the litriatury realize the stuff was around longer thnt there is a glemphatic system it sor a sewer system that clears out the debri that surrounds nurons especially injured nurons and the glemphatic system is very active during sleep it 's been imaged in function on a magnetic resonence imaging and the glemphatic system is something that you want very active because it is going to clear away the debris that sits between the nurons and the cells that surround the connections between the nurons called the glea those cells are actively involved in repairing the connections between nurons when damaged the glemphatic system it is important that many people if not all people who get t be ey are told get adequate rest you need to sleep and that is kind of twofold advice on the one hand it is telling you to get sleep because all these good things happen in sleep it is also about getting those people to not continue to engage in their activity full time are really tryine hammer through it you might say well if you have trouble sleeping how you uppose to get deep sleep most of the activity of the glemphatic system this wash out of the debris is occurring during slow wave sleep slow wave sleep as i mention a previous episode is something that happens typically in the early part of the evening even for those of you that are falling or early part of the night rather f you'r falling a sleep in the waking up three four hours later it is important that you continue to get sleep but know that the slow wave sleep is mainly packed toward the early part of the night that hopefully will a alleviate some of the anxiety about of the three and four iam wake up although you really should follow some of the protocals that i've suggested in your physicians protocalls in order to try and get regular longer sleep of seven eight hours later wore can talk about the eight hour mark is a prerequisite for repair the glemphatic system has been shown to be activated further in two ways one is that sleeping on ones side not on back or stomach seems to increase the amount of wash out or wash through i should say of the glemphatic system there are not a tond of date on this but the data that exists are are pretty solid again sleeping on one side or with feet slightly elevated as well has been shown to increase the rate of clearance of some of the debris and that is because the way that the glemphatic system works is it has a physical pressure fluid dynamic to it that allow it to work more more efficiently when one is sleeping on their side or with feet slightly elevated this means not falling asleep in a chair while watching tivi this means if possible not falling asleep on one's back or on ones stomach sleeping on one side and if you cannot do that i do not really to sleep on my side i sleep with my feet sl ightly elevate i put at the count of fin pillow under my ankles i do not have t b ey but i have had a few concussions before but right now i feel fine but i find that putting the pillow under my ankles helps me sleep much more deeply and i wake up feeling much more refreshed the other thing that has been shown to improve the function of the glemphatic system and this is again is for sake of t b i as well as for every one even without brain injury is a certain form of exercise and i want to be very very clear i will never and i am not suggesting that people exercise in any way that aggravates their injury or that goes against their physicians advice take your physicians advice as to wether not you should be exercising at all and how much and into what intensity however there some interesting data and we can provide a link to the review on this it shows that exercise of what i guess people would nowadays call it zone too cardio which is can low level cardio that one could do while talking to somebody else you could maintain a conversation although you do not have to talk to somebody else is just gives you a sense of the intensity the exercise that zone too cardio for thirty to forty five minutes three times a week seems to improve the rates of clearantes of some of the debris after injury and in general injury or know to eccelerate and improve that rates a flow for the glemphatic system i find this really interesting because i think nowadays tare such an obsession with high intends to the interval training and people trin to pack in as much as they can into us a short work out which is great if it brings people to the table have not been exercising before but i think it is really important that we know that the data on exercise in its relationship to brain health speak to doing thirty to forty five minutes of this kind of what we i do not call low level cardio it could be fast walking it could be jogging if you can do that with your injury safely could be cycling this is not the kind of work out that is desin to get your heart rate up to the point where your improving your fitness levels at some sort of a massive rate or taking huge jumps in your vio too max or anything that this is exercise i do this o and i know a number of other people especially people in communities where there is a lot of t be ire are now starting to adopt this that the thirty to forty five minutes three times a week or could be more of this zone two type cardio can be very beneficial for wash out of debris from the brain and this is really interesting outside of tbii because what we know from aging is that aging is a non linear process it is not with every year of life your brain gets a little older it is a has sometimes it follows what is more a step function lin get these big jumps in in eight in markers of aging ige s that we could thing of them as jumps down because it is a negative thing for most everybody would to live longer and be healthier in brain and body and the types of exercise i'm referring to now are really more about brain longevity and about keeping the brain healthy than they are about physical fitness there is no reason why you could not do this and also provided again it safe for you given your brain state and injury state et cetera there is no reason why you could not also combine it with weight training in other forms of cardio i think this is really interesting and i some of you would to know the mechanism or at least the hypothesized mechanism there is a a a molecule called aquapouring for it almost sounds a a the forth in a sequel of movies or something that but am aquaporin for is a molecule that is related to the gleal system glear the itmeans glue and latinor these or these cells in the brain the most numerous cells in the brain in fact that in sheathe synaps is but their very dynamic cells they are little ambulent cells they'l wrhat the microgleo will run in and will gather up debris and soak it up and then run out after an injury a aquoporan fors mainly expressd by the gleo sell called the astrocite astra looks a star incredibly interesting cells and thet the thing to remember is that the astrocites bridge the connection between the nurons the synaps the connections between them and the vasculature the blood system and the glymphatic system they cannot sit at the inner face an thet cmagine somebody on an emergency cite carcrashsite whose directing everybody around as to what to do get that person on a stretcher bandage them up call their mother et cetera et cetera get this out of the road put down some flares the astrocites can work in that capacity as well as doing somethings more directly this glemphatic system and the gleal astrocite system is the system that we want chronically active throughout the day as much as possible low level walkings own to cardio and then at night during slow wave sleep is withan really when this glemphatic system kicks in that should hopefully be an actiona will take away provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely that i believe everybody should be doing who cares about brainlongevity not just people who are trying to get over tebieye now i'd to return a little bit to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation because i think it interesting and actionable that everyone should know about this and in this case we can also say that regardless of whether not your experiencing pain acute or chronic what i'm about to tell you is as close as anything is to proof you knowinsins we rarely talk about proof we talk about evidence in favor or against the hypothesis but as close as possible to proof that our interpretation are subjective interpretation of a censury event is immensely powerful for dictating our experience of the ev ent hure a couple examples first of all anyone who is ever done combat sports are martial arts knows that it is incredible how little a punch hurts during a fight and it is incredible how much it hurts after a fight the molecula drennoline when it is liberated into our body truly blunts our experience of pain we all know the stories of people iu now walking yo miles on stumped legs of peoples doing all sorts of things that were incredible feats that allow them to move through what would otherwise be pain and afterward they do experience extreme pain but during the event oftentimes they are not experiencing pain and that is because of the pain blunting effects of a drennolin i'll tell you exactly how this works in a few minutes when we talk about acupuncture but nor apineferon binding to particular receptors a drennaline binding ae particular receptors actually shuts down pain pathways people who anticipate an injection of more phine immediately report the feeling ofe loss of pain their pain starts to diminish because they know they are going to get pain relief and it is a powerful effect now all the erpolicsand placibo effect placibo effects are very real placibo effects and belief effects ass are called have a profound effect on our experience of noxious stimule pain and they can also have a profound effect on positive stimulean things that we are looking forward to one study that i think is particularly interesting here from mycholligue it stamford shan macki they did a norrow imaging study they subjected people to pain in this case it was a a heat pain people have very specific thresholds to heat at which they cannot tolerate any more heat but they explored the extent to which looking at an image of somebody in this case a romantic partner that the person loved would allow them to adjust their pain response and it turns out it does if people are looking at an image or thinking about a person that they love or even a thing that they love a pet that they love studies previous to the one that mackine colleagues did showed that their experience of pain was reduce their threshold for pain was higher they could tolerate more pain and they reported as not as painful but there is a twist there which is it turns out that the extent to which love will modulate pain has everything to do with how infatuated an obsessed somebody is with the object of their love people that report thinking about somebody or a pet for many hours of the day kind of having an obsessive nature almost that kind of what peop might call quotun quote codependency for those who ther listening am just providing air quotes cause codepency is a kind of a clinical thing now though it is thrown around a lot all the time it sort of gas lighting people to aboat gas lighting all the time now gaslang is a real thing but the peple talk about gas lighting for many things outside the clinical description if people are are very obsessed with somebody they have a kind of obsessive love of somebodies face even if the other person does not know them which is lttle weird that response that feeling of love internally can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree these are not small effects it is not just that love can protects us from pain it is that infatuation and obsession can protect us from pain and not surprisingly how early a relationship is how new a relationship is directly correlates with people's ability they showed to use this love this internal representation of love to blunt the pain response for those hof you they ave been with your partners for many years and you love them very much an eurobsessed with them terrific you have an preinstalled wiswas is not preinstalled ya to do the work cause relationships are work but you have got a installed mechanism for blunting pain and again these are not minor effects these are major effects and it is all goin to be through that top down modulation tey we talked about not unlike the mirabox experiments with phantom limb that relieve phantom pain or some other topdown modulation and the opsy examples the nail through the boot which is a visual image that made the person think it was painful when in fact it was painful even though there was no tissue damage it was all perceptual the pain system is really subject to these perceptiual influences which is remarkable because really when we think about the somaticensory system it has this cognive components got this perferal component but thereis another component which is the way in which our sensation our some adisensory system is woven in with our autonomic nervous system and were gain get to that next but i want to just raise the idea that the reason that this kind of infatuation and obsessive love can blunt the pain response and increase one's threshold for for pain may have to do i would say almost certainly hask to do but it has not been measured yet with dopamine release because dopomine is absolutely the molecule that is liberated in our brain and body when there is a new kind of obsession or infatuation it is very distinct from the kind of love chemicals if you will a i do not even calling them love chemicals that just feels weird if this were text i would to leat that line but if from the chemicals associated with warmth and connection such as seratonan and oxytosin which tend to be for more stable long lasting relationships dopamine is what dilates the pupils which gets people re excited they cannot stop thinking about some body the text messages are even exciting they right to them and they cannot wait for the texamessers to come back the dotata on the screen the techmeasures excruciating they do not respond for two minutes and people are getting flipped out i'm not here to support that kind of whatever what iam saying is that that obsessive type of love which without question is going to be associate with the dopamine pathway does seem to have a utility in the contact of reducing the unpleasantness of physical pain and probably has to a lot to do with reducing the unpleasantness of a lot of life sitting in traffic et cetera because when we talk about pain emotional pain in physical pain start to become one and the same they are closely intertwine that the lines between them nourally become very blurry what do i mean by that well if love and infatuation can reduce pain presumably through the release of dopamine well then does dopamine release itself blunt plaint pain should we be chasing dopamine release as a way to treat chronic and acute pain and that is exactly what were gono talk about now independent of love we are gong to talk about something quite different which is putting needles and electricity in different parts of the body called acupuncture something that for many people were it 's been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine but now theire excellent laboratories exploring what is called electroacupuncture and acupuncture these are big university centers in fact my source for everything i'm about to tell you next is professor chufuma at harvard medical school and his papers i stand behind the information that i'm gotin to provide today but theyre it is extracted largely from the malaps a papers which are use very rigorous veriable isolating experiments to address just how does something acupuncture work and i think what you will be interested in and surprise to learn is that it does work but sometimes it can exacerbate pain and sometimes it can relieve pain and it all does that through very discreet pathways for which we can really say this noron connects to that nor on connects to the adrenals and we can tie the all back to dopamine because in the end it is the chemicals and nerl circuits that are giving rise to these perceptior these experiences rather of things that we call pain love et cetera in a previous podcast episode i mention my experience of visiting an acupuncturist and getting acupuncture the acupuncture itself did not really do that much for me but i was not there for any specific reason i was gifted to me by somebody and i one to try it i'm not passing judgment on acupncture i in fact i know a number of people that really derive tremendous benefit from acupuncture for pain and for o gasterontestinal issues their actually a lot of really good purereviewed studies supporting the use of acupuncture for in particular g i tract issues in recent years there is been in emphasis on tryg to understand the mechanism of things acupuncture and acupuncture itself not to support acupuncture or to try to get everybody do acupuncture but as a way to try and understand how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system or brainbody relationship in general and ashally the national institutes of health in the united states now has a entire subdivision o an an institute within the national institutes of health which is complimentary health and that institute is interested in things acupuncture and a variety of other practices that i think ten fifteen years ago people probably thought were really alternative and may be in counter culture least in the states and it is exciting i think people are starting to really take a look at what is going on under the hood for certain types of treatmentsthat are very useful nothing it is very likely to lead to an expanded number of treatments for a number or different conditions what i want to talk about in terms of acupuncture is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates the cross talk between the se mata censory system are ability to feel stuff externally extrareception internally interreception and how that se mata censory system is wired in with in communicating with our autonomic nervous system that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness after that i'm going to talk about how the acupuncture that is being done right now also points to relief for what is called referred pain this takes us all back to the homunculus let us start there we have hits representation of our body surface in our brain that representation is what we call semata topic and what semata topy is is it just means that areas of your body that are near one another your thumb and your forefinger for instance are represented by nurons that are near by each other in the brain now you might say will do but acshally did not have to be that way the nurons that represent the tip of my forefinger and the nurones tat represent my thumb on the same hand could have been distantly located and therefore the map of my body surface the monculus would be really disorder but it is not that way its very ordered its very smooth as let us ay you were to image my brain if you are to stimulate my finger my forefinger and then march that stimulation across my finger across the palm and to the near by thumb you would see that nurons in the brain would also make a sort of jay shape in their pattern of activation that means there called sematatopy but the connections from those brain nurons are sent into the body and they are syncronized with meaning they crosswire with an and form synapses with some of the imput from the visera from are gots from our diaphram from or r stomach from our spleen from or hoart are internal organs are sending information up to this map in our brain of the body surface but it is about internal information what we call interroception our ability look inside or imagine inside and feel what were feeling inside the way to think about this accurately is that our representation of ourself is a representation of our internal workings our vicera ar gots everything inside our skin and the surface of our skin and the external world what we are seeing those three things are always being combined in a very interesting complex but very seemless way accupuncture involves taking needles and sometimes electricity and or heat as well and stimulating particular locations on the body and through these maps of stimulation that have been developed over thousands of years mostly in asia but now this is a practice its being done many places thoughout the world they have these maps that speak to oh well if you stimulate this part of the body you get this response and if somebody has a gasterontestonal issue lik their there guts are moving too quick they have diarhea you stimulate this area no slow there got motility down or if their got motility is too slow theire constipate you stimulate some place else in accelerates it and ye hearing by this of it sounds kind of to a westerner whos not thinking about the underlying nurl circuitry it could sound kind a wackey it really sounds alternative or even kind of really out theire kind of stuff but when you look at the nurl circuitry the ruanatomy it really starts to make sense in chufuma's lab at harvard medical school s excellent laboratory has been exploring how stimulation of different types intense or weak with heat or without heat on different parts of the body can modulate pain and inflammation and what they have shown in a particularly exciting study is that stimulation of the abdmen anywhere on th the midsection weakly does nothing wit is not very interesting you might say intense stimulation of the abdomen however with this electracupuncture has a very strong effect of increasing inflammation in the body and this is important t understand because it is not just that stimulating that the gut does this because your activating the gut area it activates a particular nerve pathway for the ofpycionatas it is the splenic spinal sympathetic axis if you really want to note and it is pro inflammatory undermost conditions however their other conditions where if for instance the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection that can be beneficial and this goes back to a much earlier discussion that we had on a previous bodcast that will revisit again and again which is that the stresserous b nts was designed to combat infection it turns out that there are certain patterns of stimulation on the abdomen that can actually liberate a mune cells from our mune organs our spleen ancounter infection through the release of things a renalan chufu's lab also showed that stimulation of the feet and hands can reduce inflammation and again this was done mechanistically this was done by blocking certain pathways with the appropriate control experiments this was done not in any kind of of subjective way this was also done by measuring particular molecules isle six and cidokinds and things that are related to the inflammation response and what they showed is that the stimulation of the is in particular the hind limbs at lo intensity led to increases in the activity this vagal pathway the vaguest nerve being thes tenth cranial nerves that serves the kind of rest an digest and paris impathetic in otherwords calming response what this means is that we are now at the front edge of this research field that is doit is early days still but it is discovering that depenningawethere not the inthe stimulation is intense or mild and depending on where the stimulation is done on the body you can get very different effects this points the idea that you cannot say accu puncture good or accupuncture bad there has to be a systematic understanding of what exactly the effect is that you are trying to achieve and the the underlying basis for this is really relevant to the thing about a drenalin than i said before that in a fight it is rare that you ever feel pain when you get hit of experience that but later it hurts a lot it turns out that when you stimulate these pathways that activate in particular the adrenals the adrena gland liberates norapineferan an epineferan and the brain does as well it binds to what are called the bada noradernergic receptors as is really getting cuntid down into the weeds but the bada noragernergic receptors activate the spleen which liberate cells that combat infection and its anti inflammatory that is the short term quick response the more intense stimulation of the abdemen and other areas can be pro inflammatory because of the ways that they trigger certain loops that go back to the brain and trigger the sort of anxiety pathways and that place people into a state of anxiety that exacerbates pain one pathway stimulates norupaneferan in blunt's plain the other one does not what does all this mean how we sup pas to put all this together whel there is a paper that was publish in nature medicine and twenty fourteen the excellent journal that describes how dopamine can activate the vagus periferaly in the not nopeme in the brain periferaly and nor norpineferan can activate the vagus perif really am reduce inflammation and i'm not trying to throw a tonifacts at usat omis was to do with all this information what this mean eans is that there are real maps of our body surface that when stimulated communicate with our autonomic nervous system the system that controls alertness are calmness and thereby releases either molecules nor up an effrent in dopamin which make us more alert as we would be in a fight and blunt are response to pain and they reduce inflammation but there are yet other pathways that when stimulated our proinflammatory and that brings us to the question is what is all this in inflammation stuff thet people are talking about one of the things that bothers me much these days and i'm not easily irritated but what really bothers me as one people ar talking bout inflammation inflammation is bad inflammation is terrific inflammation is the reason why cells are called to the sight of injury to clear it out inflammation is what is going to allow you to heal from any injury chronic inflammation is bad but a cute inflammation is absolutely essential remember those kids that we talked about earlier that have mutations in these receptors that for sensing pain they never get inflammation and that is why there joints literally edisintegrite it is really horrible because they do not actually have the inflammation response because it was never triggered by the pain response inflammation can be very beneficial there is a lot of interest nowadays in taking things in doing things to limit inflammation one of the ones that comes up a lot as tumeric i'm surer the moment any one starts tucking about inflammation the question is what about tumeric i have talked before about tumeric elsewhere i am very sceptical of tumeric and i i might lose a few friends although iy be weird if my friend iit would say someting about my friendships if i lost friends over a discussion about tumeric but in any case tumeric does have antiimflammatory properties there is no question about that but as we have just described inflammation con be a very good thing at least in the short term the other thing about tumeric is there was a study publish out of stamford in collection with some work from other universities showing that a lot of tumeric is heavily contaminated with lead the lead is used to get that really rich dense orange coloring to it am that everyone wants to see you have to check your sources of tumeric the other thing is for men in particular tumeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrtestostrone de hydrotestostrona is theme more dominant form of andrgen in cuman males and it is involved in things aggression and lebido and things of that sort many people that i've talked to who have taken tumeric get a severe blunting of affect and lebido for some people that might be a serious negative i certainly avoid tumeric i do not tumeric am for that reason i also think that the inflammation response is a healthy response you have to keep it in check and wereging to talk about specific practices for wound healing and injury in a moment but this idea that just inflammation is bad ing you want to reduce inflammation across the board nothing can be further from the truth we have pathways that exist in our body specifically to increase inflammation it is the inflammation that goes unchecked just stress which is problematic for prepare from rain injury and that can exascerbate certain forms of dimensh et cetera but i'd to create a little bit more nuants or a lot more nuaunts if possible in the conversation around inflammation because people have just taken inthis discussion round inflammation to be this idea that just inflammation is bad and nothing can be further from the truth before i continue i just thought i'd answer a question that i get a lot a which is what about wimhoff breathing i get asked about this a lot wimhoff a also call teca the ice men a has is breathing that similar to a tumo breathing as i was originally called inbals basily hyper venilating and then doing some exales on some breath holds o couple thngs about that it should never be done near water a people who have done it near water unfortunately have drowned it is not certainly not for everybody a and i'me not here to either promote it nor discourage people from doing it but i think we should ask ourselves what is the net effect of that because a number people have asked me about it in a in relation to pain management the effect of doing that kind of breathing it is not a mysterious effect it liberates a drenaline from the addrenals there is a paper publish in the proseems in the national academy of sciences which are very fine journal showing that that breathing pattern can counter infection from endotoxon and that is because when you have a drenaline in your system and when the spleen is very active that response is used to counter infection and stress counters infection talk about what this more going forward but the idea that stress lends itself to ifection is false stress counters infection by liberating killer cells in the body you do not want the stress response to stay on indefinitely however things wimhoff breathing ice bas anything that releases in drenaline will counter the infection but you want a regulate the duration of that of drenalin response this should make perfect sense we as a species had to evolve under conditions of famine and cold actuaytecus right now is an extreme case of cold and power outers i've seen the pictures and their lot of people out their really suffering their systems are releasing a ton of a drenaline their cold some of tem are likely to be hungry theyr probably stressed their releasing a lot of a drenaline which is keeping them safe from infection after they get their heat back on and they relax and they can finally warm up again which we would for them very soon hoflle by tome this potces comes out that will have already happene that is typically when people gets sick because the imune response is blunted as the stress respons starts o subside stress inflammation countering infection that comes from endotoxin that comes s from any number things can be from cold at can be from hyper vental ation it can be from a physical threat it can be from the stress of an exane or an upcoming surgury it is ta grentaline thing and the inflammation associated with it is adaptive highly adaptive it is a short term plasticity that is designed to make us better for what we are experiencing and challenged with not worse and hopfully that will add an additional layr to this whole idea that ounostresses bad inflammation as bad et cetera again i'm not suggesting people do or do not do something whimhoff toma breathing i just wone appoint to te utility it is very similar to the utility from cold showers ice bads and other forms of anything that increase a drenalan every episode i want to make sure that every listener comes away with as much knowledge as possible but also actionable tools and today we talked about a variety of tools but i want a senter in on a particular sequence of tools that hopefully you will not need but presumably if youre human being in your active you will need at some point it is about managing injury and recovering and healing fast or at least as fast as possible it includes removing the pain it includes getting mobility back and getting back to a normal life whatever that means for you i one emphasise that what i'm about to talk about next was developed in close consultation with kelly starret who many of you probably have heard of before kelly can be found at the ready state he is a formally train degreed and educated exercise physiologist he is a world expert in movement intissu reabilitation et cetera ther are not sponsers of the podcast kelly is a friend and a colleague he somebody that i personally trust and his views on tissue reabilitation and injury i think i really grounded extremely well in both medicine physiology and the real cutting edge of what is new and what you might not get in terms of advice from the typical person all that said you always always always should consult with your physicion before adopting any protocals or removing any protocals i asked kelle i made it really simple i said o ke let say i were to sprain my ankle or break my arm or injure my knear acial terr or something that or shoulder injury what are the absolute necessary things to do regardless of situation and im and what science is this grounded and and then i made it a point to go fine the studies that either supported or refuted what he was telling me because that is what 'm here the first one is a very basic one that now you have a lot of information to act on which is in terms of rewhat we know about tissue reabilitation both brain and body we know that sleep is essential and we both agreed at that eight hours minimomen bed per night is critical not wall was interesting however is that it does not have to be eight hours of sleep we acknowledge that some of that time might be challenging to get the sleep especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited we forget how often we roll over in bed or how the the the conditions of our of our sleeping can impact those injuries too kell acknowledged and i agree that eight hours of sleep would be ideal but if not at least eight hours in mobile and that speaks to the power of these non sleep deep breast protocalls too if you cannot sleep doing non sleep deeprost protocalls we provide lins to them before were goingt continue to bride links to the previous ones and new ones are coming soon that is extremely beneficial that is a non negotiable in terms of getting the foundation for allowing for glemphatic clearance and tissue clearance et cetera the other is if possible unless it is absolutely excruciating when you just cannot do it a ten minute walk per day of course you doft want exascurbate the injury at least a ten minute walk per day and probably longer this is where it gets interesting i was taught i learn that when you injure yourself youre spost the ice something you s was but ice on it but i'didn't realize this but when speaking to exercise physiologists and some physicians they said that the ice is really more of a placibo it numbs the the environment of the injury which is not surprising and will eliminate the pain for a short while but it has some negative effects that perhaps offset its use one its sludges it create sludging within the blood and other lemphatic tissues itactualy can creates some clodding and sludging of the of the tissue and fluids the fashia the fashional interface with muscle and a number of the stuff thits must be flowing through there can slow up and increase inflammation in the wrong way connectually restrict movement out of the the a injury sight which is bad because you want the macrophages and the other selltypes fatfagosetosin eating up the debris an and injury and moving it out of there that it can repair that was surprising to me which it made me askable than what about heat while turns out heat is actually quite beneficial lot of people toke about heat shock protines and all these genetic pathways and proacing pathways thit can be activated by heat very little data to support the idea that heat shock protines are part of the wound healing process at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat that one could use a hot water bottle or a hot bath or a hot compress the major effect seem to be explained by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues and the clearance and the profusion of of fluid blood limph and other fluids out of the injuryarea s that is really interesting i did not know this i thought well yusas to ice something as it whenever i would see it coud get injured in socker never me of course now of course i got injure and sokarantin't in thy give you an ice pack and the ice pack remove some of the pain i think on the consensis now which was surprising to me is that the he ice pack is actually more of the top down modulation you think you'r doing something for the pain there some interesting studies that is soud show the plecibo effect of the ice back ice backs are plecibo perhaps that is interesting i'll underline perhaps because who knows may be there some people out there they ussay a this is toly crazy and the ice is actually very beneficial what seems heat mobility sleep keeping movement and it turns out that the movement itself can act as a bit of an analgesic it can actually reduce the pain whereas the ice reduces the pain but sledges the tissue and keeps the sells that need to be removed from leaving the area now what is also interesting is in neuro science we know that if we want a kill nerons or silence nerons we cool them tis is a well known tool in the laboratory some of the early and most important studies and nero science that form the basis for the text books where lowering a cooling probe into a particular area the brain or a perferal nerve in order to shut down that nerve the cooling will shut down the nerve but an other very well known fact in neroscience tecbooks is that when the activity of the nerve pathway or nurons comes back there is what is called homeostatic plasticity that it rebounds with greater pain with a higher level of intensi which in the pain system would acquaite to greater pain regardless of where these nurons are in the body if you stimulate a nuron it is active if you cool it it becomes inactive and when the nuron heats back up after being cooled it becomes hiper active and this makes really good sense as to why heat provided it is not damaging levels of heat would be more beneficial for wound healing and for reducing pain in the short and long run then would be cold or ice which i find very interesting now interms of chronic pain the manuscripts on this my discussion with kellium with others point to the fact that chronic pain is basically plasticity gone wrong it is sort of petiesti for the emotional system in the stress system and chronic pain is going to involve a number of different protocalls to rewire both the brain centers and the periferal centers associate with chronic pain certain things fibromialga for instance which is whole body pain relate to too little inabition in the brain you have excitation and inhibition they come from different sources anurons the inhibition is mainly from gaba and glicine and things that in fibromyalga there is too little central within the brain modulation of the pain response to that people experience whole body pain in that case the emerging therapies are really interesting eye of a friend who works for the natual institutes of health who unfortunately suffers from fibr mile jo asked me about the sallot and his cquestion nd what he is now actually exploring is red light therape something that ave talked about on veryous instegrandpost red light therape typically is talked about in terms of mito c ondria and the date on that are not terrific least not really published in blue ribbon journals in most cases except for one study that i'm aware of from glan jeffrey's lab at universy college london showing that red light stimulation to the eyes in people forty or older can offset some of the effects of macular degeneration by improving the health of the photo receptors people with fiber mialga which is this whole body pain are now starting to use red light therapies and i asked kelly and others and some experts in pain what what are your thoughts on this red light therapy for things fibro myalgaan pain especially red light local therapy their idea and i do not think this is a a of feeld that is progresse far enough now to really place any onfirm conclusions on but the ideas that red light therape locally may have some effect but the systemic red light therapy this is wearing y on protection to the eyes in some cases not from the treatment of macular degeneration but wearing protection the eyes and getting very bright light a rered light therapy in many ways may be in to usekelly's words approximating the effects of nature these are surrigate technologies for getting outside in the sunshine you knowhen you are in the sun it might not look red but therer r lot of red wave lings coming toward you the red light therapies may have some utility but getting into sunlight may actually have as much or more effect of course if these wounds are on a part of the body that you cannot expose then you can imagine why the red light therapy might be good depending the neihbourhood you live in thet mayre may not be a weird thing to go outside and expose your body to sunlight pry number of factors that dictate with an auntoby weard or not but that is up to you not me and it seems that movement heat not ice light sleep and in some cases the use and i'l talk about this in a moment that some cases the use of of restricting above and below the injury to then release and then increase profusion through the sight may actually excelerate the wound healing all of this might sound just common sense knowledge but t to me at least as of forty five year old i always just thought its ice its nonstelroyd anti imflamatory drugs it is things that brock block prostag landass to things asperan i beprophin a see to manifin those things generally work by blocking things the the they are called a cok the cocks of prostaglandan blockers and things that sort things in that pathway those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation may not be great at the beginning when you want inflammation they may be important for limiting pains people can be functional at all but the things that i talked about to day really are anchored in three principles one is that the inflammation response is a good one this is what we are learning from chufumas labs work on accupuncture the immediate acute inflammation response is good it cals to the to the sight of injury things that are ging to clean up the injury in bats cells then there are goig to be things that are improve profusion the glemphatic system getting deep sleep fe elevated sleeping on one side low levels own to cardio three times a week red light perhaps is going to be useful though sunlight might be just as good depending on who you talk to we talk about that probably more at length in a future episode a number of people will ask me i'sure about stem cells and i do not want a a take more of your time by you on going into an hour long discussion about stemsell stemcells exist in all of us during development we were created from stemcells which are sells that can become essentially anything later cells get what is called restricted in their lineage a skin cell unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it you cannot actually turn that cell into a nuron a yamanoca on the nobo prize for finding these yamanoca factors which you could give a skin cell the turn into a nuron but that is not in approved therap at this time but many people ask me about platelet rich plasma called p r pk they take blood they enrich for platelets and they reinject it back into people here is the deal this deserves an entire episode it has never been shown whether or not the injection it self is what is actually creating the effect this is something that the acupuncture literature suffered from for a long time that the sham control as it is called a sham we do not mean it is a sham but in sience you say a sham control men you do everything exthat exactly the same way you would for acupuncture you would bring the needle right up to the skin but you wouljectually poke it into the skin for instance thatll be a sham control with a drug treatment you would a inject a drug into a person and then the control the sham control would be that you would bring the injection over you might do the injection or not do the injection cause imagin that the injection it self could have an effect it is never really been shown whether not p r p has effects that are separate from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue the claims that p r p actually containd stem cells are very very feeble and when you look at the literature and you talk to any one expert in the stemcell field they will tell you that it is the number of stemcells in pirp is infantesimally small in fact much that a these places that inject p r p for injuries are not allowed to sadvertize through the use of the words stemcells is action be legal at this point least as far as i know it was through the end of last year and i'm gessing it still is now stemsells are an exciting are of technology however there is a clinic down in florida though it shut down a couple o years ago for injecting stemcells harvested from patience into the eye from acula degeneration these were people that were suffering from o poor vision and very shortly after injecting o these stemsells into the eyes they went completely blind i'm somebody who is very a sceptica of the stemcell treatment work that is out there it is acthally very hard to get in the united states for this reason it is not approved the prp treatments are very complicated the marketing around them is om shaky a at best i'm sure a number of people say that they had piarp an benefited from it tremendously and i do not doubt that whether not it was placibo to day we talked a lot about top down control that is just a dim variant on the word placebo belief effects whether not it was placibo or not i do not know i was not there that is for you to decide and i'm not here to tell you that you should or should not do something but i do think that anything involving stemcells one should be very cautious of you shall be very cautious of any one that tells you that pirp is injecting a lot of stemcells this is an involving area that really needs a lot more work and attention the major issue with stemsells that i think its concerning is that stemcells ar cells that want to become lots of different things not just the tissue that your interested insif you damage your knee and you you inject stemsells into your knee you need to molecturaly restrict those stemsells that they do not become tumer sells i a tumer is a collection of stemsells is when you get you something horrible gleo blastoma in the brain which is e terrible thing to have it is gleel cells that returned to stemnes excessive stemnas theys are produce too many of themselves and glu blastoma is often deadly not always injecting stemsells hat sounds great and it sounds something that one would want to do but one needs to approach this with extreme caution even if it is your own blood or stemcells that your reinjecting i think those technologis are coming the're on the way om if any of you are om devots of piarp tell me your experiences with them i'm curious i want to see the papers i want to know the evidence and of course there always folks out there that say i do not care what the scientists and the o physicians in the ft e say i just want to do this and if that is your stame that is your stance i'm not here to govern that am but i do think that people should be informed and in thinking about tissue recovery an injury u that is what i was able to glean again check out what kelly and a his co workers are doing at the reaty state it is phenomenal and they have worked with all the top people in ijust about every domain of life it seems very high antegrity folks some of you are probably saying whll i'm not injured i'm not an athlede i doft want stemsell injections i do not have a again i sang you should not get stemsell injections for now o please hold off until the field learns more about how to do that safely but i want ta talk about an end with a really interesting and somewhat weird technology which is baby blood i have a colleague at stemford his name is tony wise's quory and in twenty fourteen his laboratory publishd o study showing that the blood of young rodents mice in rats when transfused into old dimented rodents misonrats made those old dimented rodents recover much of their memory and seem much more vital and energetic better recall of different spacial learning tasks tissue and wound healing they have since shown can be improved in these older animals it is pretty incredible they went on to show several years later that blood from umbilical cords not making this up blood from embilicral cords can do the same and this is the basis of about at company i should one of my former post oxes a nown employ there they have isolated the molecules from young blood that seems to vitalize or revitalize the old brain and body and one of those molecules has goes by the name timptut i m p to where is all this going well i do not know how long it is going to be before their treatments based on these blood transfusions i doubt that blood transfusions themselves from young people into old people ise going to be used for the treatment of dimensia although it might as weird as it seems we know that transfusions of all sorts of stuff for instance feocle transplants are being used to treat obisity the gup microbiom of fin people is being trand not transfused but is being transplanted into the colans and guts of obeast people and leading to weight loss which sounds really wild and is not a topic i particularly enjoy talking about but none the less it points to the importance of the gupmicrobiom in regulating things blood sugar and health as it relates to obesity and diabetes and all sorts of things it does appear that there are things factors in the blood of young members of a given species that are lost over time in the older members of the of that species i am not goin to give you a tool on the basis of these findings to day i am not gin to tell you to consume any a fluid from any other member of a your species on our species a for any reason but i do think that its important to mention that the science is asking questions such as what are the factors within the brain that allow the young brain to recover much better then the older brain from injury from all sorts of things events et cetera and what are the factors in the older brain that are limiting and thinking about identifying which factors are going to allow people to restore cogni function physical function wound healing and f orth it is really exciting area i mention it i not to be sensationless but because it is happening and because there is a lot of excitement about it and because i think it is clearer that the young brain and body and blood are very different from the old brain body and blood and the goal of sciences to identify an isolate those factors that make that such that people who would otherwise get to mencho or perhaps even have to mencha will be allowed to recover againd not inactionable i tam at this point but one to think about perhaps not too long but one to think about some one at close there have talked about a lot of tools to day i've talked a lot about some at a sensation about plasticity about pain about acupuncture some of the new ants of acupuncture inflammation stress weven talked a little it about high intensity breathing talked about restricting limb movement to get compensitory regrowth of pathways or i should say reactivation of pathways that have been injured or damaged as always we take kind of a whirlwind toour through a given topic lay down some tools as we go hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury but also nurl plasticity in general today in the contects of the symaticensury system will be of use to all of you i do not wish injury on any of you but i do hope that you will take this information to mind and that you will think about it if ever you find yourself in a situation where you have to ask what is the difference between my perception and the actual tissue damages injury and pain is at the same well know it do i have some control over my experience of pain absolutely does all of that involve taking drugs are doing certain theraputics know not necessarily there is incredible subjective component there are also i is a need sometimes to treat the injury at the level of the pain receptors a at the siht of the wound please take the information do with it what you will and in the

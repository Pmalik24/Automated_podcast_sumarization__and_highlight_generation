reluctantly turning into an american bachelor he joined a jim he had no food in his refrigerator he was always at work at his drakling business and if he did have any free time he spent at reading

self more knowledge what i did drong if i won a go to have eashe she oged lady i do not have to do something tat i cannot believe i'm saying this but manar from mars women are from venus changed m y father's life it is hard to imagine my dad sitting in his little apartment struggling wish chapter titles women are waves and healing the resentment fle but i can see why this book helped him here is a thing in the be ginning about how many marriages this book as save and how every one at any age jst capable of change and that is exactly what my dad needed some one to give him a chance the book offered simple advice as a man learns to listen and interpret a woman's feelings communication becomes easier if he becomes very frustrated by listening he shou'd not try to continue instead the respectful thing to say it i really want to hear what you are saying but right now it is very difficul for me to listen in this passage the word listen appears eight times for my dad who would never been exposed to the idea that wives needed to be listened to this was revolutionary eold i tot o i all right tat i i you because irl lo ilyo bodyis lost yat because os gagle somete chap tooty chool cas yes we oki o yo was a lok yo has to se laks o li my dad started dating but the book did not teach him not to talk about his ex wife on his dates nothing was working out but he was determined not to be alone he had relatives an eran introduce him to a woman and he got engaged by this time about two and half years after their divorce i was more concerned about my mother than my father it was my father who of the two of them was seeming more liberated my mother just seemed stuck every time i went to her house there were three maps of sant josee covering her kitchen table she would get home from work and just sit and stare at them tracing out knew and better roots she could take to her office oliver will power had been used up just getting herself free i remember being disappointed in my mam she would come this far and then sort of just stopped there was nothing left in her to find some one knew in one point i was in a airplane one day and i saw couple of old couple and i thought o my god i wish i was them i wish i i had my thi thirty years husband a beside me and i was sitting behind him and shes started to explain to gi that this is her friends and this is that and is as at all ther dadinna is man wife atha i do not wanter in age fifty i do one in explaine to somebody my every singl detail of my life i want somebody to know me and yes he is gess angry yes hes shor temperar

except for my sister in me we boy cotted the wedding it seemed ridiculous to us after three years of worrying about them and holding their hands they were heading stright back in to the misery they would worked hard to leade behind but it turns out we were wrong they traded their unhappy roniand mariage for happy american one when you think about american relationships you think about the divorces the self help books the constant talking about feelings and even though all of that seems undignified and laughable it is all working for my parents now i can see my dad struggling to keep his temperan check he thinks about hurting my mom now about embarrassing her in a way he never did before i see them laugh with each other and talked to each other it is to be nervous around them becausethe atmosphere a tente now they actually seemed to each other and for a long time i attributed everything to my father's change he learned to control his temper and now they are happy ut that

wanted to make and now she says she loves him for the first time in her life o ma everybody agrees that if they would stayed any wron none of this would have happened not the heart break not the new found compatibility this is my sister neilafar the west did break them up and n they had the freedom to get back together yet i was not we had this such a weirdly and kind of such an american experience all of a sudden in the middle and i do not know what even that means except that except that my parents god divorced and then they talked about their feelings hen they both went the therape and my dad read men are from mars women are from venus and we we talk to my dad about relationships and they started he started dating and i was just slike i feel we had this family the crazy family

climatic scene where freasons that are not exactly clear hake cap shot castrates chance te mill in the night and driving rain star just prove e point shto sanjour rout had this really sweet situation they got to work side by side with all these animals which they gloved chance was tame tht he was allowed out of the pasture ndeven had favourite spot in the front yard under the trees sandrer would watch him from the kitchen window ich was really nice feeling be doweing the dishes you look out and there is your tame pe bull ferdinand laying on the grass then a rany dance of tember chance did not coming from the pasture eas handrar went looking for him finally raf had out to the pasture andfound him dead he is nineteen which is really old for a bull here was a really a sad day ot took the camer out ous an take some pictures an an us at well he deserves more than that i skanned him a skinned his whole body it took me all day t was raining it was a really sad time i'd skin a while cry while i wuld just a baby just crown a baby o to wi my not feel skin en him a'm going well somebody has to do this and i'd have to toughin up and re group and this lasted all day long i guess i was a complete wreck or by the time was all over with rou says he had no choice he had to skin hm in the first twenty for hours cause he wanted to get him taxager made turn him into a full sized bromin statue havn around forever i people could stel let ther picture take him with him chance could stay in the family business i was emotional everything was really emotional and all the family had a good crap to all mo kids in the people who knew him long they all just hated that oca re wine three months before all that happened rofp heard about this way that he might be able to cheat death with chance and keep him around is morein taxagermy it was a real long shot some one call me and said we have red and art when the paper that and am was going to clone an animal we man clonness and clone make one from another i it oup no cannot be an am is texas say am w famous vetronary school and animal hospital thic sappens to be an hour and a half drive from raff's house his chance is regular hospital and we called up and said youe going to cloed an animal right as a yest weld take tissueand we might and we w wact you use chance and wand other folks would call the some friends whou call and talk to him and and they findly just i think we bol thet im much they gave up as it dok kay well would do it the ne and scientist dis cided cone chance for simple reason he was old there is some things they tought they might find out by cloning an older animal e chance was there anyway getting a mole by obsude for disease he cientis could use the deanate from the mole to do their carning in taxer too night a man he is wite adyer bull a te reunited i guess he is been rein carnated can monce and eighteen days if she chance died e longshit paid off a clone was born the first clone bull his huge news there as ralph if you get out what to call chances clon second chance and he was just the prettiest little white lit wite bromin caff he ever saw in spendely an barely able to stain i thought it was the sme animal i would say you kn ell we goting bag that that is the first chead land i thinkin the the clippings when they interviewed me we got him back a the the vetidain am at ask us ar are kitted with us about whether the calf was going to recognizes on stall in the barn wh we got him home but we sort of blue that off well the the first day we brought him home we do we turn him loose over here in the yard he goes over lays day weter lay down in the same spot the steel co chokes me up he lay down the same spot that chance ladin it that is not reasonable when at i was spooky that was speoky anything hie notisrader way with second chance is that he has chance is same manerisms when he eats an usual manners instead of putting his head into a feet bucket holding it down there chewing into this no more food but chance he second chance raise your heads close er eyes too i've never seen another animal do that i'e never seen another and will do that there is something helse about second chance something harder to quantifid i just feel he always recognize tral fissure ah and ralph would lay down on the ground and second chance would lick him and lick his boots and second chance would lop across the pasture and come to us a and we watched other people thats would crawlinnearand he would not would not come across the pasture to them he just always seem to recognize ralph and what did you think did you think somehow his memory got tranceferred well no i still do not think that i think that he just has the same instincts the same did he is goet to make the same choices why would the eating thing be the same a clone is a kin to a genetical indentical twin is not the same animalst not chance actor my westuson is one of the scientist who runs to reprodictov science as lad be teke i sand am but i've the con second chance he says it because a con is just a twin on then more nothing less it may not even look the same as the original just twins conston necessarily act the originals either the doctor westuion understands how rafpher sander might not see it that way well people din attached to their animals and thay and they want to sometimes see more than then's there and they do see more than is may me really there and that is not necessarily a bad thing i mean thas lik that is ofer it there yeh that is lot that is not nees sarily a bad thing and and it was interesting for me to listen to ralph toall he lies under the same tree and he eats his food just the same as the all chance did and u that is rly o ralphhe o thad i just als his blood look us to day interested in that in doctor was tuson reminded me several times is is not the same animall do not expect a pit the same same attitude for a pit and i didn' believhim because ever thing looked the same you just when i seeim especially at a distance he look much chance and every day as he gis all gets older and older much ev he erean second chance is birthday ralph in sandrer wit do a party for him firabs and barbertul whuld you e thing about it would be disturbing for the guest of honor if only he knew he may what it is worth birth day ill the family and friends and neighbors came tothe front yard poster pictures a second chance we had his birth day cak which is a big feed tub with e no candles on top and we blew the candles ot an and i said that is about dark i think o lee e back to the barn i put one finger in o and his noseryng which is a common thing it gives you close contacting if they making any oggression you can merely feel it and you no respond in i was walking him we just did a few steps out of the yard and i had toe leave rope in the other hand we just took a few steps and and ploom caught me with his horn and slamm me down and wit that is when he dislotacate in my shoulder het me in the back i was im mobo on that sade he pickd me up in shslamm me down you say and anhy preceeded to you on top of me with his youow his mostly his haad his forehead in his horns oh we found three deep deep whole six or eight inches in the yard the next day where he had missed me and he was he was really trying he was really attacking it was was on purpose oh no i've sa o no this can'py if this cannot be happenin ecause we had had much faith in him an you kno just i didn had at that time always sanging abaut was yew why ar you doing this whyt why and i was i just disappointed the whole time i rememberwhent i was kicking him in the face oi just going how can you doing this to me qui it i think my feelings my o he actually hurt my pride since he tack rop acknowledges sacn chance is not the same animal as chance he believes that he definitely believes it when you love you see what you want to sin everybody knows that i part o him still helds that hope hoe that even as second chance is not chance right now hel turn into chance the stofll get the reunion wit a hope is invoving his age es since i did not have chance when he was until he was seven yu almost seven years o i do not really know how second chance is supposed to act a youd enogh chance was just this back in the day right right he might just have to go tohe stage and settle down i know horse is settled down my taxsis long horns settled down co cersmen thinks ihave been really wondering about your situation is i wonder if having second chance around all the time is every painful for you cause it reminds you that you do not have chance it is here you have this ghost of your favourite animal walking the property who is not exactly chance and if it just cime breaks your hartlittle bit no sir just the ops it your just exactly as wrong as you can be far right now feel we have gotten about ninety five per sent of him back i mean the same quality is the same fun that satisfies me that is better than zero when he was laying out in that pastrapt there diad he was a zero me we would never have any enjoyment out of him any more and there is a tremendous difference between zero and ninety five per cent ye people want to believe it is resurrection sometimes and and it is in fact not resurrection is just itstree production is bad news tator westucion is

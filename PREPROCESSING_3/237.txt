i everybody ire glas here our staff is busy reporting out stories for next week show and for other upcoming shows and we had reren scegel for this week and we decided in this stressful time it might be nice to keep things light and funny and a that is what this episode is and it has not one but two of the most popular stories we have ever put on the air the first a version of this episode was broadcask over twenty years ago back when we reistributed by public reating international and our pisodes began with the little piri audiogogo which i do not know acanamas from piai public radio ins an aton from piai public pi oi graio publi gratia public ready readiol inconational o n what could be more american then the person who sees something theyv never done before dreams they could do it itgoes after that dream whell lit is begin to day with t a woman who dreams of directing a play in the small town where she lives a college town somewhere below the mason dixon line in the hills of apalazcha a town which will remain for our purposes to day unnamed i do not lhink shead ever directed in and she claim to have acted and it was never really quite clear just what her credentials were but she she am ha manage to convince the the local theadrepartment of this college that she should direct a production of peter pan when he was in the tenth grade and nineteen seventy three jackate saw her production and everybody else in town he heard about for weeks beforehand slowly but surely anow you began to hear srt of rumors about this production for example i know that they had spent a lot of money renting these flying apparatuses out of new york and apparently their only a itis one company in a handful of these apparatuses is hat a git them was majure coo this is the story not just af a mediocra play or a terrible play when com to dato is not even a story about a play this the story about a fiasco and about what makes a fiasco and one ingredient of many fiascos is that great massive part renching chaos and failure are more likely to occur when great ambition is come ng to play when plans are big expectations great hopes at their highest and what shef t understand is that everybody in thi sort of community understood that ther were the there was certainly a sort of air af every one sort of reaching beyond their own grasp every actor was a sort of in a roll that was just a little too big for them a ev every ascpect of the the sat in the crew am and in a rumor sin sort of cooked around and there was as huge crew that a lots of things being paintis this infact is one of the criteria for greatness is that everyone is just about to reach just beyond their grass because that that is when greatness can occur that is that is right that is right and may be greatness coult have occurred what to day in our program what happens when greatness does not occur what happens in fact when fumble leads to error leads to mishap and before t you have left the realm of ordinary mistake and chaos and you have entered into the more ethereal specialized realm of fiasco to day show fiascos a philosophical inquiry perhaps the first ever strarng as we know into what makes a fiasca what takes our ordinary lives that extra distance into fiaso wut b b be easy chicago it is this american life or mour glass there is much much more to learn about fiascos in this hour stay with us we begin our sho with this truthpable peter pan he nact one opening night opening night comes and will almost everybody in the area in the ten mile radiuns of this theatr knows somebody in this production the place is pretty much packed and i do not kno if remember the opening moment of peter pan but it is the three little kids sleeping in their bed and a peter pan comes flying in the window and in this in this particular production the am there is a big a bed with all the three kids in it and off to the left i remember a is a big huge wardrobe in this a large window there and a little bureau and peter pan comes in and a you do not has the little speech where he says anybody can fly why with just totle magic dust one can fly and am and peter pan sort of sprinkles this magic dust in the air and sure enough im the kids sort of suddenly just lurch into the air om and it becomes clear right away that the people that they have hired to run these flying apparatus is really are not quite clear on how they actually work instead of the the kids am sort o sailing gracefully to and fro they sor to hang in the air popet's just sort of dangin theirs n getting jerked up and nch or to or back and forth and they an they es tent times it just stationary just just just just hanging their lek at a a spied and then several of them start to to sort of a circumscribe these circles in the air a where it is clear that the the the people running the the machines have just sort of set them off on these kind of oval courses that spiral farther and farther ut and if you are sitting in the audience thete was clearly a sense of fear a the face sis of these people am of the act the actors the actors actually you could sense their lack of confidence e tis in the the the people running the machines in the back they lay lat and in the audience you action to this plain is just are they laughing no one is laughing every one t this is one of the great things about audiences especially in the live theproduction is that they are very forgiving they want the show to work and everyone has sort of gripping their chair a little tightly right we we feel for thet you ore they are up there they are embarrassing themselves for us all dentified with that we are become them and the audience i think was very forgiving and very understanding of this this moment but there was one one moment that in this first opening scene that kind of put the audience on notice and that is when as the kids a srt of jerking up and down sring it back and forth and certaind instead of going around tese ovals at one point the little the littlest one the little boy is is sort of being flung around a littl tho a little too hard oh yes the least mass to resist whatever the machinery is doing to him right or gas sa ant and he is flying around the circle and and an the audienc sort of seezs this coming and is a real sense of pain and and gripping of the chair in white knuckleness as the kid suddenly does a just a an enormous splat into the wardrobe i mean it it is clearlys hart and he comes off of it sort of a little dazed encouse he is jerked up in the air little bit and often a little two high he suddenly set of in the working he is ot t laugh of the stay just self is now up there with the lights in on anno onhy just out of onlin hou is blomit back down to the stage and and be caught up just before he hit the floor and and it was it was har to watch ye can tell it is it is an inan incredibly funny moment heopl us say the audience was still in this very forgiving mode and no one said a word we just all sit there is sot holding our breath and this that we ar tension of being in the audience thinking oh oh my goodness they have gotten off to a very bad start oh this this is not good right and we feel for them m may i just interrupt for just a moment just just just say now now at this point because after au we are not just joined here together in the radio you and i to day to laugh at the foybles of the unfortuneate no now were here to enumerate the qualities of a fisco at this point we are not yet in the terri tory of fiase now now because us say audiences are forgiving and they one or one or two mistakes even big ones this thegon nol let that rod di say are we did we did we were very good and a we are not yet at fiasca we are at i sot of normal level of mishap right what happens immediately after this they disappear to never neverland and if you remember the the stage goes dark and then when the lights come up there is captain hook and he is giving it is the first opening soliloquy about how evil he is and what a menace he is and how he harmspeople and hates children and it is all that good stuff it is the captain took is out there and he looks great come on is big old fat hats in a and am this great hook an these wild lookin boots in everything and people of thing were confident something is happening it is a good sign it is a god time and he is in charge disguise he is got a bad mustache and he is certainly evil yes and i'm the audience is totally in his pocket he is he is peaking away and gesturing wildly and and going on and on about how bad he is and then it a certain point as he gestures his hook and the entire black hasing up to his elbow flings off of his hand and flies into the audience and cunchis an old lady in the got and now he is bad very bahe had the worst thad live i've ever heard an me what do you say hat as ahorse his hand it is now make it that os to the audience an he is not moment for any actorvery very if the very i muns of your character is that you have a look your name is captain literally all that is can happen for the rest of the just people going to refer to you by that hook youre entire motivation as a character is effect that you is that your arm is eaten off by an alligator andthat you have to have the entire plot and you have a hoos stems from that fat right right and now suddeinly you have no o in fact you have five fingers on a hand as if a miracle by the word daptain hooks tha they just do not make those hooks they used to that was actuay the outleve i wil then the lights come up and we are inever neverland and he necti yet this is hat to and and and captain hok might have stood in front of the sep he did not really see itcause he was us he spoke from shadow am now the lights come up in this susposed to be a very dramatic moment the the rumors of all this crew and the painting and everything that was going on and all this construction all work towards this one moment cause when the lights came up here was never never land this sort of psychadelic set there were paper machet mushrooms everywhere of different sizeis it was it was absolutely wonderful and sereal flem and am and there is nobody there and then from the upper rafters of stage right suddenly the kids and peter pan appear lying a flying they are flying am and their landing their landing occurs rather rapidly at at an angle of about forty five degrees to the stage they come down basically i do not know led sinkers on a line and crash to the floor am and then or sort of just dragged across the floor mops and wipe out all of the meshrooms and now have we arrived at a turning point in our fiasco ye ye it is clear now that the audience is giving way something has been lost some sense of declorum that that that little bit of forgiveness at the audience has for the actors and empathy an empathy it is beginning to dissipate well there was a split in the audience there were the sort of the younger people who were the least forgiven they started to go first oki the high school students couple of college students may be they started to laugh out laugh oll be honest ire i might have been one of those first people to laugh i was in the tenth grate it was hard to not laugh at this am but then whatever restraint that the audience had it just evaporated at this point because there were a number of things that happened in qrick secession that dist made it impossible to hold any sense of decorum am which are for example tinker bell appears for the first time iround this moment and am tinker bell is essentially a light bulb on an extension cord and a what yet and this was this wust the director's idea of you knw being rall being very modern tinker bell was just goin to be this literal light bull dangling from an extension cor is not in inother productions wete the dois that some one will shine alight shing a light or they will just a beam of focus light and the that pinprick of light is as to be tinker b that is right or something that or nothing at all and p just addressed the invisible sprite rand well that did not happen in this case this bulb comes just dangling down thi sort of hangs around tthis make tair lio bulb just hangs around and people are talking to it and i think tinker bell tinkerbell must have had an appearance in the first act but but it was somewhere and here that people justarted laugh am then another thing that happened was a later on in the scene if you member windy gets a trapped on an island and a and she she spots a kite that is floating by an flying by and she suppose to grab it and attach it to her back and fly off rag ran wele of course the kite has attached to the flying apparatus line and it it gets closer and close to her she standing on this little paper machet hill and a but the flying apparatus people cannot quite get it close enough to her at e reach she has to step out into the waters that she is just told us is filled with crocodiles to to grabit she finally gets the kite and when she yanks on it it pops off the flyin ates and the hook goes zinging up into the lights and catches now there is this big loop of wire hangi in front of the stage and there is when beholding the kite and a she add levd his best she could as i rememrber she she to that on second thought may be i can swim and with that she walked off the stage sot of motioning her arms you would do the swim the dance an nineteen sixty five say she does that at this point i mean the audience then actors are just falling apart they are frightened of the audience there are just belly laughs rolling up to the stage from the audince people are howling with laughter at every mistake and now any small mistake just takes on these these dese ges it is just a any instigation for laught er is just enough for this and now the old people have given it up every one has quit being nice now there is just this kind of frightening roar that comes from the audience every time this a mistake what happened at some point the audience turned and realized await i brealis wits going one here this is a fiaska this is a fiasko and what is really interesting about a fe ask gow is that once it starts to tumble down regt audience wants to push it farther alan oh they get hungry for more fiaska of ye if if the play proceeded perfectly they would be disappoint al hit would have ben a grave disappointment had there not been just one more mistake after another one more embarrassment after another now the reason there there is the chronicle these embarrassmentthis is why i have remembered this display for twenty five towards actthree a a the director had decided that she wanted to break down the fourth wall this was this was cutting edgeteaters far she was concerned ofeges at swen t explained when we say breaking down the fourth wall what willby mean is the wall between the the the actors and the audience whit usually it is i permeable bet then to came appoint in the late sixty sor wy seventy werlottheaters tisly that the actors would come out into the audient that is right and and interact with the audience and and and break down that wallso he the idea being that you would get more in touch with the dramatic sense and the reality of what was happening right anyway in this particular scene what was going to happen was hit the indians we are going to throw rope ladders down from the balcony and climb down these rope ladders into the audience and and move among the audience and frightness wig anyway i knew about the seeink is my friend david who i went to high school with was in it and a when david was climbing over the top of this balcony to a climbe down the rope he lost his footing and fell to the floor from the balcony a distance of about fifteen to twenty feet a ggood id a good fall that is horrible yet and he landed on both of the feet and spraing both of his ankles and of course curled into a feedal position and began to cry right he was really really hurt now to de riciat the horrible momen i'm on describing also understand that it is a friday night we are in a college town and there is a volunteer fire and ambulance department and in order to summon the rescuers from wherever they are an alarm is sounded that can be heard for five miles that alarm is locate at right over this theatere the alarm goes off hok gi this is an arrad siren it is loud you can pit your fingers in your ear in its still hearding your ears we are right under it it can be heard for five in a menute and then of course three minutes later bosting through the door of the theatre are these fifteen firementwho ware in boots hats they got hoses they do not know what it is all they know is that they have been ten i and dis that a ad to the chaos the the director of course has insot of flog the actors that the show must go on no matter whall no matter whot while all of this is happening and people ore several people are attending to day tid and other people are have just now thesideed that sense the firemen here he is going to be fine they can start laughing and now the audience has has just completely lost the show if people was standing up in their seats an shouting for more ey what blot ma i this point people are actually in erd and they wr somehow that is how this entire play ended what is in yousting about about this as a fiasco if f i fike the thing it makes me understand about fiascos is that is that the fiasco itself is an altered state that is all the nomal rules are off you have left of the nomal rules of how the audience can interact with the actor right i've never seen a production this and i've never seen an audience collapse this see what i wone do loik when you think about what people go for theatr to theatrefor lic what kind of release people want meen people want an experience that would take them out of are themselves we all want an experiencethat would take us out of ourselves and into another place and another reality right and it sounds this production even though it was tif fiasko in fact because it was a fiasco was more successful than that than any conventional play could be well see oven disagree with this an i think the old theatre critics the the ancients would say that the reason you go to the theatr in to see a great production is to be think the word they use to use is transported the idea thing that you would be lifted away from your animal nature and into these hiere more spiritual realms are being getting touch with these these greater the tragic emotions right what is what happened here was exact opposite we got transported directly in totch with our animal being i ir sell but that is almost is rare if not more than a great production jack head i's the cohost of a great pee by the aword waiting podcast about race in history called un civil which if you ware looking for something to listeng to during this national home lock down or orn your commute to your essential job i really at that jack says by the way that people ask him about this peter pan story still all these years later and the year since we first ran this we got a letter from whn of the actors in that production that jaksoff i got who play a pirat who told us jack quot did not t go far and off he only covvere the opening night the subsequent performances we are no better oa to squirrel cop what human error is often at the heart of a fiasco but what happens when you combine human error with where we will call in this case animal arror we have the story te police officer and s burbin community on the east coast there was nothing nothing going on saturday night in is fillage really quiet supercoled and this coal came over for unknown animal in the house and it was back was on my post wasabout five minutes away i myself and another car wor sign the call and we show up there and luckily for me it was another guy who is pretty new we

the side of the ladtder looking straight up at me and my partners to the at the base of t e latter right behind me just before i stuck my head to dis black hole i just kind of pas i crunched my body up underneath cgause i'm realize mam geyou now i do not know where this thing is the second we pull down the trap door old noise upstairs just ceased i was connon nervous and i was well o no i look an idiot tust crauts to pear in the top of the latter i took the flash light i just pop my head up turned the light on again and about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel at i level with me kind of reard back on its legs and i i swear from where i was standing it looked god zilla it just sca at o me i thought it is a squirrel et's can be hiding somewhere it coun be terrified to ma wit six inches away from me ad it really startled me i a cont o it ah jump back and the flash slips out of my hands it is heavy and it falls directly on to the nose of the guy who is looking straight up at me and i dont think it broke it but it did some damage and his nose his hands up to his face blood justart tof porn out between his hand this is te home on her it is the holm oner i loose my balance and fall backwards directly on to my pardner and i jus i pancake om we are both on our backs he is on his back i'm on his stomach on my back scuttling around a a beai it up an it is really narrow wholeway it is a mess the squirrel while were floundering around in the hole way jumps down the stairs boink h boint lands on me and take sa owns tars how in dignified it was terrible we are wondering she where is the where is the squirrel annd right at that second the woman who lived there you hear a screen my parting go s well we found the squirrel itsthat i is yeso we go running downstairs and n the squirrel had come into the living room where they had been havin there romantic evenit had a fire going they had pillows a ranged round whone corner of the couch next to the fire and they had a champagne flets out and nice house really nice i mean it just smelled brand new knew carpeting new rugs knew paint they had't been be for thatimal the squirrel when it bolted down the staircase took off into the living room and ran underneath the cuch for cover we run downstairs this guy is bleeding all over the place on his carpets his wife looks and says what if you done what ave you done to my husband i struckling al it was an accident and i just stop in meen sentence what is the point we have only been there about two minutes the squirrel s underneath the couch and my parn is going let us get out here this is just it is not going well i am ni'm not beaten yet i always noright yes the squirrel the e is tist couch which is in the middle of the room i have this bright idea why dn't we moved the furniture away from one o the corners and will put the couch in the corner and the squirrel prbably move along with the couch because it is the only cover available to it and once fer get into the corner whet only have two open side to te couch to worry about we did that that is tactacl yes yet i was very prout of myself at that instant but i asked her for a box and she says sure we have got box if we just move than we have nothing but box as she runs out to the grudge and she comes back with a box and the box is long enough and it fits a cross the entire short side of the couch where you would with the armrest would me i start sweeping underneath the couch with my night stick tron a move the squirrel toward the box figuring we will coucure it and just get rid of it and we will be out here and they will be no more may him it toctually working very well and the squirrels moving down along you can hear it it is chittering ind i'm tryng ot to hart it feel cona i'm nervous about the thing it my bite me i do not wanto hurd it really nowt us an animal m moving it along anderything's going very well and then with about eight inches to go i took one more swipe and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch who was lying with cassels i could rearly seen to the couch it boltit out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace which is about three feet away it was the fireplace was directly ahead of it nd it ran into the fire am i and caught on fire and ran directly back out and directly back under the coch why is it on to is ir ire ye the tail the bushy fur the whole thit a me was not flaming or anything but there there was an i was smoking and there was some there was some a litle bit af fire coming off the tail it runs back under the couch and the couch catchis on fire in seconds i mean in seconds it had it must have had dust under there something else but it it just it caught on fire immediately and my pardner and i just do not even talk we is grab the couch heave it upside down and now there is plenty of oxygen now for the fire really get goin and it its startits op and we are patting it ouc and it is sore to get in ut away from us we grabbed the only thing tha's really available and those are these really nice im silk pillows and we have wont any chand hn both of is and we are just win milling away at this fire on the couch and we put it out but it is smoking terribly and tha a it was just it was a disaster a to the couchit upside down it the bottom of it is burnt the house is fillin with smoke from the couch the squirrel when it went into the couch in its death throws just latched on to the bottom of the couch it is the smoking piece of gristle under an eatt the couch latched on it with its claws and we are pounding smearing it all over the place and the smoke alarms are firing away the guides standing in his with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose which is still belieding his the jomas are a mess that covered with blood the front of him and we finally get the fire out and we are both completely read swetting because we are dressed for lixeeritygry weather and it is hot there by the fire im were mortified the house is full of smoke the wthe wife just looks around and just starts the cry she goes what what have you done what ave you done to my house it you could se your just clicking things off on her fingers cay the that squirrel ruin fellowis n oud a new couch theuh the walls ware covered with soot the firelarms o going off my husband's disfigured and then she really cona just lost it and a he was just looking attison shake in his head he could not believe that these two idiots showed up and and did this two it his house over nothing really and heu just goes you nowt you really yet you really have not done anything wrong there is i cannot point to any one thing that you did that i have a reason to get angry about you really have not done anything wrong in me we did call you but i'm just i just i cannot thank you for this they call for a squirrel land wits three thousand four thousand ots worth ow tge an a broke and th and this is all within about five minutes could that h ve happen to you now thirteen years later there is always a new mistake to be made i do not think i i do not think i would make that pa ticular mistake i mean you make plenty mistakes you make plenty mistakes that is that is that is just part of that job an thog you a you just try not to make the same one twice but there is such variety that yif your gonto make hundreds youcan make thousands and mistakes an make thousand an mistakes intil you reallyget a handle on what you do and with police work they afford you plenty of stakes to make mistakes but there is things that just either tey are not your responsibility if yo if you get in invoben things that are not your responsibility were tht you really not equipped te handle or tha youdo not hav a specific plan a plan that is thought through to a conclusion a you probably should rea value whayt what you doin yet now that you mention that yet the traigt you walk into the house thinking oket what it will get thi squirrel how were you goin to get the squirrel what was the best case in areal that is a great question i guess i was thinking that i would go up there in the attic and find this cowering squirrel and somehow con a lureit in to some kind of a trap and an walk out with in be a huro but does a turned out a the squirrel it was a purivictory for the squirrel but the squirrel that funly one

margi rachlan has interviewed all these people she written big feature stories for alsorts big magazine's newspapers but the very very first big feature simon that she was actually sent out on was by publication in nineteen eighty two the lesangulist reader they sent out a very nervous very useful margi rachlan to interview moon unit zapa memberher daughter of franksapa in this little bit that she does on the song she is using a lot of this language that ministro vell speak that no one had ever heard before andit was considered really on exatic and i was from the valley i was sentse g talk to her she as one of your people speak to her in your secret private arga exactly an course what is touching to me is that i totally bought that your right i'm the right perse om for the j omenty go a speak to her in the valley language we were gon i alanaando you get there and your a bit nervous and the pressureis on which is of course the setting for a possible possible triumph or possible gasca right and what happens next well what i notice was that there was it was not a it was a ten situation am i distin't fee it was going very well and om the mother was sort of hovering we we have a recorting of it that youbecause you had a taperquarter rolling during this ye is at other hang out ron the vall that u am oing ot big arcin ery well im trying at this point i'm surt that that rock bottom level that every one can get at an interview where you di saing ina which your favourite colei and she is trying to hell me along her wi o nor i taing o at fe very somewere were seated in the den and uam the mother made me coffi but i was too nervous to drink it but i gess hert ofe kept staring at and she kept staring and i felt it was i pretty impore that at some point i better drain that coffee cup and am what happened was moon told me a joke and i did not see the joke coming and right before she told me the joke ihad taken at big swig of the coffee wich was now cold and when she told me the joke i burst out laughing and am and i i started to choke and i pressed my lips to gether si did not spit et out and n wine to a spittake and the coffee came shooting out my t who shooting out your neshooting right out my a man i i was really embarrass but sinalty i could not breathe at the same time i was choking and i jumped up and i stert o start of running around the room nocking things over and i and i do not think they nd i think i think that they did not know what was going on te mother began shasn she began chasing you she began chasing me ecause she could not now sir running from corner to corner tryking to catch my breath and she began soshicing me and it as certain point she got behind me and she gave me the hime maneuver niwe you knowit t not in the news business even a reporter for twenty years and nobody's ever given me a the himeo mev o en o tor wh i always say that it is a it is a bench mark the tvery lo bench mark and i can do any interview i can get thrown office ten i can make cursed out by thi subject but i can leave and getten a har nd i can drive hom an think i did not ploconoi knownow what happened what happened after that it was sorter we would all been in an earthquake together and all f the nervousness left the room and suddenly we were three galho just cetting and i remember that sirf hug them both when i left him while they were now my friend it is interesting in it because one of our criteria for fiasco is that all social order the normal social structure breaks down and gearly that is what happens here the normal interview stops and the social structure of the moment completely changes she the mob gives you the hymlic maneuver and then suddenly it stopps feeling an interview ne no it was really and and i have to say that but it was a very embarrassing experience in it completely made me feel close to them i it was interesting when moon's father died a while ago i bumped into her somewhere and and and we both burs into teerrs i may really fell a little the little sister of mine a had a loss andi meet on the starting point was you now i that moment that momentto me the thing about it thats thats useful is that it shows the the useful purpose of a fiasca that is when social order breaks down that can be a force not just for a for chaos and for intropeand for evil but in fact that can be a force for good why they can break him we can bring people together why the know was actually this huge success to me i i'd never been sent out under these time circut circumstances before i remember we beat the local paper they hurld examiner followed us a week later and we had the first story and it was cirt concered that definitive one because we had this glossery of terms that i had made her put together and a the valley speek ave valleys big terms and in and down and then it was i was sindicated and most of the quoticl stuff that you under a using in your in your story happened after the happened at yet ap

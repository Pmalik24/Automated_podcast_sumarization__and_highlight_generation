a quick warning there are curse words that are un beeped in todays episode of the sha if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our web siht this american life dot a work sodam sayali begins each day with a six a m walk around kaira it' the only thirty minute of his day he gets from salf for emals and meetings and the chas of his enormously stressfor job begins his job be now wes in charge of etting traks filled with humanitarian aid it ta gasa during the current war it does is for big american on profit called an era that sen aid into gas of decads but since the war every day their bottle necks and wed just to go challenges with all the different governments and agencies and militaries and aid groups above i toot him at the end of a very long day of this and and i made this is a sign of his diplomatic skills he seemed calm cho het de could not not ask him about it maybe that just of fasad but it is tiit is a fasad ti had o tat hee i i learned the hard way to hold myselfs together i think il break down after it things thes ar now i get in that you get it ayou get it together i doctors tat on twice just before the recencees fire between israel and hmas and then during the sees fire as interes in tacking to him because the stakes of any paws in fighting seem high for aid workkers him for this hes fire little humanitarian ade was actually making it into gasa and aferiage if only fifty five trucks to day according to the uan remember at that point already one point seven million people in asa wuld displace frim their homes afteris had been operating without an asesia that if pain collors and baseif medicines food an water where in short supply apas in fighting would made a chance to findwe get stuff through and i wanted to know how he was preparing andwhat he hope wou happen an e answer was about his preprations his team an gaza was going round doing with a basinly been doing for weeks trying to figre out what the greatest needs wor for incence in the schools and other buildings that are now the main shelters for over a million people in gasa these are incredible over crowded people leeping on the ground everywhere just to give you a bit of an image wome are sleeping inside the rooms inside the school shelter and the men are sleeping in the yard of the school tut also a lot of families are in the streets and its winter it is freezing and that is when our thuman gaza was we need dents we eed mattresses we need blankets and that is what iave been doing here and immediately we started procurement offens s in eget the first thing i did s thit went to the fort job an the kathon tha the fort job and i told them how many thnts do you hav because there ther for camping there are ready a there we can procure immediately but in by these tens as there was a problem with them and toks pend the problm i should remind you that even before this war for years now israel is controlled nearly everything that wen in and out of gasa gasa surrounded by giant fence is part of that israel restricted specific certain medals and chemicals and fabrics from entering gaa because they said they did not wone them to fall into masa's hands get turned int weapons against israel or find some military use this an official wist of restricted stav it with a tend is the fabric a there certain tipe of fabrics that are not allowd and then we were okes to with has materials that is tot alod we meed thet desied our own tence and then we meedit to fine an thender who is willing to bredus tand on certain specification froms crawds immediately i mean this vander i met him on the same day e and then i go back tom after fo or hours i ma toand i need two thousand tence wee and then immediately six qar trobs an cairo thi start producing these pens and those wofll be done what day were expecting the deliveryg nexs week next week maybe in time for the sease fire may be not we were talking two days before the sease fire started ut at i'm's organization an nera had hopeinge of other stuff that was ready to go and enter gaza and there is only one place to do that the rough acrossing from egypt into gaza it tat i'm said the trucks could be delayd there for days while egyptian and his railly officials each inspect the trucks to make sure that they are in fact filled with humanitarian ad it is never cleer how many of these trucks will make it through or f many of get through is your used to do these inspections at big check point called karam chalom there was fully equiped to handle lots of inspections but that a checkmon has been close since the war started the rofgh crossing just is not set up for hivot in matrucks and satam and other people trying to get humanitarianade into gaza understand all of that but' still do not understand the deways they say from day to day seems arbitrary to them a just yesto day seventy nine trucks got in but to give you a comparison on a normal day before the war it would have been five hundred trucks to day it is shawing that only seventy nine trucks yesterday got no and some days there were zero trucks going in sat i' why i sho few trucks getting through this is a question an arab an askging all alarg a we we cannot find than sir we do not know the answer we reached at repeated wa to is railly authorities to find out wymore truks are not getting through the one check point that they wel out into gaza but we never got a reply once ta i'm's trucks full of ad get into gaza there is another problem before the sease fire when we first talked other tructs inside gaza wics must take the aid where it needed to go inside gaza and those trucks need fuel i fuel been lacking for over two weeks there is no fuel in side gaza and ner ave been very creativ we ben usi cotrolls wo en using ya an li thought an do not es horses to deliver the a a wen i may you using horses and tonkys to deliver international ad this is wat what is needed imagine there is no fuel imagine the size of gaza te see fire started the day after thanksgiving thoug aresy that is not how the participencs view of that picgur dd the number of trucks crossing in to gaza with humanitaria ad rough we tripled i talght to sit om again on the seventh day of the sease fire he last day he told me his organization anera got more aid delivered in those seven days and it had in the two months of war before that that is that is actually what makes we really sad is sense we can get more and more ad in but these inspections deles om as if november twenty nine at least five hundred and seventy two trucks were waiting on the rud connecting the egection and mister ety crossing am is for thes ready in stection of each truck thiks hours sat i'm did your tents get across not yet lon yet be uction tways he said gualry issues he stold me that we ready next week a day after that conversation the ses fire ended now it is some clare exactly what it is gon to be next week and we there is can be ever get stup through he first night the wore rsumed my coworker when ever producers making mek and i spoke we zulia tumon direct ove communications at unra the ou and palestine refugyn agency which runs the shelters across gaza that are housing now over a million people that is by the way the you anagency thats had more of its staff killed than any you anmission in any conflict in the history the nated nation has been a hundred and eleven deaths in gasa since october julia tuma said the no troccenter gasa that first day not one after the pause in the war no human its ands o tan sa

tryng to do something that is hard to do and he knows very well that it is completely up to him the cavalry is not coming and hes for youing at had i hang ot in make the best of things he talked to nancy upday it is just normal now in america for people to start a go fun my campaign if they have medical bills the insane bills have become routine the insane dy i why process of raising the money has also become routine you would be insane not to but' several weeks ago i saw a new development in the field new to me anyway the c yo of a hospital had started to go funmy campaign to try and save the hospital it is called bucktel medical centr and the c eo is tim reevs dim says dire things in a calm voice when we got on the phone and i asked him how quickly the hospital my clothes he said i put a idin ini fron a coun a not money for one pable i keep that to week he will not in reser i hope i to week i cannot caun' ke that bucktell medical center this hospital is a small single story concrete building serving a bit more than three thousand people in renovo pennsylvania it is the middle northfish part of the state lot a big forests and hunting la nd around there buctail is the only hospital in the county it is got a community clinic twenty four hour emergency room ambulan service sixteen beds for acute care and a small onsight nursing home the next closest hospital is forty miles away the next closest emergency room is thirty four miles away and thirty four miles is not an unbearably long ride except for somebody having an emergency weave local gid i i a nothin o that no when they tee him pull in tor parkin lot they gat tot they out i having a harttack he only time ye show that the money thave a harttack he a not a mke thonrom we have pom a har population of patl toni

takes a break from worring about patience he thinks about his staff eighty five people who would lose jobs if the hospital closed the hospita is one of the bigger employers in that half of the county how does the hospital get to the point where they are setting up a go fun me to stand business the few months ago bucktail was hit with a couple of big financial set backs one after another there were some federal money that did not come through that they have been counting on also some money the state says it over paid them and now wants to take back those two hits but the hospital over six hundred thousand dollars in the whole add to that all the things that can make it hard to keep any small rural hospital open small patient population and none of the specialteees that can bring in a lot of money cardiac care nerology also insurance does not cover bucktails costs most of the hospitals patients are on medicare or medicade the hospital breaks even with medicar o patients the decaye they lose money but they also lose money on private insurance because small hospitals do not have the leverage to negotiate decent reimbersement rades the way big hospitals do tim says bucktle needs one point five million dollars to make it through the fyscal year he and the leadership team at bucktale ha've drawn up a plan they believe can stablize the hospital in the long term but the short turn lack of money is clobbering them and tim is open to any idea about how to get money any idea any amount of money the go fun my which has raised about sixteen thousand dollars was a board member's idea the board is olve volunteerers who live in te community the staff of the hospital is pitching in ar thave a loke for way o do fun ri i ri tot ther workin i conjunction with one of the local par

working on to trying save the hospital tim checks it every day adds ideas updates it is forty rows long and counting ims can a read a few line three implement s tea the hospital bought a catscan machine because patients have been going elsewhere to get cats cans and bucktale wants to keep those patients line thirty five oak ridge lumber yeares ago some one donated bunch of land to the hospital the side of a mountain a lumber company recently asked him if they could drive through that land to reach other land where they were going to cut down trees for lumber and tim said hey see if you ant o buy any of our trees on our land for lumber we will seldom to you line twenty electronic sign this is part of an effort to get more patients in the door where the hospital lucky te to the

lot of money unless you are tring to run a hospitl lee e o c a ther many many day when i get hom a and in amotionally to are you getting any sleep hothe day before thanksgiving i got tim's weekly email update that he sends out to bunch people it said quote we had a meeting with the staff this afternoon at three ofclock the meeting to day was more difficult than meetings we have had in the past likewise this is the most difficult update i have provided until to day i've been able to report that the next pay roll is covered i could not provide that assurance to day he said he had no idea how they could continue providing services pass december first he said quote we are out of tine without some temporary support i thought about an earlier conversation i'd had with tim we were on the phone and i was looking over a copy of a letter he would sent to elected officials laying out what topany at bucktale one line stop me short i just got to the line where you say i have personally provided the facility with an interest free lone o my godness tim oh the onl people it no or the people on op at o an o port reck does your wife now e is she worried about thet is she worried about it yet am i

shure there a e places where people hope that the federal governments an a swoop in millians dollars and fix everything but what have you are the federal government what he hope for thet answers from some actural federal and please it is in a minute chicago bubagradio when our program continues this marican lif myre glass each we can to show wech whose ha theme foring you variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day show the cavalry is not coming stories about all the things you do some them clever some ofthem angry when you realize that no one is going to show up to rescue you we hav arrived to at two of our programm at too give me your tired your poorer your huddled massays or done sove yoone amigreat to the united states from another country ther ter there ware bunch oways to do that but the big one for people wanted to cross from the southern border into theunited states is the asylum programm fro most we be that is the only legal pathway every one astay here asylum means not just coming here toget a itt a job or hve a better life in some way they have to show that they are running from some kind of danger or persecution back home this all comes out of a postword or two idealis on this law this idea that the united states can and should give refuge to people fleeing oppression an the president tromp as you probly remember it became abot harder to get asylum we destory back then during his administration about the people who do the first screenings of asylum applicans at the united states citizenship and emigration services you ese i ask these people are asylum officers and back down they told us that from their point of vie ew president trump was keeping out all kinds of people shud been aloud into the country and they said they yearned for some cavalry to ride in some new president to change things save the day now of course they have new president in jobidon and things have not gone the way these ufficials hope for whet are producers not you amen to to a whole different much of veuaseas officials resoy these peoplewho work in te asylum and refugey branthes i got this window into the whole emigration system they you do not usually get tis not it let me start the story the way we have to start many asylum stories by explaining what the hele the people who work in these jobs actually do the once i talk to were all asylum officers at some point and heare's what that looks they sit in an office on the phone for hours with asylum seekers in an interpreter on the line they are asking questions hearing brutal stories from people who recently cross the border about what theyir fleeing teniswell in political actofis escaping the government cammerunians fleeing viluns saw vadorn families escaping gangs the officers have to determine whether the migrens er talking to could get legal protection here under oueslaw and whether they could face harm or even death if they got sent back to their home country it is not for the faint of hart ut it is more for the bleeding hard crowd than the enforcement crowd these are not the toughgy copsy off in fine in the border patrol lots of the word for the peace quarrer lots of people within emigration law background or human rits the understand that their decisions in these cases can dictate whether some one lives or doines and every one of them have ever talk to feels the weight of that it is a moral duty to them not just a nin difie after for years of presedent trump dismantling the asylum and refugey programs and calling their work a con they felt desperate for a change and then in the months before the twenty twenty election in a random press event joe bide and cut their ear for the first time tbecause of the way he started talking about asylum sekers therestore our moral stand in the world mar our histori girls a safehave for refuges sylum seekers no sleen silence an pressen persecution my lore we have never we have never made a sylum seekers say seek asylum outside the nig satesmer making asylum cseekers weighed outside the uas that is a trump policy that these yeu esiia's workers hated to then this was a signal bidan was nodding at them paying attention to theire corner of the sand box when joe bide an one their hopes were modest they knew migration was never one of his big issues but hey at least he would set things back on a better course well at we swilgo back to whenl we hav ne abomument suesion goet a return ton normal s rin a return tu and emigration siste tents that a bad manywens e were not n a go out of our way to her people that is an asylum officer om gon a call mark not his real name also not his real voice you will hear voice actors instead of the emigration officials themselves imitating their voices and inflections as closely as possible because these folks are not siples to talk to the press they could get fired that is also why i cannot tell you a lot about mark or any of the others she will here what i can say is than mark is precise hand over all kind of a carmigon wone spide an one mark says he and his colleagues expected that pretty early on he would end something called titl forty to title forty two was a public health order that had basically close the southern border to prevent the spread of coen it would allowed yuas border officers to expel migrants back into mexico with no legal formalities no questions asked hours after they were cot the trump administration put it in place on the pendamicet a silum and refugey officers thought this was illegal because it prevented people from even being able to ask for asylum mark and his coworkers were easy trump activated it bidn could just the activatit the person i talkd to who was the most optimistic about the whole thing he say yu a s i s official i'm going a call george he is been at the agency through many administrations he watches the first sweeks of the bidan administration role by nothing but george was not bothered i te i ran in to co worker and we'r li oh these advocates ar all man that we haven'n anta title forty two yen but yow we least neat few weeks to plan i that right i i understand they cannot do it immediately but they will do it soon enough it will be fines how did it go not well not raymon not well aye i a i would say i storted to get and strictvery concern in ter sus spicious around the first time they have the opportunity to and title forty two and the decidedeexten this was back in twenty twenty one around augus back then we had a huge wave of people showing up at the border lots of them thought okat trumps gone biden sounds more friendly may be now i have a chance to get in by keeping title forty two presideinbiting could keep them from crossing into the us and ever you a s s official lik talk to heard the same story george did about why the administration made that choice political operators at the white house be came canfence that it was bad for the presedent for the te ve to show what would be characterized as ca as at the border i aske the white house of this is why the president kept title forty two going and not public health concerns they said it was the cd ses call not the precedents the you a s s workers i talk to did not buy this in fact george remembers how the bidan administration doubled down on this argument when the a cal u sued the government overtitle forty two and then you hade them making these absurd public statements that were periting the things the trumpetmenistration sand about title for to wit democratin laughed at and this mes when trump wass aponis but when thay at wofo oh we have nothing do is this is a see to sethis is related upon else not i migration ou know keeping title forty two going as long as they did was at what the hell moment for the ouace i s workers a turning point seeing all these people trying to seek asylum stuck outside our borders because of title forty to made these workers feel angry and lonely but they were the only witnesses to abrige collapsing well everyone else the other way this next person i'll call lesa she works in refugey services she was also the only official who did not swear during our interview i mean i stoppd talking bet eith my friends and family to be honest you did yeh cause all it does his work all it would do is workin me up into a frienzy a frustration and they can only listen to it for much especially when they all two were under the sillusion that oh but is not it much better oh we understand remember how horrible it was under the trumpedministration but is not it much better and you want to say yeds it is better it is we are not under full level destruction attack but also promises were made and the're not happening and people are still living an refugy camps on the southernside of the border and no one is doing anything to help them you just you feer you cannot talk to the regular world about it any more in the end it took presedent by an over a year to try to end title forty to and when he did it texas sued and stoptim title forty to remain in place until may of this year it was there through half of presen and bi dans term in those first two years of the bidan administration lots of people were being turned away at the border but at the same time in credibly lots of other people were being allowed in mostly vinisuellens and cubans the caraguones some hations more than a million migrans were allowed into the us in two years why did this happen take menisuella for example the ues did not have good diplomatic relationships wit ten nesuella we could not flive minisuellens back to their country when they showed up at the border and mexico did not want them waiting on their side which meant the bide administration was stuck they had to vigur out what to do and the solusion they came up with for vinisuella and all these countries wis temporary all the emigrants they came in the more than a million most or here in temporary permits of ficially allowed to stay for a while till things in their home country school down at first this was can have been at hawk thing the bide administration did a bid under the rat are just to relieve pressure at the border there had been dangerous over crowding at border partral stations later this became a more official program the proudly point to as proof that they stand up for huminitarian ideals but one of the officials i talk to pointed out temporary status can funnel a lot of people away from getting asylum which is permanent whatever their intentions by january of this year the bide administration had mad two man parallel tracts for imigrants tons of people coming in with temporary statuses tons of others kept out by title forty two and that is one the sedy s announce the public healt crisis was officially over title forty two had to end which is great news for these yuasiias workers right tis what they been waiting for as they sit in their offices they wonder what the plan is how their sipples to handle what may be large numbers of new asylum applicants the last day of title forty two keeps looming closer and closer and these workers are hearing nothing then some rumblings ad then when i heard that there were in a drop on te rule i was of course they are the new rules spelled out for the first time how the bid an administration wanted to run asylum at the southern border for now an original policy of their own to handle the crowds of people they expected woul cross the border one's title forty two ended the rule is called c l p which stands for cir convention of lawful pathways the rule was not just any rule it is a swiss army night many different rules all rolled into on but the part that jued out to these uasiaas workers the mos is that under the rule in order to even apply for asylum you have to show that you alreadyo applied for asylum and got denied in at least one country you have pass through before getting to the ues have you came up from south america you went thor panama then costreca then nicaragua then honduras then ell saw the dor then guatamala then mexico you would have to apply for asylum and be denied in at least one of thougs if you do not have proof of this you are not eligible for asylum hear does not matter what you are fleinging your home country your government could be act ive we trying to kill you an your family because you'are political actavus clear cut asylum clam not relevant any more you basically will not get asylum in the us because these other countries did not reject you first they ou as c i s workers i talk to or floored by this they were well that is pasically something precedent trump try to pu in place but the cort struck it down quickly said it was a legal and now here was preset in bited bringing it back or something that looked a lot it it was mind blowing it is the same yet the ather twikted around the corners and the people who had to work on writing that rule i mean jes i can even imagine to be the one who is told he are we did that rule whan we know that it is legal but let us try this one now this sis pre clearly unlawful at this point george sticks out a thick book very official looking it is a bound copy of the emigration an nationality act he just happened to hape around the house as one does i munles sheus rebe asylum statue any alien who is physically present in the united states or who arrives in the united states wether or basically this says any one who arrives here in any way legally or illegally can apply for asylum and whit circomvention of lawful pathwaysas is yes surey you can you can apply but were an asay your nout i reached out to one of the administration officials who over sea seal pee assistante secretary for emigration and border policy last nunia's netthal i asked him how seal pe is different from president trumps asylum ban which had been ruled a legal the trump administration a proch to this ose to inpos acategorical man on asylum at the land border he is saying there band was catagorigon it apply to every ones no exceptions a were not denying asylum categorically to anybody that the landborder and that is just a fact n something that is important for your audience to understand what we have done is a sentsially crea we we calla rebutable presumption and that is imortant because it is in fact rebutable and that means ot people a cross between the porcof ventry and have a compelling reason why they needed to do that can rebut the presumtion weresee many peopl do that in practice i rebutable presumption that means zeal p starts off assuming you are inneligible for asylum but do not worry you can prove it wrong you can rebut immediately write there on the spot when you talk to an asylum officer prove it wrong and then puf it is gone does not oblige you any more there is a list of ways to rebut the rule first it does not apply to unaccompanied miners or if you are sick and you need medical care that is an exception or if you are being traffic another thing vendigates the rule or if you are in iminent danger if some one is actively trying to kill you there at the border that is an exception for quote extreme and iminent threat to life for safety bhich all sone's reasonable enough but the officers i spoke with and people ti talk to who work with migrancs along the border they a'll say it is really really ridiculously difficult to get one of these exceptions ar re buttles an attorney i talk to from the texa civil writes project that she is known of cases where the medical emergency wre buttle is hard to get it takes long the migrants have gotten sicker and sicker and have died waiting for it mark says that when he is interviewing asylum seekers an trying to apply these seal pe rules he does not where it leads him and who he ands up rejecting the consequences af getting things wrong the st akes are extremely hat when you get it wrong people will die and it is not u purbaly tha stoping hysterical that is i fact it is life for death decisions every say one of them you cannot afford to get them wrong and what sea p does is it forces you to make in correct decisions an you have to take that seriously the latest numbers from the government tell us that only sixteen per cent of asylum seekers who were caught crossing the border we are able to prove they qualified for one of the seal p exceptions or rebuttles which means eighty four per cent we are not able to prove it they could be deport id many you as i as workers complaine to leadership about this from the start that is why they hated seal p the response according to george y know some of you may disagree with this rone it may make you feel uncomfortable bov on this is a jap and then the sat he cann't quit but they really do not care they really it that the really channeling their in er mar morts and do not let the dornon it you were the dog shoun o dition at the end of the dayt they are not interestin you mral or legal objections shut the fock up put your head down tho which oure told het wh i think of the administration were telling the story of seal p they would not start with the new restrictions on asylum at the border they probably emphasis a different part of the rule it is a whole new way there enticing people to cross at the official border stations in an orderly way instead of something more dangerous waiting across a river ore walking through the desert it is an ap yes they have an ap it is called c b p one and they government has big hope for it when the bide administration rolled out seal p they announce that this ap was the way every one in the southern border should apply for asylum this was goin to be the new system you can get an appointment to enter the u s and it is signs you a port of entry to show up to at a specific time come to mathamotos on october thirtieth at six p m and as an incentive to encourage you to use the ap if you download it and use it and you come in and ask for asylum all the other seal p rules that keep people out they do not apply to you it does not matter whether you ask for asylum in other countries before you got here you do not need to be in a medical emergency you r have someone chasing you threatening your life it is a golden ticket use the ap apply for sylum period and i know how bonkers this sounds on the one hand presedent biding created this we ar trumpbe policy that makes it practically impossible to even ask for asylum in some ways lut on the other hand you can side step all of that and just come into the united states if you have a phone and can dow lodanap tthis has biniscribe os the carrot and stick approach they went to reward people for using the see be p one ap and coming in through official ports of entry and they want to penalize everyone else and having anap does seem smart migrants all have phones they ousaps all the time but i'm sure the s next part will not surprise you the ap did not work wel from the very start of seal p this past may it went off the rails first of all theye were not a lot of appointments available about seven hundred and fifty a day for the whole border migrants would wait for the appointments to open up try to get one and the ap would crash there ware error messages that people did not understand that prevented people from making appointments one that just said fraud that continues to this day one review of the aptost reads this ap is crap though half the review seem to be right wing troles posting things open door policy thanks brandon or come on in farrovia p sds for all the drug smuggling human trafficing criminals that neet in nou stomping ground when the ap did work there were the waytimes a women who works at a shelter and renosa told me she talk to a family that had been waiting for four months for their appointment same with mathemortos andtihuanum the problem with waiting besides that it sucks to wait is tat the car tells ar out the border looking to robin kidnap asylums seeker o er astuck there many people just make a run for it without their golden ticket they cross the border anywhere they can mark laid out for me pretty typical case that he says he gets often for example you are hanging out mexico you'r planning on getting yours seebe p one appointment but they go snapped up every day you are waiting round and then in the months that you are waiting in mot more els where or else you get kin that hol formansom they may calls to your samily members using yourself on asking for hower much money otherwise i can kill you you family scrounges up whatever they get to pay them they pay them you get release to et y you dumped ofp on the side the road somewhere how no money because they have robbed you they takeen all your travel documents thif they can uou kow everything that you had with you how are you going to support yourself in this border town while you wait to get a seebe p one appointment on the fond that you longer hav you dsat i cannot do this anymore i got across in th united states mark ask me did i think that migran was an extreme danger enough to get a rebuttle to the seal pea rules and be allowed to apply for asylum it sounds a well no that is not how works that person is not eligible for thaterybuttle because you half to demonstrate th your life or safety was in iminin danger at that exact moment when you cross into the united states unless that cartel eor whoever kin ap to you is nipping on your sheels as you dive in the water you are not elgible for thaterybottle this is that you asiiias worker i will call joana she is been doing this job for a while it sorte this whole completely nonsensical idea that yo you have to be actually running through the desert and you do not try to wage your way across the reo grand while bullets are flying over your head rag i mean is is if you these laws and ideas are written by people who have watched way too many world work too movies for tomite epises of narcos or seme ye yet too many hevisence of narco ter i do not know but that is not that is not how works stepping back and looking up the big picture most of the people entering from our southern border are not you seem the seep p one ap enoctober it was about a hundred and eighty eight thousand people who got copy to een ports of ventry ofersas about forty four thousand who use the ap which means most people face the restrictive rules that make it hard to ask for asylum they you as seias officials they spoke to said under presiden biten the way selpe is written it sounds they are all these was you can still apply for asylm but in practice it is just as bad as it was under president trum because seal p deni many people the chance at asylum at all i asked asistant secretary nunious netto if presedent bines policy is just as restrictive as presdent trumps what we are duing is they completely different an balance to proache to the citry that again includes an unpresidented extension inlawful pokwars n proscessies wor people to con to the country whilat thisin on put son common sense or o constraints on o the abilityoclimsion at the border for individuals at the landborder between portsent wo do not have a compelling reason wanity to cross un lowf we between heirportsent but in practice what were hearing on the ground is that people who that it is incredibly hard to prove the exceptions and rebuttles that people that try to prove an exception ar rebuttle that has to do with medical emergencies for example have died waiting for such an exception ar rebuttle and does not it in effect at the end does not it to squalify a lot of people from even asking for asylum just realy reamses iry n ote reasona on the record here at that point assistants secretary nunious nettos press persen interrupted us they' agree to answer only one question about seal p on the record i saw this is a normal follow up to clarify they disagreed they said they were limited in what they could say because of on going law suits about the rule the keep phrase in what he said was a balanced t approach theadministration officials have talkto say that this mishmash of new rules and exceptions to those rules and everything else have described they say when you put it all together you will see them trying to balance the huminitarian princeiples they say they hold dear wut the fact that they need to wead out dubious asylum claims i think what is happening is there is a humanitarian crisis many people arriving at the borter and a back logue of nearly three million emigration cases already that the administration had to figure out something to do with the tens of thousands of people showing up each week and theires scared of looking soft on imigration tut they also do not want to be anty emigrant they do not think of themselves as anty emigrant they ended up with this contradictory hodge padch letting in over a million people for huminitarian resons but that is just temporary relocation or setting up seal p rules thet are both deeply restrictive and surprisingly unrestricted of course it is amass tseal p is curenly being challenged in court in two separate federal cases the aseal use toing the bid an administration in bo saying that sealpe makes the two hard for people to apply for asylum in violation of the law the asylum officers union has filed two amecas preevs one for each of the law suits saying they agree they reperosent about one thousand asylum officers assistant secretary nunias netto told me the administration is confident the rule is legle the there is one phrase at one of the officers joanna used that stuck with me she said the overtun window has shifted which means the window of political acceptability has changed the gulpost have moved because of trump strategy on asylum where the goal according to joanna was to kill the asylum program allow no one in give no protection and when the biden administration created se l p tjoanna thinks they cosigned on the idea of let us just not any more just with a different tone if you look at it now that you have seen the bided administration in action in asylum what what thingster you yes his is they actually ave made some changes heres where it is different and here is where it is the same as how it was noter trump er well they do not pull babies away from mothers arms i gess you get a sicker are i cooky ye for you they talk about it different lay ah that is really important demicrats do not call country shet hall countries they just they treat that shat hall countries but i think what the bidan administerytion you have a pretense at protection that the trump people ded an'tto there is something just lik rih do you thnk it is worse than it wesunder trum i mean it is very bad and very similar but it is a different kind what you mean a different kind do what is what is worse some one whose direct in doing something bad some one who dresses up a little nicer and puts a better face on it but still does pretty much the samething i think we will look back on the first two years of the bid administration in the future n identify this as an inflection point when we kind of point stap the pretense of having an a sylum system that comports wis our legal obligationse under international and federal law may be that is the real by parties an agreement at this point this system that we built to function os their own idealistic cavalry to protect people who are fleeing for their lives both partie seem to have decided that we do not need to do that anymore is that of looking at why youre coming to the us and judging that on its merits now we will block you because of how you came to the ues whether y use tess to be pe one up whether you ask for asilum from countries along the way if you are the most vulnerable the most then need a rescuing our asilum

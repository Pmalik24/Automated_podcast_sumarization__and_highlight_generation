normally spend over fifty hours a week on a slow week watching games and thinging about sports who these days hungry men rating in empty kitchen pantry for any scrap of food i resorterd to watching old college games tha theye seen before and live cream baseball in the middle the night the german sokaly bundislee o saturday morning the choice bis was between bundisliga and a cornhole the american

education recky steamboat perses mot cho man randy savage at restelvaneous three and its largely considered the greatest restling match of all time an i realize that since some homescooling my cad they had to see the important classics of my culture the cannon the cannon ye now mad it really were joking boat were not cononically ere's a lot of controversy about what is in the cannon wrestling was no one disputes this spench his watching way foer games inder rock town sometimes he says he sawt this action might be better for him in some way to dabout fewer hours desports maybe maybe but it also makes me realize that the things ie fill them with are much better there is a lot empty the is a lik there is there is a lot o empty space out there man there is a lot o empty sface in life and when somebody is says you do not well now you can nan you could fill it with something really meaning ful will you or or is that even an option i think there is only much meeting you can packin to the hours of a week i think there is only much productivity within one person i think that something by the way this is sforts me to confront anyway the i say these guys reout about sports doing these sportsless monts it is called what wort sports the tone of it is peoplewho livin tens surrounded by rebel after a war remembering what it was to live in houses looking back on their old lives which only now they appreciate for what they were the as say starts this way i remember there were expensive commercials i defnally remember expensive commercials being a part of lat sports i only notice this when sports on replay happen the ad for replay games or cheap very sad om generators carwarn to boot tactgo ger for things that should not be tactacal carbizers and hearing ans o you remember how back when there were words each person had a list ofteens they strongly preferred to win if the portland trail blazers and infas grisly squared off you and i would be a little bit hackyer about life if the gr is lings wor the teem that one wall is that all about y the things they miss filly spans doing things that were not normal for anybody but phillys fans spreadsheets of sport statistics for each game which results them went into a spread cheet for the whole season wics then went into a historical archive spread sheet watching a for our game and walking away with one gift worthy moment they write fellik aversion of sipting for gold wutd version in which the dirt itself was valuable o uncle thing i remember about sports is watching people run fast in one direction it was fund to watch some one do this when unimpeded such as when you sain bolt walked into a maull in church shoes or whatever in rain as fast as the fast as an a fill player ever had but it was ten times this fun when some one was able to run really far while other people were trying to stop that person from running far also fon watching big people try to stop fast people from running they write sports lital chemistry labs designd to run for hours mons and senturies along the way producing countless things nobody could ave predicted from the onset a cool other world we space placs wuld people could completely depress yourise for several hours and sometimes come to space madness long the way one things went hay wire dyou remember that part a part was a pall of thirteen ec when your team starting safety whent out with an injury and they had to figure out how to play with tend to fenders a won'e gui who should have been going to law school instead of covering the other tos best receiver that part was a problem but the fun one o fall these problems very much belong to some one else despite us getting to invest feelings and whether they solve these problems or not carrying about whether i mediokr general managur coud finally figure out hat to sports pledges this was kind of politics but in a fake world in which we did not have to acknowledge politics can kill us that was nice is all passage in the essay where spensor reminiscence about the last live gane he went to i'll li seou and clemson in new orleans they got awysters for th game and met a friend ad restaurant the next day to eat and talk football for hours he writes do you hear all the beats of an impossible world playing there i do i feel every little ping of a world that ave only miss for forty five days of this point li cactus needles just pressing into the skin of a hovering hand jason somes at all up neatly with this for me the thing that mattered most about sports is how they by design did not matter we built industrial complex is around them but at hart they were about discovering which side had earned the right to shout the cooler obsinities on any given day and then the following day we would rediscovered but a day in our program feverybody who is yearning for sports right now an our sportsless world we try to help we radio methodon for your seports adiction sthet met afor too negative we

incidentally all the trophies that you collect long way of yer serious about the game frou the get e big of the trophy of course some trophies do not age very well get old enough in at some point the congestrec to look dusty aging catter what of our producers nancy updike a toctor frient of hers o what about a basketball all about this when i met up with my friend mary to talk about baskatball she was having some trouble with her trophies she just moved to a new apartment and her new place was small small that a bunch of high shool trophies would just dominate any room they were in she had the trophies in a box in e living room nd we sat on the floor pulling out fake silver statuetts of girls an cooliyes reaching ever upward hopeful and fit likein sophie at propaganda posters i to ca see feelin really tough walking hom with something ass big especially fo hold i li share yo gat that baby by the base then she found one that was not the others sort of hard to understand actually it picture this a thick slice of wood sanded and shalacked and mounted with a miniature room and backboard and then leaping across the front a stick figure made of roofing nails going in for a slam dunk marry identified this as her nineteen seventy eight girls of our sity team trophy from cardinal docarty high school and the girls she said had not been pleased with a tropy at all if ugly is not ye it is truly if we were all really unhappy we wanted w a tedational a tre yes i i we would rather have had the the also ugly but much more acceptable old version of trophies than o an i o arahies iwas sure i mean if your thirteen year old girl you arnt ye walkng o tat you ar a ran that is a truthyou an something that goes up high in the sky not something it is a slice of a tray i a a sligce id a tree with a mal stick figures sordern together ye ydoing the one thing that you will never be able to do dunk what was that was that something that yourd disguss oh yet i mean we and we also thought that that was the only reson we would never beinan bea luckily for us we all thoud well we are we are really some of the best players on the face of the earth when your sixteen year old girl was shoing in i at a tough catholic leag school syou sink ye we enough i'm just as good as marice cheeksand the doctor would to play with me and a doctor ja am and ou know we we could attribute our lack of success in the envia to te fact that we were girls soon to be women who would never dong and that is all that was be nus from it mary handed me the wood slized trophy and when i reached to touch the stick figure i realized that one of its feet was on a hitit i could actually make it go in for at the dunk once i discover this it was impossible not to do i over and over and over the trophy was completely hypnotizing a disturbing artifact from an artistic period best for got that that that the art of the late seventys shou know e specially in catholic em religion text books and churches and stuff was ugly her near there was even at a janra that late sevendays galike a i'm afraid i've been influence by it its os alittle in drawings that are just tha little bit olf on purpose you kdo not a men an the on purposeness of it is just alr ouabrigt right you can always your cats even on playing in the bak as a kid mary played baskebo mostly with her older brother daniel the two of them roomed around the city together lookipick up games whenever they could all summer every week and even at night because the court down the street had lihts it was a way to get out of the house to escape the chaosk of eleven kids in a working class irish family an a two small house on the edge of northas philadelphia basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense and home was a place where you could get hit for no reason or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal mary remembere being hungry a lot growing up a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school the message was em you could not be hungry because your parents for saints em and they especially directed it to our family into all the other familyes tha had u a lot of kids in them that our parents were saints was they workd hard to provide for us i thought that i was just extraordinarily em greedy that that i would want a you kdo not eat when i was hungry i think that the plaing baskiball was away to say if i could use my body in this way that u got me stais an attention and a certain amaunt of prestige thand then then my body was ocain away even though it was men i was way too skinny when i was kid em and it was cause for concern for the schoolner couple times and plaing baskiball was away to say you are not you not could have nerald tamage from being mail nurse she just can have these other miner moltners bro another godthing about basketballs tat she mary bought the family a rim and a basket ball for the back yard when she was only seven or eight using her first communion money sixty five bucks and five dollar incerements from every one in her huge family the only equipment she really needed and could never afford wer good shoes she always had those supermarket check out line shoes with ha hard plastic souls that were completely embarrassing of course but also had no ripability she would be running down the court and go sliding and be called for travelling whone year she got up the courage to ask a girl down the block for her old choes her nang was carn and e she had really nice bate a bullets tig tops white and i wanted her sneakers and cause i knew she was getting new ones and in our neighbourhood there is the practice of throwing your old sneakers up over the telephone wires when you are done with them and most of them were hardly worn out at all i mean not it the mean they thought of them you could see t hat there was tread missing but it is not you had ripped through the top of them and ih'd asked her for them and she said dea that she would given to me when she got her new ones and m and it was i thought that it was a little bit werd that i would ask somebody for their ue shoes but we had other clothes that were used from other people and she was tough and she cat kn had this she seemed she be the kind of person that could keep something that to her and and would know what it meant an and she did she never told anybody except of course the most im portant person that she should not have told her mother and her mother got m really upset and told her that she could not given to me and there they were hanging up on the telephone wire my sneakers and iam sure that her mum did that because she was afraid that if i came home with the pair u sneakers that it would be in sulting to my mother i'm sure that they all had this understanding up themselves you now you do not inslt some one else's you do not insult one of your peers by giving their kids here crappy shoes even though they are better than the crappy shoes that you brought for them but they were always really beautiful sneaker sang up on the oners and her ws no way to get them no way at all they just floated up there and hon i think that is when i decided that em platonic idealism was true there really was a perfect thing ti ever experience at least all i played in that catholic league and only i could see them for what they were they only sa worn out tread i saw a season of unforeseens high statistics we tolkd for two hours about basket ball and we kept returning to the dunk and the cruelty of the dunk on that would sliced trophy i dunk by a stick figure made out nails driving home there eighteen year old sense of frustration they could be the best ball handlers the best gards and it did not matter worth a dam because they could not dunk all of that captured for ever in the last trophy most of them would ever receive i think it was really kind of ethoughtless and the way that thoughtless things can sometimes t have a really nasty edge to them no one and we had a woman on our team who was six three and she could not dunk the ball you do not mean it was there was no there was no one that we knew who could dunk the ball not not a single woman that we knew and we knew some tall women we knew women who were in college i mean we's that i have a dream i recurring dream that i dunt the ball e what were the circumstances i was on the base line i i i made it was the same i was in the same positiona a time and it was not the kinds of dunks that you seein real life that even the best players cdo this was a spectacular dont because i did not just get my hands up over the rim i sailed over the rim with my feet and got above thea basket and just slam the ball down to the thing i was my whole body was a most tor im mo it stat in bon smal

then ta sort a lid lictos you knnow your dat was sm your dat as smar when he was a kid he won this om ye just fourteen he won this national quis show for kids on tv an kno wa flew from the city where he lived in flutilema o he as only id from the provinces as who was a finallist only kid from public school the front page of the newspaper heis incredbwy verbal kid left poetry in words great talker but again sacker there is two things that happen when you are not one of the better players you they putcher in gol you knownt to be a gol keeper am may be they might make you ref but that is ouno really low ye ahbut my dad turned out around and was not goly or refand i'm sure he played i'm i'm not saingthat he did not play but but he started calling the neighborood games webet he was calling the games ty ti he have geer he had a my crophone and a little speaker he can make his voice louder and yet he be have onlys thatsa yet yet and and busilys his taking equipment down and he is announcing kids actual games yes has their play yes i kidshy knows ye kidson his neighborood i just imagine o if i were a kid playing in that game to have somebody calling the game and i could hear them cawing the game is hout of doing it itwould make merar competitive you an mat makes it much more a yeabsolutely my pick my picture of it is how glamorous ikinin me suddenly it is their game is elevated and it is not just the neighborhood game now it is look this s just were on the radio which is just that is the same they do for the worald cup h a a ta danielstad would also make up games the whole professional games all the players both sides all the action starting daniel says when he was ten or leven he wou do just cind for himself as a thing to do though the whole family knew he could do this and if for example on a sunday afternoon after ones had lunch when my father would stark to be the entertainment for the adults ad rar not to just can you make up a game for us make it a good one he would just describe a game and it is a completely made up game am but when a goal would be scored inevitably the adults would cheer and ait was great i was a great game you known't and he' got really good at this eventually he was he was one of my great uncles had a little theatre you its uncle yango on the beach aa beachtown and in sodthern prew and may the were doing sort of likea a night of arts and poetry when a town wi show sentialy and my aunt my great uncle loncastor signed up whe i was you can do it just you do for us round the house yet yet on sunday afternoon i think of

yet we do not them in his telling of it every one plays the game with heir life every one does it exactly right as if as if controlled by a merinat which of courds if they were rn ye ye i can just i find it very easy to believe that people could have been really moved by the sport this is this was it was not a fake game it was t the game and in his game i th the hometown teame gets it up to the edge and the scories yes the gobs course heople exploded you were cheering fom that it actually happened and the detail that he tells me that i that i am always struck by his it when he when the young

hundred six pounds her features are fine and delicate but when she talks about her love for boxing you can see her in the ring she is radiant it is speaking to some one who is had a religious conversion boxing is yet aladon me is lik my vision it is i giss at the inavision is this is its is ol this is what i was plitty o for wain e gentleen when i met wot of the womens one hundred six boun waxs o wen wer you beads an viago in on o o onon o ri o o royo n wit te wo wo in o ono in wonin o in o on on o o wan a is er wor with milton's training or ritzar was unbeautable within a year she had taken all the amateur titles in new york she won the metros the empire states and in ninety six she won the biggest of all the golden gloves and madison square garden a fight televized around the world held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history of thought r morit sa and i get together to woch the vidio of her ninety six colding gloves win the gardens packed the crowds going wild morizzis incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring watching her you understand what it means to be a smart fighter she is calculated thut woman she is fighting is taller than she is with longer arms some moritza duck down low and jabs up to the body shoosing where she lands her ponchence to the ribs then to the chest and when her opponent can barely catch her breath moritz is up giving her a fierce combination to the face and head et goes te gas the epebet it was little of the body oh nother ot the lod the other one nother one and the last ten seconds mans and gets in a good punch straight to maritza's face moritzas stumbles back nd then seems to go crazy she throws non stocp combinations and crowdis greamin be ea e e a e e e i mrits a a ge me is wa a a wer cool oh my god you are good moritza i am i wanted i want to see you fight bad lo after the fight ends were laughing we keep rewinding to watch moritzas amazing foa e e its e e eot the wi ot we are both completely high and hysterical moritzas face is transformed this as pure joy and in a way it is terrible because we both know she is quitting boxing moritza wants to go prow but there does not seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing she is only one hundred six pounds they do not even have a name for her weight class if she went prow no one knows if any women weare good enough to matcher as it is there are only two amateure women at her level in all her title matches she is always been put up against these same two opponents over and over and she is beat them every time in ten years there may be enough women that maritza would be able to make a career of it but she is already in her thirties she says she has to be realistic about the future i youno i i get mit feelings you donwat aigt when i go in to the gim i want to do it you no when i come away from the givenis ettling a reality its gon am zat is lik a zad is o you nobody see on the outside no one's easy but e at is gul dyine its lik god it gould te she beintea boxing it is she is in love with some one she knows she has to leave she circles around boxing quitz comes back for one night stands last year milton signed her up for the metros turnament without telling her on the night of the fight he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her moritza got in her car and drove from queens to brooklyn while milton lied to the judges about moritza being stuck in traffic she arrived beat her opponent and three rounds flat but was disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to re tire that she left without even collecting her trophy but being back in the game felt too good and after that wind she just could not bring herself to walk away despite her reservations she went on to fight in the nineteen ninety seven new york gloves and of course one we e and february sjust after moritza missus the deadline for the nineteen ninety eight golden gloves i go to milton's jim to see her fight even though these days moritza is and there much any more milton has promised me that moritza will spar with a new girl he is training we wait and wait and now maritza an hour passes when she finally shows she looks worn out and tired she is not dress to box and she says she is got the flue she is nok in a fight rid away everyone starts pushing her s is ela a ai a te with me wat he need everything naa nathen she says she did not bring her shoes she does not have any of her gear milton points to some shoes lying in the corner says there her size suddenly marizza does not look tired bat i gat at tha avo malkes then maritza drops the pretense we had down in the elevator to her car turns out she is been carrying her gloves her mouth piece her wraps all of her equipment in her car for the past year just in case i is is o aaa oa a you net the biggest smiling e looks hapyrat aa batia gad thet tet a iwet ga we a te ge vey a ae ta e as i ges wa a a tecan av you it te tecand therda a ter tie teiam wi novy wa n a womingas ba is that gazy batgat she grabs her bag and we race back to the gim and as marizzis getting dressed i notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck milton stands ringside pumped up ready to see his favourite an action again bizas a go a la lat los a bit da barx wall wha she shall e woslat o sols he ji wo go meritza's stiff at first then she starts to relax she is ducking down dancing around the ring and in the last ten seconds of the fight she has a surge of energy she is punching hard moving fast throwing none stop combinations aa a and afterwards she is pumped up with a drennl and swetting laughing with milton in the guises in the gim she says she will be back to spar and train every week and even though she is missed the deadline for this years golden gloves she' swears she will take the gloves next year stake tune for nineteen ninety nine she says stay tunes but morizza does not show it milton's the next week or the week after she breaks two appointments with me she does not return my calls and whent i finally reach her she is angry angry she fought again scared she is getting suck back in and how about the fact that

canadian or not y e canadianadddoyou are in the water right now yet the canadian is a canadian soldier and the water is the canal right outside the cabo airport the only thing agml is trying to do here the whole thing is tost slog his way to within ear shot of the one canadian soldier he can see and make himself heard above the crowd agmal worked for an angio funded by the united states and now he and his family to leave him his parents and his brother there are luckier than most of the people around them because they have citizenship in another country he and his family are all canadian citizens and please picture this young canadian agmal kirk sent me a photo of him in he canal agmal is twenty seven years old pretty sure he could pass for nineteen without his gotee hes slight big glasses wearing his back pack in front of him on his chest a nervous tourist he is mediep in water on one side of the canal is a growing crowd of afgans on the other are soldiers and behind the soldiers is the path to get into the airport doyo yo d no ge ga n they canow i thay soldier's name no d de o kan waitin exactly how agmal came to be standing on a canal is hours earlier he would received in email with instructions for what to do how to get out he forwarded the email to kirk here is the emal that agmal got at three o one a m from am from the canadian government kirk read the keypart important instructions go to the baron hotel immediately all kepts do not where western styl clothing all kepts bet prepared to wait for many hours once inside go to the garden and sit under the canadian flag and wait for canadian officials bring food and water if possible that is the official process here get yourself to a hotel garden sit down under a flag do this immediately somehow bring water agml and his family had gone to the place they thought was the baron hotel but it was the wrong place no canadian officials they could see eseem to be all british people kirk to a map looking at gugomaps with the route agmal his parents and his brother needed to take through more crowds to get to the right place the canal leave or not was the right place wor as close as they were able to get the canal is next to the baron hotel and there was a canadian soldier there they could see him he had a little canadian flag on his uniform but he kept stepping away oka izhe bank you these talking the someon asser noo o ke agml is trying to get the soldier's attention because as thiy keep saying agmal is a citizen of canada he is not a supplicant he has the right papers but agmal who comes across as a cautious rule following sort of person with his face mask pulled neatly under his chin in case he is ever inside again that young man is stuck in a canal i'll be patient oord other people in this same situation might have no trouble bellowing to get some one's attention soft spoken agmal is saying excuse me excuse me canada the soldier is talking to other people theare walking even farther away agml asks her what words he should be calling out a a you when when you get an opportunity agmal o ke can our caneheme no i'm dominous ther in the line with you when when he finishes with this gi you need to say that there is a a friend of a canadian minister on the phone can you oke a friend of a canadian minister on the phone it is true kirk trew his wife is friends with a canadian member of parliament a minister who at that point was fast asleep and had no idea this was happening kirk is trying to think of anything he can tell agmal tosay to get the soldier's attention name dropping yes sure definitely a yet where is he w o ca i do not want you to just say canada i want you to say i'm a canadian citizen he does not know me he is putting trust in me i do not know him i've already pushed him to fight through the crowd and jump into the canal that was your idea to get in the canal yes by the time of that phone call that was already when he got to the back end of that crowd and saw thousands of people he said thers i cannot do this there is no i have my parents here ther we are not we cannot get to the front we are just gn ta have to try another day or or wait for you to work your connections to get the canadians to come out and and and find us and i told hem this is ot over text but is they are not there not get a come out for you you have to push through that crowd and his sister was on the thread and a couple other om people who ave have been who had been trying to to help him and they were messaging me saying go easy on him he was in the hospital last week with the panic attack he is he is you kow the rebasically saying om he is already at the breaking point but i do that if he could not get within ear shot of a canadian soldier he had there was there was nothing not knowing if he gives up to day whether or not the doors will be completely shut tomorrow and the other thing that is is wain on on me but that i'm not telling him is this dread of one rogue tollid opening fire into that crowd one i ede going off in that crowd less than twenty four hours after we talked abom was det nate outside the ar port and some one started shooting into the crowd everything came down to trying to get him in the right point on earth where his voice would be loud enough to be heard and strong enough to be liszen to you are in the right position what what do you you ok i o not you have you have to shout i'm a canadian citizen do it right now if you see them not canadian say canadian citizen you cannot just say canadian ig while you have to say canadian citizen i o n he would saying that if you have sharp ears you can hear cirk swearing under his breath all during this call hasically cursing his way through thi stress what is happening i nto a in ihe saing the crowd ors increasing ands increasing i know i know but you are in the right you are in the right position you cannot give up right now you i ii o a chow far away are they cer is groaning because he did not realize ajama was separated from his family his parents and his brother at this point even if they are not that far away right now while ajamal and kirk ar focused on connecting with this soldier if this work ajmal's family could get pushed out of sight as the crowd keeps swelling and pushing forward a bad snaria would be ajamal ends of getting out but his family stays lost in the throng on these group threads these chats kirk is following they are full of stories of family members getting separated ajml had not wanted to bring his parents on his brother into this gross canal unless it was clear they were goingto get out he said the bottom of the canal had these slippery stones and whe worried one of his parents would fall and injure themselves now there is no time for agma to break off and go get them he has to keep trying to reach this soldier you cannot lose that spot you have that you have that soldier right in front of you he is gon to come back i o you o i ot obor e you have you have to stay in that spot and wait for him to come back the fact that you just sent me that oo hadwicin a yo a call me bck as soon as he gets cose o can just in case anyone is finding there ire at this point focused on canada i wont to state the obvious and say that in the big picture this was our show the united states our plans our time line those were dictating the over all scen at the air port ajaml and kirk got back on the thrond they been at it for almost six hours do not let him go away without saying youre canadian citizen and a minister is on the fone a long minute goes by where kirk cannot tag at's happening ajamal keeps asking him please wait please wait do not dolry bout me just do not let him leave without saying what i told you another half minute ajmal is fighting off despaire the soldier is not responding to him o not a one o what did you say o are you still close to him another agonizing minute and a half and then suddenly agjama can hear me hello whois his yes whom i talking to this is kirk johnson i' served i youasade in rocked sorri can hear me i can alcat you have four canadian citizens there i'm calling on behalf of melony joli who is ta minister of economic development for canada you have for canadian citizens they were asked o to go in there right now and that they have been pushed back several times soca ae do i elog people you e i understand by i just need your assurance that theiregoing to get through because the the the one of the group is in poor health and i know that melansoly is is she s the minister is wantin she wante i did need to be able to tell the miniser that ther through ioi owl people al gamanastay in the line thank you for going that sir icishon i know i know you got your hands fo i know i'll tell them thi say out i'm grateful to you for your help sir thank you he ll get dan t i'll gat i'm unto stand i i's not clear if the canadian minister dam bit carried any sway with this soldier he mostly sounds he want to get off the phone and get back to work but agmal finally had his attention and what a frightening degree of perseverance it took agmal to get to this point where he could just hand some one his papers and even perseverance most likely would notve ben enough without luck without connections to these groups kirk and others are part of or to some one else with power how many people in the rowd around agmal had perseverance even courage but none ot for luck u ka agmal cut the i can y hear me ill cat get your family close to you kay i do not gat tell tell them to come you may have to wait a while but do not do not be separate from them now do not move where you are okay oka ikirk and i did this interview a day ind a half after this call with agmal ended and kirk was still waiting to hear if agman his family made it out then finally he got a tacx from him it came through as kirk and i were finishing up our interview he he ti he texted me i angon i my gan what they just got on a plain the agma on his family they are on a plant yes thereis one partabagmal's story that took kirk's breath away even in the retailing it was the way agml ended up finding his brother after he would made contact with the soldier because agml's family as kirk had feared had gotten lost in the crowd you do not have to have the brothers to to feel this but at my brothers are my best friends endon the way that i subsequently found out he was able to to get them was that he just called from the canal into this crowd asking his fellow afgans to to start calling his brother's name and they all started shouting it out and that is how they i found his his brother in parente and they then got into the canal from there and joined him it is im you think i wan i want o feeld i want feel proud about this and a feel this is the good story but it is just im there is much more suffering that as happened in people that are not getting through i do not want people who hear this to think that im people who are sort of discomfited by what their hearing about this who may not really be close to the situation or understand what is going on to be ohey i heard it is bad by hake are i good now this guy this has a happy ending this has a happy ending for this guy in his family and for a small percentage of the lucky few that are getting through im i i fear that word whe're not gana really see the full told of this when this is all over and we are we are just about at the end of this h ol a dis aster and at the start of something much darker i fear i fear that too nancy updike is one of the producers of e show coming ou some of our favorite stories we have run about getting out including choose your own adventure story about getting out of relationship ye shoose your own adventure on the radio somehow bhat's in a minute from chicago public radio when our programme continues it is this american life hom david castenbam in for or glass this week on her show getting out stories of people making it out of seemingly impossible situations or trying to anyway act too you can check out any time you you can never leave what ore the tings about trying to get out of an intent situation is that it can feel every little decision you make might take you down the wrong path back when she as a teaager one of our coerkers o the baker found herself in that position she 's trapped in a ho tell room with her siblings held there by a stranger what happened was their family was all staying at this mariat but there is such a big family that the parents and the oldest kid were in one room elna and the three other kids were next store in their own room there was elma was fourteen at the time julia who as ten britan who was eight and jill who was five on the was sharing a bed with her elna wh as in eigth great at the time was more or less in charge and then one night they are all sleep it is the middle the night she told the altira my memory is that if's i i saw a sliver of light which is what woke me up and the sound of the door closing and there was the feeling that there was someone standing at the foot of the bed i reached over and i turned the lamp on and there was this woman iand i she looked startled to see us and the firs thing she sadwas you are just childreng i did not expect you to be children thus pretty creeping ri what did you make of thr saying that i instantly felt this is an on thiye sittuation e describe her remember she was my mam's age she was probably in her forties and i i brown hair light kind of frompy looking somebodyofd sit next toon the bos or something did she seem menacing she seemed really distressed she was crying to she is crying she was crying ye she cried the whole time she was in she is crying and she said your children and i did not expect you to be children yet and do the other cids get up everyone is widawing i distinctly remember my little brothers a sisters faces cause their eyes were just huge but no one said anything and af they sitting up to or they just flatsto there is a lang flat li nobody mut it is what up his ots she is talking right this is how itwas was to be and and then she is also crying and she is stugging to herself iremember being very hard to follow what what she was saying and i eventually i said im i'm sorry i think you have the wrong room and she started to cry and she said i know i know ad in do this i do this i do not know why i do this and then she is i'm pacing back and forth and and kind of crying and she sits down on the bet at the foot of the bed did she seem crazier to she seem upset i mean it is interesting i was i think i'd i was too young and unfamiliar to identify what a crazy person seems no but what i could identify in that moment was that this person was unpredictable yes i go i've got to be really careful how i do this i remember feeling that pressur and in that moment very very very aware of my brothers and sisters cause they were little an that something back could happen to them and that the way that it was not going to happen to them was me there were kno adults there i think it was the first situation i was ever in where there was you could not defer to some one else to to keep you safe for tell you what to do and what do i do and it had that quality of lik time slows down in your kind of your there but you are al watching and the then i did the mass in my head and i was oquet i have a couple options they are i cry for help scream butd i do not think anyone will here am that remember looking how far away the phone was from me and i realize i can reach and grab the phone and i could call for help or an even lie if i could knock on the door where my sister was sister in the connecting witm next door i could at least they would know something was happening in here and they could get to us in time you but all of that felt m li can escalation i would provoke her and what can i do to not provoke her can a play up the fact that were children an dam what i felt i needed to do was i needed to calm her down and become herfriend and if i could become her friend she would leave and she would not hurt us i get her to see you was a person make her think i was on her side cause i it did not feel she dn't see us as people it just felt em it felt dangerous nd i did not understand why and i felt the key to being safe was slowing everything down and i remember saying i'm really sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry 'm here i'm sorry 'm doing this i'm sorry and i do not remember this but my brother remembers that what she said was i'm sorry girls i'm sorry girls and that his whole memory of this night was justping i'm a boy do mad am i ask her i said am are you oquet is everything oquet and that is she kept me na going on about how her night was hard and i was i'm sorry that sounds herly really difficult i as you troing to prefrend her ye this me trying to befriend her but it is reat i feel i was hiper alert till i e if i can understand what is going on with her i can help sall tit but i could not understand cause it did not make any sense did you feel sorry for i felt concerned for her and im and then she took out her purse and as she reached into her person then she gripped on to something and i remember thinking oh no wet the wav a thotlike its a goners or i gon or a night for something i re my heart just dropping and then she pulled out a hair brush and then she just started brushing her hair gat the foot of my bed well and a and at that point i was this is really weird tinsis later a an a do not think she is gon ta lea and then i'm she sat on the vanity in front of the merroer at the desk and she took her ear rings off and oel and she started take shook her shoes off se took her coat off she was just ellya making herself comfortable till i be here now and i let her do all that im an was sort of listening to her go on about what was wrong and then eventually after i fell enough time had passed i said i'm we am we have to wake up early to go to school to morrow and we are really tired i think wwe should proably go back to bed now and shee is i know i no i'm sorry im sorry i'm sorry i'm here i'm here i'msir i'm here and i said i' now it is is tolly finatley are here almost cing to think you reing here but i'm do you mind a leaving now and i very slowly stood up and walked over to the door and every moment was making sureer safe and then i open the door and she said qetouqet and she put her shoes on and then she started to leave and just as she was about to leave i said oh you forgot your earrings and then she was started crying all over again itwas this huge thing waked over to get the earring and then sat backe down on the bed and i remember thinking why it i bringing up ti ear an a wer clote to being safe then a then the whole thing li base gle holding started all over again where i had tolike listen to her cry calm her down and then finally i'm im ou know we have to wake up early to go to school do you min leaving and i walked her to the door and a she walked out of the door and as soon as she was out of the oor i just slike push the door as hard as i could to close it an when i push day tasily li slammed at shat she screamed at the top of her lungs and is dere a bolt or something on the door i think i di boltit after i slammed a shell and then i heard her screaming in the hallway and then she ran down the hallway screaming and she ran back towards the door screaming and a tha must men to her e f i was itscarry and then then i got was

greate he is having a harder time finding his place in mddle school than other middle school kids because he was new to town but also because leo still loved rochester he loved his school there he loved his friends suddenly everything about his life was different and according to leo much worse the signature on his gemale account now red rochester is much better in big red letters saricanagh knows leo and his parents she visited them at home to see ow leo was doing this is how much lo does not want to be here when i got to his house he was on the sofa with a laptop investigating greyhound busskeduls his mother was goin o drive him and his sister back to rochester for the columbus day week end but not until saturday morning and leo wone to get there friday for more time with his friends a multy statio negotiation followed with his dad for one thing i bust tick at cost money ahr that is not a problem no veo knon o asn' no but teis here is not why it not six ifty in morning and you on in is clon friday the bustics eight hours even if you left a noon you heid hakin to thema it is excellent never mind that the bst takes twice as long his driving and never mind that leo would be alone and have to change busses and the is parents had no intention of letting him go through with his plan but is the kind of negotiation you indulge when your kid is miserable and leo is miserable he told me right away he was and that he had been from the moment he got here in august is this the first time you have in your life where you have felt you have been sad about something for this long i think sto exipt for ma te other cat die may ood cat it is this feel worse than that yes yovead long peres is head an till now o now i do not know any on heare really and i think it just everything hi general wants overwhelming o back in rochester leo had known all his best friends since kindergarden or before they played together at school after school on wee k ends everybody knew everybody everything was comfortable hand is thi six grater in his old school he and his friends were at the top of the heap they wore green sashes in the morning and got to be door monitors for the younger kids coming into the building imagine now leo takes a school bus for the first time to his new school a sprawling one story building full of six seventh an eighth greaters leo small for his age only a hair taller than his sister whos only nine years old on day one he knows exactly no one who as much louder than my old school much louder people talking people closing and opening lockers people walking is us noise is older kids more kids because an milds coos tiny leo is between he is old enough to decipeer greyhound buscedules but not old enough to actually travel on one by himself and old enough to know that if he is gen a survive in middle school he has to make friends but then making those friends stands to be significantly more complicated than it was back in rochester leofs sister aught in is not forthgrat he says she is not having his heart a time of it she is him ben alive as long she has not made as deep connections an she art he met some a friend in criscol i think is easier to make friends and and the mi his clothe in in midlescool o really why because people care less about you are what you mean by that the old days get the moreye judgemeope on there woks their back round there how they act i what cool is for a kids because he kindrgarton he could walk up to someone in say he want to be my friend an din then that would be at bit it is harder o i just think people an more wary before they o can not they ion first grate i if i met someone i would not realy care they were oujes care if they were nice er nou the day i interviewed him leode had a couple of break through he ye mailed his parents during the school day to tell them the first piece of good news they would had from him until that day that emales had mostly been three desperate words i feel awful without even a period at the end to make the feeling finite was an endless awful but on this thursday he wrote to tell them the mash potatoes they servang the cafateria were great followed by four exclamation points second and this was the big news he asked another kid if he wanted to come over leo told me he thought about it first for a few days than finally emailed the boy hos name is devon another seventh greater but now leo did not want a call devon's house to final as a plan he dreaded the awkwardness of the phone his dad called devon's parents introduced himself was leofs father he goes to school with your son evon and we were a devon i'm sorry devon i'm pey m evil look for mys that i boudays but were hopin devon can come over on sunday thinks i ca en i bea no well ei

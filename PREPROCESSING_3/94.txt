war in israel continues as more updates are flowing out an getting information on nearly a minute by minute basis at the fond a bring to you what i have as it comes in overnight bodies more than fifteen hundred terrace ad ben found inside of israel's borders it wase unclear at the very beginning on on friday night saturday to wase unclear exactly howmany terrace had entered israel to beginning there ware a lot of talks about few dozen it turns out that it was at least fifteen hundred terrace who ad broke in through the israely border fence surrounding the gozi strip and the way that tey did this was sophisticated it was obviously back by ron it takes tremendous sophistication do it they did tisrael had built this twenty foot high border fence around the gozi tripus considered well nigh impermiable it had touch censers it had drones it had all sorts of material around it that made it very difficult to breach apparently comas came up with way to do it in in technologically sophisticated fashion they ucibra attacks these drones of their own to blow up the actual censer towers they then drove bulldoszers through the fence and fifteen hundred terrace at a minnimum broke into the state of israel and promptly engaged in the worst massacar of jews since the holicos the numbers as of this moment are approaching one thousan dead jews probably an access of one thousand dead jews at this point this was not a military operation many real sense of the termat military is where einsat's grupin natzies were literally driving up to differenc is railly villages these are not settlements when here settlement settlements typiclar for t people who are in the west bank tu dantimaria it is completely different scussion these are people were just living in villages living in kibutsim they re very close to the gossi border these nosies drove up they literally just mowe down civilians kidnaped civilians brought them back to the gozis trip according to the times of israel the israel defence forces that it hid finally regain control over its suddenly porisbord with the gozistrip on tuesday morning seventy to hours after commos terras blew through sections of barrier and launched invasion that is all one thousand israelies slaughtered or kidnapd as israel continues to grapple with the enormity of saturdays massacres and military was formally notifying hosges families that t e loved ones were being helding goza air force plans bombarted wide swaves of the strip morenmore vidyo is emerging at this point of exactly how terras broke in to the varios kibutsim and and various towns that are surrounding the gozi trip thas known as the gosa envelope here for example is avidio of comas terras who ambush people as they were attempting to drive in to one of these one of these kibutsim ther standing outside the fence as you can see in this par ticular vidio and ta theyre waiting for some one to approach this this thick iron fence ithing ma attempting to crawl underneath and then you will see that hey're going to ambush acar as it drives up and allaligate and allas the gate to to open they then proceeded to go in to this particular area and murder as many jews as they could when most horrifying discoveries yesterday ise over a hundred dead bodies in one of these acubusima place called kibutzbari you can see that the car arrives door the the gape bigins to open he terris come and the murdero the civilians they shoot them and tam and then they break in to the a the kibuts this is i've said is what bat terrorism looks is what evil looks they came to murder i have friends wheare down there at te the border of of the gosa trip right now in some of these places stetrot is he not that ther running rough shod through the area my m my my friends we are down at the border our senting me vidio one of the pieces of idio that was sent to me for my friend shows one of the comoss trucks it was a still laden with guns in ammunition in the back here is lotle bit of the vidiallo narrated for you ou see thi is a a a terror truck you see that it is still laden with guns and ammunition backs of guns said ammunition on the ground theire arabic writings o those those arabic writings or pamphlets distributed by comos about the aslomic rules of war talk about what you can do to women what you can do to children and and all of the rest the pictures thet've now emerged from kubuts borry are absolutely horrifying as you amattion over a hundred dead people found in just that one kubuts alone which makes that the second grate sight of death in israel they the first grated sight of death an israel a whas a was the the massacr at this e di m electrunk dance music music festival he was berry in southern israel they found more than one hundred bodies there and a again the the pictures are horrifying stacks and stacks of body back body backs of children in here is a picture of of what it looks when you have to body bag a small trild because this is what this is what they do that is ay baby it is being body baged an intag by a a state worker in israel it is that is not the only small body back there their other children in body bacgs right there because this is the worst that humanity has to offer that o from as is they are the worst that humentity has to offer the situation there ise bad that because parents and chilldrene' killed together and because the bodies were in many cases mutilated or obliterated beyond recognition israel has been using deana to match up babies here is a tragings to fox news explaining the ansers will come the light in in becoming days n some cases theres senter set up here in israel for families where they can give names an iven gan eh and wen you watch thes grately pracsed at night you se senes of parents show me up to t it is a it is difficult yah but tha parent show me up to te get hair of the kit a to the authorities s if thet can match the a bodies ya just r i'm that sam the situation over in israel again more and more vidios emerging and there will be soon i am shure fresh vidios vetrocities commited by comas a they are theyare the nasies bour time in some ways they are worse than the naties which is nearly impossible to say about any human being thenasi's mechanized murder comms openly celebrates it when the when the allies were approaching near the end of world word too the natsies attempted to cover up their o natrocities in this particular case they celebrated put it on social media cand candies to their children fire guns in the aire while celebrating it here is am some footage of of what looks when youre these at this footage that was from the electronic dance music festival thit was taking place near the gosbor commas terras were literally standing on the road waiting for people to drive up an the they were just shooting them here is vidio from dash cam a a o one of those situations hes are people attempting to escape the masker this happening at the elant electronic dance festival you see homs terris literally just standing out in the middle of the road and as this person slows down hes jus going to start firing through the wind shield and the in continuing to fire on the car and till the car i enza being put out of commission everyone inside presumably murdered more body canvidio has has emerged also and look ot any terrors that is mins an normous number of terrase everyone inside that car is obviously dead at this point in the vidiosa crashes and this is body canvidio of comas entering cu boots t cissufim this is a them shootng a dog a dog attempts to protect the citizens and they the they kill the dog and then they proceed to walk into the rest o the cubuts and murder everyone ywy they go through the a refriterators obvious the make sure the theym have slaked their thirst and then they set fire to the to the cubuts the purpose of setting fire to the cubuts is to drive all of the civilians out from their homes where the can then shoot them in the streets this is this is what comas is understand anybody who wran now is claiming moral equivalent anybody who is claiming both side t as manybodywho is cloing for a sees firor part o the problem the par the probem this is who youre standing for these are the people you are pretending are worthy of having a conversation with these are those people this is who they are theyre showing it to you they filmed these vidios they put these viios homline this footage was not put on line by forces there are anticamas it is were put oon by camas this is part and parcel of what they are what they want what they do there is more dashboard camera footage a vam commas murdering people here is comas they were u theyre people who are in a shelter underground cmmas figues out their people in the shelter and they promptly throw grenade directly into these shelter underground can see ther's coms terroris wos standing there ye he pulls the grenade pin throws it into the shelter to kill everybody inside resumably that and then when peop le run out they a they gon them down we see these the worse sene since the hollicostorges these the orstines since the holicosprages then we bring u the the issue of the hostages there now it is unclear hummin hostages are being held at this point we know that some people whoare considered to be hostages are are now dad the washington post yesterday broke vidio showing that many of the hostages never made at to gossa you can see this is out woman and a an middle age people or elderly people thats hostage number one hostage omer to another woman these ur just people who are supposedly being cinnapped is hostage number four hostage nmber thre these are these are middle age for elderly people and then as comastripes way you can see their bodies stacked on the groun i because cams has shopd them before taking off for the gossistrip those were not hostages they were just murder victims there is people whoere massacred for the crime of breathing and being jews the m pictures of hostages are now emerging the the to days can be filled with awful vidio because comas has threatened and presume will make good on its threats to behead hostages in return for israel retaliating gainst comasen attempting to depose kamas from its vicious tyranny in in the gossisrip apparently schools in israel are telling parents to remove tik tok and instogram aps from their children's phones tbecause vidios of hostages begging for their lives are soon going to be released by hamas instheir asking this is what comastas the the torture people in the murder them and then they attempt put it on the the phones of the children of israel tis is what they attempt to do agand it is hard to describe scum of the earth that there are no ther are no words in english for t they really are not i here is a picture of one of the hostages who is being held one of the things tha youwill notice here are the sand bags i here the sandbags underneat the hostage and those sandbags say the people of japan and for free distribution for palsinian refuges because a that that is the way that that aid typically works in the gossistrip hamas the hundreds million dollars the merica's poured into that area that has been going for hamasto pay for rockets and pay for terrist equipments and to equip it is terrus and a and now to take that rain use it whatever theire using for and reuse the bags the tack par money of japan a breuse those bags for sandbags that they can use a in to em to commit acts of evil is one of the people who is awaiting his dath for certain here is one israily mother describing her kinapp children entire families were kidnapped frendamic mind michaelisenburg whos a tack s yo in israel has talked about the facts that that other people that thet are members of his company the have had entire families cousins who were takeng away families with multiple children takin to the gosis strip presumably to be murdered or already dad here is one mother explaining o herr her children wore kidnapped she her sister was cinnappes with the children she somehow escaped and here to us describing the situation ebo t she thinshi hidden the closet a baa terr is broke in my house lone we hid in the closet an putitsuitede they blew ted the door eta butimcherfuma our neihbor was murdered they took

terrorises sholders anthen sept screaming he wanted down i shall was on me and those of those people are all on being held captive right now meanwhiles i say hamas is threatening to execute all of those civilians do not worry gis to say it is istrust a cycle of iolence do not you see it is just moral equivalence it' us moral equivalence ill come oss tos threatening to execute all of those civilian hosages even th anderson cooper of sianan when struggling to speak after ins rayle women made a heroin cley for her kidnapp children again i these are these are mothers who are crying out because their children have been stolen from them and take into the gos ta strucp where they are presumably to be murdered or terrace will hide behind them and understand that if is ral goes in and tries to kill comma's terrace in tese children's eye that is solely the fault of comans when you hide behind a child that makes you a coward it makes you a a piece of human de bri ye youre the worst that they they there again i very rarily struggle for words there there are no words for these kinds vatrocities and here is ame other begging for her her children mem aa we a eaeaean a a o oe mo you kno that is a anderson cooper eing unable to respon as any normal human being wood this is what commasays this what evil is sing hv as evil is old iis in jerusulen corse nig totoss amwa his not just issued in you threaden calvings tgoin hossiges can you talk about that som after thirty years of attempting to negotiate with palistonian terroris and after thirty years of making concessions to them and after fifteen years of handing over the entire gosistrip to the tender mercies of comass and giving them eight and pretending that there is a peace process and pretending ot these people were anything but human tebri the leadership of comas the staffing of commas the the government of commas this is the result this is the result evil must be eradicated it cannot be dealt with it cannot be negotiated with there cannot be a sease fire these people have to be driven six feet under they need to be dead tatis the only solution to true evile and ta the world is finding that out to day israelis finding that oubt to day as well obviously the funerals were being held throughut the state of israel again a thousand dead in the state of israel thos numbers that the're horrible enough not a thousand dad in in one day is horrible enough in locations oll over israel i i always hesitate to do proportionality in terms of numbers because again on human life is he human life but just to suggest the impacts on the state of israel of those sorts of numbers proportionality is sometimes usefel a thousand jews murdered in one day in israel in a country that has ben nine million juws remember tht the united states to america has about three hundred forty million people to to tryin do that math what you are really talking about is approximately thirty six thousand people if they were killed in a day in the united states in multipilocations around around the united states it is it is the greatest catastroph for juws have mentioned before since the holicoss without without any sort of doubt om but commass was not finished as the as funeraels we are taking place for people whav ben killed virtually a huge number te people are young people israels a very young country the elderly work at nap the elderly wore killed but a huge number of these people are children or at the very least they are young people seventeen eighteen nineteen ears old many the people serving the military a israel the draught begins when you are when you are seventeeneighten yearsael on the m rockets were be it were being fired overhead as they were attempting to bury their dead this is this o the way that commass operates thit is by the way is what it towns when the a when the rockants go off the sirons go off ands i ever made ducts for cover i know for my friends who are where the're right now the severans are going off all over israelthe bengoing off in the north because casblos will get to injust a moment has been threatening to come into the war on israel's northern word whic e the worst mistake tever made i ther the rockets been fired into ashkalon into ashto these recities that are there near the coast in israel or on the coast in israel just north of the gassaborder in fired inland tor bechemash the sirens gone off in jerusalem which is actually a significant of distance from the gossip strip i am my inlaws are ar in israel right now and my inlaws were in whats alled the mama the mamadesay is a safe room that basically has no windows the there in israel ther stockin safe room on saturday for eleven hours that that is not ararity that is very very normal under circumstances this and unless you believe that theare palestonian moderates wo are ready to negotiate lest you believe that the palcinan authority is differente in any market way from commaser that palcinias lonici had is different any market way i here is just reminder that the the same people who did what they did withegote a commas were considered the world's peace partners for israel for decades here is the andry mitthel talking with a former pialospokes person the palstin liberation organization whih was gaser arfot's terro group thatwas then legitimized by the world and turned into legitimate group calld th palcinian authority they refuse comment on palston in terrism on comasterrism thes of course they do becaus they' been complicit in that terrorism for for decades at this point to weact to this trat from hemastow to traten to execute passageis woi t women n children the alderla we are taken from their hones if theyare any were i aratac ante this is the this is the pobenis that i do not thik thet this is poi is poper political contac this is an justo aar this is acthaan occupation that is gon an au for fifty six years wat what a is rallyis er cipob o er contact sa the pass fortyg hours is what palcidians hav been living through over the course of the past fifty six years but does that cas extraordinary lag out of their hones of all ages were not talking about military people wee tween that civilians children an elderly people men and women and taking them ito gasa and fegtning to execupe them ga anter aate wa istoinis socin ma mais aste camantadetisisin a yoe a toldy different place what a you want people to understand is what liei the gassiss she is the gosistre yau wat te fifty cris tht of the iblo monsters its justifying you justifying is behavioris monstrous as it is up to you don den it of course it is up to you to condemn it the of course dup to you to conten it of course it is you you been working han in gloicomma for years ye the palsinian authority uses american taxpar money to funterrorism in defiance of the tail of forsact which is american legislation barring palcin an authority from doig that palcinan authorityes still has actual rewards for terrorous families they signd checs to terrors families oy mayre who is the edtor of the jerusalem post ye he is now tweating out the stories from it is southern israel get worst by the hour a woman found murdered with the feedist next to her still attached to its humbilical cord in elderly women's an elderly woman found to pull o blood her body riddled with bulled holes entire families found burned to death in their homes the cot right now at this hour there is constant barache i in tell of eve i tell of vev of course is the is the mos populous city in israel a comas has been beheading babies a this is tab the atrocities are are extraordinary kip wit is far oza which is quarter mile from the gossip boarder i is still an active scene because come os booby traps the entire area and again there reports that that comass literally beheaded babies they have found the bodies of a forty babies apparently is than they 've now found th bodis of forty babies that that is breaking news right at this moment a that they 've found the bodies of forty babies that comas beheaded and comuss be headed this is tam this is its is who they are when people show you how evil they are then na i'm nofm not sure what exactly its supposed to be said beyond that anybody pretending that there is moral equivalence i have set it again also elsaid said ie said beforl said again any one pretending moral equivalence is in emissary o falsehood is a lier is a lyer and anyone who pretends that israel has beendoing anything remotely this with regard to the called occupation is a lyer as well israels does not be had babies israels is not drag what women back to its side of the border and hold them hostage after raping them and murdering them i mean that tht is not this is not what they incisnt no one does this no one does this except for the world's most evil people coms and its supporters and a there is blood on the hands of people who ave spent the last twenty thirty years defending terrorism in the called name of peas israel is now responded benjaminit is nowwho the priminister of israel he says that israel is not in themiddle of an an operation israel is in fact at war which of course istrael israel is it war we did not want the swor it was forse upon us in the most brutal and savage way but theways well did not start the wor israel with finishen ance the jewish people were stateless ance he jewish people were defenseless no longer comaswel understand and by a cacking us they have made em i stake of testoric proportions we will exact uplace hat will be remembered by them and israels other enemies for that case to comethe savage a cact the comas prepecated against in hist i is ralies an mind boglen slautering families in their homes masicing hundreds of young people and not tor pestaple kinnipping scores of women children and elderly even hollocos of ens homaste is upon bun and executed children they are savages there is no modern compare there there is no comp there is no comp im and homas por its partis at has suppo ars around the world as you will see because evil never sleeps thankfully neither does the justice of of god i'm israel has taken measures already its first measure was to cut off the wateran electricity to the gosseps trip one of the reasons for this as you do not provide actual resources to your enemies the o the other thing is that israel is attempting to move civilians out of many of these areas when ou cut off the water and power that is an inducement to civilian populations to move out of these areas israe has been senting text messages to civilians in the gossestrip telling them to get out israel has been letting every one know the aradio via whatever methods they can hif you are civilians should get out of the area them entelling hem to move toward the southern bords war the rafa crossing with egypt egypt for its part doing great humanitarian work has decided not to open that border and allow any of those refugees to enter into egypt just remember whenever you heare about the supposed etrocities perpetrated by theisrailies understand the airb world has refused for seventy pluss years to take in any palistinian refugees they have instead decided to use them as political too the civilians in gaza who by the way voted for ckomas into thousend six to thasen seven and commas enjoys still significant popular support in the gosseps trip by every valblepole those civilians israel is taking care not to kill them as much cares they possibly can taktib an inducing people to move away from the most populated areas of the gossep strip and toward less populous areas o the gosses trp move toward the south move toward less military occupied areas and they are be encourage the cvilians by komas to state precisely where they are s that if israel kills komas members they also are can be forced to kill civilians which is a war crime the entire purpose of the guniva conventions is to keep people in uniform to keep soldier soldiers terrorism is by definition in act of a trocity that involves in thet volves civilians if you hide behind a civilian you are the person responsible for the death of that civilian and thts ro komastas komas literally located its military headqurts at the bottom of they hospital this is what tey are they locate theire their headquarters in mosques they they hide weapon cashes cashes in in churches and maques specificallies that if israel has to blow those things up then they can claim that it some sort of human rice vilition this is what they do they understand how the western press pleas this garbage they understand the western press pretends that there is some sort of moral equivalence between a comas terroris driving in to a cuboots and beheading a child and israel attempting to minnamis civilian casualties in the gosestrip and failing because komas is hiding ehind children commases toblame for both of those civilian casualties comms es actively encouraging people not to move from these areas right now you see bomstropping on gaza understand israel i mean i've seen vidio of it i i've see i literally know this fra fact israel has called off strikes multa over the course lasst thirty years uncount uncounted strikes israel has called off because there are civilians in the area israel can not be held hostage by the ability of komas to use civilians as human shields ceres wha look estra an israel is bombing gaza one o the things that fascinating about the vidios what you will see in secondary explosions secondar explosions only emerge if there is a weapons cash underneath thivildins because israel et the building the will be an explosion and then there will be an insentiary that sets off the rest ofthe weapons cash explosives underneath the building can see that clearly in the invidials this one to israel hits the building and then as hegan snvidia ther secondary explosions the secondary explosions our result of weapons being hidden beneath the ground which is again what done the palsinian authority commas is lonacyo how this is what they do the israely defenceminister yesterday talked about a seige on gosa this of course was seized upon by the left laying to plaing that this a human rized violation know this called the siege when you arethe midle of a war you do not continue to supply electricity and water to the people who have just murdered one thousandof your citizens if you do your a fool heresraelof galan ties the defence minister in israel the wa febim te we are inpeseia complete siege gose theyeill be no electricisi e fu e e fueld everything will be closed beasua animals on weordnly that is correct that is obviously correct raping women beheading children human animals is is a prego description the question now is how far this conflict is going to broaden the united states did something excellent yesterday we moved in aircraft carrier into the mediterranean off the coast of lebanon and essentially threatened that cusbala should not make the wrong decision of opening up ta second front against israel in the iddle of this commossas the aroneaback tarro group in the gosestrip cosbal is the aroniaback tarro group in the north of israel on southern border of lebanon theyhave turned the roads of th middle east barout into an absolute trashy becaue this what aron das awron is a cancer and they have theyve now permeated there their canceross tentacles around he mittle east cosbala is a heavily armed terror group they hae at least a hundred and fifty thousand very sophisticateor rock is pointed the state of israel should they get into the war israel l will be forced to unleash the full might and power of atst air force america's also trying to this way husbala from getting intothe war largely bcause america has a very strong intrist in this not broadening into a reginal war because if israel is forced to face down lebanon in the north husbl on the north syria in its in its northeast and then prism bliaron it self this going t asclay very very quickly an israel is prepared to take all those steps if it falls under attack from those borers america is using piece through strength here as well it should according to barons the us announced the decision on the strike group which includes an aircraft carrier another worships on sunday a day after comossmilitant's launchoand on precedent an multiprong attack on israels southern flank israel hasbelat have tradedts on fire this weep t they have stopped short of the devastating fullscale war they fought intwo thousand secs again israel is stretched thin israel is not a large contry and if israel is forced to it the one thing israel dos have i the air superiority israel has not used tits their superior where you seing from goza is targeted strikes if if cosblaget tin those will not be targeted strikes if csbalagetsan israel unlawn will unleesh the af sixteens and the the southern border of lebanon will be a park gla becaus the're not can have any other choice the when when you are militarily stretched to your limits at that point survival is the only thing the matters and you cannot be stretched to the point where you have a two front war in which it is your job too to try and separate the wheat from the chaff in themiddle of an excistential crisis that that secon front in lebanan i think is unlikely to open specifically because of this there is talk about casballa getting more heavily involved i'm there've been a few gon men whohave been attempting to inful trate in the north again i think that is more as an attempt to draw resources north in israel and away from the gossis strip at i do not think that cusbela wants a full skall war if they did as they say would be the worst mistake gever made that the the great ironingof the situation is that for both commas and husballaw the the great in sure of their own survival is the fact that israel is technologically sophisticated that the the the only reason that commassas existed to this point is because their rockets did not work it is because irondom was sufficient well when they edged around that and killed te thousand is railly civilians at that point the gloves are off and israel is going to have to engage in a long protracted slog through the gossestrip attempting to avoids villing casualties as best they can and the wess had better get ready for ugly images coming out of gaza all the fault of commass it is a tragedy when ant gasen civilian is killed and that is the fault of commass it is the fault of commass and the the medias attempt to draw moral aquilentrishall undoubtedly be unleisure of the course he next forty eight seventy two hours is discusting is discusting the is the difference between the man who ise trying to protect his child andthe man put hizown child in front of him in order to murder the other man's child comas is the latter and israel is the former the washington postes out con firm reports that eran was in fact behind this attack the walster jernal reported tat yesterday the bide administration in a pathetic attempt to cover its on ass for it is prior negotiations with with the aranian regime and its turn over of billions of dollars to the arranun regime try to pretend thet aron was not involvt clearly it was this is too technologically sophisticated and commass never would launch anything this we vat aranian permission considering their client state of the aranian government according to the washington post whele ron's precise rall and saturday's violence remaind unclear the assault reflected taron's years long ambitions surround israe oth legions of paramilitary fighters armed with increasingly sophisticate a weapon systems capable of striking deep inside the jewish state commass the gospates talstinian militants organization that lead the attack has astorically maintained to grieve in dependence from taharan but in recent years cmmss has benefited from mass iv th infusions of eranian cash as whellst technical help for manufacturing rockets an drones with advanced guidan systems some of which occurred in camps outside of gasa in fact there is information merging that in gossa they bilt an entire fake is raily town and they would been stage in prep for something this for quite some time current in former intelligence official save the assault bore hommarks of rodian support and noted tha officials in taheran have boasted publicly about the huge sums in military aid provided to comas in recent years will tess thing broughten out i think unlikely to broten out further from where it is unlet unless cusballa makes a cruchal mis stake here i'm but suffice it to say that now that this is happene no ho moss associated person anywhere on earth should feel safe israls a very long history of killing its enemies in farflong places and israel will not sleep until the leaders of commoserdad and that they should not pretenment that being in cataris any sort of protection for the meanwhile the e u has reverse in announcement that it made suspending aid the palstinians originally when this capin they came out and they said that they would reverse aid to the palstinians they would not be giving them hundreds of millings of dollars for esen terrism and the e u has been extraordinarily supportive of palistinian terrorism for a significant period of time flying in officials to pretend that there is moral equivalence to pretend that was all about israel' called occupation of the gosestrip despite the fact that again the gasstrip has not had a jewish foot on it since sudausan and sec a since saturday according toabes he news support of the twenty seven nation block for isrel had been steadfast including that the country had every right withan international loto defend itself in the war with comosme now they have reversed themselves he said there will be no suspension of payments the u forn policy chief aperson in jose brow criticized the e u in sisting the suspension of payments would have damaged ou interest in the region and would have only further embolden terras yes it is it clearly giving the money is th is the way to to dissuade terrorists the eu says been the biggest owner to the palistinians ahas been advocating for years for the two state approach that is completely dad at this point it is thad because you cannot havei two state solution in which one of the states oncs to eradicate out of existence the other state israel's handed land over if any resources over again it is it is worth noting here that israel was providing free waternelectricity to the gosa strip for years on end germany is not suspending humanitarian add provides separately the international non governmental organization and the uan leave it to th europeans to continue funding terror groups throughout the region meanwhile the un human rihtes council observed a moments of silence for the death of palistinian civilians because the un is as i had said before the most icoly of international politics they are desplicable and vile and they are filled with islamic an is lomist countries let support the death of jews to her is the human rihtes council which again includes such wonderful players in human rightes as pacastan in the asudan and rhon and there

the bin garbage since the beginning the are even more garbage now we will get to a more of the bad guises in one second because there rallies held all around the world in favor of the in favor of comas o firbet but credit were creditors do the leaders of france trumy italy uk an youass releasta joint statement wiell to day we pres him ma crown of france chanceler shols of germany or mister malony of italy or mister soonac of the uka and presen bitin of the united states express our steadfast and uniteed supports to the state of israel and our unequivocal contemnation of comas and its appalling acts of terrorism we make clear that the terrace actions of omass have no justi fication to legitimacy and must be universally condemnd there is never any justification for terrorism in recent days the world is watch an horror as comss terrase mastcrd families in their home slaughter over two hundred young people en joying a music festival and kidnap t elderly women children and entire families are now being held as hostages our countries will support israel in ous efforts to defend itself and its people against such a trocities we further emphasize this not a momen frendy parety hostile to israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage all mus recognize legitima aspirations of palstini an people an support equal messures of justice and freedom for israilies and palistonins alike but make no mistake cmas oes not represent those aspirations and it offers nothing for the palstnian people other thand more terror and bloodshed i mean obviously igruwat that i wish that a lot palstinians agreed with that considering ha the elected comas and comases continued to rule the gossestript continuously since soe thasent sec over the coming days wel remain united and co ordinated together is allies and as common friends over israel to ensure israels able to defend itself an altimately set the conditions for a peaceful and integrated middle east region that of course is not the go of the re on richi soonac the priminister of the united king dom he give spech yesterday thoas quite excellent here he was yesterday i wanted to come here to niht to stand with you tos time with you in this hour of grief as we mon the victims of an utly o born act of terro tos time with you in this hour of prayer as we think of those held hostage and your friends an love lons taking refuge in bom sheltes a risking their lives on the frontmont and perhaps above all i wanted to come here to night to stand with you in solidarty and israils our ome as the primenits thrugh of this country i am unequivocal the people te support haomas ar fully responsible to this appolling attact they are not minitance they are not freedom fintes they are terros than of course is true and moral clarity is necessary at this point in time considering how much lack there has been for decades at this point in in the city of london there is a mass ralley and favor of commasier some of the foot ed yesterday cmasigan has called for mas rallies all over the world in favor of their terrors totrocities you see masses of people who are who are waving palcinian comass flags very large group of people walkingthroug n beay you should remember and if you live in a major western city thatheye are people who actively favor comass live in your city im many of them many of them on which a should say something about emmigration palsy generally at the cidney opera house a sidney tried to pay tributes to the state of israel by shining blue and white lights on the cine opera house instead a bonchoem pro comas terror supporters showed up by the hundreds with palsinian flags and they began chanting gas the jews just in case you in case you are unaware of their actual agenda in case you thught on' know these i just people we are looking for a vible to sate solution there they are shouting gas the jews that is that the cidny opera house sir if you have let these people into your country an i would recommend that you make provisions o for your own safety e cis a these teire terrscores they are flying right there some them look te flying isel flags notice that they are ot shouting anythin about his ralies they are shouting they'r shuting out the jews because again antisianism is a cheap cover for hatred of jews and the wish to destroy as many jews as possible and kill them and meanwhile on the american domestic political front the american people's vast ignorance of these subjects is demonstrating it self in polling data theve been kept ignorant something onfall tem kept ignorant by mmedia that lies routinely about moral equivalence there is also an enormous political movement in the united states that is far to the left and a and supports terrorism in ways both soft and hard a new yu gov pole asks very simple question do you think that commass is deliberately striking is railly civillians not actively avoiding striking is rally svillianareas are a tempting to avoid striking is railly civilian areas fifty three per cent of americans say that comases deliberately striking civillian areas thirteen per cent say that theyare not actively avoiding striking is rally csvillianareas six per cent only say that that theyare tempting to avoid striking is rallysvillianairs while this is not a question tht is up for to bate they are clearly deliberately striking s is raemmin that that is the entire story here they literally went in to towns and murdered babies this is what they did there is ot a qu that should be one hundredpercent question fifty three per cent say tht's for their doing thirteen percents whell lite kind of doing it s by accident moral less thirteen persent six per cent said that they are actually trying not to kill is rally civillians which is amazing because they somehow landed on killing a thousand of them and that twenty eight per cent if theywere not shore twenty percent butt where those statistics begin to go insane is in the age brackets and this the reflection of politics young people in america have been twisted and sceed by the educational system in the media into believing absolute lies and falsehoods absolute agregious lies an i moral e falsehoods in the group eighteen to twenty nine only thirty two per cent of americans said that comas was deliberately striking as raly cilianareas twenty one per cent said that they were not actively avoiding striking isrally civilianareas eleven per cent said they were attempting to avoid striking israly civilianareas thirty five per cents of the were notshore only one third of people eighteen twenty nine could say the commossas targoning civilians that is a blot on the media becase the media are liers and theyv been lying for years drawing moral equivalence between people o are murderers and terroris and genicital maniacs and people attempting to protect their own children and to avoids villin casualties on th other side by the way whn yu loo to pulling numbers on the other side do you think israel is deliberately striking palistnian civilian areas twenty nine per cent sa yes not actively avoiding striking palistinin civilianareas nineteen per cent say yes attempting to avoid striking palistinan civilianareas only twenty per cents ay yes israel it has a long standing policy it is called taharatanechic they put their own soldiers at risk in order do not strike civilians when you look at the age break down there and if youok ta political break down this is insane the political break down suggests per cent of democrats who believe that israel is deliberately striking palistinian civilianareas they want kilcivilians is their idea thirty four per cent of democrats tat's a plurality of democrats say that israels deliberately striking palistinianareas only thirteen per cent that says that israels attempting to avoid striking civilianareas the democratic party is in a state of moral collapse it has been n a state of moral collapse for a very long time he can stey wult every one to say about the republican party i have my hon criticisms that have mad very apparent over the course of my entire career their inability their stupidity their fractuousness the fact that they cannot seem to put together two in two but the fact is that thei re publican party bays at least understands basic politics thirty two per cent say that israel is attempting to avoid striking palistinian civilian areas a plurality precisely the revers among democrats just amazing stuff amazing stuff theire fromma from democrats in the b and and young people that that that is going exstremely while and and of porse a lot of that is led by some of our most intellectually luminous members of congress people elhin omar do hater extrordinare she in the homascocas tcontinued to do their best to stand for terrists ehanomar tweeted out gods is two plus milian population are mostly children who live under blockade in what israel's own former intelligenc chief is called in open oir prison the overwhelming majority live in poverty manysuff for life long in psychological and physical trama leming points out of the point gaza has been entirely governed by commas since two thousand and six any time the palistinians wish to actually engage indecent governents they can they have not thy ave instead decided to direct all money all resources not at building up their own cociety but at targening jews understand that goza has a massive suage problem th massive in fact the western aid authorities of a tempted to send in pipes the can bild better seuage systems and gossa those seuage pipes were then used by hamas in order to generate rockets there re purpose and turn into rocket tubes but of course it is israel's fault dospite the fact a again no jews livin in the gossesstrip ehinomaur continues along these lines just as we honor the humanity of the hundreds of innocen israilly cevillians o nine americans whoere klled this weeken we must honor the humanity of the inocent palstinian cevillian who ave been killed and whose lives are up ended i feel horrible for tose people as well which israel doesto which is why israels trying notskilles people an commass is perfectly happy to station all of its rockets righte behind department buildings palstinian residence of les bank have scarcely better lives than gosins with the routine destruction of their ancestral homes destruction ofthe crops and violence taxk by meansall propagandistic nonsense it really is routine destruction of their ancestral homes the palsinian population in the called westbank has risen by millions by millions i should point out at this point that when she says that thereis no better living standard and juda an simaria the west bank of israel which again is largely governedby the palsonian authority genina's governed by the palstinian authority he bron is govern by the palstinian authority ik these these areas ore governed by palstinians if you have failed to grow youre on economy that would be that that is your fault you have the ability to actually elect people and put people an power or not going to steel all of the money aser arfout by the end of his liveis worth hundreds of millions of dollars machmu basworth hundreds of millions of dollars to this point but i still even in spite of that i should point out that in the gasastrip the ged peoper capit is eighthundred seveny six dollars in the west bank for palstnians living in the called wlessbankhud antimaria almost two thousand dollars and is railly arabs is railly arabs the gd p procapida among is railly arabs the g peeper capitan israel is almost sixty dals dollars for is railly arbs it is a multipole yet there is a reason why israily arabs are not clamoring to get in to palstnian governed areas every single pole of his railly arabs twenty per cent ofthe population o israel are arab and muslem every single pollshows they do not israel and also nobody wants to leave governent makes a rather largher whiche is a liar and shhe propagandastelhin almara and she is a proterrer stan and this is what she does meanwhile our colleges in universities continued to turn out the worst columbia lawscull put out theire usual pathetic statements it put out a a statements that basically was a bunch of mushmouth according to the washington for beakon a the dean of columbia loscall julian lesta release o statemen on monday whitewashing the worst terrace attack in is railly history lamentan quot be violencs that erupted in israel and gosa uc just errupted did it volcano is erupted was not herros who broke the ofense in the murder babies and cannapped women n in raped them and then murdered them and thevidio that i showed yesterday of the israelly woman or the chisecia german woman who is at a dan's festival was raped murdered than paraded through the streets of gossa that tim that was just in eruption of violenc just happen the violence that erupted in israel and gasta's pass to week an is nothing short of tragic said lesser i know many in our community have ben effected but directly an indefect indirectly thereis no mention of antisemitism or jews i by the way the antisematism that that the dean of the columbialossial cares about is that at one point a fhlostico is found in abathram and this should tell you what yu need to know about far left views of antisemitism in the united states if significantly more deeply worried in some areas of the far laft in the united states or even in the traditional left of theunited states about asuastoka on a bathrom door that they are worried about the murder of one thousand jews in israel beause they have somehow created the psychological distance to believe that if a juw gets murdan israels not because theire jues because theren is raily and thus it does not matter ell that that is going to come all to a crashing halt right now and it should come to a crashing all tha a lot of eyes that are being opend they have never actually wanted to see evil in now are eing forced to see evil because this is evil in our time jonathan greebladhave had not a lot of hind words for jonathan green blad on the show he is the head of the anti defamation league as maybe we can half ago i did an en actual twitter space with elan musk very critical of the antidefamation leak i think that is at jonathan has done a lot of very progressive work whet hed use excellent on emison b s yesterday morning when he was confronted with the propagantism and lies of the american laft attempting to recapitulate this conflict to some sort of moral equivalent between two quarrelling sides as supposed to the greatest mass terror attack i in min modern juish history l i am sad and cope trying to cope i'll behones i am angry i am angry with the world that alloud the dehumanization of israilies and sanitizes the terrism of comoss i must say i love this show and i love this network but 've got to ask who is rihting the scrips hamas the people who did this they are not fighters shonathan they are not militants non looking right at the camra they are terrorist it is a barbarian who rapes and brutalizeas women who tar kills children in front of their parents look when we say oll this was an escalation it was found to happen i am sorry this was a massacre that was preplanned this was not destined to happen it is not normal to shoot tea aturs in the back hundreds of them i just think gies get the story right in all these pictures of missiles or the robbl in gasa please talk to the israili mothers and fathers who lost their children an good for jonathan green blacd but yet at sins tot ba mesan beseee from doing its worst again you wonder why the american people are very very ignorant about the sort of sup particular young people in people on left the answer is because they are people in the mediou o want them to be ignorant here for example was amason be c suggesting that actually the best way to get hossages back would be for israel to take jews out of the out of their homes injured antimaria ause i worket amazing and goza there were amazing an gos thereis they re moved some six thousand jews from their homes in the godstript turned over commoss and fifteen years later this is what you have and the solution on imust and be ses of course you should live in fewer places th i mean if yous do not wn to be killed obviously thy shuld live in fewer places in fact if you ware not just go directly to it maybe you shulnd be alive that is thits a really easy way toprevent them from being killed but certainly we should remove them from their homes in deferences to terroris who behead babies and cinnap women to rape them probably that great solution emison besee just all the wisest people if you are thinking that far hadnithin that smart and getting to a palistoday and stay bhecommons more difficult ah because of all the ie varly hoisn than the asteda thats supportit i thin an insta i thankin t a they ar national commtet a condens them how do you do that does this make ey i railrethink that or do they just double down well i was hoping is ral wesme thinking that a the ther coaeon oar ministe at ya wi which est substantially to the right of him ainclude people who ware very much for neu ra the ral a theyis vailya or and fori anding settnt lets into ariaty an art o the wes forbak it it possible for theyre to be a continguous palistady instate ah and rolbling that bath beple s i'm sarry continguous munins territorially connected there will never be a continuous palistinian state because the goza strip is on the left corner of israel and the judaan sumaria ari is over here sof you want a contiguous palistonian stay they meading non contiguous israel obviously these youple are foolsthey do not know anythingad thdo not care about anything for them the easiest thing it is the tyou do not moral cowards do moral cowars always take the mit aline it is the easiest thing to do the easiest thing to do in any situation jus take the morln all i just wish everybody loved each other all i just wish they are a piece ah if only tese people would just come together and get around their conflicts and that avoids you that that allows you to avoid the implications evil until it is smash you directly in the face and even then it turns out that there is a comfort in blindness tere'san absolute comfort and blindnesso it is much easier on a moral ofs si do not know anything about this i take no sides i do not know thet i do not take any side i'm not important well and e went when you see babies being beheaden you cannot take sides if you cannot take sides youare a quizzling if you cannot take sides you are part of the problem it is evil not you take sides when one side is murdering babies and the other side is attempting to defend them that it is not the same thing the notion that the real tragedy heres the death of the pece precested its a damned pathetic and dark joke it really is the pecepros has been deades since the paliconian authority decided to turn down every available offer from nineteen ninety four onward to actually establish a palistonian state and decided instead at they would set up full funding mechanisms for terrorism there are streets named after terrorists actual people just murdered people are restaurants in the west bank the goza strip is a terror haven obviously but again the easiest thing if your imistand beseersananal well there is more lea it is all new ones there is many shades of gray many shades of gray here to see when people bad babies next to their monthers that is clearly here is emisand be sees allevelsy engaging in some complexity what is thit you are watching for in the next twenty four twentyeight hours i i i have to say a betn rick have have sad it very clearly you have got a look around quarters on this one there emotions are rutting high their lot of people who are pretty sure that they know the right thing to do in the moment and a lot of that feels punishment and retribution there are mass of consequences to getting this one wrong oh well ye geves look round cornius be wise elegati do not you see there maht be consequences to you non killing all the cherish on beheaded babies that is thet thit ifwe be have to be very cyt really ot realy got pinpoints on this one alebelshi all the wise men say all the wise men say that is on the moral cowardice the moral cowardice is how the west eyes by the way through moral cowardice tbecause those consequences will come home moral cowardice at home leases to surrender on every front this not just to manner of what happens in a place israel israel has always been a canarry in the comabics that yous are always canarrying the colmine in the sort of stuff but i e society that loses its moral compass to the extent that there is new onts and complexity to people oor beheading babies that is not a society that is destined to live that is not in as as asiety that can that can withstand any sort of pressure at all a collapses inward at the first sign of conflict i speakin of what yeure see an an amasand s he heres a moral equivalent supercut from these jokers poblications day after day time after time am thewise wise non stop and it seems a then natin au government is not witing to a to to bring any piece to the region it is conflicting for me because on how peopleis tere an inisent bitence of be inbolved in but at the same time it is the side we know what other twit of they hav do you condemn what hama wha as they have t inside an israel to is really civilians fa dead and there are hostages us en te most i wister betea most tey abon tan this sime work that has got te us t wher we are tote that just what is the loss of oe on livinis troject in all sience you have conte seventies iy that that is more than to unded os ton an thi fom thn one one thousan six hundred and t an thotis tench on compounds of being wot out thisism crime committed by is land what tes more trugic what equally trugic is the blindness and the disfness of the world iery singul putitican avinis booked if we see havy chousin natiu i kingdom be loss is blook do not understo mat peoples the za for how the sophistication on the new on do not you see the change is range o h cons ere protesting the io called judicial reforms would be protesting israaels in humane treatment of the apaw listinians who live under is really oucupation but that is just not something that is happening o yet youould expect says alygelsi that a that these railies or protesting traditionar formtion be out protesting in favor of commos that is that is what you expect if your complex lik alibelsy im you wonder why a again the media ar disgusting they are truly discussing ther somemany discussing members the media not all of them obviously some of them seek truth some of them occasionally stumble upon the ther not seeking it and then you have the motivated actors or more interested in thir own sudo sofistication and a moral equivalence than anything else for the part of the united states far john curby the anasy spokes person i'm again there there is a wilful blindness that as taken place because people the iner sha of foreign policy is very very strong a john kurby fully admente that commss i has killed americans that americans are currently being held hostage were also very very closely aaccordinating with is really officials about the sadest of american citizens was sadly know that a few hav been kille a we also know that there are many more that on accounted for we do not know where they are we do not o condition and and nothing's more iportd us in their sakegans security wr get ta they lashed up with his really officials on that is well that som that is a americans are n harm's way obly the bid dministration lastin americans were in harms waythey just left them in afcanistan tjohn crby says by the way goby n still believes in the two state solution which clearly is the solution here you need it u ned cl commass was the governing power it is not even a terror group in the traditional sense that had no governing power it has governing power cas belot in lebenon has governing power palsing authoris t terris coud has governing power is lomchy hot has governing power the part of a colition government in the westbank but says the emitt an but says this american a two state solutionis is clearly clearly that is the answer give them terrisor in control as tht wer t amazing in gaza is the the two states solution off the table now suddenly tlt about progeterations as it is is is quite ut all the president still believes ain the promise of he two states solution ain peace an justice a for these railly people as well as for the palistinian people and the president knows that hamoss does not speak for the palistinian people he does not the do not speak for all the palicony people on all their aspirations in the united states there will continue to be a support for a viable two state solution which the president still believes is possible tohave contioname to hust leadership sive a quessononot on all sides here to stop of thevery second i've a question who does because they say that fine what is assume for example that commos is actually a dictatorship what is a sume that the man the were elected nt two thousand sixty thousand seven what is a soon ther inditatorship who is the who exactly what is relegotiate with who is the other party at the table the palsin an authority by th way has not had that they have not held an election since what two thousand n two thousand eightwo thousand nine when was machmood abosst last elected machmooabass was last elected as the leader o the pausin an authority which is the govrning party in a gudantomary in two thousand five two thousand s ics he is now cur crn h's curnently serving the eighteenth year before your term but who exactly is ersposto negotiate with this itslik that the blinders on tese people the unbelievable blinders on these people it is just absolutely insane far the byde dministrationis provided the sports israel thit is necessary but here is how the worm curns israels gon to have to do wha it have to do nerer protected citizenry it is non cn tike a momen sactic a few days sn tik weeks is re gon to have to go in the probably gan ave to annax the gossiss trip meening take full military control of the gossess trip because they tried at the other way and did not gol amazing the rolegan have set up to militrizezon that broadens the amounts of space between the is raily areas and the palcing in t arab areas in the gossisstrip that is probably what is can to happen here long term tbecause there are no other answers and no one has provided any other answers bcause there is no other negotiating party israel by the way has tried to hand control of the gossesstrip over to egypt nont egypt said ah not interested isrel has tried to hndle ver control of paulistinian arab areas injured aansomaria to jorn you kno jordn said hellmo jordans at helmo strongly they murdered twenty thousand paulistinians way back in the seventyes during black september an then expelled the rest into the lebanon men it is for people who do not know the te history of the region the notion that that israel has primary responsto behood for a group of people have been rejected by egypt jordan and lebanon among others is a is pretty amazing but din the end israels gan o have o do it have to do do defendis own citizens because israel is a sovereign country stink americas a sovhern country and we here in america have to defend our own citizens americla never stand for anything this imagine that the people whoare crossing the southern bordr right now we are all armed to the teeth and were going to rannon village is killing thirty thousand americans do you think that the border with mexico would curnently be controlled by a by no one or do youthink the american militar would be in there doyou think the a mexin government ould even be would ouven be functional how do yu think that would go wem in any case israels gon to have to d wht it have to do and watch as the media who are already moral cowards turn their fire on the people who just watch their babies be headed im by terros grups becase that is that is what will happen and you need remember these images the ones that commossitself as putting at therell be morimages over the coming days and the moral equivalencs lackies will begin their work oushe remember again sometimes it is just a matter of good and sometimes it is just a matter of evil con ont finish with them one good story of the day this one has gone byrall it is say it is pretty amazing story i there is a m a couple from the southern town of o hakim an that is a town that is he located a few a few kalometers inland from from the gossiss strip it was really hard i have a a friend who lives here his brother lives over there and whois waiting for the entire twoday holiday to find out whether his brother as ok dozens people slaughtered in ofakin but there is one oman whose name is rahel rachel in english and a she is she spoke to the media about what happened to her when these terroris entered offakim the couple both of their sons are police officers and they were taking captive in their own home and t a apparently rachel said to her husband she said if we die will die together the terras told the couple that they weregoingto become marters they threaten to kill them and i then security eventually arrived the idea farrived in and killed every butt the story here is is is rather amazing apparently the cops they arrived and they were then in negotiations with the terrors supposedly security forces realized their being shot out from the building the first plan of asthmas to throw grenad into the house kill the terras but as they were doing that theyre being told that they were actual jews who are still in the house they open negotiations the terras were demanding food and water orahul said quot i coul seethey were angry i asked them if they were hungry i prepared them coffee and cookies david her husbands shaid she drove them crazy she kept asking if they want something i as rahel worked to distract the captors the terras began to sing songs by these really singer your narques apparently again is really cultures even taken ou by a terrace outside the building their police offcer son ev yatar described the lay out of the home to count ter terrorism forces in preparation for reaching and rescue the officers got right up to the entrance of the home during the negotiations one o the terrace use to tables to make shift barricade holding a han grenade over rahe ishead having removed the pin another sad ofthe top the tairs aiming a gun at the police apparently during the negotiations the police signaled to rahel not to given and gineit ivent give any indication that a that she was related to any the peoplewere outside but apparently she a she was asked by the police outside they could see her they asked her how many terrace were in there and she held up her hand to her fae in a cousual movement with her fingers spread to say that they were five and she told the terrase the cheid to rub her head the whole time apparently she just offering them food she is offering them cookies and shees offering them coffee and the basic idea she said i was given th e coffeen and and cookies because hungry people are angry people and they wr aparently basily all sitting in the room i eating their cookies when the police broke in and killed everyone and killed all te bagis apparently according to hersh haid we are very close to the terrace we were save her husbands haid i jumped on to my wife shots came over us right by my head i do not know hig survived when rescuers entered the home an explosivevice was set off at insherd one of them the rest of the forse kept going and freed all of the apparent hostages on the pictures from the home are filled th bullet holes and a and pockmarkson an all the raso again an amazing story out of a out of ofokim well as as i said yesterday thoughts prayers resources should be directed toward the state of israel and toward the jews who are going into harms way the members of the army who are going into harm's way many of whom require resources refer to the description into days show on you tube for directions to links if you wish to give charity or if you wish to help out the the dead here w ill be avenged they will be avenged they must be avenged there is a phrase in hebrew that we use to describe the m what we hope happens to those who spill blood this way sza shemyu kom tomam which means a may god avenge their blood and as rabbi mayor sol ofatrick points out draws on a bunch of different biblical verse is paralleling a thirteenth century prare known as afharachemim which commemorates people a whore killed in pegrums at that time the the god of israel does not sleep he is not slumber the revenge will be taken for the dead a the an anybody who who cannot see moral clarity at this point in time i do not believe you i actually do not believe you i think tha they are alterior motives to play whether it is your own suit of sophistication or whether you have baser and darker ulterior motives if you again if you cannot draw the distinction people beheading babies and people tempting to protect babies i do not know i do not now what to tell you but this conflict is not going to go away not not to day not to morrow not for a while and be strong and of good cheer because a the west is going to win an israel reghtnown as the emissary of the west against these a pieces of human debri

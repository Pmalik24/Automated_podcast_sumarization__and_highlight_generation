welcome to the huberman lad podcas wcus science science pace to s for lirecently te huberman labpodcast hosted a live event at the wiltern theatr in loss angelis it was entitled the brainbody contract the first part of the evening was a lecture about science and science space tools for mental health physical health and performance the second half was a question in answer period in which the audience asked me questions from the podcast or related to their own interests or things that they have glean from social media whor just general questions about mental health physical health and performance and i answers those questions for them we wanted to make the recorded version of that question in answer session available to everybody regardless of who could attend what follows is the question answer period from the wiltern theatr brainbody contract live huberman lab event want to be sure to thank the sponsers from that event they were eight sleep which makes smart mattress covers with heating and cooling capacity i started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover about eight months ago and it is completely transformed by sleep i sleep much deeper i wake up far less during the middle of the night if at all and i wake up feeling far better than i ever have even after the same amount of sleep in fact i love my eight sleep much that when i travel now iam quite bothered that erbian bees and hotels do not have eightsleep mattress covers on them and i've even shipped my eightsleep mattress cover out to meet me in the location that i arrive to that i get the best possible sleep if you ant a try eight sleeping go to eight sleep dot calm slash hubermen to save up to four hundred dollars off their sleep fit holiday bundle which includes their new pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u essa canada united kingdom select countries in the w and australia again that is eight sleep do calm slash hubermen i to also thank our supplement partner momentous they make the very highest quality supplements they ship internationally and theyve formulated supplements as single ingredient formulations that match what is discussed on the huberman lab podcast if you are interested in any of those supplements please go to livemomentous dok calm slash hubermen and now without further ado the question answer period from the huberman lab live event in los angelists what occurs in the mine body when you have eighty eigh t o therways to address it without medication thank you for this question attention defis at heyperactivity disorder used to be called eh d d the heypractivity part is a little misleeding and again i'm not a clinition here here is what we know works for some people and yet theyre always going to be side effectsiv any kind of chemical manipulation which is at we know that people kids and adults with eghty eight t ashly have a tremendouscapacity to focus if they with theyr focussing on you take a kid with eighty ti cannot focus and you give them their favorite vidiogame and there are a lazer the threshold to access the dopaming system is higher and dobamin has this incredible ability to focus the brain another aspects of the nervous system you do not certainly if people require medication i'm not going to tell you to stop taking that medication but the focus training exercises that have been explored mainly in china but theyre trying to be explored in over here as well do seem to be of benefit and these are as they sound they use them in schools in china now which are literally visual focus exercises you'r mental focus that is your ability to focus on in cognively follows your visual focus and of course your stress will anchor your youthe centuly put you in a sotustraw fiew of the world yes there are a non medication base treatments by medication on assuming you mean prescription medication there of course supplement base medications that will increase dopamin mainly altirasine again this is something that th carefully about before you start tampering with you are dopaming system but it is the the eltirasine is the precurs or to dopami will raise your dopamin levels but i believe and you will hear me say this as many times as necessary that one should if you can rely on behavioral tools first then of course sleep in nutritionis tare prerequisite again for all mental halth physical health performace you simply cannot neglect those and then and only then if those all of that is into working to rely on suppleent base tools or on prescription medication it is clear that vive ants ater all riddlin et cetera work fradiaee but of some people chouse to rely on more subtle forms of parmocologic manipulation eltiracine and this focusing exercise a essentially consists of spending one to three minutes trying to maintain visual focus and yes you are allowed to blink i do not know why we we tend to sterit something we do not blink but om do notlay your eyes dry out and that can increase your ability to focus cognitively and it works and keep in mind that focusing always involves a refocusing we covered a beautiful data set not collected by my lab by wendy sizuki's labit and why you that it roughly ten minute it is ashl thirteen minute a dy meditation of the sort where you just focus on your breathing has been shown to improve focus significantly why do not we heare about this more wele she is now deane of arts and sciences and why you and all the students are hearing about it hopefly they'r doing it but it takes a lobit of discipline for some reason ten minute a tigpt medication is something that very few people follow consistently but if youre ooking for non medication base treatments radiage te ordyour somebody who just struggles with focus the focusing exercise or the meditation i just described i can be very useful say the data ye thinks for bring up spacetime bridging or people familiar with what spacetime bridginas i have not talked a lot about it ocat this is a thanks for bringing that up a we a shl have an episode on meditation coming up soon where i cover it and i talked about it long ago and then i kind of abandoned it becaus well we wanted more data and and it is a pretty interesting technique you no if you think about not the nervous system an vision in particular but if you are not a sighted personin you'r low vision or no vision you could do this with your hearing but i menassume most people here are sited if not just translate this to the auditory system you have this incredible ability to close your eyes and focus for instance on people tolk about the third eyes cent or u no focusing right behind your forehead oyou know why people do that when they meditate the reason is that you actully have no sensation in your brain it is the one place to focus your attention for which you abandone sensation right if i think about any portion of my body or my breathing i'm either i'm going to sense what is happening i'm going to perceive my inin inner landscape sillcalled interreception or my outer if i look out into the world it is extereception when you focus your attention with your eyes closed just you do have to close your eyes just behind your forehead you are focusing on your thinking right sort of obvious but i do not at least to me had never been stated that clearly again one of the problems with some of the more traditional practices but also the problem with science is that there is a shrouding of everything in very complex language which sucks why is it is suck because it is a separator you el liminate the number of people that can be brought to potentially useful practicsis and i do not it when people including myself over use mechanism and descriptions of fancy phrases to mask basic principles simplest language i think is is a ah it tends to unify people around the practices when you focus on this called thirdyes centere right or a spotright behind your forehead or on your breath it is lo tricky with the breath but when you focus ion your frontal qartecs there is nothing to sense because there is no scensoring our ons there there is no touch there is no pain nothing that is why in these gory movies you can take the skull off and ere in nersurgeries the're pocing around and there the prison's flang of ilind i no an aesthetic now inaesthetic does not require anyset there is no sensorin or ouns cannot sense anything there space time bridging involves it is esentilia meditation but's really a perceptible exercise i think that is where we are goinguith this is it is starts by closing your eyes and focusing on that location for which there is no sensation there is only thaug and then opening your eyes and focusing on a location may be about the distance of your hand and you focus also on your breathing to you sort of imagine a kind of a s teather between that you can split your attention to these two locations you thinking about your body and you are thinking bout a location outside of you and then you while continuing to think about your body called interraception focus on your breathing you focus further out and then further out and then further out and then ultimately the little cartoon or men where the we are just a little blue dot floating in a big universe and it is must make all your problems go away i it kindof o works because what you have done is you have expanded your perception an go only i the stuff that is appening ing here is really important when i'm focused on what is happening n here but when i'm focused on what is going on and that the kind of the vastness of all this and were just a little in a pale blue dot and all that it changes your perception not just your visual perception obviously changing your visual perception changes your cognive perception which changes your emotional experience the spacetime bridging is a is a perceptial exercise were you step from focussing internally to focussing externally at a short distance than a further distance further distance further distance and then trying to imagine yourself in this larger landscape itsownds very mystical but it is ashy very norobiological and it capture something really amazing why is the tea in there the time space time bridging cause this is space but time is in there because when you focus in close you are slicing of time is finer you notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing and things that are happening up close whereas when you focus further out your perception of time actually changes which is why in panoramic vision we are calm and when you think about we are just a pale blue do and we most only live to about eighty five or nine hundred years old and then what is happening right now my boss bing in it ajurc and all that does not really matter because the earth is spenning and all that kind of stuff which is all true and is the stuff of philosophy and mindfulness and i think is beautiful what you are really doing is you are changing your time perception by changing your space perception spacetime bridging is very useful because most people get locked at one step one of these spations especially under conditions of stress and people who have a trouble focussing i'm glad you brought this up in this context of eighty eight tep people have a hard time focusing whether not they ave eighty eighed e or not tend to skip back and forth between different space time domains as we call them in science this is a simple exercise that you can do focusing internally then stepting out externally then steping back in all the while paying attention to your inner and the landscape just simply by focussing on your breathing am it is a tool that we are still collecting date on in terms of its utility but people are already using it and am i do not think of is imeditation i think of it is a perceptional exercise thanks for asking thet caause ha teenage our what ore five things you would recommend to physically feel my best i'm a fifteen year old surf or who attends high school and place socker it something you are doing a lot of things right to physically feel your best bouquet i'm in a grasp at some comtext here that i'm not that is not within reach i'm assuming if you are doing all these things you are hofly doing a bunch of other things too and ther going to be demands on you that you y some of them you do not want to do school on things that are going to have varying levels of joy and delight and demand of things you do not want to do i i i don' want a default always to the simplest of tools but i i certainly think that even as a fifteen year old if you are not already getting a lots and lots of sleep that is going to be great tell your parents that i said you should get lots and lots of sleep bry youre not sleeping through classes i am a professor after all i could not a i tell you otherwise i would say if i could travel back in time as a fifteen year old i would encourage you to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practise i know the sounds a little clichet but having some awareness of you are thinking about your thinking is good but i'm actually not going to say sit down and meditate for ten minutes a day or do anesty are i'm i'm actually not going to tell you that i think given how plastic your brain is how much it is changing at fifteen i would encourage you and maybe would set a timer for this to actually develop just a really keen awareness of what stresses you out what relaxes you what delights you et cetera and just a simply develop in awariness of that because those are your unteni and i certainly had a meditation practice as a youth mostly given to me because i was a little hay wire and i needed it and it worked pretty well but i think in retrospect what i wish i had developed was more of a sense of youhow i navigated stress or things and things i enjoyed in things i did not enjoy and i would just encourage you to have a general awareness trying detect and learn about what braises youre drennal and what raises you are dope o me n what raises your sare tone and and then start thinking about tools but again the awareness is going to be very valuable and gosh as a fifteen year old you are in this amazing blessed period of heightenerol plasticity should we all be lucky enjoy it next question please clarity on a drenlin regarding cold water should we wait to feel the rise of a drenalin tha get me out here feeling an the faull of it before bailing yes provided it does not kill you i i do not want to say col water it is hard to kill yourself with cold water provide your heads above in you breathing but the it is i my podcasperuse is always i i cannot help that the anyway it is it is a great tool and different days it will feel different for instance doing cold any kind of a drendlin and deliberate cold exposure or a drennlin increasing activity early in the day you might find that you are more quottinquat resilient than later in other words the wall a really do not want to do this this is actually interesting for i think it extends beyond cold water let say you really do not want to do something pay attention to the fact that maybe it is not the right thing to do but assuming it' something that you should do but you do not want to do you are already in the first wal of a drenine you do not experience it necessarily as heighten levels of stress you might experience it as heighten levels of fatigue or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state that is require to move through the thing but i do encourage you to take advantage of that of course and we have an episode coming out to morrow actually that answers questions should you train if you are sick and what if you travelin and there is contaxt always but i think that you do want to experience if you want to get the most out of the cold water exposure and to be more specific the adrenalin then you want to get to that point of i really want to get out here but i know i can stay in safely but i really want to get out of here and it is it is a little hard to explain but there is just much learning in those short moments about where your mind goes and this sounds very kind of again subjective and maybe a ll wish you washy but you can realize great things about yourself in those moments you can find insight in those moments also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort not just physical but mental discomfort i's directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave that you will experience afterwards the reason't feel good when you get out of the ice bath and your showered off i wous do the warm shower after i do not do this end on cold thing i do not know jus seems to painful and then take a warm shower and hn you feel great and that is the surge of dopamine that we know based on a paper publishin the urpean journal physiology last many hours and it is a one hundred to two hundred per cent increase in dopamin is not a subtle of fact and then people say will wait is that dobaming in to crash my doba mean system know because it is a nice slow rise in fact i am actually not aware of many things besides love and delight that can create this long sl arc of dopamin lasting many hours maybe you are aware of other things if you are let me know but it turns out that long arc is a a true anti depressent and my colleague get stamford doctor onolympki who is ahead of our do diagnosis diction clinic has talked about in her amazing bot dopami nation about patience of hers that if really helpd themselves along and out of the more depressive phases of r working through a diction and in just depression in general through directed cold water therapy ie you knowi i'm ovously a fanatic about it in the sense that it is a powerful relatively safe if done properly safe if done properly way to modulate your internal dopame hopfully i answered your question next question pleace i sorry i caught it rays and went off the fall as well yes i think you should get out once your once your you have accomplish something do not get out when yopanic unless its dangerous sare how can you train your brain to feel more confident moments where you tend to feel intimidated ah o ke es hard question am because context is tricky here cause i do not know what the context is and confidence on short time scales and then long time scales to confidence in school confidence and career those are those are long long our things were as confidence to be able to do something in the short term is different but remember those action sequences that trigger the release of dopamine do not bemean i've mainly talked abou the dark side of dopamine but i hofully also talked about that t' upward spiral that dopami can cause mainly by thinking about delight and things that you really enjoy the that carries over and i would say that you want im you want to micro slice the demands of what is maybe got you back on your heels a bit am i she could frendamine who is here to night i think also my friend pat yo he has a great way of ai you now conceptioalizing this which is it for most all endeavours were either feel back on our heels flatfooted or forward centere of mass we can really do something we are flatfood o were back on our heels and sometimes getting from back on our heels lat let us call that lack of confidence to just you kow on to feet and confident enough to move forward or at least stay in the in the game that is going to require you could lean on different tools i cannot say which would be ideal for the circumstance yere you have in mind but i do think that having away to calm yourself we will give you access to more resources internal resources we know this this was something i meant to bring up during the discussion about fear versis love et cetera trying to acts as delight and love when we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety the rule set the options available to us and indeed our creativity is greatly diminished and this has to do with the way that the prefrontal qartec inter acts with an airy the wrinkled the insula which relates to our internal landscape and there is his weird phenomenon which is it normally our brain our thinking rain and or rule setting brain can it leads our the brain parts that control and pay attention to how we feel internally and that is why for inctance if you feel will nervous you can still do something at's some point you get stressed enough and we know this from work by my colli davit is beagle it reverses and these arreas of the brain that are paying attention how flushed my faces are with an am sweating or my breathing ashally start to shut down creative decision making i would say the way to have more confidence is to learn to control that stress and keep the part of your brain the prefuntal quartexs is that part that can come up with new rules that can be funny that can be creative that keeps that brain part leading the way thing about this is the provuntal quartex is or the coach and the rest your rainers ar the players and if you get too stressed the players start to lead the game in the coach follows now drags them along i would encourage you to focuss on real time stress modulation and to raise your strestthreshold using the sorts of toos we talked about and to register your winds i did not get into this and too much detail but one of the amazing things about the dopamin system is that it is highly subject to your interpretation if you tell yourself that a fail was a win and you can see or conceptialize some way in which that is actually true you get to tap into the dopamin system you might think that is crazy you can cheat your own brain you can cheat your own nerro chemistry and indeed you can you can change the time space time reference and we see this with examples nelson men dell are victor frankal you you read their stories right trapped in little sells it confined imprisoned and they come up with new ways to acess the dopamin system aby now not thinking about what they are not getting but thinking about what they can control in their immediate experience many many examples of this throughout literature and history and the dopamen system is the life for system i do not say that in any loose way dopamine is life force it is the wish in the desire to continue it is persistence and if you can think about what might seem a failure and really spend some time thinking about not the potential winds on the outside but how you can canceptialize that is a potential win internally you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win and that chemical win sets you up for more real winds for that make sense it is incredible how contexturalize the dopami system is but if it were not why would it matter if we are talking about money or mates or food or job or school you do not get fifty reward systems and motivation systems you get one and that is the dopaming system next question please what is the competing mechanism behind bylateral eve movement m d'ar that helps resolve psychological trama the competing mechanism ah well let me let me try an answer as best i can a nuttry understand the full extent of the question bu lime e m d'ar moving your eyes from side to side right then then recounting a trama is a very caman and actually one of the for approve treatments that are behavior ol for trama i'm it is contaken seriously in the psychactric and cycological community for good reason it tends to work best for single event tramas as appost entire childhoods i'm no joke there meun some youle of their entire childhood with dramatic other people they experience a trama a single event trama or repeated periods of the same were similar type of trama i movements from side to side have been shown in a number of studies to very potently reduce the activity of a brain structure cal the imigdala which most people are familiar with because of the character from the starwords movi midaa there is a nurrsign to somewhere on the the the that team it is indeed a threat detection center and when you move through space not outer space but when you walk this your eyes actually generate these suttle side toside shifts unless your focasing on a specific target and my lab and other laboratories have found that that leads to a very potent quieting of the threat detection system and then e m diar is essentually a process of pairing that calmer state with no threat detection system activated with the recount of something that normally would be quite triggering it is you have heard of pavlovian conditioning a bell rings in the animal gets fed and andimal salevates eventually just the bell will avoke the salvation you are doing the reverse of that it is called behavioral desenses ation as underlying mechanism et cetera but the ideas to pair a calm state with recount of something it has been shown to be successful there are people who think that the side toside i movements and the recount of trama may actually be invoking some form of hypnosis i my colleague david spegols your expert ind clinical hypnoss is appeared on my podcast retrols pdcast ana yew other podcasts and talks about this it is not stageshypnosis its clinical hypnosis there may be something going on there m d'ar yen some people get great relief from it other people do not what is kind of nice is that this i movements from side to side or simply taking a walk as ellas you are not looking at your phone and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side is a very good way to shut down the fear in stress system taking a walk i think it is relaxing for obvious reasons and there ar data showing that you knowpart the reason why animal scr cth at the door and whan to go for walk may not actually be the exerciseors kind of an anxiety in an an anxiety relief that occurs of course they i have to go the bathroom to one of costell's great joys in life was just pein on everything outdoors thankfully the psychological troma rewiring unfortunat te have not been a lot of brain imaging studies long looking at this long term of how will m do our works what i think it is going to happen in the next few years by the way is it is not going to be a discussion around should you do m d'ar should you do trains cranual magnetic stimulation should you do behaviour olthery it is going o be commonation therapies commination there be's including pharmicologic manipulations to essentially give a boost to the systems that encourage ineral plasticity dopamin in sertone and and gentlemen and then also then perform e m d are if you want to talk about what is happening in the landscape of clinical trials on some of the psychodelics on happy to talk about it they are still e legal but they are being used in clinical trials and very interesting stuff is happening there lookate next question please what no research or interventions are you must excite about in the realm of o wit a wellness what i think is going to be very interesting in the next few years really reflects my an obsession that you have seen a little bit of to night but the thing ni thing it is going to be most useful and i've seen this in science before and i think we are going to see it in health in wellness is that ther're all these tools and all these people and he saying this and she saying that and what we are going to star paying attention to is what are the common themes right i it and a broader and more important theme is going t be one of modulation verses mediation what do i mean well if some one were to pull a fire alarm right now please do not that will shift our attention and make it hard to focus in what i'm saying and knowing me iplogust say up here talking do we think that fire alarms mediate attention num they modulate it right if it were very very cold in this room it was when we first got here to night the're arctic cold helthleet's warmed up a bit e it has not i'm sorry sorry ye i atempted to ye i almost thought may we all just do abunch your breathing to heat up a grentalin release but now these days getting grups of people all breathe on each other s ot exactly i can see that might go the wrong way in terms of what people interpret the the idea here is that certain things directly mediate something a physiological side directly calms you down quickly it mediates the comming response getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered it modulates strass but is sleeping directly mediating stress control no and i think this is really important and this brings up the topic of the got brain axis the got is rich with these little bugs bacteria trillions of them which is an ere thought to me but also the surface of your skin the surface of your eyes you have a skin microbyo ma nazal microbyom every mucosal lining has a microbyom in fact think about this it is this is a crazy but worth while tangent have you ever bit in the inside your mouth it is socks right and get a cot an a hurt but gess what the inside of your mouth heels without a scar but that weird right you cut anywhere else on your body and depending on how well you heel and your age in your imune status you get a scar your mouth is filled with bacteria and it is open to the world but the got microbiom provided it is healthy provides and incredible ability to heel quickly and i'm not somebody who is done a lot of accupuncture i've went a few times and other's interesting science happening on macupunctubut what is the first thing they do when you walk in there hun and then they got my yat and they have this cool intuition that is not based on western mechanistic science it is more of an intuition based on millions if not billions of data points that have been put into these charts it is pretty cool right and what they are looking at i believe and from what micolleagues who work on microbyom tell me is thacan look at the pallor of your tongue in particular in the back and get a sense of whether not the microbiom there is of the appropriate stoff but they do not go lack obasilis andembsi they all onto illis right but they ow you are just biotic instead they get a sense now parents of small babies learn to detect all sorts of things coming out of essentiay every orifice of the child as a read out of health because the child does not have language and a dogown eartin unfortunatelyu learn to do this too for better for worst pride for better right we have this intuition about got health but got health would be another example where it is very clear now that fiber can be healpful but it is mostly consuming these fermented foods that been used in for ages but losurder fomentifoods of the noto kimchi sour crowd comboocha et cetera all these things the depending on which culture you are in they come in different forms certain yogerts et cetera that allow that got to be healthy and it modulates a huge number of systems i do not think that you are going to cure depression by a justing you are got microbiom but if you are got microbiota are not wealth and you improve that it will indeed shift the narrow transmitter systems of your brain and give you a elevated mood thut should not come as of surprise any more but i think that the whole world things ik cosh it must be the seratonan in the gut no it is actually not ceratoni got it is that the it is got microbioto create chemicals that actually become seratonan in the brain or become dopening in the brain and i think that the got microbyom i would put in the same category although not quite as important i' put i in the category sleep it modulates a huge number of other processies it does not mediate them sunlight sleep healthy got microbioum exercise good nutricion social connection these things all create this general milu or environment of health i would to see more distinction between modulating and mediating to affects and tools out there because i i also see a lot of unnecessary argument you are there is no example that improving your got microbium curous depressions i'm course there is not but the're really good examples if youre got micro byom is off that improving it can improve mood which in depending on where you are on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things i think that that the future of health you knw we hear much about personalize medicine and matched your geno but iwe knowingon of the basic most people do not even have the basics right and if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough hopefully certain theme starts a kind of repeat themselves but a key theme that a you learn in science you teach your students your lets does it modulator t doesnit mediate it you need to be careful with your language there and there is great information and or as we say interpretational power there if you understand the difference thend i think we can go a long way by making that distinction modulating verses mediating ether probably other things that modulate health that i'm overlooking now just because of a the the flow that i'm in the cool mit ye the coolmi palmer cooling o get i promise to talk about cot palmer cooling well i'll do it now palmer cooling they change the cuean aform at loki sit is is teaching in the classroom all right very briefly the palmer cooling which is essentially placing you can cool the core of the body most quickly by placing cold objects on the hands the bottoms of the feet or on the top of the face because of the arrangement of vasculature normally you got this arteries caplaries vains things but in at those locations in the body you skip the capilaries and you can basely you are not really passing cool into te body but your cooling off the core of the body more quickly and if you do that in between sets of exercise or during a rod nor cycling you can dramatically increase youre ability to continue actually use the cool mit for cognative work but you do not need a cool mit a sorry coolmit guis e you can just get a a a thing of ice water or just very cold water and you i know it sounds trivially easy your actually just cooling your core by putting your hands or even one ha and on a relatively cold thing of water or ice but not cold that it constricts te the vascular ture there this is the incredible work of my collig at stamford doctor crak heller why would not more people do this if you can double the amount of endurants believe it are not or double the number of sets of exercise you can do or feel more alert and do more cognive work why would not more people do it because people just do not do it and it sounds crazy it really sounds crazy but it is a real thing and i wish more people do it the athletes at stamford do it people toe military do it people no no and they and they use it enjoy it it is just ists a it is a it is almost seems too off target from the what you are trying to accomplish i do not know for some reason people are finally on board breathing in a specific way as a useful too a few years ago knoone was into that iman just think of how far we have come it is incredible people tike about psychadelics meditation breathing i think the pandemic for all it is pains and what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons did wake people up to the idea that you have to take control over your health because there is no magic ferry coming to do it for to you and with all do respect there is no government agency that is gon drop off the kit at your front door o here is i take o carry erself it is just it is just nock an i happan and it would not happen under any circumstances it is a personal responsibility issue huh e all rightell what lessons from escapeboarding the failure part the failure failurer failure i mean for me youscae work never was a goodscapeboarder still have close friends in that community an a ar photographer and guide does all the visuals and the other goze whut dote visuals for oa potcast mike play backing cris an martin are all of that community i think that for me that community was really a as a miche will sometimes say escape oarders hate everything meaning they have a very high threshold for what they consider acceptable it is not just what you do it is how you do it superimportant and i thinkin narrow science a there' a lot of there is a lot of stuff in science in general ther're a lot ere many papers and there is many experiments iy how you navigate that landscape i think it it help me develop a sense of taste but the taste that i'm referring to is not nessarily a taste of which sciences cooler not cool that too but it came through a few times to night when i' strug about my mentors i picked back then scapeboardin caus i really the people and also you did not need your parents to co to a game and that worke for me and y cant make your own scasu and i do think it is very important to the extent that you can in science and in everything to surround yourself with the kinds of people that you just really enjoy being around and to me the podcasts running a lad feels a lot scape boarding it is the same energy it is the same neurochemical systems firing s th at that is a yo one next u favorite fine oh oh i know that is inappropriate i i do have a finemen's story but it is inappropriate arn't it maybe some time is whay i do not drink good decision making well i read all a finemens books tso i had the pleasure i never met him i hewas dead before i was born but my my dad did and he had good finemen stories and they are inappropriate the cool thing about finemen right was that he idn't really care if people understood the specifics of what he was talking about he just wanted people to get turned on to how amazing physics was and he love general principles and one of the things eu now the example thats sometimes given out in o how many yur familiar with the finmen books but surelyoure joking mister fiemen ore what you care what other people think all o that is of it is wonderful he picked locks we worked at lost almost labs they are working on the bam and he basiclyt well there and elswhere and every morning the offices used to come in and he would spread all the top secret papers out on the floor he'ld break into the safes at night and then they were perplex who could do thi he safe cracking literally national scurity secrets just for fun prankster he also bongo drum naked on the roof of caltac and he did most of his writing of therums in strip clubs fact learn to draw late in life was really in to flotation tanks and very curious about but never did psychodelic that is tas i understand but one of the the cool finemen factoyds is that when he was a kid he he talked about when he was a child that has dad used to take him bird watching and he say all that is a whatever scrub jay and that is a whatever whatever thrush and thot's and his dad said no do not cloud your mind with naming and taxin on me that is not meaningful because then whatd a it is the different youknow the pigmy thrush or the the lesser this or that the more import thing ist to start to identifi principles of hy certain birds behave one way and certain birds behave another and to start fining the the comminalities and the regularities and that is a theme that i obviously tonight of tried to impose and it is achally something that i cannot do in pod cast necessarily cause i cannot thread across forty episodes or something that in the same way that i could in an evening this that is an appropriate finemen story also it just eem a delightful guy and he is cannicoli's a little bit street ritya the thick accent he was from far rock way but he did not really care much what people thought or he did and he pretended he did not careful when people tell you they do not care what people think i think he did to the extent that it is still a low him to get the message out there o k next question please my horse w ell of this i delight in all things animals but a specially horses because my high school grofering had a horse an i you kow they do that thing were i people ow horses can detect how they know more about you than and i gen to the horse in the horse any ththe this and it is a litmous test i've mai't grofor in with a horse was very intimidating fremain actually i felt i had to compete with the horse she spend all this time with the horse is very large very anyway eventually i broke the horse the oke my horse does the double in heal long exhail often he is a bit of a stressy guy warm blood ye warmblood ice to work at the barn ya i used to shovel maneuran work at the barn she brought her horse to college that is igt i should followed her off to calli never would have gone to college if she had gone to college and the horses are interesting animals they do tell you lot the the orse does the double in healong exhail often he is a bit of a stressy god you suppose thi physiological strest regulator transents we absolutely absolutely in fact i mention warm blood sor i'd have a colleue at stamford na she is amazing er name is sumaconal and she is an expert in dog chinetics s you can imagine i'm always asking her questions and we talk about dogs and we talk about horses because she allso think she raises warm bloods and you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods and you also if you have any familiarity with dogs their dogs costello we are a newcliar bom could go off and costell mi open an eye that is the bulldog economy of effort they are not going to get activated unless there is a reason to do it they are very as we call paris sympathetic dominant that se saw of autonomic arowsal is just really really relaxed getting them into action is more of a more of an effort ther're other animals the whipp it right we are the italian greyhound they lis it he're always cold that or very sympathetic dominant and then a horse within a breed or within a species there is a range and humans also out within a range i think any one who ise had shildren will tell you he or she has been this ins birth calm easy going or really easily strassed i think that see saw wean get into to night too much but there is a a concept with the autonomic regulation of of a hinge do not think much about being really stressed out or really relax but certain animals the hingeis tighten that the the se saw just kind of tilt's mello wike costello a bull dog is almost eems a different animal then a whip it ther'e very different and within the the categra horses i'm not an expert in horse cenetics but they are selected for not just for their physical attributes but for there psychological or temperament attributes and you see this in dogs to in fact the reason i picked costello and elvis can verify the stories i read i wanted a dog for many years and i went there and there were all these puppies and i was i heard you need to take them in the other room and one by one and if it barks for its siblings than you uss ethy puppy walking and all the dogs are running around crazy was regd around christmas time ranelvas and the running round and then there is one in the back and he is taking advantage of the fact that all the other ones ar wen he is just eating out of all their mors s i i want that one i took that chubby little bastard in the next room and i thought o k he is going to bark for his siblings an lay down ain' took a nap nos i this one i want this one why did i want that one will this complete the the principle which is i wanted a dog that because i'm not that and i'm was very interested in a dog i could take care of but also a dog that would helpregulate my nervous system and for me having a dog that as opposed to a whip it or something that was getting constantly around his iu a very calming effact and to this day memory of his snoring still puts me to sleep i think that youre your horse probably haw it cont idols a little bit higherthing about the ar p m revsilo bit higher t a given hier more our p m at a given speed that is way i thing about the autonomic system how d you reset that well this is why a lot of exercise is good right it is ailing my girl friend's horse was crazy it was gilded late and it was crazy almost a nuts but at e at ponseright it was not nuts but it was crazy it was gilded late next crition is there any science behind staing motivated or developing discipline wo this represents kind of the higher teer of where i think things are going to going the next for yours were we are going to start seeing this convergence of psychology and biology where we can get to these harder concepts i to think that we can stay motivated through a simple process that now will make sense to you because the last thing i covered was toggling back ind forth between ourability to be gritty and lean in cond of infriction maybe in aloll anger fear competitiveness et cetera that kond of earn grinding in but that the mor re sustaining fuel the sort of hybrid version right hibrad fuel mottel would be one in which you can access that but that is a topleadable and not renewable resource without a lot of rest meaning working hard out of anger determination and can a grit will work but when you are depleaded you have to stop for a long while whereas if you can access this delight system which is really one of dopamene and seratonean both in other words and i want to think of a not of a diffrent way to put this but to trying thing about what sorts of things and tools allow you to be and feel most loving i know it sounds weak but it is anything but we to be most loving in the verb sense of the word toward what you are doing actuall used to use this trick in college when i'd encounter a topic i hated i would tell myself i'm really i'm juse in a fall in love with this by trying to find the gems within it sometimes it work sometimes it did not but the wish to do it that way i suppose to oceamgers can a grind this out at least for me at the time was a powerful tool motivation and discipline is a tricky one that sort of that just do it thing you need tools to modulate your stress and to get your sleep do all the basic things right set the right contact for you to be in your best chance of being disciplined and that it is it self is its own form o discipline but in terms of continual motivation you are not in o manage to go against the grain for very long people have managed to go against challenge for very long time for very long times in fact i was reading recently about the psycholegy of people been kidnapp and they have this odd trick that they used if you heard about this is sort stocklums indrum but they actually convince themselves to fall in love with their captors and then they come up with new ways to escape the sacantacool u there is something about mentally feeling your trying to go from back on your heels to flat footed it does that is very energetically costly again the these systems are very susceptible to the watwe call contacts are topt down regulation howfully that helps i knownit is a little bit abstract i wish i could give you one minute exercise or making motivated but o but we to talk about tools tould get a drentaline going and things that but spend some time thinking about what would allow you to sustain effort through positive feelings it is not a ligke concept at all o next question please what would be your biggest piece of advice for achieving one's dreams boy that is a tough one gain this is game a ltle abstract i'm a believer in this idea of a kind of a seed message rober green is talked a lot about this that we can all kind of think back to a event or stage of our life typically it is before puberty for other reasons that our kind of interesting but where we we delight in something right it' for me it was fish and o ly see now i do not need to work on fish it is it was not about the fish i hope that came through i me a querior really cool but it is not about the fish it is something about the way they moved it was something about the way that it tickled might excitement i ease get dropped off at this ottle petshop in californiaavenue poll to called moni's petshop my momuses child carrage you drop me off there and i this book and i would log all the tropical fish and which ones could be with which ones and then i would i was obsessed right but for me it was something about organizing and being able to make reliable predictions it was about parsimony it was about principles as opposed to en the color's delighted me in all that kind of stok it the equipment tolighten me but then i at puberity anen it was something else and and then i went to collegein it was something else and i got gir vor in it was something else it changes over time but this is why i recommended to that young fifteen year old person that they learn to tap into that sense of this is cool this feels i know not everyone else thinks at school maybe they do this feels good i actually have of sommatic experience of this i'm not a very somatically oriented person i more up here but i actually c know if i'm on to something if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting it is i want a move or it some peoplel you can start to identify ways in which you suddenly have this positive energy it is not a fear energy it is almost a magnetism to things and just do not be confused and or mis directed in thinking that it is that thing it is that i yen energy or that attraction to something that feels right that is your i wish we hade these divining rod to find water that is your tool it is unten i you want a grow your and ten i how do you follow your dreams wi i never thought i do a podcast i never thougt'd become a norrow scientist you you have to be willing course to take risks and and to iterate quickly but not quickly that you you fail out of the game et cetera if you do get back in et cetera but it is really about developing in awareness now the keything is you are not going to find this by going up a mountain and sitting there or waiting for your passion ta just kind of rocket beou now tos tis sort piano fall onder your head it is not cin i happen that way you have to interract with the sensory world and different kinds of people and you have to be a little bit of a adventurer in a safe way of course an adventurer and learn to recognize the signals and some people are very intune with us them the other's in amazing podcasts with rireuben recently on jorogans podastsery talks about the creative processes kind of this wy it seems whatever's going on in that bear to his is connects to the world and he can just there that is where you need to go and that is but that is part of the magic is you do not really know an because it is it is all energetic it is all energetic and when i say energetic i do not mean in the mistical sense i mean you have to learn to sens those fluctuations and energies some people can sends them very easily because thei'r very mellow an if something gets really excited they notice as a big delta as we say inci big change other people they ride kunt a high all the time and everythingis exciting to them and they miss a lot of thse subtle fluctuations in what is really special and right for them in fact mania it is characterize by hyper elevated levels of dopenming and everything's a good idea right and depression is the opposite nothing's a good idia nothing's gon to work right and those are the extremes and those are rough conditions obviously but for most people it is about learning to detect those subtle fluctuations an every time every single time you find somebody who is exceptional at their craft en doing well in life ook can a lot of people are exceptional their craft but not necessarily doing well on the whole those people have a kind of a intuition about what feels good to them this here is noble prize when her in chemistry is my colly carolin burtosy and all i know of her except the fact that she is amazing chemist is they did this interview with her and she said that when everyone go out and college she was finding excuses to stay home and read organ at chemistry now ad to me something a bad night but for her it was pure delight and she is wired for that and ti think her work is going to be vitally important and transformative for humanity i really do how do you succeed in in get chasing your dreams you succeed in identifying what they are but you do not know at the outset you want a fined the energy to find the right path and continually course correct when you will undoubtedly be off your path that is the sumchy what i've done i'v still look for the feeling of delighting in costello or the cubtle fish that is what i'm am looking for it is not a templet i have to match but that is my oya i know what that feels it is a texture it is if you thing about a bunch of diferent texturies of sand paper it is this one that just feel really god and you are comparing everything to that it caus the system that involves all these chemicals you will find it if you learn to pay attention to it but you will not find it sitting staring at your bellybutton er look going up amount you have to be incensory experience in order to find it reflection is good but you neen to get into action ok aall right well o k am syliciban a opinion of the psychodelics generally we jus sad an episode with my cholic nolin williams whose a tripleboard certified nerologis psychiadris is a funthing about working at stamford is also very humbling cause you are what were these people that threeboard certifications that the syliciban first while not for everybody people with psychosis it is stilly legal decriminalized certain places obviously the cautionary notes of people who have druggadiction issues or other kinds of ediction issues need to be thoughtful about diving into a narrow chemical landscape that but it does appear that the that the clinical trials on one mackro dose this is what is interesting to me alopule tok about microdosing sylisivon but the data at least according to matthew johnson who is also on the podcas the data for microdosig are not really there frankly the data on single session mackrodose the sort of heroic doses that have ben talked about in the psychic the psychonot community for depression and to some extent ptst and for eating disorders and for anlaend sort of end of life preparation are quite encouraging in fact the current data suggested about two thirds of people achieve lasting relief from one session now keep in mind those are guided sessions with physicions in the room et cetera i do think there is a potential hazard of all psychodelics which is they alterr this includes emd ma or especially mdi mat they alter the chemical landscape in you such that a lot of things can serve as a tractors in that state meaning you can get really into the sound of music in an emdimasession feel connected to that and waste the opportunity for some more meaningful transformat ivery wiring and i i do think that that is worth paying attention to that is the the the usefulness of having at their apeutic guide theres they can continually steer you back to what at least for you is the more meaningful work but it is very encouraging and nolin williams who i trust this an again triuble board certif ied emdy said th in the studies of lifetime perceived individual in societal risk of all the compounds out there except for cafine sylicivon is at the bottom of the list whereas things in a heroine cocane alcal hall o methem phedaman said at the top of ta list a she a'lcall quite high on that list at certain mounts of consumption i'm very excited about what is happening in the landscape of sylicivon but i'm not excited about the microdosing data very excite about the single heroic dose data a one interesting their thing theire perhaps what seem is to be the unifing feature of a successful syllicil sylicibons guves me session is that at some point the person feels as if it too much of a autonomic thing they it cut get to this point and then they are encourage to cotinc let go and i'm fascinated by this concept of letting go becaus yo manoro sciencis we do not know what that means but seems being able to ride the wave of of autonomic aralsal from top to bottom seems to be very powerful for tromaan depression treatment and this is interesting a lot of people think that one of the major issues in humans nowadays is were stressed about a lot of things but we never actually get to go into the full stress response and then let it relax again and catharsis was big at one point scream therapisteve jobsing to scream therrapies that whether not catharsis is healthy or not as been debated but the date are co pointing the fact that it may be provided that the catharsis is not obviously on damaging themself for somebody else maye wesh ll be screaming llotmore why doest my desire to eat disappear after i use the sana of interesting i can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat u i can only speculate the sana or any kind of deliberate heat exposure that is uncomfortable releases thes molecule dying orphan is ac tally the same molecule that is released in under conditions of alcohol withdrawal i makes you feel agitated and not good and then there is this rebound but the way it feels good is later it causes this upregulation in the call mulepioid receptors youare the chemicals that you have your caled indogenous opioid's not that opioids that ie relate o the opriod crisis but the ones that you naturally make are able to have a more robust of fact after the sana dinorphan is an appetites suppressin and for reasons related to kind of general discomfort in the bodie that is the only reason i can speculate there are a number of other things that sana does including massive increases in growthornmone provided you do not sana too much ifyou do at once a week for four twenty minute sessions space five minutes apart u you get these enormous increases in growthormona if you start doing it more often you get still significant but smaller increases in growthormon and my team this is how the podcas goes to at some point roub just goese it is enough if you thnk that the episodes are long now they would be a lot longer listn't i just want it am before we part i know it is a sunday night and people have to go i want to think everyone for coming out to night i know that at least for me i'm still sort of a baffled but pleasantly that people im interestin investing time to come out and here a hours of a a nerd me talk about science and tools and i'm delighted that people are hopefully gleaning some useful information ple ese two pass along the information i did not invent this stuff as i mentiond before i was not consulted the design phase i have no domain over it this is the stuff of mother nature whatever other beliefs you have they are here in us of course i be remiss if i did not finish by saying have a wonderful night and thank you for your interest in science

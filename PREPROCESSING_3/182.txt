a quick warning there are a crrish words that er unbeeped interdate epitode of the show if you prefer a big terigion you can find that at our website this american life dat or from w b es chicago it is this american life i' beer made on me sitting in for ira glasse do what the square for titove of your home is oh god bm how could you ask me that you muntster i'm sorry that is my friend mowna mona brought a house after saving for ten years and she has a lot of complicated feelings about that house or the majority of her life she thought of herself as a person who does not have money that is what makes her her no matter the actual reality it is been that way sinc she was a kid i wente wer schooldand justop the street was another school that was a private school that was called bankcrofts em and we will used to call it wankcrofts because i think there was just this understanding that those at rich kids would not liecaft and they will not us beckis i think even when you are eleven years old that the future ahead of them is just smoother it just has less friction in it and i think we resented them even then for that fon fact we went when all girl's school and they called us er the vortion make us thog has hop y accurate i w si the virgant las yeeea i urate col dan i sa ithy an horrible i no i no mona knows the price of everything in her house she cannot forget the rugs fror my keer the lamp she brought on sale but still things was too expensive being able to afford a down payment and now or mortgage it just does not match how mona has always seen herself or how she once other people to see her if you monts after she moved in she hosted a casual bachelor at party at the house for her childhood friend he bridl party were all school friends she had not seen in ages a mona was feeling a little uncomfortable im i'm really obsessd with them cleanliness normanly and i kind of deliberately did not tidy or clean for the few daysd before they came which is wid e just cause i did not wan it to look too nice you ere trying to look kind of shabby she not shabby shek just shabby she did not clean or dust the mirrors did not jishop the cushions did not even vacuume for a couple of days beforehand but despite that to her horror the first friends to arrive did this funny loottle sort of dance in my kitchen wher she was o my god is just big they asked em if they could have a tore of the house and i kind it was just ye and then did not do anything about it but then the third time they askd i know all of my evasion tacics at this points they were just mona give us the focking tor em then i did and m i do not know they were just it is mice is thanks and and it should not be it should not be a big deal but it is becaiuse i think it som wich do not think i deserve i guess these friends all knew how she would grown up the parets had brought their house of an older lady in never updated is t the carpets were old the wall paper was peeling in places there was a bit too much furnishere when friends would come over mona felt super aware of it and embarrass were te identical emotion to what she was feeling in this new house now the whole tor she could feel them looking which is the point of a houstol dwhen they got upstairs in her bedroom the closet door was a jar cot is just embarrassing say these things at loud in my closet was a she bank e containing a gootry handbag now i did not purchase said goochy handbacg it was given to me which is also incredibly bazaar it was a work ift and i just kind of saw an iye track on that and that fell wid to me and then always also in any human insurrection there is always this troice right you acknowledged the thing or dou not acknowledge a thing and just keep the conversation going and i just know myself if i would have acknowledged it i would have made things even weider by over explaining how i came to have this rea goochy handbag wohhen i have an opened it since i got it why have not you opened if because again it does not it does not feel it belongs to me even though i own it who i am is not somebody who owns a goochy hand bag and there fore it stays in the cupboard to her the desinor bag is not actuallye a bag it is a material ascit something she could sell if ever things got rough because mona is a person who knows that the ground can give way under your feet at any time i have to foint something out the oh no no ijushav jus can o thinking ike it is a weird thing to be i do not know what to do i have money lie git is cad lot my diaman shoes they are tight i i now it is abs disgusting i'm not expecting any one that is listening to have any sympathy for this to be realllydyclear this is not framed as poor me i feel uncomfortable talk baskas again especially growing up any time that some one with more resources than me complained yo shall fuck up i do not really want to hear it i'm not complaining iam really just trying to describe a feeling i thing i nutually is still if it was wid the strangest feeling is the feeling of coming back is the feeling of putting a key through the door and opening the door and it is it is kind of was that thing agrofoybia where your scared of open spaces wis really flocking wid to have that when you walk into your home have a fearof the open space but if i'm walking upstairs to go to bed or something now it is really weerd i i feel a lodger here it is transitory when you are in your house and you are going up to bed thaes it feel an out body sort of legor it is me but it is not really me exactly i can it is i can see a woman going up the stas e and every now and then i remind myself that that person is me the mona there was another big change and it came a few months after she would brought the house that had made her feel unlike herself she was on a long awaited vacation with friend on the second to last night got a fun cl from my sister er telling me that my mum i got fan call for my sister telling me that my mumma had a stroke i came back immediately em and then e she had another stroke and yes she just im she needs twenty for our cale eand she moved in with me and i tried to do that as best i could mona swung into action she worked out the lightly cost of care and for how long they could afford it that money that she would been careful to save was actually being useful at one point she thought she might have to sell the house the wid thing was i felt horribly familiar to be in a position where things felt more precarious again when i moved into the house and everything was cave for those six months i did not feel me and now i do fool myself because the the fury's bak is just is it is me just living in a nice house for now this house is not mine really iings on some level in my mind the house is not mine and that makes me fool me by desoching lightly when i did get more safe i felt less myself i felt really o disconnected with myself i think attually being afraid his part my againstity that is what i showed to day is all about and something you understand to be such a fundamental part of yourself changes dramatically or goes away and your left wondering is this still me am i still who i think i am that feeling of me mine is me we har three peopl facing down monumental changes wondering exactly that stay with us t act one voice over sometimes you can plot the life of a singer from their discography think of the shiff beyond sey made from gurl group power pop to soul bearing global superstar i want to play you some recordings of sandy allen to this first story is about singing from four different points in his life then mi part the story of a person losing a big part of themself and building something to replac it here is the first recording i'll call it the first voice e aradady very appy yogois hthat was sandy around the age of fourteen singing scales in a voice lessen sandy was born with a voice by the age of forified he would be hoisted onder the nearest table at family weddings to belt out somewhere over the rainbow those imprompte wedding gigs became rolls in musicals at school and performing inquires and choruses both at home and internationally by the age of fifteen sandy had sung in acquire that performed that a san francisco ciancs game and also at the sidney opera house he was good and he knew it i was the person in the girl's coress who word sing the megga meggar hi know whether it was in o holly night or the end of the national i at the mil your at the then i'll be game or whatever i i was that voice sandy's boys with its three octave range was special enough to seriously consider juliart sandy could sound a dismy princess and in this parody of a song rom the little mermaid he really doeds a i chaa i a a aa a a a me i sha i i a ai aaaa a ia a a a sandy did not go the juliard pass he became a writer instead that is how i first got to know him working the same newsroom but he still loved singing carryoky or just sitting at his piano with no audience just the act of it sandy's voice high vastin range and also kind of effortless was programmed in a call part of the swell of deena that made sandy sandy another thing about sandy in his own words he would known he was different since he was a little kid tbut he kept it to himself all through college and into his twenties which was when he made his first trans frend it was at that friend's house that sandy firs sotestoterinceringes it would take another few years before sandy came out as monbinery and tranc which felt great to name out loud whenever he thought about actual he stalting testocer in himself it came with a clutch of worries the severe anxiety around needles het was nervous about his relationships with the people in his life but when he came to aurticulating oldes concerns the reason i would give myself was i cannot give up my singing voice may be i thought the universe would punish me i made i thought that hey if i do this monstrous quon o thing and start has to trown and ruin this beautiful voice that i spent much of my childhood building then the punishment i'll receive is that i will not ever feel the pleasure of singing again this fear of losing his voice it is one tut many transpeople have experience in spoken about sandy's ear was that they would be a tootal absence of a singing voice he did not know any famous transmen singers and he held one transgide tooking on a potcos about how he could not singany more four years went by c ha gate his the second set of recordings an calling this one the count down sessions m wa a waa m this is from late twenty twenty about twenty on months go at this point sandy had made the choice to start tea but before he staut it o compelled to sing some of his favorite songs and recolled himself doin what i ended up doing when i look back at it now was i was roding really must all to suffer myself stuff that i had sung and plays songs that id sng in my car as a teenajer one of the songs that a recorded on my old voice for somewhere over the rainbow it was almost i reverse all the way beginning i think it was it was it it it almost fell a memorial hey let us give this one last spen you said this thing am when we spigoly at that it felt count down to never singing aga a yat i was had i was i i felt guilty it was woyou know if i'm going to kill this sweet thing that spend my friend for all this time i will at least enjoy or our last days together whan ab na i man as o a nat i a tats w i was morning and entire self heard that was the one that i created i i never felt a woman but i had to act a woman for a very long time and i was saying good byde all of that did it really feel you would never sing again never ever well i think that if i'm being honest my sense was my other my aunt my new voice whatever it was going to be was going to be bad that i just would not want to i cand seemd to focas and youd o seem t ndi sa nat e amjust ame this is one of his new favorites beeddy ilishes my future yo as good as he sounds i mostly here how thin and kind of am tenative that voice says and how much it does not fit me ga ou me a nat a man o you told me that the last song th at you ever recorded a musing yul voice pre te was changes which is eu know very on the nose a very a a sasca that yet you knojiced thes li dear of you flipfing the castleof a aha changes because of the changes i'm going through fee but i love that much i love that that was wher your your be your brain an your voice landed i can you play a little of that recording ye am to a an a a gegegegegan ga a as stran what do you thing iad iagf yourself singing it i hear me singing a male artist a with a kind of yearning i yah it sounds the most excited of any of the ta strait i hear more energy in my voice there it is unoous in his gut that this is what he would to sound what he could sound and he is itching to get to a time when it is all reall happening i was yow deep down super excited for what was on the other side saa a a a ta me aa ave a a a aa aa a te ank a then he played the third set of accordings a'm calling it rough going a a the fakeer iit sandy's voice in a new pase and not always successful in making the exact sounds he wanted it to be making i never dream aa yo sommdy a you i never dream aa smmody a you o a a it took some time for the tea to have a notable effects on sandy's voice those recodings or from about two months after h'd stulted i could not sing sounds that even sounded okey at all i was a screechyteen sound i had flon moments were that quen esantial voice break where you go to sing a note and there is nothing there it is reminding me av it is different but after topsurgery for example i was weak in my upper body that i could not lift a glass i could not open a door and over that period of monsif of learning how to use my upper body again i mean it was these small victoryes when i could hold a mug and it in it did not feel heavy that i was going a drop it in thos croke newly post tea days sandy found himself attempting to sing the songs of artis that he would not ave apbroach before he tried lened coin he tried john he cash none of it was sounding quite right tesasero does a lot of things it changes the way wai is distributed on your body as well as the thickness of your skin and head and even how fostyo hegroes it also thickens the voculcords making some voices break and deepen and sand's voice was braking waiting for this fourth teckade second pubitis of kickin was kind of sereal sandy had had top surgery was growing facial head and now he was waiting for his voice to drop and then one day i sat down at the piano i hit a middle see and i could not sing it wa you knowhat i mean its gone middle see was gone for conducts middle see use to be where i would have started my scales it would have beend kind of just it is the easiest thing to sing is a middle see on my previous voice it what i a s of lo it was not ike a leaning off it was not kind of lek alwids tapering and now it was just o iii i con't do that it yet my voice was gone the voice that i had was honestly a few notes big it was ub sir i sat there at the piano going oh no there is almost nothing here what song can i even make out of such a small ability it was a very horrible thing to all the sudden have my voice go from being the most familiar part of my body on some level to this completely unknown i did not even know what it could do let alone how to make it do it i remember the song where i sang it in it was oh my got this sounds a song what was the song i rem it was your song by elton john which is not a song that i and i remember having this moment of oh my go it is a song i i could feel it it was the first time that i was able to kind of step back and cross my arms and just watch it was i was going wo look at this thing go now i have a much better sense of where the voice starts and where it can get to i've a much better sense of how to actually use it and i feel it when i'm doing it it is a bigger instrument big a how i think when i say that in my mind i'm picturing a violin and a cellow there is some an examples instruments where there is a smaller version that hirer there is a pickalon than there is a flut and it is i'm just rock in a new it is a bigger in its lower in order to make a lower sound you have to move more air through that thing i need more in order o power it e're on the los side of recoodings now that is col e's sandys lid voice i and sin to fo kis you do t nodes i na ee a na you nsandi singing be the eyelish again on his piano at o we were on the foot and i asked him to plai me a couple of songs while e were toking in this third voice the post hose tististerin voice it is the fust i mead song in front of any one beside his husband an a couple of friends is queeks in croaks have e bated but sandy's voices still influnx the voice rehab is on going an mn i noo ming o it is easys to har the difference even only a few months uponce the voice is obviously deepe the more than that its sound strong but he is been practicing n othat sounds more lived in than what you sent me back in much a yet probably of course i had ask sandy to sing changes to i an an i a iana an mas non it o i mchan me bti canrase i mas i that i a tantan i an tan i how did that feel oh l scar how does your voice feel singing it to day o kay yet every day that i wake up and i can just sing its another beautiful glorious gift it is wow here we go i can still do it and some days are better in some days are worse but it is i'm no longer in this period of mark and everything feeling off and searching i'm on the other sde and i'm just living my life his effort lest three oacta first voice and his second unmaintained voice and the rule post tea voice there rull the bones of this new voice that he had to build up himself it is just it is a different sound it is what i enjoy about it in some senses it is a tran's voice i do not know if i sound a cisky i think that i sound something else and i'm a product of a very specific right set of of things that can happen to a body and i i love that too i love that it winds up being a sound that is not others it feels more grown up in a little more fragile perhaps because it is new but also i'm i'm always pushing it i'm always trying stuff that i have not done before something he would never even thoughts to imagine before now was homonizing with himself i had a a moment the other day when we were playing some of my old voice over the stery out and then i in my voice now sang along with it and it a self do at and ther wishes this moment of ana a an a do you ander and i han part of that is just the sheer uncannes of of horse it is the same voice it it is me and you could hear how in a sense faithful a raplica this is with a big difference it felt kind of i was breaking time othit the the kind of fossil ik my old voice in the room an than my new one joining it do wedding with my former voice suddenly my former voice become much more interesting to me im this way where it is not just this thing that i walked away from any a a si get in a a sa osonty had expected tisplits in himself woitd the arrival of a new voice but what was once unfamiliar is somehow now the truest expression of himself he could even say he turned to face

crosswed florescent sbuzzed machines hummed and beaped and the sneakers of hurrying nurses squeaked on rubber floors stephany tried to ignore ithel as she flicked through cline emails on her phone but it was impossible even if she could scren out the noise there was the cloying smell of pathulie oil rachel's favorite from the diffuser by the bed stephany had not thought that ther could be a worse smell than the hospitals mixif disinfectant disease ant cheap cand soup but pachouliy oil was it rachel had been in a comer for six months some bug she would picked up on one of her endless oversees trips to find herself nobody could figure out why she had not woken up yet but the doctors encourage them to keep visiting keep talking to her hoping that something would prompt her to open her eyes typical rachel thought stephany the tention seeking even while on conscious tephany's mother finished her chapter and cras play on an ancien portable tapetec the sound of flutes and wale song filled the air i'm going to stretch my legs said stephan there was a coffee cart by the front door of the building stephany ordered a doublest breso and briefly considered then rejected a sweaty pastry the coffee tasted tarmac she took it outside into the carpark and litter cigarett a man shuffled over he was short and dressed in a long trench coat with the collar turned up and a battered black hat pulled down over his brow a p eye in an old detective series exstep that his skin was green not nautus green but actual green traffic green hallow rachel he said stephany started then shook her head

man grabbed her by the wrist i have something to show you he said he put his other hand on her forehead she felt herself become dizzy then her mind filled with images playing out a film she saw rachel unpacking her back pack in her filthy flat dirty clothes and half red self helpboots and ashtrays overflowin with rachel's foul menthals cigaretts she saw the anty colamp at the bottom the bag racked in an old tetiat she sw rachel rubbing at a tarnish on it and the green man appearing him offering her three wishes as his traditional money sex power thought stephany what else is there but she saw rachel looking at the mess around her i mee to get my shit together rachel told the genie i mean to be more stephany she is got it all husband career big how first wish i want to be stephanie your wish is my command said the genie there was a flash and rachel collapsed to the ground in that instant stephanie or some one who looked stephanie appeared in rachel's apartment she was wearing a tailored cashmir suit and had her hair neatly curled in a bun the stephanie in rachel's apartment walked over to a mirror and stood at it mouth wide stephanie watched stephanie watching stephani in the mirror mira stephanie ran her hands over her body she stared to laugh she turned to the genie this is not what i meant she said i just wanted to know how she gets what she is got but no it is good

she has known hisself to be for many years she ready did not know who would emuge i heads up this dory briefly mention theside his callda in my early twenty is i would sometimes flirt with boys i did not even at parties i didnt want e bea i saying things i'm on the aximum dos of my aunticycotic because i that it made me sound dangerous and i felt a general disclaimer that nothing i sat should be taken seriously now if i say i went off my aunticycotic with no suggestive in flection with no inflection at all at thirty three years old mary to a woman increasingly largic to alcohol this also makes me sound dangerous it not in a socially sanction hot way it cannot escaped the stigma it is there if you are on these pells it is there if you go off the pells this is a story of coming off the pells one night last fall i told my partner a talia that something was of i could not feel sadness or joy i could not distinguished indignation and frustration from excitement i thought it had to do with my current anticycot it watuta i've never experience sycoses but latudas proscribed for other things too i'd been taking it for thoughts that go round and round and a general state of suicidal feeling i struggled with sometimes explosive emotions that i had a hard time regulating and in the year since the original prescription thanks to lots and lots of thorapy i'd grown stronger and more stable the latuda had saved my life but in the way that a sedating dart saves her life it made me solathargec that it was impossible to act out on all my feelings or even to feel them i asked my psycitrus what he thought about maybe going off tholatuda he said he was proud at the work i done over the pass couple years it felt a bespoke commencemen speech i cried and then we made a plan to taper my dos down to cera justo be clar i'm not aunti met i love mets id believe my aunti depresence plorel which i still take or helping me thrive but the latuta was tdifferent it is a havy medication targeting challenges i had a dressed an therapy maybe i was ready to try liyfe without it i'd been on one auntipsycotic or another since my early twenties i did not know what i was without this medication it was an odd feeling to realize that i did not know who i was it baseline as an adult i could be anyone and that was ma be the scarious thing about going off tholatuta what if f i was unrecognizable tetalia or my dog or my editors what if i became unrecognizable to my self i starte tabering off the tuda november and in january i taked a conversation with tall ya about how it was going you and i i have been together lisix yars and this entire time i in on an natosicotic most of the time must and im whand i was thinking about going down on the letuda r off with letuda i was am certainly the person married to me wright now the person that i am on theletuda and i wondered if how you wave been a react to somebody you did not you did not know or mediedin offulato ye ask if i was wore y wita to an no what how do you resipi to i tat let am promptin ye te talk on yeh i see i did don' ask you a yes or no wi an formulating i thought as thoug on an academic an ta you teachers college students and does her best to get me to write with outlines these a statements and evidents to support my findings tall yan i got together in grad school at yee and she often fact checks my memories because those years are a blur i was popping out of an from many altoitens in literature sim in ours in you sidating medications had me falling a sleep in cafes wandering lost in down tine you haven over time with the rotating door of psychiatrests diagnoses and medications including latuda i got better in the ways we measure getting better for mento illness i made plans with france i was productive i wore a lep stad but a deep sadness not away at me all the time that is cared me it made me feel damaged and brokin and radio active in ways i could not even understand i ca si span an how many months since i stopp taking the latuda january febrary marc april may five months no why an an almost afa years how do you remember thit wase januar i kept a diry lit ye those were those ere som an long evening tai i just spent in the better injust i just lying down woul do you remember about when you think about that time wit do you remember a certain feeling i remember may be the first tre months i wanted to to go back to go back en be glad i discourage wal maybe you should say why you discouraged it yes any frequently you would have bad days and you would announce to me that you decided that you needed letuda and i would say to ye o pine that is fine an before you make such a big decision wide you make sure that you are not reacting to withdraw ye just find out ye because once you go back on your girl lose the opportunity to have tat at as if you could just wait it was not because i did not want you to be on thetuda it was honestly because i wanted you to know and think about what now yand you would not have ever gotten the chance to know that n what do you remember about wanting to go back on it thinking you could not do it what do you remember i remember thinking that it was a lot of work ye i remember jus a having a a sense what i always wanted to know was the base line who what i who i was what i was at the base line and awfulan tuda i a did not reallead no right in what i was experiencing at that time wit why really was y but what i did now is that a i was experiencing bodily things the nights wets and the clamming ass and you not these other things that made me feel noda that i constant nada headaches that made me feel an old computer that is just running all the time thas jus feels really really hot i fely the thin this watpen when you ar oldto a there as eruption of a woda and agitation and firstian and go really sare i think od maybe your base line was too much you dint water baselot you ray and end you cet han in a nin there i did contanon there for many months i did not know what was me and what was the withdrawal but slowly the bodily agitation my grains and shivers lifted and i was left with me h the difference between you on and all silatuda is huge it is absoly ge but it is not likea your future wi fear lika different personality coming ow ally that at all no i do not seem to have ars wi it is true i'm not a different person offtiatuta but everything is harder now moving through my day is trying to beat egwhites into a marane without a mixer just a butter knife all effort and i'm bone tired at the end of each da i feel much more sensitive than i have ever felt tender sore and scared a prey animal a baby dear or a yorkey with a bob cat for a neighbor it takes almost nothing to make me fall apart not being able to open ajar dropping a mug of coffee taking the weather personally i fell apart multiple times a day but it also takes almost no time to gather myself now if i feel overwhelmed i excuse myself to another room said a fifteen minute timer the last that ase and cri i watch a vidio about chipmong facts narrated by a young man who seems as delighted by chipmunks as i am and then i'm fine i'm back downstairs making coffee scheduling doctor's appointments an zou meetings sometimes even before the alarm goes off the tuda which was supposed to protect me from emotional intensity which was supposed to prevent me from breaking down just kept me stuck in bad sad about being sad i've also noticed that i can concentrate better now for longer stretches of time for a while on the tuda i could not read not at all i could only rearead and that feugt lonely i'm reading again one morning i took my dog and demons on a walk in the nearby woods i was midway through the first chapter of edith warton's house of mirth on audiobok i was kind of star struck starry a about the rhythm of per sentenc says the wickedness and speed of her wey and the sensuous appreciation of melodrama i felt a bit a teany bober i felt about wharton the way i felt about john mayr and seventh grate and room for squares came ow and on it the song your body is a wonderland i'm confronting strangers again that is back maybe it is because i grew up in new york under julioni or because my dad had an explosive temper and once my brother was born i learned that if i was scared someone with more power was going to

wellfolks there is something called the dunning cruger effect dunnincruger effect is a bias in the brain that you tend to think you are better at something than you actually are and the dunnin crugeraffect is widely held across a wide variety of skillsets in the united states is also held in general by lot ofpeople who think they are smarter than they actually are but it is particularly held by people who have been made un touchable by the system if you' been made untouchable by the system and you have just been rizing through the ranks for years based on say your intersectional identity you are going to think you are much better and more competent od things than you actually are and then get away with a lot more this is the story of fanny willis fanny willis is the fulton county district attorney she is the person was brought charges against president trump based on supposed violation of reco law which as we have explained on the show really does not appli in this particular case it is certainly a legal stretch she is attempting to make her name by getting at donald trump particularly in a state cort becaseif yecan get donald trump on state charge whele the ye cannot pardon himself if you come president of the united states well things started to fall apart for fanny willis over the last couple of months sheas a heroine in the media she was she was a hard charging prosecutor wwas going to finally get trump and then it turns out that she is k example of the dunning cruger effect but with ae intersectional twist because she thought that apparently she could get away with literally anything just for background wet me playyoueclip a fanny willis explaining before she was elected d why exactly she should be the d here she is because they deserve a d that will not have fict with it employ because they desarva d that will not put leddle in their old poke when it should go to benefit childre because we deserve better o now as we 're about to find befulten county people did not actually receive that d apparently according to forbes willis faces accusations she violated state conflict of interest in public money laws ov her claims from a group of trump codefendence that she engaged in an improper clanduston personal relationship the se mere relationship wit a man named a thanial wade who really had very little prosecutorial background but was appointed the special prosecutor to help her out in the fulton counticase against a donal trump wait ind willis apparently travelled together on two vacations according to cor documents and state records reveal that wade earn more than six hundred and fifty fousin dollars working with willis yesterday there was a hearing about all of this it was a it is an evidentiary hearing in cort in which the defendings asked that she essentially be removed from the case for conflict of interest and fanny willis for some od reason decided she was going to testify now this came after shead basically destroyed her own time lines to the question here was wether she had hired this guy because she was supercompetent she would paid him and then they fell in lave an they started going on cruis in having saconal he rest or whether she had known the guide for a while and she decided to bring in her lover to pay him state tax pare dollars and then gone vacations with hem with with state tapare dollars and did that not based on the interest of th people of fontan county but based on her own personal interest in the guy she was stubping well si willis and manny of her employs had been sopena to testify apty evident hur hering to determin whether she should be disqualified from the case and last week she'ld try to stave off her testimony and that completely failed yesterday first they called a bunch of fanny willis is employes her pals here is one of fanny willis's pals explaining that fanny willis actually was in romantic relationship with nethan with nathan waded as early is twenty nineteen her name is robin yerty she was considerativeswe will see a friend of fanny willis but then hey got very gossipy and and a kenafellapart for fanny willis on t stanp here was at the friend a former stafford the foten county district attorney's office robin yearty talking about the relationship between willis and waded you are without going at all that the patakinty thous ther ter dout your mind a tente thousand nateen til te thousand twenty two on miss fwillis n mister wa were it a romantic relationship what is the question im fere no doubt that there were me anto relation ho wi in effect onte thousand nineten to the last oftystop with her no no an not fased on your personal obter atien an obser an yer speaking wit tanteen in together tane ike got e no case that is what she testified and really there two issues in the seven entiary hearing is she number one is when fanny willis started dating nathan waded if it was earlier than the appointment which suggests of course that she appointed him because she' stubbing ham s that is question number one and question number two is even if she was dating him after they got to gether on the case was she then expending tax pair dollars on him in ways that she would not any other employ shat's question number two and fanny willis fails on both accounts iell it is more on this in the second first going on lone without expressive pin it is using your smartphone without a pro tective case but's the time probably is fine iall takes is one accidental drop on a solid concred to make you wish you would protected yourself

they then called nithan waided and waid tries to deny that he was dating willis in twenty twenty he tries to claim that because he had fone of cancer it was not possible for him to have romansic relationshid because he was trying to isolate i it did not go over amazingly well in court he was swenting bullets nathan waide as you ould imagine yno a o ai tat ae er ds' i o dis you indicated a ir

her because i cancer at the times to well you were a pretty non serol that in tire time i'm assuming that you could have been in a room with herdating her at the time wain was then force to explain about his sex life with vanning willis ans a things got awkward have you had a personal relationship at all and what i mean by that after the summer of twenty twenty three at you asking me if i intercourse with the discaton i was trying not to but i i guess e it yu in a character i todas that answer would be tanse would be now it is been curely professional sence to summer of twenty twentyte that is where we havin issues im ya you will have to explain caus i do notknow what the issue would be no i will explain to e im is you say personal om we are very good tri poably cosel teer become o be the tack would dif you askhim mebot s inter course be tan tou es mo abet e by chage frorm intercourse to romanc no o case then what the hell is huk a gase wai then admits that he was paid for a bunch of stuff that was really not appropriate he paid for things apparently using the taxpar dollars he would been paid for sles tav they went on a cruise he would pay for that using his business credicard and to the question is well was the state essentially paying him to then take her on romantic cruisis an re he says none ter no because she paid me back in cash that is going to be the excuse now is that whatever state dollars flowed to their relationship in appropriately it was not really an appropriate because she had fat stacks of cash in in the safe i'm not kitting thats the actual defense the nathen waighed and fannywell's try to use ier is that in the actitatat that you roughly share tow ra yousma thou thi's rawfuly car howel your tank he remark ye to do and wereid you depathet the mon e rammer o c shen to do me ti i she hare notin hash r her carholl i she shier youll stuck out o you and to all the vications that she tok she paint you cash r ismand you heri ll thevication on your biti act and you included tos in tedoctions on your aces ra tat ye did not a gase again his claim in this gost clam nmber two a clem number one is that he was daning her before he was esshe hired claim number too is that they were taking business trips that is airoquotesfor those listening around the world and that he was paying for them ba sgleesing tax pare dollars and then she was reimbersing him for her half in cash right's that hit did not look as though they were basically scamming the government out of money that is that is essentially the claim that she is making the the counts vailing claim would be that she paid him six hndred fifty thousand dollars to be a prosecutor an area where he has no qualifications in orders that they could gone romantic vacase s together at this point fanny willis decides she must testify now first of all let me to s be clear any time you ared the subject of any sort of court proceeding it is almost invariably a horrible idea to say you one testify this is why every defense council ever will tell you do not get on the stand very few people are goold witnesses in their own defence the really bad witnesses fanny willis happens to suffer from two things one she is not telling the truth and too she also happens to be one of the most off putting witnesses in human history the donin cruwger affact that i discusted the very top yer that of fact is obviously present with th nnywellis it is almost beyond comprehension this lady thinks she isgoodet her job she thinks that she is convincing she thinks that she comes off as honest and forthright and rightchous and she comes off as preciselee the opposite she comes off as obnoxious and lying and scheming and it is really bat vannuwels blows up on the stand we truly blows up it is more on this in just one second first i've been talking about bmy he lick sleep mattress for years as i've had my helik sleep mattress round almost a deckade at this point it was made

wwor ow wo all she gets on an a she is standing there st momes wos miss cross i don' lik you an spee we miss wells tos maybe there withdrawing the objection to the motion or mors miss poswo take a lev ere a oer eo e tison of the dis returnif this poinas that she is no longer i intesting missi him miss mersins allis next womes she had tried to not testify and natshe is going to testifyeso she strides up aggressively to the witness box and now is the moments o first she starts off by suggesting that making her even answer questions is contrary to democracy which his werd because it seems actionally as well within the boundaries of democracy to ask whether the d a who is prosecuting donald trum for political reasons is in fact a corrupt person who ise having sacs with the other prosecutor and paying him vast quantities of tax paricash well takeing vacations with m here she is getting very very self righteous about theole situation is nat trthe matmesser way her ovn an i con i o do a man owe wee ws intrete ofo i think gre on very i on bee to i'm not a hostilely i ey e want can be ot more wit your hostile is worl to be ea wirst wi heriters ar poseis mercans i her interup pori contre contrary to democracy not o mine that mean a case o firstshe terrible wawyer the sound hostile witnesses the way that it works in a criminal trial or a civil trial acturally is a hostile witness when you have seen it untiv soms e permission to treat te witness is hostile and what that means is that weny witness is sa witness for the defense and a prosecutor is prosecuting thn they can cross examine the witness ithe can ask more adversarial questions becaue they are not a friendly witness it does not mean your affect is hostile or not hostile she is even know wit that and she is the decacounty i love that that the the the defendins interests are contrary to democracy because the claim is the td defendence tried to overturn election therefore she is completely scot free on the question of whether she is in fact a corrupt public sarted and then she goes full out she goes full al potce kno in anjustice foral you are out of order you are out of other sine ire cort is out of order here we go fannywellus well on te miler i object to you getting reccor to din intrusive in to people's personal live you confused you think i'm on trial these people are on trial for trying to still an election an twenty twenty i'm not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial well i mean its an eviden sour hearing to determine whetheryou should be disqualified partechnically in this particular portion of the trial your actions are on trial but guess what brazenness is not going to substitute for actually being innocent in this particular case it gets worse and worse for her she sarts yelling about the media she is the media lied about her which is weard because again she is the one who apparently lied a lot and i her fo mone al i testimony ton i get only made efent to that i wul be you naex witnes and i think very anxious to have thi conpersation in to day i ran to the corsho i tin as i ewenthe is er wai o has fin a fin ye just assume you wu be nat itness n only

argument i i dou ot that just the argma e a o id under troto the arguo thi mornin waer atama body i tot gein excelent gial teni ou how ti onest you er with the cort on monday and i'm actually surpive that becan contin tin titeiyer i am well she what what would a heroin here she is a she throws her friend unerthboutts remember robin erty her her former friend who tustified that she and nathan wade were romantic in twenty nineteen and i here she is throwing her friend under the buss yo wa hanger or five whatever o plasifit as have you been frends it her i had not spoken to robin in o over a year i tirly not consider her fin now o think that she i te tan o e te go o ponis an i thin that she betraye of ratyou now she betrayed the friendship i apparently talking about what this lady was doing outside school o ga then she gets to the question of the cash that she gave to nathan wade she says dory that cash was never that' serious there there is not what i gave him cash w i mean it is a little weird is it not o i herig o say othe rabout you dn't kno of that has ior e te rat maw you i care ter ice no teste money gratly o i'm not when i allow you to mis carry to ra my tistals i know that i keep money in my house the amount the money i gave mister wad hit was never that therio it only i never handed him more than twenty five hundred dollars in arian bert we not talking about twenty thousand dollars in ca i do not hav twenty thousand dollars in cash right now the most i ever gaved him i know i gave him twenty five hundred dollars won we to believe because we went to one on hotel and then we went to a second hotel that twenty five hundred ollar actually gave him mollar fil in believe i know that the arube trip the one that you describe with his mon think i gave him about two thousand dollars bor that trip for lie total o gat then she was asked iman why do you pay him back in ash but there is no record of you actually reimbersing him for your haf of the travelin gan that looks a kickbak if if i hire my wife and or anybody else and that person is it a close personal relationship with me and i pay them a lot of money and then we take cruises together that the other person is paying for the id dea is that i'ms fos to pay for my half she demonstrate that i'm not actually stealing money from the government but there is no record of her having paid back nathan wade instead she says that she paid him back in cash she was asked why jacl you paid bas waitin cash all the time and i here is her not very convincing answer the money ha at te way tha half in october a twenty twenty tar you non't know wher that money i do know wet came from te came fom my weatin to you wit jobi eres wa on't o you noer titi comfome i came from i don' not o would you talkin ye could have come for o a private do because before i was the a i was in private practiceso i learned money doing that time to i is probaly i ye it oft odt hav would you mean i do not know i ame fom i had

down with your intimating i dear i'm af mi ot me pothat you ma ma a nee pun fit what i di till it do wit o aa i have fom om probably fin trin os action if an believe tha probably thin five hundred dollars on my card she has no prove that she actually paid wed pack and i love that the lords lik yon you prove tht sic wl ive just gave you the prif i set it that is not prove that that there is evidence that you set it but the whole question is whethe you are lying or not i we gan just take it face value that you claim the thing et's more on this in just one second first think about the joy you feel when you tree yourself to something new slipping into a new pair of lounge where it is a simple yet telightful experience i get that feeling every time i put on tommy john because tommy john

fanny wellus basently admits to a campaign finance violation apparently she says that she took money from her campaign and kep that which i do not believe you can do for personal use last i tract my question ons where di that cashorigal comif it any can o bak casis an plengeib a cash for years in my hot for me to tell you the sorce the woney comes from when you go to public thingyou buy fom y get fifty dollars o throwt in there when yiu'v been my whole lihe when i took out a large amount of money on my firsth campaign i ha from the cash of that what now again first roll of criming folks do not admit to the criming yet that was grate that was really really but she concluded with an explanation that she does not wine she likes o grery goes semming again this went amazingly well for fanny wellas and for the anti trum team in this particular case here she was me sust lose up on the stand here it is it is wild muchle cash at tom probably four five hundred dollars an ma not paid for o a pon ufta i think we ded too differ wine tor if she did shuerfit to om hake ot bout hand he likes wine i do not li nike win to be on the i great shouks gragoose that is the important thing as you expend six hundred fifty thousnis expare money on the got yoursnipping ye that is that is the important thing wer even emas anbe see was o there goes the georgia case an must ten be see had on a former federal proscur name chuck rosenbrig said i it may be time before fanny willis you leave if it is determine that they have apparently mis that even before the gentuals in this case se think we should beach a point were for the interat of protecting the trial entirefoln county trial a that they should voluntarily stu as as of is a great question this is not going well for the state a it could turn out an ka at it might turn out worst to your point a it might be appropriate for miss willis to consider wemoving herself from this case now and turning the rains over to a senor official in in the district atturnys office let himer her handle it it is worse than that because donal trumps ta turnies her can be able to make very obvious and clear case that fanny willis ginned up this entire case she sheshe she could hirer in high profile fashion the gui she was stipping sho she could gone expensin cruise with him as con mbe a very easy case to make and i'm not the only person making natkase over on he mess and be see is an annalistnam carolin policy she says the same thing she is this case against trump is pretty much dead in the water do not let the lega le for you this is apect tit this monu mantau if things are going in the direction we think a hony willi li to the court if the game over for her she will be disqualified im if they had a relation ship prior to when they a represented to to the court it is it is a huge daylike a canover state it gat yep i'm this is a problem this a problem lemi jus make clear one thing for all those who wish to be associated with or two targa donal trump donal trump is the monkey's paw the monkey's paws a short story in which people discover a magical monkey's paw where if you actually make a wish upon it you get your wish but in the worst possible way that is exactly donals frum fannywillis got her wish donal trump made her famous downal trom me er prominent dnal trum may and up putting her in jail which jus just hysterical the way this is working out we bet a fine farewell the fanny willis whose career is abasidly over because once again the tunning crogruff a undefeated for a lot of people and the reason tit exists is specifically because of the intersectionality here in the same day that this is going on thyour times ran in entire piese titled why the case against fanny willis youls familiar to black women and i just have a question why should that feel familiar o black women our black women routinely mis appropriating funs in order to pay off the person theire stipping it isems a little racis but according to the new or times tangalla hollis palmer fell ta sedence of pride when she learned that fanny willis the dea of fulen counts georgia and one of the nations to elected black female prosecutors would leave the election interference case agains for a presinen trump but that pride would be tempered by dismay as news emerged of miss willis's personal relationship with a fellow prosecuer nathan j wade and outside lawyer she helped to she hired to help run the case miss hollis palmerf a black fort year old turning for mississippi is mostly uset a critic's trying she said to discredit miss willis at first youa skepticale of the elegations but when miss willis herself conceded the relationship miss hollis reserve tome disappointment for the prosecutor who should have used a little more discretion and a little better judghment she said again the idea here is that the reason that she is being targeted is not because she is in fact corrupt it is because she is black and that is why by the way there is all these questions about t e i surrounding people fanny willis about a firmative action surrounding people fanny willis about people comal harrison competent of their jobs suddenly vice president of the united states in air apparent to the whitehouse in theire lod be blat that where vary an compatent and why variety of speres and if the entire society tells them they are not subject on maritocracy that is hi gon it with fanny willis as the district attorney in foltin county blowing op whatever case she is going to bring against donal trump in the first place

march march twenty fifth oqueen to york judge that of course is the idiotic alvan brag case against donal trump claiming the donal trump for some od reason violated state campaigng fin ance laws by violating feteral campagn finance laws by paying stormy danuels pay off money be quiet about theire affair that is that case it is foolish there is really no basis for it butt that trial is going to move forward in new york city that is the latest on that meanwhile there is a do j case that is currently being brought by special council david whise againsta former aff behind in formant this would be the informant who claimed that president trobidon and son hunter we are involved with beresma holdings the person who they are now proscunes got int alexander smernof he has facing charges in connection with ling to the fban creating false records to corngstanan he as rested thursday in los vagus apparently the invictment alleges that smernov's story to the fba was quit a fabrication an a malgam f otherwise unremarkable business meetings in contect that it actually occurred but at a later day than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching berizman tht effendante services an products not for iscussing bribes to jobidon when he was in offic ther bunch of fpamemos that contained his talk about how berizma wanted to pay joe and hunter or five million buxs o peace an all the rest of it and now the fpe i is is saying that he lied about it and they are going to prosecute him over this the question the democrats are are making it that one theyr bringing is there suggesting that because smernof was lying this dis credito averything related to berizmaand hunter and jo which of course it does not that was supplementory material that supported a lot of the allegations that were made about hunter and jo and t was very torect but again unsupported by sort of further evidents about actual payments of five millin dollars to jobidn but it does not end all of the questions about joe hunter and trafficing in the in the bidin business name thit is rases questions as to whether the deoja's actually targeting this gui because he lied to the fbii or whethe ther targting ham in an attempts to basically get bidon off the hook for the second time in e last couple of weeks he did violate classfied document statues but they also said he seeno s that is lad yobidn is being let off the hook ukan meanwhile and what i think is far more important news than any of these legal developments the leading critic of vladmerpouten has now been found dead in prison wer has died in prison under unspecified circumstances this is an actual important world o men elexin ofvalny is was in h anti coruption campaigner who was widely seen as the chief rival to ladmerpouten in russia unclear how he died he was merely forty seveny years old he had been sentence on a bunch of trumped up charges to a penal colony penalty of more than thirty years he had been behind bar since januar twenty twenty one accordig to walstr journal when e returned to russia from germany where he was recovering after he would fallen ill during a flight inside of russia hei he got sick whileis on the flightins had russia he then flew to germany to seek treatment then upon reaching germany doctor's concluded that he had actuolny been poison with a soviat era nerve agent called novichak which is again one of the things that vladmerpoutan does he tents to poison his critics nvanly for years was a large scale critic of ladmerpouten up until his arrest he came back from exile who was immediately arrested by by vladmerpouten's team and then he was sentenced and thn he was moved to an arctic prison sto remote that at first nobody knew where the helly was meanfor for literally weeks they shuttled him arounds that nobody could find out where he was td then finally he released a message saying that he was in a place that was extremely cold far in the north where all he could see were some dogs insom snow basically curiou footage of navany from yesterday in a qourt apperance and as you can see he looks alive and wile e was skinning obviously but this does not look somebody who is on first death obviously this him literally yesterday i asked the walz returnal reports nivaone's death practically extinguishes the last real political on opposition that still remained inside russia following gland repudents invasion of you prane his cracked on on free speech and the passage of increasingly draconian laws aimed at stamping out any descent nivanes time in yell reflected the worst accesses of judicional inprison system that is increasingly been used to punish puden's political opponents he had suffered ar alarming health ailments in prison issues that it worse in in recent mones his woaers ere basely cut off from all access on him he was growing increasingly ematiated in biddyo appearances in quart again every one suspects because people gets suicided regularly and i and deathe by natural class is regularly if thereopponents of land reputen that a the put mechine finally had nough the lectin valny and they felt the threat from the outside or from nvany or from ay te inside of russia and it was just a convenient time to to get rid of lacy nvalney and ifvalney again large skel cridic of the cremlin in two thousand twenty nivany did not interview on sixty minutes and i and here he was on sixty minutes talking about his poisoning i said to the flight attendment and i cand of shocked him with my statement awell i was poisont and i'm going to die and i immediately lay di under his feet olexy navolny was on a flight to moscow from siberia where he would been campaigning against puten's party in a local election when he collapsed with no pain but knowing he was dying ax should ever sell of you body just at telling you that is body wad don and i gathered they suspected poison right away yes of course meanwhile his teeman siberia searched his hotel room collecting things navolnum may have touched this water bottle which the doctors in berlin sent along with a blood sample to a german military lab to see exactly what the poison was and the answer was anoverchuck they discovern o i chalk this not edgent in my blod in the inside of by all my body and alwhas botal from the hotel that is why we now we know that i was poison in the hotel because i ell it is again it is just a pure spiculation because no one knows wat what what happened exectle but i think that when i was maybe put some clos with thes an this poison on me i tatch it with the hant and then i sep

essentials for fifteen per cent off to day o cam meanwhile the question of course is why was in volney poysand in the first place involney was on sixtey minutes and here he was explaining why vladmerpun trad kill him but why would puten on a poison alexey navalney when we first met navalney three years ago he was running against putent for president he had made a name for himself by getting his hands on in criminating internal financial documents related to high level officials and posting them on a blong to these dorcuments that you got prove corruption absolutely i work as e ristl blor and i'm not afrait t announce the names he says he found that the cremlin's inner circle was accumulating vast amounts of wealth and publish pictures of multiple homes and yachts he moved on to erring docu mentories on you tube with vityof the officials lavish life style and it is si it is something very special about mister putzon that is his crazy bout money personal mona about his family being reach his france o his the people who was sor he with hum wit the in the cge b all of them ther bilin a that is why fightsing corruption means for him that his fightsing me a and now he has fought him to the pointment of balney is is dead men the realityes the ladmapunis te ficious dictator who kills his political opponets men the list is as long as your arm if people tho vladmer puten has killed ranging from journalist to fellow olegarcs to to disidends who have challenged him in any sort of way at home and abroad by the way he has had people killed well outside the worders of of russia and this is why i have to say it is pretty whild that tucker carlson did not just interview puten which was fine as i talkes about on the show at length when tucker interview puten i thought he do difine chob all he did with let putentock and i thougt it was illuminating and interesting and then tucker went on to a chenshilly act as he prop agan is for vladmerput an russia he went on to act as a as a sort of walter to ranty burney s anders knock off he has spent the days since his interview with pooten galevanting around moscow and doing what pretty much opurest to be almost identical to burni standers level propaganda on behalf of the russian regime mi stay this because here for example is a burniyg standers sor to ninteen eighty eight talking byt the manchec of one of moscow's train stations just to give you sort of a background here here is a here is burniy the statioens themselves absolutely beautiful a inincluding many works of a shandlus ti wit beautiful it was a very very fect of an tucker began his tour of moscow by going to one of the train stations in moscow now a few things here he is said before that moscow's train stations are clean theire home less there do you not were about being pushed in front of a train and actually defended that statement to the extent that i think that major american states have done an awful job with crime eu nows just incamp to new jersey which is oneo the crime capitals of the united states is a fact o the american cities have done a terrible job in terms of cracking town of crime that happens to be trup bu that is not what but tuckers swing here tucker is doing something a little different which is suggesting that the entire regime upon which the train station is base he goes to a train station than basically says because this train station is ninetan has shanda leaders people in rush or living wonderful lives under the totalage of lanmer pooten and he keep saying that sort of thing over and over and over again which is strainge because he does not ashing to make that claim if he wants to claim that the ou ctranians shuld not be supported by american tax pair dollars you can make that claim without actually going full deranty but as wh as robertown ing gunor might they never go fuld deranty in any case here was a here is tucker at the at the moscow station oe o the ways you understand a society is through its infastructr the places where people gather the places where they go to travel you got a lot of people in one places tells you a lot about the people with that in mine we are standing in front of the kive skyo matro station an is train station next to it thehe metrestatemens build by joseph stalin seventy years ago and the question is howsi doing now after seventy years we went into it to take a look and what we have found shocked us now that is not an endorsement of stallin who was bad obviously noris an in dorse when the crain presitin bly thing ere pho you may ot him either but it does not change the reality of what we sow or or precisely did not se te noperfeeding there is no filth w no faw smells they are no bumbs or drugadics or waipis for people waiting to pus you on to the train tracts an kill you now it is perfectly clean and orderly and how do you explain that whyre not even going to gass that is not our job we are only go to ask the question and if you are response as to shouted us slogans domber than the slogans we use to call sopiet and mock that is not really an answer how dois rosh a country were told us they ga station with new clear weapons havein stupway station and all people used to get to work an home every single day that is nicer than anything in our country whe're not cin gan we are o co speculate where dus goin to raise the question and wait for some one in charge to give us that answer what is the anse i stop the lectur and lett you take a look for yourself at what the capscya matro station in moscow russa look li to day i' gay nina pase feen secon he is not con speculate on what the answer is here a i'll give you the answer the answer's very clear every dictatorship has certain areas they are extremely clean where they bring of foreign journalists to show them how clean those areas are in fact that is precisely wy this train station was built in nineteen thirty five this particular train station was open the is o riginally created i guy named lazar koganovitch who happen to be one of joseph stalen's right hand men the way that the trainstation was built s they hiredta bunch people who would actualy built the london under coun and to go tothe last to get people to build it for them and then they basically jailed all those people because they knew how the moscow train stations were working and also in order to fun this thing they had to bring in a bunch of workers and they to pay those workers whell how t exactly to they did they pay those workers they needed har curren sy to buy all of the instruments in order to build this particular train station how did they get all that stuff whell the answer is they went over to you crain they stole all the grain and they murdered all the coolocks the halladamar is actually one of the reasons why you have a beautiful train station rght here but that does not even answer wyet nice now e answerlites nice now is because dictators have always been able to clean up a particular train stations that is not answer as to whether the country it self is in good shape the countrysult is that isnt pretty terrible shape actuallye if you go to pion yang they are beautiful pictures of some of the subway stations in pon yang that is in north corea north corea is a shochole this bazar notion tat you can go to one train station and then suggest that something is being done right over all by the regime tbecause the one train station is nice again iiv fully take the cretique an an agree with the cretite that the train stations in the united states ie rom ly garbage in big cities new york and that they are too dangerous theresbeen no one more procop than i have been on the issues but tht's not the argument tuckers making he is makin the argument that somehow the regime over all is bizar ly legip and it 's all done by implication riht i'm not even going to speculate i'm not even what i mean you could jus say what i say am you cut you could youn't have to speculate the reason the train station is nice ys because laderbuttan spends dectitorial resources on keeping that train station nice and the reason the rest of russhi is i really badshape is because ladmr boden' spent all of the resources making the train station nices and tkelling his political aponens electing of olty thi's all happening the same week that he kiled the lecing of olne an all likelihood in prison after jailing him on specious charges by the way and then just it make sure that it is not commentary you get the actual full scale propagand to bee rule from the moscow railway station here we go thay february twenty twenty for in the middle of a war here it is is a beautiful train station sois one in pyong yane in fact were the highways in germany in nineteen thirty sex it turns out the pretty much aerdi there is place invasiane that aure supernice every single dictatorship on planet earth has great places to show foreign journalists wil they have shandeliers in the simein electiong of all these not con to see those any time soon but they dyou have shandeliers in the subways and that is the important thing is not it that it is well wit and that this one train station is is grat nat this is not even the best sort of bizar vidio from from tucker that he is released in the last three days he also released evidio in which you went to a russian supermarket and now honestly whath this vidio shows to me more than anything else and again the entire idea here is that youre suppost to be enraged at the united states because you went tal russian super market yes she says that in this vidio and ow i will point out many things about this particular vidio because it is truly connoman astonishing vidio remember this is well russia is in themiddle of invading a sovereign contry in you grain the warning crain has killed a couple hundred thousand people on theucraninside play three hundred thousand people on the russian side the russian economy is really really week the this itince in russia our imprisoned or killed or both is in the case of laxite nof oney bu tucker did go to a grocery store said he could talk about about america is in the weirdest way possible here is tucker a long standing feature may be the longest standing feature of cold war propaganda in the wast was the soviet grocery store no products no choices shoddily made things and it was not actually propagettit was real and you could lok ap the pictures on the inte if you want we thought it be interesting to take a look at a contemporary modern da twenty twenty four russian grocery store two years into sanctions here we are or a tre we go i guess to put in ten roubles here and you get it back when you put the cart back it is free but there is an intentive to return it and not joust brigate yore home wast in camp o k ss thea grocery gard has scillit this is disined i'm ving en us out now where the wheels do not move they lar on the grocer cardesco look ba no hands retail placeman herslito ith different you walking through masings to get the hold o k we have got throug te perfume section to get to the grocers organa trying by what a family forward by every week an to see what the selections o rons i a aand russian famous for its bread is one thing i can asess pretty well the low carblife tall is not swept russia a thank heaven because the an lioget that it is fresh to ir that ounacorn and many mells er o con a russian we os ny coffee do not i dont jist the sugar o flower beons with you bu e it looks a staple we should get it it is a very good king packis scoty flowry and this is russian wine its from crimia which on only has the one water nabl base but also is the source of most of the grapes a in this part of russia for one sos cowel crget shes us check out of a grocery store and you have got gum racer blades and candy actually they hidtulatulates stillen but these are all seem to be western products mars twix snickers milky way bounty co lat as possdrops men tos it is prettynon sanction jimmy but what o i know i went from amuse to legitimately angry a we were guessing what the wi cost everybody hears from the nite states by droceries and we do not pay any attention costes weare jus putting in the cart where we would actually eat over week and we all came in around four hundred box byforner buxs a it was a hundred and four dollars you ask here and that is when you starts o realize that ot ideology maybe does matters much as you thought tro rubshin if you take people's standard of living and you tanket through filth and crime and inflecion and they literally cannot by the groceries they want that point may be matters less what you say whether youare good person or a bad person your wrecking people's lives in their country and that is what our leaders have done to us and coming to a russian grocery store the heart of eevle and seeing what things cost now people live it le radicalize you against our weaders that is how i feel anyway radicalize were i makigany this up by the way two things there weres noting here one th it diddn't matters your good or batner how corrupt it is long as there are no homeless people at the sublastation youn't kill lucy f balney but as long as you can sok a benan is the grocery store does any one really should you complain really anumber one there is that which is absurd on its face on im on more level and then you just have the be sic misunderstanding of how economics works but gou really really be sic misunderstandig of how economics works little secret about supplying demand if it turns out that youare in a poor country if you are a rich american everything looks super duper cheap i know it isto mazing if i go t ven as wala whatever i have in my wallt will pobably by half the country right now is that because ven is waylights an amazing economy productor cheap there it is amazing or is that because i'm a rich american and the exchange rate means i can get prety much whatever i want and you than' any poor country in the world i can lat why do you think american tourists are up charged on everything if you go the shook in israel or an arab market anywhere and you are an american nd here is negotiatin with guy and they realize yor american they will up the price why do you think that is cause they know you have money at it is the thick that is the whole thing by the way there is many things that are wrong with what tucker is saying here it is gon a radicalize you tha you go to a poor country an things are cheaper which is how does he think that that the wage base in he united states has been under cut by foreign competition because wages in other countries are cheapers that because things are amazing in say chin u for those wage labors after all they can get their food euven ore paying them nothing in orer to radicalize yourself off of off of the fact that food is cheaper comparatively in russia than it is in the united sate's for in american i say for n americans im to get you how expensive is if you are russian in a second you have to want to be radicalized you have to want to do the propagan to work and i gan tuckard n have to do this all tuckerhad to do and if he steps outside moscow by he way things are way worse he is being led tyou the nicest areas of moscow he is being taken to the bulshboy bellat and he is being taken to the moscow transation and to the really nice up scale super market if yeu took a three mile ride outside moscow things would look very very different but that that is the kind of amazing thing about all this let mes tell you something about how it works if you are a russian if you are russian russia has a per cappen a ge ty pe of thirteen thousand dollars it per cappen a g t pe of thirteen thousand dollars the percapita g d p of the united states to day is seventy thousand dollars seven zero compare to thirteen it is worse than that by the way because per cappen a ge typet is not tell you even remotely theentirer story of who has all the wealth in russia bout five hundred oligarcs a premage all the wealth in russia legitimately all of it in fact the median salary which is a good representation a sort of the average persan in russia rangeis anywhere from about five hundred ninety bucks per month in july of twenty twenty three acorning to sperer invects about seven hudred fifty bux month now do the quick math you are tung mellic less than eight thousand dollars tha year would be themedian salary in fact according to studies sixty plus per cent of russians spend half their salary on food half of it that is not remotely what americans spent on food because why we are real rich over here and that means that we can support higher prices that they cannot support in russia in other words tuckers over ther being all my goblick out cheap the is in every russion is looking at that bill and their thing himselves that is it that is a lot of that is that is a lot of money an he says this would support that that what he had in is cart would support a family for a week right that that is whady sys suggests in tht cossicg a hundred bux and to him that is really cheap but as i just set the average monthly salary of a russian the median monthly salary is six hundred buck month 's oft a hundred bucks to feed a family for a week theire four weeks in a month last i chect that means youre spending well in access of two thirds of what you earn in any given month just on food in russia and in fact when when he suggests that well they on't have inflation over here becaus m men lookut cheap things are eight's the opposite it is the opposit the exchange rates to the rouble has scy rocketed in other words ian american dollar goes way farther in russia then it would in the united states specifically because everybody in russia is much poorer in facticumecy in the vidio tucker shows footage from the supermarci cash register of how much that cost and it was something nine thausin four hndred eighty one roubles and he says that comes outs a hundred and four dollars in other words the exchange right right now is one one dollar is ninety two roubles ain two thousand ten one dollar was about thirty roubles perti let inflation and bad economies russia hasninflation an abat economy in fact just over the course of twenty twenty three tconsumer price inflation was eight per cent in twentyt twenty two it was thirteen point eight per cent and for particular products cabbage or oranges the increase in prices was in access of seventy per cent wife in russia is not good under fladnerpooten do not be fooled bi the train station with the shanda leaders full on twenty three per cent of the russian population does not have indoor plumming yeu head over out to the rural areas not to the center of moscow the richest area what you will finds that forty eight per cent of russians in those areas still use outhouses eighteen per cent additionallys two thirds of russians wor livng in rural areas do not have in dor plumming eighteen per cent have zeros suage system not even in outhouse than have a pite thell get that is how things are working in russia to day and as for the supposed joys of livin in russia they ave a twenty one per cent alcohol is em rat in russia for men and women about five hundred thousan aborsians pere year in russia russia's population right now it is a prosimatly a hundred and forty three million the united states population right now is approximately three hundred and thirty one million wou have bot a million aborsions a year in the united states which is awful and horrifying and terrible in everybody including tucker hates that russia's aborsion rte is far higher than that of the united states well hndred ten per cent of russians actually atten church on a on a monthly basis forget about a weekly basis a monthly basis in other words propagandizing for this regime is a lie it is it is bad it is wrong in tuck ralso went to a mc donalds over in russia it it ist mcdonalds that they would been transferred over to russian control because mc donalds decided that they could nation make money in russia it does the same thing he is amazed by the quolity of the it it is amazing it is just the same as mc donalds whell yaxs a mean it was a mc donalds and then they just turned over this particular train to the russian se e owe of mc donalds they sold it to him what tucker neglect to tell yus that for several months in say twenty twenty two they did not have french fris tbecause be potato harvest was not good enough as reported by the associate o press of the time now why is any of this important tbecause the juxta position of what tucker is doing to prop up russia as some sort of wonderful model to emulate for the united states which is what a lot of these vidios are about again specific critikes of the united states when it comes to our positions on crime for example i i agree with that les otucker is doing here it is clearly nowatucker is doing here he is kee continue stake hes being raticallize byt hings low prices in russia because to poor country or that he is amazed by the fact that they have things that are common place in the united states well one thing i noticed is that when it comes to population maigration not a hull of a lot people from america migrating to russia lot of people fom russia migrating to the united states and that is for a reason be the question of what is indicative of of haveladmerputent rules the death of elexing valny er the fact that they tell of shandeleders in the moscow train station it is pretty clearly death of elexy nevalny that is without any political reference to what is going on in eu craine there is this strain that is grown on both the right and the left that suggest that america is somehow not the greatest place in the world that america is actually quite terrible and tat if you go to other countries these other countries are better there is certain things about other countries they could tar superior to the united states you could you' say thathere is certain educational systems that are run better tan those of the united states you can say that a train station in moscow i's cleaner then a train station in yor city but the broad base political cretique that is somehow it does not matter how you run the government long as the trains run on time or it does neon matter if the trains run on time america is just kind of inherently bad that is incredibly problematics incredibly dangerous and it is hard to see how it is super america

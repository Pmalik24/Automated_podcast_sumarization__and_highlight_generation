a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped intodays episode of the show if you pre fer a beap version you can find that at our websight this american life dot o work here is just first time working for his big brother thes brother need somebody last minute theres go beld on him jeff also hat somebody bell on him heu be bi come for the summer that is girling and it became really a pear right away that that was not gea work out he has some time on his hands as brother was doing a research study on black bears is rother's a wild up biologes and offered in this job is a feeld teck and sommer working with black bears was a dream that would not be a dream for everybody whevers at a dream for you i just think bears ther is a cools animals ther cool black bears are cool how fast they can clind of tree their years i leve hi bears ears i just leve everything about bears jeff les bears his brother west studies bears jeff is the younger brother west is the older brother was is research with a track where bears were an brice cany national part and you tal here he is there was a bear that had broken into a tent swated a womand while she was sleeping really scareder and the idea was to caller some bears track them see where they are going how theyr spending their time if they coud fing ore that out par cul relokat campsides away from thes there is post signs as an jeff spend summer putting collars with two pstrovises on to a bunch of wild bears and then in the winter they to go back and chack on the bears to a quick exam make sure the collars ware not too tight once the bears fatten up for winter swap out anye old collars and need new batteries i turns out the easiest way to do that is to visit the bears with ere hibrnatin in the dans the most bear dans the job is not actually too difficult o scareit he dends are small ga cavity in some rock or under a tree we says and the're generally shallow enough that i can just i have a pole that has a syringe on the end of it i can just extend that pole and sa dayt the bear from outside of the det i do noty generall even have to go inside generally but then you can a couple dens where it is you are the only thing between the bear and th exit and that is when it gets kind of skin and that is what happen in this kays oh this oneis on another lev this ongles crazy this one apping on a wintery day hef you of them haded out a see bear number ninty five nthe udy i saw us ignolegy ps i maybe a thousand feet up a steep hillside get to im in the snow i's hard and cold then they struggle to find any opening at all in the rock that could be a don theres it just a blanket of snow everywhere hes seartr may be half an hour and then west is standing on this tiny little opening and then i see these branches right by his feet and a lot of times bears wil bring branches into the den som wes i think you standing on top of the ded he is just no way they cuear away the snow it is an opening the size of a manhole cover going into the side of a sandstone cleff and then we crouchd down and looked and i mean you could only see twenty feed in and it is just black honestly this den a it would be terrifying to go in it if you did not know anything was in't it and that there is a bear there that just ansiffies it much more is thik even if there was not a bear i'd be this is exskit was not jeff discuss whether they'e ging to go into this hole by bears are n't grizzlys they mas never attack people but going into this very unuse r dam where the bear might feel trapped it threatened and a'm no way out except through them as choice jeff does talk back to as way more than tha normal feel teckwood cause heis a brother but wes is the boss and he is we can as far and we really do need to change that bears collar and i start crawling in looking for the back to the den looking for the bear and it is just not there and this holl just plunges into darkness my head lamp only goes far and i just keep going and immediately i realize shit this is a really really long den this is much longer than anything i've ever seen or even heard of how on this thing extends eighty feet back and at the end of it it is just pitch black you kind of you really do have to suppress a lot of a lot of primal stuff that is tlling you this is a place where you are not supposed to be this is not a place for humants wes is in front big brother scientist just behind little brother a sistem and ther army crawling cause the tunnel was too low to stand up and its pretty crammed and you not feeling we aring yaur belly and a tunnel anging towards ha bear no of course not you do notknow that feeling who has done that but you have been in the situation a moving towards something scairy or dreadful ahead and now you have got yourself in it you cannot turn back you have to keep moving you just have to deal and that is what to dhay show us about we have this story than we have another one in the second half of the show and yes it is this american lie from be easy chicago ire glass anyway they'r edging towards this bear riht the tunnel was gentally slipping downward and the smell you may be wondeing wat the smell slike wet earth musty the bear brings in a nest of pine tree boughs and other sticks and stuffs does kin of smell cedery and nice too thay gits musty but it is honestly nowt as bad is what you would think because when a bear goes in to highbr nation wes will give yo a lot my scientific name on this but they create a but plug of poop that they will not poop theentire time then their den there is no feeseasar you are in in there it honesay is not terrible they may be fifteen twenty twenty five feet into the tunnel and was his head lamp points in the far end and i just see these two green eyes at the very end of his tunnel staring back at me and the thing about these highbrnatin bears is they bears do not hihbrnate very deeply if a bear hears you approaching its den it can come out of that ironation and generally within five to ten minutes they can be moble ands this bar was awake and they have they have the tupeetam lusitem which is the thing you see in cat's eyes or dear eyes are whatever that reflects ligkht back at you and and they reflect a really cund of green glow and it is just again the stuff of nightmares your crawling down a deep dark hoal in the mountains and thers two green eyes shining back at you the light starchs to catch these two eyeballs at the very end tas ea get s that day just greaning back at us that plat i'm har fied and a i start kind of feeting ou i sti saying tha wess is is craz this is crazy i do not know about this and juff just started saying we should not be here we should not be here we should not be here as a montrer that he was repeating and ie keep saying that and it was starting to really free from me out i i was trying to summon all this courage and drawin all my experience and then i have him behind me telling me tat wihj should not be in there and i turned around and then west yiscaus jeff shut up s's then my immediate respox s you are brave and then he just started repeating you are the bravest person i've ever met you are the bravest person i efer pit and that helped actually that made me villlon better it is funnyn how he needs to keep saying something to to have some place to put his fear yet yet i think for him he needed to vocalize that and for me i was really going inward and just trying to vocus on the bear and i's looking for any cues that bear was going to be aggressive and at that point you will leave im what are you watching for they make a really distinctive sound when they are really a really upset and then they also can they make this really interesting jaw popping noise to it letteally clacks its jaws at pops its jaws it is kind o sound and then from there it proceeds to swatting the ground with its paws and then if it is still upset it will bluff charge you and a bluff charges just where the bear comes at you and then stop short are you terrified oh ye oh ya's absolutely terrified i have a vidio that i took when i got close to the bear i took a quick ideal for my fown and i at the very end of it you to sear me say this is scary heath o this i sos not i scare sscare 's i really plesits its terrifying i csh all of my body wat of my psyche was saying you absolutely need to get out of this den tit is this feeling of being a soft pink human being in a place where we do not belong cours a west being in the tunnel with is bear he is a bear expert and he is thoughts som about what this experience must have been for the bear where these blackbears live there theyre top dog there is nothing bigger or more dangerous than them and they do not have stuff that crawls into their dens and gets closer and closer to them it must be a very unique experience for them as well i'm obviously a bear lik what the hell is this thing doing in here wik when the bear sees you it knows it can kick your ous ri cou culd just look at you and it does not even without even thinking of doing any math in its head or something it just sees your size and it just knows you are not a threat but then is it scared yet i think the thing that you that we have to realize with wild animals is that for them a fight means much more than can i win or or will i lose it is i'm am i going to be injured in this because for any animal itbears included if theye sustain a big injury in any kind of you will scuffle or fight or whatever that could be a deat sentence for them because then they no longer have the ability of feed or escape or even move and they tend to be very risk o verse itso wessen jeff keep armi crawing forward with tha sringeful of sed it iv on the end of a seven foot po ndfinally wist gets close enough to jab it into the bear mishon accomplish right but we jab it the bear does not react at all does not flench an must important that is not fall asle par be cause it ot inso big since they lasting it three hundred fifty pounds which it require way more set iti than wis gof it s ot s it them head back out of the cave bhe're another dosubseditit which they deavily are goin to need that jot goes to jab ot brother and itis something 's fully capable of doing i think i was still just diled up all the lak to eleving with all i lik emotion my thoughts ren't clear sias lie doing a terrible job your hands are not totally steady ye just making a mass i fumbling around and eventually the bear makes it lay all way through the eighty feet a den and starts coming out this is not the plan it would be very bad for a tryink toout bear to weave it stand at all it could easily wander off and get lost in the snow in the middle of winter and westan jaff remember their bear guise hey do anything they can think of the bears in this research you do not get hurt by it and experience the minimum amount of discomforter sdress they hav another feel teck with them who is been waiting outside the tunnel and whes orders that gi now keep the bear in the den hn the gi start swatding at the bear with a pastic shovel to keep it from emerging and it just doesnot care it is not even registering that hes there and just keeps walking past him wele yet at that point i ran and the thing that i really did not want to have happen was the drug take hold while this bar was trying to get away and have it tumble down the hill side or down a cliff side or something that i just was not willing to what that happen i ran and actually grabd the bear by its back legs and pulled them out from under it and then i straddled the bear and pushed its head down into the snow in the meantime iad slayly laway what an y what are you talking about you are able to do that cause the bear is kind of weg is the bear walking a sort of cartun drunk bear kind of thing its staggering along yet that is honestly exactly how it was walking that is a perfect repsa ion he is on top of this bear straddling it holding its collar and head down in the snow e's actally otin a second dose of setitinto him by them but the bear is still awaye an rest then looks over it jaff whois panic that he 's dropped the entire case of drugs jeff is must preparing a third dose and i just yell it jff i say jaff comgrab this bear i'll do the drugs kind of an unusual said of sentences to say anybody this which places jaff is now the once straddling the bear hands on its collar and the bear gets up and starts to move again as almost that move the re placemens where yonder reaves is a quarter back wer anyo the football movies where the big haf ty line min catches the ball n and thin there just slowly moving towards the enson and the whole defence jumps on hem and theyre just kind of falling off ofoy tracky and i still going towards the goa in yow is not going in a straight lying with all these people hanging on him an isnat ende that we are just hanging on this black bear and it is just slowly going in a straight line just holding it by the collar getting dragged along sloating down a little bit but that is all hi can do and this thing with his bear where none of the normal worlds apply totally off the map is this is what i have to do but i cannot believe i'm doing iit was sereal i just is i's in a tree it starts making waig it is wagh ded more of it downward slope tou o now it is a really hard for me to stop it and i'm just kindo on the back of it and it walks straight into a pine tree and likeligerly lik could not figure out what was going on and just tried to keep walking forwards ing to a tree west remembers it wore could junipropush but any case the doest job the bear stops finally passes out on the ground they do thei business change the collar examine the bear and then bher does not it lost in fused in the snow when it wakes up the grab its lims and dragg it fifteen yards or backe up the slope to the opening f the tonnel which is exactly as completely exhausting as you would imagine it tikes may be half an hour etemperature's droppir wes worrid that the bear mike a coald through leves a blankcet on top bef im before they go ing bat but wesn' ev both talk about is the terror that they fell in that tunnel wes says it was a whole new level of fear he did not know existed the kind of primal fer a long ago humans must had all the time facing off with animals at wanted to kill them an eat them and it is something that that we have forgotten but i think it something that still sits deep inside of us that when you do have these experiences with large animals that it git bubbles to the surface and in a way it was really it intoxicating i'll tell you that night i did not sleep ar wink because my dranelon was just coursing through my body om they just made me feel i honestly made me feel very alive and ah even when i think back on that i can still remember the feelings i had that night as i went back to my the cabin and everything just how bright the star seemed and how pris the air fell and it really just reminded me how good it is to be alive in the bear the bear is fine the dugsagater probably does not remember the details of what happened west said inevera year later was went back to that tunnel when the bearer was not in it found the blanket inside the bear must a liked a little it smelled beare fure all over it was took back kept ip is a souvenir he says it still smells pengly bear af n the bray we hav another story of people thrown into ay dangerous and utterly for seeable situation and how they handle it in this episode thet we caling the bear at the end of the tunnel was not jeff by the ay of a pod casts were they tell stories of animal attacks is called tooth and caw if i you enjoyed the string that you serd you should know that by their standards this story was not special the ones wen their show way or eventful morinamen ut mccagobobegradio whon a program continues tis mar con lik from our glass to taces program again the bear at the end of the tunnel stories people who find themselves trapped in some dangerous situation and now they just have to deal we have arrived tat at two of our shel act two the devils in the details and there are many details few month ago we brught you the story from one of our producers meeking mek about an ob g wyan in rural itao it was deciding whetheror not to leave the state after roversis wage was overturned and abortion was outlaw there i dont ont to leae here an le i thon't wont to leave yit i do not if i can say the sob g wyann amelia huntsburger was facing a nitoho a set of borthon laws that kicked in after row was overturned that are some of the most restrictive in the country and con jus tay i think when most of us think of these laws we think of their effect on abortian clinecs and abortion carprofiders that was in this story a melia was a general ob g wyan at hospital and other was doing papsmers birk controlled giving babies and our hospital did not terminate pregnancies unless it was a medical complication which by the way is most hospitals in t e itedstates but when ros overturned and these new laws and i tho took effect they defined abortion in the broadest possible terms it was effectually a complete ban even pregnancies that were not coun be viable could not be terminated and any doctor who performed an abortion breaking those rules face severe consequences they gooas ar medical license that go to prison for two to five years and they could get sued fi le members could su if a raper is ordered in a pregnancy and the vicnim decided to get in abortion the rapest's family could sue the doctor for performing the abortion n the probe for amelia the b g wyan si yran in to all kinds of situations wheare in the course of ad ministering normal health care for her patience she could run a foul the law for instance ifo patient showed up at her hospital miss carring and bleeding on controllably nthe past amelia could terminate the pregnancy to stop the bleedit but now she be charge with a felony if she did that if she did anything determin into pregnancy if it still had a quote feedle heartbeat that is frase in the law thoughin the early stages it is not a heart beat it just electrical activity in some tissue that could eventually become a heart now when amelia faced pregnancies was serious complicatients situations were the longer she waited to act the more danger the patient was in she coald no longer just think about what was best for the patient who was in front of her en when you do surgery that where somebody is having ongoing octive bleading that is allready high stress and dots or high stress a trained for that i know what to do with tht i can handle that then you adt in this other weard layer o is her brother can an not understand that this was a not vioable pregnancy in that her life was at risk and what about her mom what about her partner what about her sister they ar do these people understand how serious this condition is or do they only understand that i removed the pregnancy that had a heart be i do not know how mass tos to know she where y becgoting sued she were to bet getting prosecuted this came up all that nand the end of her story back in march ameia was still hanging on idom stil desided since than much as happened just a few weeks after we are in that story ameia decided she was gointo it eway dos bida has a bushonons she 's one o the first tooud be she wiyans in the state to anout she was going abouter wek after that something that she feared might happen some day haven about quicker than shea imagine the hospital were she practice bon ar general health announce that was shutting down its entire labor in delivery department the hospital sited the new las as one reason the shad recruiting her docter is would be quote extremely difficult finance was the other reason sinse then all three of the other obe ju i answer share o practice with amelia have left the state what ameya dreadend most a miving way was what was goin to happen to her patience how woul all this affect everyone an idohope tryind have a baby we thught about that for to day sho because what would happen to them this was in a sence the bear in the tunnel the difficulties and possible danger that all those patient's face cause of the new laws and what is unfolded since as been pretty dramatic i producing makin mek went back to talp to patience tand to the law makers who put them into the situatients therein in the state here s minky i talkd to half a dozen pregnant women who would ben planning to deliver up bon er general and suddenly found themselves contorting their lives around the gistical problems they had never imagined facing for something as every day is trying to have a baby in the state of idaho brookmay cumber is twenty five years old and was days away from giving birth when i reached her amelia had ben her doctor and brook's plan had been to do her prenatal appointments tat bon er general and deliver there too bhut now the closas idaho hospital with a labor in delivery department was almost two hours away in a small city called qardelane sheed ad take her three little kids with her in the car on a four hour round trem for every prenatal appointmen blood prusser feedle heartbean four hours for a fifteen minute chacken the days that we would have tat go to quarteline it was from nine thirty to six ofclock at ni i would have my sister who she lis and spokan she is about thirty five minutes from quarteline that she would hang out the k ids i caun go to my pointment and then we would have to go out for lunch or do a bik meg and then go to a park because ike they cannot jus et the car forfour hours back to back the distance to the hospital also worried her she was freeked out about not gettng to the hospital in time and giving birth on the side of the road her labors have always been pretty fast which she have time to make it to the hospital when brook got three weeks away from her dueday she could not take being on hieler all the time she moved in with her ma'm who lived two hours away close to brooks new hospital brook took the kids with her her husband could not joind them because of work and her mamm was working every day brook was carrying for three little kids basically on her own at eight months pregnant it was hard deleave her husband the splitting up their family temporarily was the only solution they could come up with me mi has ben hav never really ben a part before and being in a bet alone hasbeen strange and then ar to boys they have had some trouble sleeping they will wake up in the middle o the night then both the boys will call into bed with me and then i wind up an the cowch e mi gining to try toayles get one ore hour of rest boner general had been the only labor and delivery unit in its region of northern i toho when it shut down it became a statistic and a whole seper at longstandin prises the closure of labor and delivery surfices in rural hospitals all over the country nearly half of rural community hospitals no longer offer obstatrics care the chaos created by boner general's closur for the women i spoke with involved the most basic important stoff child care money some women told me they would lose a days worth of pay every time they had to drive to an appointmen they talked about having to budge at hundreds or even thousands of ectra dollars for travel or housing in a place closer to a labor and delivery department for swhiching to admidwife not covered by insuranc for they went to another state to get care insurance might not cover a that either i talk to one woman who told me she bought hellacopter insurance for a medical evacuation flight in case she started hamergine or had some other kind of emergency complication turns out its cheaper than you think seventy five dollars and she was not the only one hellacoppder insurance for normal pregnancies this woman's name is jessy grosemen she is thirty two years old and this was her first kid and in idaho she worried the abortion laws tied doctor's hands in too many cases i desi did wi an i bre an wits that if we you have to chance her tot e hospitalre i might be taken at washington i i can be last worri about i the iiry any ow man preseng tos mi relling about might o what in forse e sary o havits and mat i i have t this es ter helle coptor getting you l t get ais but yeare entired at might just be lihkt and i get a di as mig bebe at a di li beer no guaranteess for anyone pregnant person doctor any one who might want a look at the maternal mortality statistics and idho since the new lass past the state use to have a committe that troced maternal deaths in their couses but it does not any more the legislature decided not to renew it in its last sassion idaho is now the only state in the country without a commitee this that is the situation for these women who just needted general ob j wayan care during their pregnancies but then there are the high risk pations which includes by the way any oe who is expecting twine any one with high blood pressur or diabeties anyone over thirty five and any one whose pregnancies include rare complications these people are in a much more dire situation in itaho now tbecause they may need whats called a maternal feedal medic n doctor these her highly skilled u be juyannes specialists at keeping both the fedus and the patient alive and healthy through these pregnancies and these doctor had been leaving the stye caylis smith had a maternal feedal medicine doctor her first pregnantcy had complications but things were going smoothly with this one it was a boy she ad her husband had picked out a name brooks and then when she was nineteen weeks she went in for her anatomy scan and i i juseremember this honographli i know they cannot say any thing but she jus kept going over his heart quite a beh and of course i'm talking myself down it is sine it is just different this time each person has a different wf doing things and then it was just really quiet and then she left and em doctor cooper her walked into the room doctor kihly cooper her maternal feedal medicine specialist i just remember she had a diograam an am she i jus remember her being i've nember stem her defecte this sever before i they could not really see the babies i or er at all his i gues say were to arch was it really formed the only thing cala wanted to know was could brook survive pass birth she and her husband had already decided that could care for a child woitd special needs doctor cooper referred her to a pediatric prardiologist but he told her no brooks's chances of survival were very unlikely he called some of the best pediatric hospitals in the country and none of them could offer her a surgical option to fix is heart she remember sitting in an ultrosound room with her doctor she is if you diside to continue this pregnancy i yere for you and we will figure out what that means and where we need to go for me she is but if you do diside that you did not want to cotns pegnant she shes just really sorry ti ti i personally can o anyou understood at that point this is because of the laws ye yeh i mean her hands were tied i knew i knew she was protecting herself but also i would never ask her to be in that position yeh we just all cant ive looked at each other wit theho we do now most patients cayla whose pregnancies have what are called leethal and life limitn't feedal anomalies shoose termination because continuing their pregnancies will result in miscarriage still birth her death shortly after delivery but calis doctor could not offer her atermination just a week or before this terminating the pregnancy brooks would not have been considered an i legal abortion an itaho but now under ida hose new laws it was calistarted asking her doctor about what if she did continuer pregnancy and delivered brooks what would it be for him would he fill any pain during the birth would he suffer from air hunger feel breathlessness as he gasped for air but of course her doctor could not guarante that he would not feel anything even with paliative care and morphine that it just also felt there is only one option and it wasnit one that we wantee ake but bike i do not want my sunditsuffar i do not i'm nocking upot myself through that and i'll go risk my own life bec doctor cooper ceporator bating shoe she is you have afore to present em to getting pregnamcy again preaclancia is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality et usually involves the surgeon blood pressur that can seriously harm or kill a pregnant pation it is un predictable and hard to know when it will happen and how severe it will be which brings us to the man thing doctors find frostrating about ida hose new abortion laws there is language in the law that says they cannot terminate a pregnanc y unless it is quote to prevent the death of the pregnant woman doctor cooper said she does not know what that means is it mean she would have to wait for cala to be near death's door from preaclampcia before she could intervene her whole training all doctor's training is the stop problems before death afer becomes emminent the only other situation where doctor cooper could terminate a pregnancy is if the feetal heart beat stopped i the feetis was dead cal described her options and itaho as a quote chet buffet do i risk going to her knowing that i'm not even in a half a son to take home and risk my life and not be there for my daughter i mean i want to make it very clear that i was at that point twenty weeks pregnent i could feel tis very active im and what that dus is one's mental hale i just av thistating because i fel i to sult trab there is him breally dark thought that i never thought i would have thought ah thinks is there chance at his harrible stop because i knew bere where im currently and itaho that would be a reason fur them to help me i heard this from other pregnant women and itaho with leefful feetal anomalies they found themselves wishing for the heartbeats to stop hearing that brooks could sofferth he made it to term cala decided to leave this state in order to end her pregnancy she found appointment at a hospital in seatle because she was far along twenty one weeks second pregmaster because it was not clear of her insurance was going to cover it sead to pay almost fifteen thousand dollars updrauht she and her husband took out alone and then drove seven and a half hours with their two year old daughter cala had a choice of how to enter prgnancy with a surgical procedure or by inducing labor early cala knew she wanted to induce she delivered brooks after twelve hours of labor he was still born she says there was this weird eariy silence in the delivery room and then every one laughed she and her husband could hold brooks there were things that came up after that were kind o a some one just people saing congratulations just walking in the real met od because i did not know rat right brooks was cremated two weeks later cala made the seven and a half hour drive back to seattle to pick up his ashes my parete would have without a doctor iven up to see atle to get him if i kneeded them to and you do brought him to us when they were able to come over here but i just remember talking of my husbad aty i i it does not made me feel good i feel i just mee to go and he was thit you jest nee to go and i tro i drove over to theauta with my daughter it was one of those things that i i just need to me in charge of this i'm si know what is happening cale was the first case this that her doctor doctor cooper handled after ita hos abortion laws changed her first case where she could not do anything to help then there were more patients calas she could not help and an april of this year she was the first maternal feedal medicine doctor to leave itahoe because of its abortion laws there was already assure toe of these specialists an itaho before the laws went to effact only nine in the entire state now there were just five and one of those will retire before the end of the year that fear bat every pregnant woman i talk to an ita who had that they be left totally on their own in a medical emergency it happened to bcca the last patient doctor cooper hat to tell i'm sorry i cannot help you before she moved out of itaho becca is thirty one she lives in the boisy aria and used to oversee a fitness club she went to college on a poll baulting scholarship when she was about sixteen weeks prognat she learned that her feetes had a genatic anomally multiple organs were developing abnormally including its heart in kidneys tif she continued the prognancy she likely miss cary and was at risk for preclamcy out r severe hemerging you knowhen you see an moties and people get yosatal diagnosis an they just cunin to nom and all you here is a blabering doctor in the background and i do not actually rememberaful lot of that conversation i just remember sitting there and trying ot to ball ma eyes out thecase wed won at thi wenly wanted to gow our samily we tried fofre almost a whol year for thi one and we told people were you how ere pregne sce be say o wi we think it is get to the little girl or something she decided to make the same choice calamade leave the state becca drove to portland organ to terminate her pregnancy at a clenec but that is not what she an her husband told their family in fronds we we are not comfortable beg outright in telling them exactly why we are going portland we told family an frends that we are going for dranetic custing yejuscause it is controversial right now an our state and we did not want to rist losing god relatonships o tit cane down to it becca story is different from calas because she was not able to get the full procedure the night before her appointment for a sergical termination she started miss caring it was around midnight she as at a hotel with her husband and two your old daughter who were sleeping and iwas just laying in ded and i started counting and counting in a contractions where happening everady thirty seconds ins the only thing that i kept thinking to myself was oh now this is it is happening and thethe only thing i

again says she did not make a sounds even when her husband was trying to get her uterous to contract she would stoppe bleening which meant needing his fist into her lower abdemen the way the doctor instructed him over the phome she says it was incredibly painful and waying in the sour it is s streams of blood going into the drain in the whole time weare just wise this ampani this should not be happening if bacca had been able to get a termination and idaho it probably would not have her dactor kindly cooper couldhave done the procedure as soon as she decided ecca would have been in and out in a day not in a hotel room far from home in the morning when the clinic opened up a couple tem poleese showed up to collect the feedus baca then hobbled over to the clinic for an exam it was next to her hotel and she had to walk past the line of anti abortion protestors her hausband had to stay behind to watch their daughter when she came back they drove home to idaho seven hours they sat silently almost the whole way before talking to calan bacca one part of the postrow experience i'd never heard about whezat people who had to travel out of state to terminate safely had all these complications figuring out what to do with the remains tbecause of rules about traveling across state lines with human remains baca had wanted to donate the body for medical research to give her pregnantcy lost more meaning but for legious sical reasons of the clinic she did not get that option baccon her husband decided to creaming but they had no idea when the clinic would send the remains a couple weeks later were home and aa posta worker comes up to our door and was i cam here wou need acide for a packet and oslik o e there is this white box that says remains wabled on every single side of the box for some reason the box was a drest to baby and not the parents and the postor worker does not actually realize it untill i as sining for it she saw the name on the top in her face just this is o cood bi and leathelyjus we n o suc as grob the box and shut the door of the set as a terrible coda to a terrible experience bacchome baccaworried that people who would help them go out of state might gettin trouble if she talket about it it was not clear who approsecutor my goafter in the earliest hardesdays she had a secret instead of just a los i dodn't see li coun get openly talk about it and is a lot of the graven proxess i wast for me as being able to talk about it right about it lik got meven just as sympathize or empathized with other people who got through somewhat s totuation ee it people be justo it made it and muted and quiet very lonely greeving process bacca and calam at recently the part of a group of people with other patience and doctors wher trying to sooth a state hoping to expand the exceptions in the abortion laws toinclude leetful feedal anomalies the ones they had in their pregnancies and most important they want the law toll loud doctors to provide abortions to preserve a person's health not just to prevent their death which is the language in the lawright now their case was filed by the center for reproductive rits who fbiled similar legal actions and other states with restrictive laws they re presented the abortion clinic in the supreme court case that overturned row aconcac to the two idawho lawmakers in the house in senate whos sponsor the law that crimanalizes abortion i wanted to find out how they think its working were they hearing about the kinds of experiences i was did they know about the doctors leaving the state did they think they need to make any changes one of the law sponsors declined an interview and the other did not respond tumultuul requess i reached out to republican lawmakers who voted for the law back in twenty twentye before reafhal ate senator jim got three represents the district and southern itaho and identifies as pro life i was surprise he walked into the interview with a note book would stats about the number of doctors who loft the sate and started siting them tso far it is at least nineteen doctors because that worried him a'm pro life but i think there is got to be some consideration for the do is they practise if they are not in find im selsion an in cort the second is a help of them aw has hen you talk about pro life the life of a mother is if you are trying to protect that that is pro life to to me when you first voted for the abortionlaws did you think that roe would actually fall or did it feel more a symbolic act at that time it is a good question i i think to answere that honestly a probably did not think it would happen bebecaus tat what i done on for what fifty years something that he is the chair of a committee in ta senn that abortion bills go through before they go to the rest of the legislature for thowhe says the language in the abortion man was always more aggressive than his own personal beliefs at that time when you voted for them were you looking that closely at the language of the laws may maybe there was some things overlooked as far as what the consequence is would be because they were not truly consequences yet and youre shut conscious you are thinking it is not going to be al return sill this is one way you can make a statement you kind o get into that deal where if you are pro life even thou the bill has some things her problematic you were going to come down on the side of of arrying on the side of protecting the unborn the other law makers i talk to he says he believe the inten of the laws when he voted for them was a shut down abortions happening in clinics in the state not to help shut down a rural labor and delivery unit are force patience to travel out of state because of severe feel abnormalities those were consequences he did not forsate now seeing how things of played out do you regret voting for those laws or wouldyouhave done something different if you could go back in time in the contect of being pro life and recognizing the importance of the unborn i feel that bot at that time with what was in place as far as trying to push back against an embed at law i i think that was in propriate bot at the time even not once to rover way eshall returned as when the weality i think shunkin for all of us i talkd to three republican legislators and they were all in the same situation trying to grapple with the consequences of what had just been theoretical policy when they first loted for them but now was real law a facting real situations in people's lives we republican law makers used to be pretty much on the same side now they have different ideas about hot up lie pro life to itahose new laws the next law maker i talke to was representative brent crane for nearly twenty years he is represented a district outside of baisy and makes his living running a fire alarm and security business he believes in life tat conception and says he is proudly sponsordor costponsor more than a dozen pieces of anti abortion legislation he in senator got three are on the same page as far as seeing the need to broaden exceptions in the abortion laws but they also hop to work alongside law makers who think there should not be any exceptions for instance for rapin incessvictoms rober resenatof crane describes him is still stuck in what he calls a pre r o mine side for everything is still black and wite me he says he used to ve abortion that we too untill row finally fall a i remember sit by the fireplace my wife thas shusually where we sit down in the evening or early morning and i said am i've got a get my head around this issun because we are not prepared to deal with this is estate did you o sa a post roe infironment is totally different in in a pre ro all legislatures crafted destries it questions up before the court well now you are in a postur environment were yeu have to govern that means you have to have legislation that that is going to work and for a pro life lawmaker most pro life law makers will take a very conservative and very rigid stance on the issue of life am no i'm not i'm not going to give any ground at all for any more exemptions that is it whatever for me personally i think that there are some instances where the families need to make those decisions again this is ha place were lawmakers who used to all be on the same side of a porsion are now in conflict and there was e draft of the bill in the last legislative sassion that got to the main problem with the current law the way ol be due bi ancia the bill would have a lowed abortions for some serious health complications before they became life ri me in other words letting doctors made decisions based on the health of the pregnant person not just their potential death representative crane chairs the house committee that abortion legislation goes through and he scedle the hearing for the bill that he would a cancel of the last menet beause he did not have the votes to get out of committee for some of his members considering the health of the pregnant person open to canopworms behind close door i was parther tobe and then if for opening health of the mother where tos that stop is at mental health is it just tihd to physical health is a financial health what what is hale how you defining health the mother representative julian young is republican from soulth easterni tohe she is vice chair of that committee and oppose that new language about health complications what i do not want to do is put language in that vague that it has the effect of open the door to abortion in situations where you could protect both lives and for talking about hig blood pressure if wor talking about conditions that are common to pregnancy than we do not want that lumped into anything that could be a life threatening condition for the mother because the reality is that as women we put our lives on the line by choosing to have children there are always risks with every pregnancy and you can never eliminate every risk what is your ye at which her medical knowledge of pregnancy ell well i'm not ing a claim to be an obe duien that i've learned lot wor the years and a it i guess i speak to the issue not as a medical professional but as a mother that is really wermi ex pretisis she has ten children shes switches off bringing her youngest to to the capital with her and the sit on on committee meetings and hearings also randof fact turns out my uncle was her orthodontist when she was akead representative young is weary of letting doctors consider the health of the pregnant person of giving doctors and i tho hospitals the kind of control they had before rofell for representative young the sweep of the new laws is not som overreach it is the point the concern i think with the health exception is that we have some in the medical community who practised in an environment for a lot of years where the life of the child was not valued equally ir about in it a hospital specifically thak around the country because that was the way it was hat it was a fetus that was a clump of sells and there was not the protection in the courts for the l ife of the childs unlike sentator got three who is worried about doctors leaving it hom representative young thinks that some ito ho o b g ians are exaggerating their fears about prosecution under the law she says others ar scaring themselves i overthinking the phrase to prevent dath she points to language in the law that says they can use their quote good faith me dical judgment representative crane who talked about the pre ro and post ro mind thats of republicans also agrees with her on thus on this topic he does not see is much cray if you are not performing elective abortions you have nothing to worry about just if you are not going over the speedlemit you dont have toe worry about a cop polling you over for speedy elective abortions is a phrase ante abortion law makers and active asuse but it is not a medical distinction in medicine any termination of a preagnancy for any reason is an abortion whether it is to prevent dath or to help rap an incesvictums ore just not wanting to be pragment they are all just calld abortions just connects this in terminology are another frostration doctors and ito have about the new laws o b g ans who have lefet an once that are trying to figere up they can stay but are't sure if they can say is are the law is still vague to me i wha's tho they what is the tas the bigness for them there is an exception tha for life of the pragnat patient but what does that need to be wht dis that defined is that fifteen persent close todath fifty per cent fortyfive and also there are these things that come up we know this person has proclancy it is goot it devolp i cannot say hen a just i cannot operate an that area because there is not that health language i d jo me honestly do you shinks it if a doctor di says he look i'm going to have to take your child that goes to dowt i'm going to either haft if i do not take the child the mobs goan to die what hyeu wantig to do take the child he does that and you get a a wildly aggressive prosecutor this says i'm going to take you to court for violating the triggerlaw on the sate of out you think a reasonable court of people tha are made up of just honest citizens you and i argantisay yvergn t throwing a jail for that ri prosecutu for that thet they are not going to how long si the lawpen an effect right been in effect y over your have any doctors been prosecuted have any cases come forward o i think dot doctors are saying is i know lawmakers are telling us that but there is no guarantee that a prosecutor is not get to come after me there is no guarantee that a family member is not et assue me and i do not want to have to go to court and i have also got kids andi've got a livelihood we have an agy that is really aggressive that the lawmakers assurance of no ones get to come after you yhoy're notk at a lose an court is not assurance for me i understand i mean tt i i spent more than almost ninety days listening to these exact same arguments and i me look life of the mother is life of the mother it is yit is not this highly technical highly new wants argument that i think that some of these folks are scared about i do not know i me your reporter i'm i'm a alarm guy i for me's perty simple life of the motherhay the mother's life caen then i know i i have the abuility to operate in thi space imi think that is wher ob gu an's get tat we have legislators who are not doctors that is true ah but but on the flipside you have doctors that are trying to tell legislators how to do their jop and a we have constituents that ar asking us a this just what we want you do not act and that is that is where the tention exists i ran by him and representative yongs some of the specific experiences i'd heard from prigmant women in ob g ians the actual people who been stock sholddering the emotional and legistical burdens of the new abortion laws and how disconnected they said they thouht from this new era and ito hom that suppose to be pro life and pro family here is how representative young sees this moment what i hear you describing a lot seems adjusting to a nesito ation and undoubtedly there is a little pain with every change an there is we just do not live in a world where everything works out perfectly all the time and that just because there is some in convenients associated with making the policy change to protect life does not mean that it is not the right thing to do because there is always two sides to the story and there a lot of babies who were going to live in this state that might not have lived and that is valuable that is worth protecting that is worth paying a price for even if it means that there has to be some growing paints associated with that ob j what ends in the state have been telling me that access to good maternal health cure and ideho has suterated rapidly over the last year that the state is now in crisis is that ful accurate to you as crisis the word that you would yous yet i guess i have not seen that yet but what what i keep coming back to as a legislatoer if you are a physician that does not want to adhere to at a standard of protecting both the life of the mother and the life of the child then that may be frestrating for you i think there is going to be some sorting out maybe as thi standard of practise a jests to what the statute is uconcern is is people an adjustmet is yet ye'l lokn tem saying meke is i do not think that we have to desert this this value of protecting life in order to have a thriving ob community we should be able to make these two things work together and it might take a minute to have the conversation and figureet out but i do believe that it is possible in the year after i da hose new laws wen to a fact representative young and other law makers did end of making a few changes to the law some of the most notable abortions are now legal for certain kinds of pregnancies that are never going to be viable ectopic pregnacies and abortions are now legal for rapan incesvectums ifs those victims do it in the first thirteen weeks and fioleplece report since most sexual ssalt victims never report this is still a steep barrier but the thing o b j enne's wanted most new wording that would allow them to consider the health of their pregnant patiencs lejustlaters did not give them that the law maker say there still working on it but after that legislative session ended that is when most of the o b j yennes who left the state ore decided to retire erlyg got out we are living in this moment or there is a political and ideological sorting happening in many parts the country there people who are picking oup and specifically living to red or blue states to scape the laws their state legislatures have passed it just seems easier than trying to change the politics of the place where you live but the big question for the patients i talk to an ito ho is how many o b j ennes will still be left standing to care for them after the sorting out period representof yong brought up it is finally done in a recent survey fiftee per sent of ob j yennes in the state said they were definitely leaving ore still considering leaving fifty per sens making men

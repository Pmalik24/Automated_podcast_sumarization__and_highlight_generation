allen is not the real santa paus gi in the north pole obviously i said the stending little kids who mi be was tening to me right now that guy in the north pole is amazing allen is not that guy allens ist ta guy who dresses up is sanna sometimes haln does not have santisflying raindeer halen does not have wecions of elves backing him up and most of all hallen does not have his years of experience this is myh first year santa my first oone wrong on he is driving to his very first chair gig ai'm im nervous i i i'm i'm nervous a really really nervous e cher gig you sidna cer tock to kids nout what they wont for christmas one of our producers in you to corn fell rode with him to this job this was an redwin's california an hour or east of wull sand to us allen is an earnest guy the kind face who and he retellyou this himself tenstover thing things of ale really he told o viva he is not your what to expected this gig what could go wrong just been trying to prepare for everything i hmaking sim wes checking twice last night i made checklists on my fallin for all the things that i would beed and all the things a potentially need i have a back up for almost everything that i were a am well i it in case a babi spits up i need another sure i if the co get turdy i need another o and i have to have exstric gloves in i've been kind of manic about trying to anticipy all the ci castorfties that gat happenone were another an precare for them is ous i worried about his beard is fifty three is natural beard is still must be brown i started a bleaching my beard in june ans my beard started getting smallr the bleach was damaging it sbreaking o yes hes tries to expens of paraproduct stop the damage but he sivilar shorten any once maybe his greatest anxiety going into this gig is the questions tethe kids might ask him would he say the right thing there might be a e know a child with a real problem ther ther mom is gone or somebodys a incarcerated or something that ans i cannot tai cannot bring an one back that they lost and i really wery about being aske about that i cannot bring some one home wos on ta apoiyment somewhere he frats an drives on his way to th gig twoful santa costumes in the bag in a christmast comes round every year always the same buthe same songs in the same stage prhaps ince specials on te be yon get numb to it it is easy to lose the magical feeling that many people had as kids round the poliday but one thin he say about alan he is not feeling i just the opposite he is on hio work not just as he wancs to be a perfect santa for these little kids mainly heis that way because it is his first time in the chair and there are all kinds of reasons that that is a big deal for him hat will gn to get into in a minute or two but my pride now is when you'are trying something for the first time ou can just ion'ts heast all the potential an excitement of what it could be you feel feelings which is why this christmas here it i shall we thought o be nice to spend an hour with people who are not doing what the have ever done in the past or christmas who are not doing the same old same old whoen spend the hour with people who are trying somethe brand new i christmas does they have a shot at some deep christmas he feeling to babasy chicago sis merican life im i a glass stay a ana glan to santa believe in himself i ca allen i may bethos a santa allen it is on his way to his first cheirgig as we said pretty sony ta cornfeld went with him to see how he would do on that gig but to understand why he is nervous and what he hoped to get out of the gig he can have to understand what job means from the first place and that is wereof heva is ma start before getting into the santa business allen had a job thoug a sort of the officeit of being santa he was a correction's officer at a state prison hed gotten into the work because he needed the money and stability and stayed for over two decades but he hated it and felt increasingly queezy about the whole sys stem and his roll on it and then in twenty seventeen he got a break from it though not under great conditions he i realy sick anded up having to take nearly a year and a half off from mark for medical leve he got depressed stoppe shaving ger along beard one day to cheer himself at allen and his wife arrand decided to go to a comic book convention is obviously i'm cind of a nerved and i enjoy that sort of thing but i went there and it wasnit really having a very good time and i was taking a break from walking around in the convention and i'm sitting in a little caffe in him having something a drinker eating a sanmich i do not rly remember but there is his guy there he says hey i your beard and i wont oh i thanks an he gave me this little card in what it is sa it is a recruitment cart for this fraternal order of real bearded sances there is something very sort of tied to the real world about the idea of recruiting a santa when it feels it should just be some snow falls on your shoulder something than you become santa thhe had but know this was just a guy i sitting around at a comicon a tak to very dozen first times santas in reporting the story nearly every one had this in comment it was some one else who first tidentified than the santa turns out that is the magical snow that falls on your shoulder allen shows a business card to his life errand whe suggests he dress up for there got sons kids christmas still months away but it might give him something to look forward to i'm thinking a call i i do have the speard now and tha i've always been ther definitely on the road tun side of things i've got that working for me and i went well i should could feel in sarry for myself in maybe do something with this now allen figures he will play santa just as once as a nice thing to do for his family since he is a grandfather to these kids allen was worried they might recognize him he bleached his beard white an asked a friend who knows how to sow to make him a red suit but and christmas eve as he is hutting over to the house he realizes he actually is no idea what to do he just tries to imagine but a real santa might do then opens the door makes an entrance and there is free owi tris ma they hav nointy it was the firthest thing from their mind i did not cave tremendous expectations going into it and then one i did it it was just this tremendous rush of emotions in that is not a thing tha happens to me a lot of bit a pretty buttent at person most to my life when it was santa for them it became santa for me it is just one of the most powerful things ofve ever fill my life when i'm fim i'm a completely different person in all my little nerow sees and dout ind faults and foibles it is all gone and all the proms that allen haus santa does not amy of tus allen loved this new version of himself but pretty soon christmas was over andso is medical leave which mean allen's beard had to go tbe cause as ta correction's officer he had to be able to wear a gas mask in case a riot broke out at the prison ndyou cannot properly set a gasp maskover a beard allen could not afford to quet he grabbed his clippers e made himself shave off his beard this is goed a sound really weard i still have that beard in ia blockbag really yow i mourned that beard why do you still have it i probably should not but it it mental lot to me it was the key to the doors that open that let me do this and when i had to shave that beard off i was pretty unhappy about it i was upset the next year llen bout a fakebeard to play santa but it looks bad he could not bring himself to wear it two years pass without playing santa and then thinks im part to his wife erand hos making enough money as an engineer to support them allen is finally able to retire and he throws himself into becoming santa the gall is to become a professional santa the kind that some one might hire for say a private party or praded or the holy grail of santa engagements a char gag first thing llen starts growing his beard back then he signds up for santa school at we cannot intensive were you learn everything from what to say to sceptical cids to how to make an entrance he meeds lots of other santas who off for helpful teps how do snteeking a bathroom brak while stayin in character parently ourespect to say youf to make a call o the north pall finding out theres this he tiyer world you did not know about at's been the little weard and sometimes you wonder how you got to this place in life this is a deeply weard thing for mitle aged and elderly guise to do but it but it is curna wonderful i meen it is it is a but i deeply strage at the sake time by the time i'm talking to him allen spend almost a full year preparing for the rall he is a diligent and serious student of the santa tradition but there is one part of it he does not believe in the notty list surprising maybe given his last ja you have been bad you are on the naudulist that is that is no way to be 's punative exactly and that is i've seen pianative and i do not thing it works i want a loote be able lift im up rather than put him in a corner somewhere in tell that youare this thing being santa lets im work on the other side of the ledger which feels ta lot better to him i tried to do that job as well as i culd but it was really difsticult andso when you run into a lot of people sort of onthe nauny list am and he cannot do anything for him an they cannot do anything for themselves it feels cunt of hopeless that is a less my learn for my career people meed redeption they need to be accepted back into the fault even if they made mistakes finding the way of too well for g o over the people sort of give you at openin to for you ershel the other's lot cleet othe day is finely arrive for allen's first ever targag we are driving to the event which is tat an abandoned pure one an an outdoor mall about a half an hour from his house we hopp out of te car and meet joana garsia who hired allen for the event she lets us in through the back door of the building there is a single clothing rack with teashirts on it alen takes a shirts off he can use the rack to hang all the pieces of hi santal fit bt he nervous he keeps dropping step foe o turod almot tus ondoing slap to or som fii a line forms outside while allen changes into his costume he is got a fur lined red robe and matching hat and a green vest with gold buttons underneath he is wearing big black boots and little half moon spectacles that i have to say really pull the whole outfit together but he still just looks a guyana costume then the dooris open and the kits rushen al e on ter e e u u i lo or druss suddenly he santa confident arms stretched wide beaming whatever the opposite of naratic is he is that two little girls walk an ans potim and their eyes seem to double in sides there seeing something truly magical it is clear they have no idea this is his first time doing this to them he santa te we ready ove bo the day begins will not you wont for pristense what monster truk i lonmost e al as he can here as got his kidvoice on and wit do not kno what i expected it is ackly but this job requires just much pat it you santa allen is tappdancing as fast as he can single tels to o els to all way to keep the kits tappy and engaged te won yall bolld up on the photographer sam can snap a good picture for the parents al its o al i yo afafafafafafa ofa o watching santa allen i thought about this thing another santa a pastor name santadon told me santadon said that back when he was in graduate school for psychology on his first day of class his professor asked how many of you have people who are already coming to for counslling don and a few other students rase her hands then the professor goes i'm goingto be honest with you if people are not already coming to you getting a degree from here proubly will not changed that heu're either the kind of person people on a confide in or your not don thinks at the same is true for santa there is some an naint santa essins some santa vide that you either have or you do not and here on his first cherr gag santa allen seem to have it tho it did not always go smoothly with every kit a oin aaa son oa a on on wo o there we are a lot of crying babies o old in on e for wwere o ti a off you ant r e ro n sometimes kids as santa allen for things that throom for a loop the boy who said he wanted trouble for christmas were the girl who just wanted soks tat cur tersoks it it no dust me e sofs off o ge hat's good one little girl wanted two hampstairs but as she asked for them her parent stood behind her with wide eyes vigorously shaking her heads no of course there were some awkward moments when santa allen axidenaly mistaked a boy with long hair for a girl and this kid whe lookes a tiny adult and who was not having it was santa allen's questions i hadn analmost you not on animals iha e ni can no the real ranger they have ant words this yno i i si ibe seen rudolf an evyou seen his knos i no o no i yet it is likes sup in its red are you going to schooling n no no i may for o some people ple to school in the for santa allen had imagined fieldi an all these big hard questions from kids but in practice the real work of imitating santa 's more working a fack tory line a quick back and forth snap a picture then on to the next the hard is question he ended up getting was about missus claus a forme ar you o she lookin armmorful carl a fol arfol barfol o e sa i she o barl co mise mooo i do not she josn't wish she just mot o make som the north poll that well ask and she is important she is to seee al of the north pole missusshe coss is actually my loss se allen wanted to yasand the little girl shut did not want to promise cookies and set her up to be disappointed on christmas day instead he pivited to a feminous message he later told me he wansto have date the image of missus clas for kids especially for girls he is not the idea that she just pakes cookies and petters around the north pole all day a one pm the doors or close santa allen's been there for two hours talked over a hundred kids he changes out of his costume and into what is referred to as santa casual red clothing but not the wholshabang christmas light he bacts ap and we get in the car we are bout to drive back to his house when allen realizes he is left his back packinside the sdoor this is a problem for him because he really does not want to go back and get it and hav people see him when he is not in the full santa costume but as we are walking back to the pier one a guying a car notices allen ta allen puts his finger up to his lips as if to say s wo o i will not say nothin tige says then we are standing in front of the stoore waiting to be let back in when a girl in the back seat of a car driving by yells santa aes an it dn't want ta ruin the image for anybody do not ther i yet allen tries to tack himself into the corner of the building by the door to hide from people but it does not work at all for go everyone who passes by double takes him her yells at him ii allen looks misserable it is funny you have transformed back into arlen ino ow the rod sou d you live what yo u scorm now i down't but i'm i'm stracked by the chance formation how different you ar i guess som bact to being fortuns or something other you are literally cowering in a corner i is not the man i saw thirty minutes agat ole im im i'm not him on me allen did not play on on ending his first chair gag glue to the side of a pierr wan but there

believe it not cancels for christmas and we come home that night and my father gets a phong clau it is exactly wet yo think thend he picks it up in the first thing the principal sase toimas professorattleman your sons have a lying problem my father said what did they do and the principale said well that do you tryig to explain to the children the very delicate topic of christmas and outs raised his head and he said we had christmas and i teter thait he did not have christmas and he said whom pry sure we a christmawi stocking snoopy charley brown menin christmas pand the teateres edanta christmas econiga three wakes tago or nine months er not to penning on er anyway don jews believe in the sky called santa claus and in my mind's iye i remember aja raising his hand and saying we had santa claus that is what i remember but d are conflicting a counts here apparently aja did not raised his hand apparently aja in the words of the teacher lifted two fingers he was ordering a second tomartaning and ajit and say we had santa claus apparently aded is wen we know santi claus and the deaters yout or santa cas ey jay and tit is y o us nd the other kids who santa clas tey us all he is amazing he is a fat man and he comes down nown juish chimneys an the middle of the night and he gives just as young gentiles he is a liza but insteat of ine is cookyes ind gess well last night because he is friends s way our dad we cane down our chimney and he let this walkman are not he the creet at my parents pot in the grage and he ate all of the cookies principle said professor adlman is this true and apparently enfather jus when no it is not entirely show and the principle said what you mean it is not entirely show and my father's that shorelaniate the cookies i jays wrog sant ta did not come to our house and my momsas there was a significant paus on the other end of the foun and then the principle went a do not tant tat didin't come to your yet christmas my father explained he explained that cally was bereft and that she and know where to go and that he hehad reservations about this but he let a happing cause he thought i was actually really valuable teachable moment where he could explain to his children that doing the thing sanderd in jewish values may not always appeer conventionally jewish and more than anything else doing this for this woman who really a nower togot really was a classic example of which yuse which ritinally call mitzpa whishmeans good deed principle listens that explaines my dat finishes the principle said professor dleman i understand re coming from but your wrong cas what you have actually done is you have introduced this holiday that is foreign and corrosive into your home and you have coolearly confused your children and perhaps harm to them permanently we have given him this holiday and next year going to take it away from them what is secondan do this is not a good deed this is in emidst of uts idle worship which is the most grievous sin that you can possibly commit and you and your wife need you begin repenting for that right now and my father to his credit went whele clearly rabbi you do not understand the meaning of christmas and then he hsa men thet nexi to is one man show just for us to he can sho to london in january i kno whon he is bining to show to your city go to alics adlman comedy tot com

christmas and what that does for them we arrived denat three of our show at three buffalo gals canth yo come out to night an istor ay a the new experience s somebody is having at christmais is simple we have a grown man a man who loves films classic film's obscure films new films all kinds of films and hi seen tons of them who somehow has never seein the most pevasive movy that is out there christmas it is a wonderful live the man somebody is been on the show a bunch one of our from producers neo drumming i executive eged or a manuel burry is in ral life friends with nail id took it upon yorself to change his life forever or possibly not at all a shown the film i've watched ta lot of movi is with mel it is fun because he gets giddy and excited about showing you movy you have not seen you always know you 're going to have a thoughtful conversation afterwards but i also sometimes hate it when he recites all the dialogue and dazed in confused while your trying to watch it hem how 'd he miss this movy that is been on tellovision every year since he was born i really i feel the christmas christmas movies that i love ar the movies with christmas in the background all british movies but lik love assioly or di hard or movies would christmas in that backround christmas in the foreground i've never seen the one with the little kid with the glasses a christmas story yet but the movie that are just christmas i just did not ihave a inclination to see them i think it is because christmas for me was always in the background gi was as youh was witness a christmas was a thing that happened around to me no christmas tree no christmas carols no christmas movies give in that what is your favorite a christmas movy christmas in the background movy i guess is but i'm oing them i think dihood is clearly my favor christmamovy i mean im i i hate to be traditional as as erdistion i meis a lat o man a lot of people allow men will say that ihotis i fi christma it is is it just your favorite moy it is in my tat five cons mas stontly neel you see is a classic example of the problem i think there is a world a people out there who have not seen it is a wonderful life because ther impression is it ust some corny halmarky movy weardly i think the most popular christmas mayvby out there is also somehow the most unverated by people meil to be a fron about this i love it is a wonderful life i love the romance of it the darkness the humor i love jimmy steart thaly actor and his bumbling charm zusys paddles the broken bannaster i love it all it is not just my favorite christmas film it is my favorite film andi want neal to see what i see what do abo it is wonderful life it is a christmas movy because it happen it is always unaired on christmas but and i know i think i i thing masies is involoved something wrong here is what else he thinks he knows jimmy stewart it is in black an wite and he saw something on insor gran that it is about a person losing everything which makes me think it is maybe it is some kind olike you will tid re telling of the jobe story who can and o ats a guess another reason it is a wonderful life holds a special place in my heart that ending of the film actually makes me get a little tery i'm not a crier i'm enbarrass by the idea of a film making me cry but for lots of people i think it is a wonderful life sneaks up on you do you think ye will cry i mean at old absolutely will not cry thou anththy i can think of that i cry that was there was a willsmits movy where he played a poor father once i cam with the man them phrset of happiness yes wos of happiness you wuld hide during prisive cause he had this thing of be has some long speech above failure as a man and o low i feele i do not know oun you migt cry e aai man ok a tas for yous illosy if ive if there is a longespeech about failing is a man and maye yo ol cri that is that is a a a me start the film in case you meal have not seen it the movy is about george baily a bright goofy and friendly young man ho wants to see the world but keeps getting stuck in his hometown first sits a job that keeps him there his father passes and he takes his place running the family business then it is a romance george meets marry at a dance where they fall into a pool ad they are force to walk home in whatever dry clothing they can ringle together marry is in a bathrob and george is in a football uniform three sizes to bag baoga cannot you come out tont i ad meal loves a rom come a good meek you yet allther wost me talk that i tell you with a prettish girl to well why do not you say wa o al ba be alse is i is a this is a wat ouis is a me this is a very have i talking to watch yish wh do i u a to a de o that why do not ju u s t all sixy this is amazing this is o ha o a eto you is wis shd o al the chemistry between the two leads on this fateful walk home an can tell meals at least somewhat sol george and marry get married and just when george is about to get out of town travel with his wife there is a bankru al then after that a wor abable he'ch time his face with another obstable westuck he sticks around trise to fix it and till one fateful christmas eve his business is about to go under bec has of a careless mistake made by one of his impoys but george is a one he will be held responsable he is lost feels he has no place to turn he goes home marrying the kids are decorating for christmas and he snaps i is a wong every time while you call is a happy family why we hav t have always ki eo go not marry christmas e is it neel wel wit i is te does on a a a l whos an a is horrible george wishes a nevery been dorin and an angel name clarence makes his wish come true war he sees what the town would be if he did not exist and i's horrible ruled by money grubbing robber barron's nobody has jobs or who he will points out it is very much a film he has seen back to the future only then does george realize that impact his life has made and that he in fact had a wonderful life sorry cann't help myself a r clarence takes back george's wish he runs home to his family and then everyone in town shows up and gives him money his business was survive o s o i s o t i ad look over anyo no tears but when the film ends he tells me thate he liked it and he was surprised by it and recognize that it was not just a christmas filn i definitely forget of se chrstasta i stop thicking about the christit does not feel that that does not feel whodsable untill they sing ol i eto funny when you are saying at the beginning that you ware oh yi christmas maes or christmasmes in the beckand is the yet this is this is one of those thines actea even the old exanis amusi ew years thing it is the christmas wage does not really come back to christmas it is not a bout that wo o yel is alon is a ga cet ocet say mor they vocade the bolt the feme of both of them is to thet things are not as bad as you think is that dis your life could that if you sto and appreciate your lie o it not even just if you its thought just that you stop and appreciate you it is that circumstance dire circumstance forces you to appreciate you life an dy hard absures of ridiculously obsurd terriss i convance makes it that he appreciates his his marriage in his family more and he fights to say this wellel about them that is any the thing i love't the most by them wil bes howlike thit is kind of a romantic film it is wat everything i hav is great is shuld go back and save it and this is that same thing o jus in the moment when things are bad you can feel it was not worth it but if you stop and look at it it is worth saving it is wrth for serving it is the in of the year maybe the these kinds of mobes jus suppose to ro mind as they amongs sote things you did wong thiton thing dislike it is ultimately worth it an enough but maybe that is a common thing lke mobes at eir at the end of the year may be me just want to be reassured going into the next year that what we did was not completely awastence time at one point while we are talking about the film ne'll asked by a cry at that moment the towns people come out to support george and i say it is nice to think that people might recognize all that you do for them nell tells me maybe that is what 'm emotional because i do a lot for other people and yells tas maybe that is why he is not emotional becaus well he does not not news to me casin point what i did for him this christmas gave him the gift of watching it is a wonderful what he did for me got me to watch diehard manelbury is i ha sinsentin o that that for single bells such he call i celebrating who christmas first of eron this year one that she is still puzzling through hi she my marriage was over by last christmas but i did not notice because i wase having such nice time one of my ats as many radiant qualities was how much he liked t the holidays il was in star contrast to me a misery gramland who recently escaped a bog and is elergic to natural sunlie i did not really grow up celebrating christmas i was raised hen do by emigrants who just did not really care about the holiday the extent of our decorations was a sparse plastic tree with screwed in branches that looked if a spruce had recently been set uplays our family's dedication to the holiday was always cartunishly pathetic but when i met my axts a little over ten years ago i realize that being with him ment being with a christmas perisen it was joining a cult where the belief structure was built around a glazed ham being with him met we bought a real live tree year after year felling our apartment with pine meedles that i'd fined until we bought the next real live tree does not it smell grat he would say and i reply with no because years of cigarette smoking has robbed me of a sense of smell my ex husband was practically competitive about gift giving al was giving me the best gift the thing i wanted sometimes even the several o things i wanted one year he took me to kee ap another year he bought me and intendl consul that had been reliably sold out for months the year after that delicate dimond studs for my non deserving years i got him a bag three times just three different bags i do not know he seemed to need a lot of bags i do not know what i'm doing out here o hey and a i cas in and as ia i ii a i toon i resented christmas and his love for it often we used to fight about how i wanted to go see my family for the holidays even thoughthere was not much of a holiday to speak of and how he wanted to go back to his sleepy little home town with the three carsenta claus parade and his stepmother's gingerbred village at the grandchildren bicared over and the minsauce with his dad's lamb and the christmas brunch with his mother i was always fighting against my instincts to hate everything to be synical to ask to be left alone i did not christmas because it required much sincerity and emotional intelligence i clearly obviously still lack we separated in february and he is now off building a life i know nothing about i was worried about how he would do alone at christmas but who is alone in actuality me the christmas hater i'm grinch at the top of the mountain looking down at the denizens of hooville asking and the smallest voice possible do they miss me down there because though i was always loth to admit it i did many things about christmas with his family i did how i always felt warm and soft between december twenty third and twenty six i was a big fat baby in a clush blanket i became comfortable with it and eventually i learned to look forward to it christmas with him and his people was the closest to cortizal zero i've ever gotten in my life my ex husband's mother and stepmother always told me they loved me on christmas day when we exchanged gifts and i always said at back i meant it too a rarity for me i liked t being a daughter in law and offering to help with the turkey even though i have no idea how to cook a turkey there was comfort in opening the garage door and seeing his cousin's piled in there wearing old labath's wetters chain smoking and fighting over who stole whose lighter all these forty something yearls reverting to who they were when they were seventeen my ex were up somewhere without the pollution of a big city you could always se the stars i wish i had spent more time looking at them wto marry into a family that loves christmas is to be conscripted into something that feels pleasingly conspiratorial exactly what you need to do and wear and for whom the days pass and inc yue closer to december twenty fourth and you have a precise awareness of what is expected of and for you and when the holiday is done you have all these little secrets to whisper to each other in delight remember that year my mom put brownsugar in the eggs she made for christmas day brunch my husband would whisper into my mouth while we lay in bed after we return to our lives in new york to the albatros at increasingly was our marriage i'd laugh and say yes but we ate it because we love her and we love each other right we love each other say it one more time to i'm sure that you are sur now all i feel is this constant twinge in my gut it is having a tale cut off i was not supposed to even have one but i did for a while and now i do not i thought about spending christmas alone this year i could do something devastating and romantic take myself on a solo vacation maybe some ere sunny where i'd swan around an drapy fabric and look sad and hot and sad maybe it a resort every one there would think i had a secret but the secret is ah i'm sad instead on both hands i count the people i will not speak to this december his folks his siblings his nieces an nephews the cousin of his that was my favorit the other cousin of hiss who alwayspent too much time touching my lower back his aunt whe always called me sasha even ten years in i'll add this pain to the several others that hardenme from the inside out the first year of divorce is just a march of agonies every notable event the first when you do by yourself first birthday where we do not even speak first family medical crisis where we do not cling to each other driftwood in a sunamy and now our first christmas apart ggmy grief around my divorce remains wildly on predictable i do not have any stratagy or plan on how to cope with the holidays i just have to walk through a t j max and glare at the christmas display and how i have no use for a santaclas cookachar i never did but now i really do not in the end i decided to just go home this year and lick my wounds amongst my own family my twelve year old neece since the sterla celebrate christmas with glee there are cookies to be ice and an embarrassmen o riches under the tree and a fire place and am any dock sending beans whowill gladly snap a hunk of ter te ofh of your fork even my dad injoys christmas if forst heu will never say no to a slisif pcan pie after a dinner that he complains does not have enough masala i could conceivably find pleasure in this holiday again if i worked at it but i do not want to write now it is not that i or dislike the holiday it is simply that now it hurts my feelings i crave nothing more than in difference to view christmas is but another holiday that is not mine e stir onica eed

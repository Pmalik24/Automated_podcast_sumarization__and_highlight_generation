jobidon builds miles wall along the southern border even as he attempts to deny it will make any difference at all chaosk continues among re publicans seeking an hew speaker and the aft the ilaunch is a new effort to target trum followers i'm benchgro this is the benchbirreau sho the benshpir showsponser bexpressivepana privacy is right not a privilege to fend your rights at expressipy pianzi com lashe men department of home land security secretaril a hondro mayorkas on wednesday waved twenty six different federal waws that actually allowed him to build border wall in south texas apparently among the twenty six waws the de just weaved according national view that includes the clean air actsive drinking water actin in dangered species act theprogect will be twented by congressional appropriations package from fiscaly yor twenty nineteen it is ambe tons of wall but it is some walls twenty miles of wall along the border an star county texas that is an area experiencing higlegl entry the bidan administration has acknowledged tot this was necessary they put forar to statement saying as much suggesting that this is the way that this was going to go that basically we need the wall if you do not have the walls can be very difficult for us to secure the border this of course greate the major con undrum because jobidon suggested during the twenty twen y race that walls are bad they are in effective they are useless and infact the idea of the trump wall was incredibly bad races terrible is why you had ol general coso quortezs during the trump administration jhetting on down to the southern border to hang around empty parking lots and fake cry into the camra over over offence this is why you had the entire media shrieking and crying about the idea of donal tromp building more borderwall the is why just a few weeks ago you had judges who are stepping in to prevent the governor of texas gregg abbot from putting boueis in themiddle of the reo ground fprevent people fromhe legally attempting to cross that border well now they ave flipet now theyave flipt again it is not all that long ago they were saying all the sort of stuff the as as ofe twenty twenty one correnjon pier was saying on behalf of this administration that walls do not work the also sese wora present agre as as we have said that ta i i have to look at the the a comments i have not sant tums i whan to makesure i read it with in contact abut we have talke d about the border wall here in in general as as a way a that the it is been usein in to to get to to close the border and we feel that it is a policy that doesnt work and is not just us ait experts has said that the borderwall is not a it is not an effective policy that was the administration just a couple of years ago what changed well turns out millions people have crossed the southern border under jobiton and they are all going up to northern cities blue cities new york chicago and turns out that people in tose blue cities do not it very much you got governors cathy hocal in new york calling out the byt administration youhave the governor of illinois jaby pritzker and the mayor brandon johnson of chicago calling for jobidon fix this thing here they were just a couple of days ago we have to have better poornation with every stinge lovel of government and that ifluds the state of texes there are other things the federaoer can tdo other than sending es money but they have not yet done e no letter to presidenbidon asking for more help governor fritzkers tas the crisis he is overwhelming the state in the city's ability to provide aid it will all of this has driven the bide administration into some dose of reality or least it did briefly there is a brief moment in time just a couple of days ago and it appeared t the by administration might be shocked into reality mayben to stop the overwhelming flot of leglipmigrans at the border may orkc a send an an official filing in the federal registers is just a couple of days go quote there is presently and acute an immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the united states in order to prevent unlawful entries into the united states in the projugareas in order to insure the expedicious construction of the barriers and roads in the projugareas i have determined that it is necessary exercise at the authority vested a me by section one or to se of the i i r i r a he is out you waive regulations ind ord t make this sort of thing happened but then wokenist snaped back into place a mausetrap there is no way the by administration was can be able to flip this dramatically after claiming that donal trumpleton evil human rites violator for ttempting to build borderwall and yesterday jobidn the defunct president of the united states suggested that actually the borderwal will not work which raise the questionis t why then they are building it but e says guys guis its its sto lock on a work ot i did not change my mind is lock on work which is building it cause we have to build it which is weird since you had to wave twenty six regulations in order to bild it here is jobine yesterday then why are you doing it i you doing it the answer is that he is doing it because he also knows that the consequence if not doing it are really bad politically but he still has to please his left wing at bases he has created a situationi which he is caught between rock and hardplace is a catch twenty two for him and the same with the crime policys a catch twenty to if crime goes out a control iooks really bad for his administration if he adsmore cops to the streets it also looks really bad for his administration left wing policy is a failure when you pursueit to its logical conclusion which is an open border in this particular case people do not it very much and then you hae to back track and that he will yellit you for back tracking an this wat jobidon does not want to what exactly is jobidins excuse for having spent the money to actually build wall he says the money was appropriated he have to spend it which again is weird from a president of the united states whos unalaterally declared himself the ability to relieve student londebt to the tune of hundreds of buillions of dollars for example but when it comes to money alicated for border wall funting suddenly wlike riht now he dis govered the actually has to spend money those appropriated in twenty nineteen strange p trionwut i mean you could theoredically you could say we couln't wave the regulation sorry i that be the eses easy way to do it they literally had to wave regulations in or to make this happen they could have made the case secretary mayoricus easily could not made the case got i want to spen te money but the regulations prevent me from spending money tbecause obviously a be inviolation of life i did spend ma not doing that he is building the walls the one havenit both ways agin tho one build the wall claim the wall does nothing they can simultaneously claim there doing something stop the borderflow and also claim to all f thei'r left wing buddies that actually they still agree with themselves when they took the moronic position that walls do nothing which of course is silly of course walls do something you would't have a giant fence around the white house if walls did nothing eans it is it is it is an argumen that is beneath contempt that walls do nothing of course walls do something they have for all of human history stupid heull get to more on thisin just one second first company is

he said we need the wall because we have a big pop on the border then because tobidin decided that he was going to maintain the position that they do not need the wall and walls are bad he had to walk it back here is mayoricas yesterday walking it back ro do ont this ad ministration is made clear gthat a boarder wall i's not the answer that remains our position an our position that is never waver the language in the federal register notice i's being taken out of contact an it does not signify any change in colicy whatsoever always missin context is it the powwer you explicitly said that there isan immediate need to build border wall this follows hard on mayricas claiming thatit was not actually border wall thotas actully just construction along the borderwhat they building a castle well ad ministra galf course what it what exactly as it was what would you call the thing that you are building that is a wall it it is all idio and they are asuming your more ons me creen chom pierre a gain wildly on tallent to prass secretaries to shofs ask what why is it tht you want a break you es lall in order to put up the wall and thn claim tat the walls does not does not do anything and she has no

waw why not tiss to appor we win to congress the congress appropriates e finding why hongress thathongres a proriates to fii we ask ton te not use that unin an that particular purpose they denied it and now we are complying with the lw you have to go o wter aw buyi to tin he to wor o wan to torytes ton terenow im not gat an to hypotheticals from here i'm jus telling you whet i can tell you from here the facts are that w d chest is complying with the la this is from tisco yer tis wiss underpisco er twenty nineteen under republican leaderschip an d a chest is preplyin to do this the president astmultipal times of congress to reappropriate they did not and were not complying by the lo thanks everybody much legal compliance from this administration i mean that if there is one thing we know about this administration they love complying with be separation of powers in which congress passes ae law andthe president signs in the president abides by that legislation that is something this administration absolutely adorse they would never do anything you knolaterlly say i know tell ocha to cram down a vax mantate on eighty million americans they would never do anything that after all the power of the legislature controls what ocha can and cannot do tand that is not in the enabling legislations obviously they would follow the law he mean i they would never try to twist the laws relive hundreds of billions of dollars of student loned at just get rid of it in that they follow the law clearly and just just they are right here there is an appropriation to build the wawl and that just following the law by building the lal even if they think it is useless because that is just what sicklers these people are for the law or they are completely pholograp they are completely vograp we all know that they are full of grap but this is the problem when you take positions thet are counter logic and decency and then the effects of those those policies come to fruition youeve thit somehow mitagate agains your on policies the reason this is happening is very obvious you got people in new york and people in chicago and people in california and people all over the left wing the big cities biblucities are complaining about jo bidons illegal emigration probet there is a reason by the way that your bidn is doing this and that is because his poll numbers absolutely stink his poll numbers on emigration are benot they are not just under water theyare wildly under water i mean insanely under water jour bitons approveal mbers on migration a twenty per cent yes the do something but a the same time he esn't want to ticke off that left wing base nwhat is amazing to me is that he is attached to the left hem base why are theyg n igal vote for donal trump obviously not i theven to stay home of trump is on the ballet obviously not but he feels the necessity you really does to ckator set active space in who is that activ i space is not black people in americas major citie who are overwhelmingly in favor of less he legal migration is im litenos in america whre overwhelmingly in favor of less illegal migration it is woke white liberals living in upper class suburbs whonever hafe te gult the consequence is in theminningo ship to martha's vineyards then then all the sudden they are starting to freak out and and and complain but until then they are very happy o put their lwnsigns the rutu signaling wansigns a man that the democratic patic polisy is disasterarea an an republicans could point that out if they were not in themiddle of a speakership battle which they declared on themselves because that that is definitely the best way to fight a war is if yorn the middle of a of a of a battle a political battle with the other side the best thing to do his

starts right now i'll cas o meanwhile while democrats are de claying war on themselves over whether to build a border wall or not the athe epublicans are declaring war on themselves with regard to this speakership battle in a fascinating new twist to the speakership battle apparently the republicans are now going to hold a speakership debate apparently telivized which io kay all rihhe i here is my objection to this my only object i'm all for transparency but who republicans alecke in a closed cawcas to lead their cawkas really should not be a a matter of public scrutiny nearly as much as you voting free to local congress person the reason i say this is because how the sausage gets made is very different then how people tell you the sausage gets made on talk radio and on talk grate what i do for living i moain to give you the purest most conservative perspective because that is what i get to do i mam i'm lucky ot on't have to make the sausage but behind the closed doors obvious there is wealing and dealing trades get made but the problem is that inssentive structure s completely scewe you can i should get the deal done you cannot elect to speaker unless there is some deals that are eting made behind closed doors and this is for example i's one of the problems with the republican fight agains year marks or years an yours in yours republicans have said quite correctly on principale ourracks are really bad they are they'e really bad youre marks o the system whereby there is a bill it is coming through and i attached a rider fry district and i say i'm only going to vote in favor of the spill if you build the benshippereo post office in my district an's really bad becaus if everybody does that yo und of spending lot of money the problem is if nobody does that yoon't pass any buills and you in e thy giant omnibus package that only get support becase the giant crap sand which anyway usually a larger crapsandwhich then would ave been attained with a few simple ermars and gain the saucsage making process is really ugly telivizing all of that are not that is that is gray wov prolonging the speaker chaos i suppose because you are gin to and up with a a segment that is very proachim jordan you n not up with a segment that is very proe heaven hern for example you will this is what is going to happen because it is not as though any one of these candidates is completely dominate the three big candidates wouvd ben mentione at this point or steveskillys jim jordan and republican study coittee chair ceven hern of oclohoma apparently a corin punchpal news fox news bret bare is gin a host a closed it debate and discussion between the jeope candidates for speaker on monday night according to a sorce involved with the planning and then later it came out apparently ther's are gon telivize that which a it is can be vir if you are running for speaker of the house now you are basically kind of running for president right not not formally but you are getting in front of the american people on the republican base and showing who has most fealty to conservative principles the problem is that you can show that fealty but the system constrains you from actually achieving those gulls you make the biggest promising promise o everything o everybody two minute from now everis n we real disappointed when we hit the end of the continuang resolution and somebody cuts to deal which is exactly what is going to happen as we all know anywhere publicans are gin a host that candidave form tuesday night and the close party election on wednesday there is no timeline for electing a speaker on the house floor this thing is problican continue for a number of days donald trump for his part he a after originally recommending cev mc carthy for the post mc carthy was very pro trump and then doing nothing to stop covenmc carthy from falling donald trump then num apparently started sharing posts on truth social pitching himself as the speaker and calling coven mc carthy a traitor which is as always no one is more loyal than present the mosas in an anicas donald trump is now in dorsing jim jordan for speaker just fini i really jim jordan i think he is terrific the ead of the house oversike committee at gand i know i am wants this job the terrible job but jim jordan is an excellent candidate he is one o the founders the ouse freedom calkas he is extremely conservative across the board and as far as trump goes to big trump backer now the problem is of course were also in th middl of an open primary inside the republican party while trump is way in front in that primary hes still represents about half of the republican part y and the other half the re publican party is split among a myriad of candidates jo trumpson dorseman he is not sure to guarantee that somehow jordan becomes the guy especially because there is a whole wing of moderates in h party who may not be in love with jim jorn cev mc carthy people ripped him for not having centralizing principles and to a certain ex ent theres some truth to that because he is a consummate politician anhy kind o have to be in ord tr be speaker of the house and broke or some sort of a greement between all these disperict groups yet cannot really be a guy who has sort of hard and fast principles unless you can be a dictator new gingrice was very early on when he was speaker of the house an than he ended up being tefend a straited anyway after a certain point being a iddealist in being speaker of the house are usually not things that go together this 's why mish mac conal's a very effective sen at majority leader but not the most ideological politician usually these two things are in conflict if youn't be per ticularly effective is legislature as legislator usually that means not being a purist in any case jim jordan is more of a purist thate a lot of people in moderate district in new york maybe who maght not love jim jordan steveskallees is considered again sort of the eparty faverit in the sense that he is not coming in from the outside he was a second n command two ckeven mc carthy ther healt can cerns about steveskillees there is now been some talk believe oor not about patrick mac henry possibly not because patrick c henry actually has a lot of acking but because he is the speaker protensy sorte just sitting there lready in order for any sort of speakership vote to happen the big thing that is cannot have to happen is their goin to have to change the motion two they cate rule the motion vacate rule which is a consession made by kev mc carthy two te mackateswing o the party was that he would allow any one anylike a single person to bring a motion to vacate the chair if they did not likewhat he was doing an that basically set the stage for him being oused an n any point because h has very very narrow house majority all it took was basely five re publicans voting against him and he would lose his speakership even if the other ninety sevenen persout ofthe calkas was in favor of ken mc carthian in fact that is what happen in order for any new speaker to be elected and the have any power at all than motion to vacate is goin to have to be changed an corin punchball that is exactly woulds happening forty five house re publicans including several power players to brittna letter to the conference effectively to manding changes the motion to vacate rule that costmc carthy his job a few members who signd the s letters tai they are not willing to indorse anybody for speaker until the motion o vacate is overhauled those names include represent of sepeny bice voke loholma dusty johnson of south to cota represent brinfit is patrick of pennsylvania gheri graves of louisiana for an affairs at ommittee char mihte mc caul of texas and ways an means comitte chur jason smith o missouri againis a big faction it is forty five people there is even some talk to mc carthy ight get a secon go round here although i think that that is very unlikely aft this point meanwhile the question is wether any of these people oter can be able to ras lot o money steevescolese has he is raised about a hundred seventy million dollars to spport various re publicans over the last decade sclees raised more in last cycle fifty three million than jorden raised over the last decate thirty eight million that is can be a major concern again being speaker o the house is not the same is being i most idea logically pure usually it is the gicn cut deals nd get get people elected but this is a a pretty significant mass well get into more of that massing just one second first look at the wy that light is strimming in near homeright now when i bought my home in florda one of thethings that mattered most moves have him into the home because honestly it is too dark in my house i cannot stand it and that meant i took a look to window coerngs n tht i went to blind sto coman i got better window coverings becuse that makes a huge different

percent off at blinds tot com when chick out on line do not forget to tell them you heard about blinds ot com from the benship yere o shol rules and restrictions may apply gat as you ben saying in order for any speaker to be able to run the house you can have to have some level of authority over the members of his own caukus is what representative johnson was saying dusty johnsonseuf to cotty saying and we got a bunch of foundational probems here and if we do not fix those before a new speaker is named there is just gon ta continue let me just lay it out there cut to the chase who you with in the speaker battle o no then in by yo i mak we ga wes candis yes sir i why we can we do not change yo d yo ho we yan r ha s it us goint me to san stupint com carde theer draer i mean an that is correct if if these rules happens wo not grand the the speaker enough power to actually keep his calkus in line tofr not geting anything done obviously to hav to be consequences for stepping out of line it is very funny me that live yeopl are very happy i cep mac carthto getting outstead ire lot of the same people ware very upset at at rogues john mc caine in in the united statestenant i agree with them about john mc kanbat the whole point as you cannot actually pass anything unless you keep your majority in line and if you remove all the consequences that are available to keep people in line they will not stay in line yof have a collective action problem representive maxmiller re publican of ohio he says lesn't if we eep fightingeach other here i'm not hope for even cun be able tokeep the majority om te stand here and tell you by the actions of to taken place this week i'm not hopeful to keep tohe majority i'm not hopeful th one about the senate you do not i spoke to president trunk three times yesterday and i explain to him hat there could be a colithion government that would happen and throughout that process we would lose in the house of representatives what a trump say when you told him all thi set is incredibly upset this is wri love to get to my point i knew about makgates using them maget clok ot to go ahead and the postcontannot twitter with no contect to make it seem as if he has president trumps support and he pates it ind the most broad strokes possible that is why he good at what he does is because he is a bs harvest i'l gate mackeets strying if i back an that perception by doing something that i will say is is clever he is saying ofll cat i'm good to negotiate on motion vacate he says myt yo obe college one raise the threshold on the motion vacate there is a question for them if we enact or forms to laid out by re presentove rocana whos democrat from california nice guin i've interviewed ro before how high would you the emtevo threshall to be i'll basically give you whatever you want for this stuff what it what what exactly is that stuff a ban on congressional stoctratning which makes tons to me put everything into into a blind trust make some sort of consequent you cant involve yoursev in it twelve your termlinet for congress and a ban on political donations from lobbyus or pask now we know that this is going nower i kake those last tut things are going nowhere and the reasonthaes ar going nowhere is because they ar bunch people sitting in congress ry now far beyond the twelve your termlinet oudo not open up a bunch of safe districts forepublicans to challenge there is that as far as the man on political dnations from lobbyus or packs i'm i'm just wondering if republicans enact that and democrats do not how is tackling to work out shes saing he is gan a change th the motion to vacate rules if there is a ban on political donations from lobbyus or packs for whom for justs re publicans he is that seems shooting yourself to rectly in the face agan i'm i'm perfectly willing to here mackates his list of demands but if the idea is that all lobbists and packdonations goway by by theway all a packdonation is that that 's a ga grouple people who get togetherand they put together re political actions on committee and then they and they spend money on behalf of a candidate if republicans take that off the table and the they let democrats do it how exactlyis that advantageous orepublicans attempting to win i jus lobbyists is not as much as the next gy but but the notion that democrats are gin a continue doing this an republic doing it a stop doing this if put you an inherent disadvantage electorally our democrats can avote to do this over all and how exactly with that tie in to republican at temds to get a speaker to to push that what mackates is are to shown is that republicans can push stuff and if democrats do not go along with it mackates blames the republicans to any way he did this with regard to word security he literally got up the other da mous you gui say that you passd a harshbord secure te regiment why did not se that become wal right cas thre's a democratic senete and a democratic president and both those people both those those institutions continue to maintain that wallsdo not do things i do not understand if macgates once o put for d a list the actual ike chievable things that do not actively damage the re publican partyes ability to be democraks i'm happy to hear it i said this before with chiproy was doing this agains gep mocarthy which he did earlier in the year and then he names bunch concessions i'm all in favor that that is fine but if these concessions are non duable concessions thet democrats take ad manage of i'm notsur how that exactly is a big win and how it is not exactly posturing an gen all this puts whoever is running for speaker in in a pretty major jam here because for example jim jordon he has come for id and he says we are not gon to go to a vote with out to eighteen mi bregin to need two eighteen in ordero go for d with avout when i'm an have vote on the speakerin to have alreadyeside behind close or sus speaker it has the hap we should not go to the houseforn till we have two hundred eighteen vots for the spiker of the anited states house to re presentatives we should not have to go through what we did back in january i'm all for that i think i can bring our teeme to gether to accomplish that and more importantly once we get that done to do the work that ne it is to be done on the border on crin on and platin on all these issues we have to address i think i can do that that is why the tateder me under what conditions is the big question under what conditions what actuall get's hammered out here is going to find whether the oustrom mc carthy was good or bad yet i sems tere is no plan in oustin mac carthy maybe dens up o k anyway avready scrambles nthe nd of coming with some sort of agreement if that that is the case thin credit to gat but if it does not end up that way if its just sur chaos or if we ans up back in the same situation with an incredibly weak speaker unable to keep his own people in line then democrates are going to win because again if you look as though you are running a clown car people will vote for democrats even if their policies are absolute sher garbage though the one good piece of news yere is the donal trump whos speculating just a a few moments to go about possibly running for speaker himself elysias stop that nonsense that thats dume i'm not even shur wyt people were con sidering that theres an active house rule right now on the re publicanside that ifyoure under an active indightman you cannot be house speaker a trums under multiple active indichtments right now that ut if had changed the rold an super awkward i kno who thought the trump had the skill set to be speaker of the house anyway itwould in very strange im but dome at least that is off the table when trump indorse is jordan good for trump for endorsing somebody at this point one the ways can tell the jordanis good candidet is how much lift tates him sunny hoston of the view she says the jim jordan is a terrorist literally a terrorist why is yo shrapping dyna might to himself now he was meanr or one time i will just say about genjoit and i he has been called by his own party by giant john baner a political terrorist he is also been link to the ohio sat sextual the be scandal i testifi in front o congress about something semple cameras and court rums he came in late he lookd de sevled and he immediately was screaming and yalling and terrorized to me and be of their experts on the panel and describing him as a terroris as exxactly that he is a ccaos agent and it came out of nowhere and he had no command of the subject that we were talking about which madit evenscarriou to have ha the thought of im being thespeaker of the house i thinkeads to more chaos at his won model as tomel trumcl as no command of the language y that o gaa joy bay hard ripping people for for lact of command of the english language ans a watching a dog try to explain to to a human no how language ought to work you are mostly just amaze the dog can speak english ot the monlic jo joy p you ripping people for command the eglish i mish good stuff right there again that is the singlebus case forage im joran i've eard now shere is the awkward thing heres the awkward thing whatever deal gets cut the republican party is going to halfton now actually re establish itself as a party o spent the last fifteen years in the republican party ripping power away from the people of the top of the republican party that as come with a couple of benefits and some pretty significant clos the benefits are that the republican party has gotten more right wing or least it did briefly when it came to for example spending the tea party movement which i thought was terrific outs of part of it calld un congress to actually pushback on spending the problem is that when you take away the leadership of the institutions and you simply destroy them and you say that petty much everyyou crete a roiling boiling pot inside for example the republican party and therepublican party inferstructre has no power to actually dictates well that point whate yu went up with sendlessto ket andless caus yet it is of on you re publicans wilook at nancy polosy on the one hand with theep in abiting hatred for her policy and on the other hand with a bit of admiration for the fact that she is kept her caucas together mho say this all the time nancy pollosy is obviously gooded her jop shetdy fractius caucas she kept it together how because she crammed down on them she said listen i'm not gon give you money i'm nto fine people the primary you i'm no threaten your committee memberships i'm in a run this place a dictatorship this not a democracy thiis not a group of people gettin together at late nighte at the club and figuring things out with comedy this is me running the place and you cannot hve it both ways either you want to fight nancy polosy which requires natural consolidation or power around institutions with leadership or you wanto argue amongst yourselves in the name of principle andthn lose to pople nancy polosy which is why they are goin to have to be some sort of tools tat are put in the hands of the house leadership that are going to a low punishment for the members now right now i understand every's running for speaker and at the moment it is gointo be all of them basically appealing to the etter angels of nature rits o you have jim jorn or example defending macgates from the calls for expulsion her'e been some members the republican caucas have said t what he did heare is ridiculous that should expell hem from thec caucas i do not think you expell hem from the caucaswhen youhave a forseet majority but the the basic notion here that going forward the leadership isn ship we will not have the tools to punish people how exactly canoperated them hagsoutan operated right now one of people wis coming under even greater fire than macates in some ways is an nancy mace she join for no reason any one can explain seven hard liners in austing mc carthy she is at best a moderaterepublican preticular ly on on abortion its shocked everybody when she joined to to aust mc carthy ia're goring to politica mc carthy and makesto noisy eed aye but he california republican had help maces secure her seat in congress by pumping millions of dollars ans her one struggling campaign maces move to aggressively fundrays off or her vote to bals mc carthy is only intensifying her colly to angers towards her for maces the auntimc carthyvote mad prove a purposeful step and a commilionic career that tardy seenor swing repeatedly between trump centric conservative and establishmen bucking centrism maces making clear her bote for speaker is up for the taking by either steevescleese or representative jim jordan else wherein the geo pee revenges on them and you house re publicans are now weighing to expel mace fom at least two centress leading groups she belong to in the first place that follows hard out of very awkward appearance for nancy maces oncianan where she was sendng out funrasing emails in he midle of the austra mc carthyan sho s astonsian an a you ripped macgates for doing exactly the same thing earlier this year people to got to ilotside at alful al that or e to help me a d to show their support because they there are no that or coming after me to night i'm glad you brought that out because bac in tanuary when therre the marithon vots for cemicrthi to get this job yois fighting ti i gavell this is something that you sa backgates as a frod every time e voted against chaving tha carthy last week he sent out af fond rasing e now a what you saw last weeke was a constitutional process diminished by those kinds of political actions of course now here we are and october you an conerston gate sir arenint agreement on at least alfting bi carthing you gron a pod cast the other to day you yourself a inrasin atvot how do you how do you explain that to to now why have not been fon rising off of this every sep of the way i mad my decision last night i made the decision to fund ras over the last twenty for hours because of the threats that i have received over fond rasing and minin drying out which is why i need help he here is the deal republicans are whoever takes over i is goin a halve to have some tools at their disposal by the way a government shut down is still a possibility about forty days from now they have to figure this thing out really quictave to figureout new speaker if figur a wha the reproaches can be on this goverment than you do all of that forthwith brin ridal of former age who senter rob portment of ohio i's now th manhanans tue yo said itbecome substantially harder t to a government spending deal thekse the message has ben sent that republicans should not rely on democrats to pass any bills things can always get worse the no compromise fringe has been strongly in powerd an essentially has a veadol over house republican policy which cannot be squared with what democrats in the white house want if we ends up with a government shut down in the middle of bad economic news all bring some of that newsion just a

economy here is is on verieg thin footing mohommeda erein who i really trost as an analyst on the sort of tuff he says that the possibility of of avoiding a hard landing here is really really decreasing pretty significantly he has a piece over the financial times pointing this out he says the economy is likely weaken as markets internalize the significant likelihood that rate will stay higher for longer he says an intense period of rising interestrates high oil prices in a stronger dollar is pushing the financial market concenses an nuos economic growth away from the comforting notion of soff landing by my count is ilbe the sixth time in the past fifteen monds thay con ventional wis dom shifts for the world's most influential economy hat to pivit that unfortunalely is likely to stick for longer this time around threatening what has been an impressively strongosts economy undermining genuine e financial stability and exporting volatility to the rest of the world in just the last two weeks the yield on the bench market you as tenor bond has risen by some a zero point five prersentace points around four point eight per cents as part of a comprehends of shift in the entire intrestrat structure the move brought the changing yields th an i popping one per centage points since the end of june leading to higher borrowing rates for companies or burn some carlons for households more pronounc n on even toe posit outflows from the banking system as in vesters shift cash into money market accounts notably te cost of a thirtyor mortgage is up to eight per cent makin already exspentstive home purchases even less affortable pushing yields up and increasingly disorderly manner is a combination of markets recognizing that the higher polsu rate sed by the fad will be here for a while and the need to absorb a significant supply of treasury bonds do to large budgetary dephisit pluster's high oil prices these are developments that the economy and markets do not ine way they damp growth the increase the threat of stag flation and that continues to be serious threat there is a jobs report that a first glance looks really really nice a drob's report in september that showed three hundred and thirty six thousand chobs ated butt if the idea was that the economy is over heated and we spent too much money and that the economy is to be cooled then adding threin an thirty six thousand jobs that is a very high rate and doing that without really increasing the labor forse participation raght in any serious way which just means that now tasically the same percentage people are in the labor forse were in the labor fors before du continuing that sort of thing is not going to lead the federal reserve to lower intrestrates tor can increase intrestrates again according to ab sy news being a little optimistic ats possible the cooling of paygrowth may help reassure the fas in flation fighters wor scrutinizing every scrap of dated to determined whether to rase their curate again this year still the outsides job growth may stoke warries the economy willexspand two fast from flation to cool if they think if people think by the way that the rates are goingto go up on bonds for exemple what is that to it traps the bon yueld up the price on the bond that we have already released in the market is going to go down as those bond yields increase that means eventually peoping in a shift their money out of stokson into these very high yield bonds when they do that the stock market is going to stagnate already earnings are threatened again we are we are in a a really tenter hook situation on the economy what shall by an i think might be waiting for here franklies for republicans to shut town the government he is the shut down the government least can blame his failing a con mean somebody who is not him is just another reason why re publicans need to be smart and stractegic about this sort of stuff as supposed to grand standing and and creating a new speaker who has no power to actually cudgelis own members in a line because what is be real about this the idea tht youre cnapass a party line budget without any ability to cudgelanear own members into line thas can be a very difficult thing to do particularly inthe face of a democratic sentete and meanwhile hillery clinton in she just comes out of h would recovery offento to really reck american politics further i do not know why sheis still on on itevs but she is she has now called for the formal deprogramming of magamembers they are in a cult you see if your democrat and you cultishly and slavishly worship brokamama or hillery clinton or now in elderly dothard who has the inability to speak from his facehol then that is because you are normal but if your trump fan or even if not a trum fam by voted for him this means that you are a magamember who must be deprogrammed an we had very strong partizans and both parties in te past ah and we had very bitter battles over all kinds of things gon control and climate change an the economy and taces but there was not this little taleod extremeess an waving iu kno wagging the dog of the republican party as it is to day and sadly many of those extreme says maga extremes am take their marching orders from donald tromp who has no credability laughed by any mazure he is only in it for himself he is now defending himself an civil actions and criminal actions and when do they break with him u no becaus at some point maybe there neds to be a formal dep programming at the cult members but something needs to happen what dis that mean of formal deprogramming of the call members is as nown fishusticuetens ficistic to me me tongo fun adult camps iou mon stock about reeducation campslic what what would formal dep programming even look from hillery clinton in this thi should be frightening should be priticarly frighten and given the fact that according to newsweek the federal goernment believes the threat of violene in major civil disturbance is around the twenty twenty forty gost presidential election is great as quietly created a new category of extremests it seeks to track and counter donl trums army of maga followers the f b i apparently i's going to pursue and prevent what calls domestic terrorism without rect reference to political parties or affiliations but tithas majority of its currnt anti governmen investigations are of trum supporters according to classified det obtain by newsweek a current at the i official says the efbiz an almost impossible situation the ef theis intend on stopping dimestic terrorism and any reapit of january six butt ther focusing on former presed en trump and his mago supporters is what they are doing right now newsweek spoke to over a current a dozn currents or former government officials specializing in terrorsmen of hree month investigation to understand the current domestic scurity lands scape and to a value it of biding is doing about what calls at domestic at terrorism andta they have been looking at secret f pi and d a chstata tracking incid in's tvest investigations in cases it seems as though they are cracking down on magot members presumably at the behasto presen abidn who teeted at last suptember donal trumpand mag republicans are threats the very soul of this country that means that people who opposet or bidan nee de programming the f ba neans to target them all that should scare it the living hell out of you an is not just by the way that they are targaning the common down a trom voter there also targaning anybody 's just heterodox the bin administration meanwhile continues to target yulon musk how many agencies aur targang elon muskof this point we got the that the c c which has targan that the f t c which is targaning him that the analar be i believe is targaning him it is every agency of the federal governmen is now targanium this weard why is that happening i cannot imagine other than that he has heterodox's political opinions the c c said thursday it is seeking another court order they would compelle youon must to test fight is part of an investigation into his purchase of twitter now called acts the c c said in a filing in a san francisco federal court must failed to appear for testimony on suptemb or fifteenth despite an investigate if sepina served by the c c and having raiseona objections of the time it was served but two days before scedral testimony must abruptly notify the c c staff he would not appear the c c said has been conducting a fact finding investigation volving the period before musks take over last year when twiter was still publicly traded the agents he said it has not concluded that any one violated federal securities laws there just investigating yot for the fun of it and for the hell of it by the way it is it is why would you investigate elon musk for buying twitter and turning it into acts by pretty much every vailable count he has lost tens of billions ofdollars in that trans actions what exactly is the horrible thing that he did when he took the hit the answer of course is that put pressure on musken and hope to shut im up it is the basic idea tildry clinton of course spells that one out once again she says we need hes big platforms to do what hillery clitton wants them to do people from all walks of lihe are mounting a massive a resistance to atocracy a to the oppression of women and girls to irresponsible big tac companies whose platforms are absolutely rit with masogany and secisem and biral attacks on women in the public sper we are trying to tell a different story a a different narative for the future by not only standing up for democ human rhts and progress but highlighting a women who are doing it in their lies every single day suchs the big platforms that ar toblame obviously says hillery clinton we we all know which platforms she is talking about right there telon must tweated out a comprehensive overhaul the ancies as sorelhy needed along with ha commistion to take punitive action against those individuals whoe abuse thair regulatory power for personal and political gan cannot wait for this to happen he says the probability of it happenings a hundred percent whle we can only hope and pray that that is true because the threats against muscar have been pretty extraordinary i'l ca meanwhile it is time for some things i and some things that i hate must begin with a a quick thing that i for my colly candaso and candas recently spoke at a camps a naturaa champus this was and she is hit with the usual question which has some activis got up a a tran teld yub t cu plus tifide by sign actofast and why are you hurting my feelings and i'm hat's off to candas for this a excellent response ha what do you to think tranus on tes cantisact vitmyb yor a lite ta gat a how nat man a ayep that is that is right by the way i love the i'm too pregnant for this line a kandas an a again showing her status is a burthing person how dareshe bat tem that is what candas is at herbastic i other things that i obviously i was hon a very long plain ride over the course of the evening and i got a chance to watch i movy that i had not see when i came out in about two thousand tam but it is excellent it is called temple grand an good weeken watch if you happened to be able to get access to it and the entire movi is about a a woman who is known as sort of one of the the great advocates for people hor artistic shos diagnos with outis when she was very very young and the movi is essentially what it is to be artistic it is it is an excellent depiction of what autism is howhow autistic people see things in visual terms but camp really communicate with people in the same way thevery one else camp at have different abilities and it is it is it is really quite a beautiful movy it is definitely worth the watch as on h bo originally it has given stragt thern and i cloidane and it is it is it is really quickgood totaly wore to watch excellent performances all round temple gran an something unique to watch this weeken a time for a quick thing that i hate a se bas i got a say this is pretty astonishing s bs has different rules for whose face they blure when they ware showing criminals or alleged criminals being taken from say a a one particularstation to another se bs news in new york covered two different situations very differently there is a a suspect who stabbed to dath a left wing guynamed ryon carson in new york city and this this suspect his face was blurred by s bes news somebody on the twitters took that footage and jucs toposed it with the footage of daniel penny remember danial penny he was the s te marine who subdued a threatening man on the subway threnning man was black thandit op dying daniel penny there were perfectly finaly showing his face on the news this suspect however they were not going to show the face on those shers withthefootage look this is footige of the man police say they we are looking for yes not yet been i dentified but weere blurring his face at the moment wile charges or pending i we watched agan as all this went down more than a does an officers were round when it happened before entering a home here on loft o youd havty tout well that is weird that is wheret i i wonder why they would do such a thing probably for the same exactoreason that every time you read a crime story if to white person who commits crime against a person af minority status their raceis mentioned in every single story and if te black person who for example punch is a anasian person the races never mentioned because the mediote would rather obscurer for you the actual deta involved in the story than allow you the possibility of maybe thinking the wrong thing you mg you cannot think the wrong thing meanwhile people who do not want yu t think the wrong thing thy ould include rhyon carson's friends remember ryn carson was murdered and now people ave started go fun me for his death and they are using the money i can you not to this is friends to give themselves time off from work quote hi every one we are a collective of rhyon's close friends reeling from a brutal loss we are asking for your help on behalf of his partner in easing the burden and stress of this horrifing situation we can have space and time to grieve and remember riot immediate needs are to offset the cost of working class people taking time off of work to properly mourned they are paying themselves in other words not family members not as girl friend themselves which is im i suppose unique grift that is that is pretty astonishing sort of stuff right there ah again bad ideas have consequences allready git is the rest ofth cho continues right now you are not

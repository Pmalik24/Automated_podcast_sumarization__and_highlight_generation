hitheverybody ev you was ning et our podcastor the internete there are words in this episode that we have unbeeped if you prefer a beep diversion of the show you could find that out a wepside this american life at work hitheverybody i reglass here it is smark life rm to be beasy chicago just here for a minute to say we have a special show for you to day one of our producers on a joffey wall as been reporting a lot on education at schools and three years ago she did this stoy this about a part of education theverybody knows about but i think we do not talk about much at all not away the feels anything and this one of my favoratures we have ever done and full of surprise turns to twists on i do not wone waste any more time here setting this opson just gon a hand over the chotojona we can get to it here she is lessa and angela are both teachers both in the brancs and new yor city both relentlessly energetic women who make generous use of their arms while talking they met years ago they liked each other in two thousand five lisa and angela were part of a programme that brought their two schools together sort of a class room exchange kid's from lisas school would see angela school and vice virsa they thugt their students woeld get a lot out of meeting each other and learning about one another schools tbe cause their students spend their school days in two very different places tese a green bound school university heights high school is a public school it is ninety seven per cent black in his bannic it is located in the poorest congressional district in the country the south brancs angela vassas af school fieldston is also in the branc but it is one of new york cities in le private schools it is seventy per cenmt white it is known as a progressive school one in five kids gets financhlad which i's helpful because last year tuition was forty three thousand dollars these two schools worth three miles from each other ut the students basically needed a fareign exchange program to meet each othec the tucher started by having their students raight letters to each other they were pen pause for a while which was going well and thend lsa and angela pland a time to get them together lisa the public school teacher says the moment her kids got off the bussat fieldston the private school they had a dramatic reaction to what theysaw they could't bleave tha campis they felt everyone was looking at them and one of the students starte screaming crying this is on fair a thiss tiss i do not want to be here i'm leav im leading right now an going home we are melony it is o ka you should stay with the grup let us talk i kow some contects university heights the public school these kids were coming from it is small and friendly they are no meal detecters but it is a public school in a poor neighborhood the kids share of building and a gim with another school the private school fieldston has an eighteen acre kampas on a hill stone buildings are connected by landscaped paths every few windows is the size of a gorage door there is a danc studio in art gallery a pool on that first day the public school kids almost all of them portery kin and demanking kids from the south brance walk on to the campas look around at the quad the trees see the schools mission etched into the stone arches angela the private school teacher from fieldston came to greet them and immediately noticed that one of the girls seemed upset and i went over to talkdor as idlisa and that she jumped up and she said we'v got a get ot here we get to get at here w get o get at here and i thoght it was a choke at the beginning i did not realized and it really was i mean she went white completely white yout'll bloodjoy from her face and her friend was holding ers e collnal miliny called ellmility it was just unawful situation none of us hand had anticipated such a wrong reaction r there are hundreds of programms right now that are trying to do some version of this exchange program the help people connect across a growing divide for a lot of students american public schools are more segregated than they were a generation ago not less the gap between rich and poor is wider than is ben since the great depressions thesically whatever gap you hereabout income gap achievement gap we shall divide these two groups of kids from university hights and fieldston exist on opposite sdes and just seeing across that divide something many of us never do can be incredibly powerful in this case from the very first few minutes it was definitely dramatic this incident when the kids visited fieldston happened ten years ago and i heard this story from many different people the teachers kid's from both schools alison roland was a junior at the private school fieldston at the time she remembers the girl who freeked out peoplewere what happen that was ueird but nobody really it was very behind the scenes even more she remembers the feeling she had seeing the girl freek out feeling helpless it is uncomfortable you cannot help soe one not be uncomfortable ah you no one wants to fe thor on the hill school on the top of the hill on ther peop it is uncomfortable but at the same time i told yohat er shi where she was coming fromin terms of it is mest out it is crazy our educations have been drostically defren and that is completely on far but what you do in the moment when your sool high school student an you do not have the power i'll have a di could not be call apoliticstion in that moment and change i do not outal making change to take a long time a lot of feelsone tants do go on to ny coliticions an run well disn'e in the nor times and host evening news programms and design major american cities in part of the point of programms these that try a bridge the divide tis seeing as the private schol kids wil likely go on to be important imfluential people may be rit education policye wor finance new businesses it is good for them to know not everybody's life looks kheirs but of course then there is the question what di the public school kids get out of it wrait now there is a popular idea an education it pops up all over the place about exposure that exposure is partu curely important for poor kids not just important that it can change destinyes you take a group of kids to tor a college campus they will be more likely to go to college or if you just know some one who went to college that will help the idea is if you want a kid to move from one social class to another that kid has to see what it looks over there on the other side exposure is a tool for social change and economic mobility or it just sucks you see how much you did not get an its shocking or painful and you freek ot that one girl melany the people who run programs these hope that even if it is up setting in the moment ultimately this kind of experience helps more than it hurts but nobody really knows because this is the kind of thing that plays out over time it occurred to me that the group of kids who were part of that first year exchange between fieldston and university heights could answer this question does it hurt or help the public school kids it is been ten years they are in their mid twentyes now they have gone to college got an apartments and jabs in it turns out this one experience really has shaped some of the publicscol kiss in profound ways las i did not se coming to days show what happens when you see the other side and at lifs a lot better wat's bekin with melony the girl who freekd da i wondered about melanye because she had such a strong immediate reaction that everyone remembered but also because listened to what happened after that apparently melny start a crying the moment she got to fieldston wanted to leave but the teachers managed to calm her down and for while it seemed the moment had passed and they were fine the partnered all the students up the university heights kids could go with the fieldsand kids to some other classes marlena etlesteane a fieldstonce to told me the girl who shadowed her she does not remember her name but other people told me it was melony marleena has never forgotten her i remember we were studying an lit the enlikement ah i w were ti were looking at it through paintings and i remember her making connections between the painting and enlightment eire philosopher is and cloting con lock and just schooling all of us ou do not making connections i would have been completely in capable hoas aking and is cleary the smartest person the room then after waling everyone in this class with her intellect melony left raan away she found the experience of being at fieldston upsetting she ultimately could not stand to be there and lesta green baun her teacher told me melany did not just run away from fieldston that day she also seemed to run away from high school she does not remember seeing her much after that i would love to know i wuld love to know how she feels about who she is and if that moment in her life in any way shape the way she thinks to day lesa told me she had no idea were melony was but she said you known you shoud call ashley wallace tha was mlony's best friend she

it that ba r did she want to colege well awy know but ashly says she musthave how else do someone disappear that unless they make it out of the bronx and never looked batk othere is a new york city number listed under melany's name but of course at ha at a time where i any inconvenient o make had there is a woman with the same name who manages a real estate firm an corpus christy there is a gentle lab tachnicion in harrisburg an executive office professional and loss vagus a woman on twitter who i think lives in mexico and has devoted her account to retreating just in bebers twit her account they all seemed to be about the rate age all not her a background check on melany's name was a current and former address i went to the current one she does metlive there sent letters to boat no lon ashly her friend from high school gave me a couple names of people she thought might have kept up with melany and top of the list was pablo murial their high school history teacher he is porter regan melany from the neighbourhood ashley says we all loved pablo but especially melany e o i it is conna jofywal the reporter all tat har how are you ye cole te poe cabo people coln co me ot atout

t cin clat ha pobaly alrey bo holdo a poki f i an she i ke what aves she a and a never soa i began contacting former classmates and i became sort of upsess bshecause it was weird how invisible she was every one else was supereasy to find these far twenty five yearalds and we have the inner net and the classmades memories of melny were all similarly mithic she spoke her mind she was brilliant she was fierce she was going to make it and no one had heard from her werdly the one person i contacted who had a real idea of what happ in a mlany was the teacher from fieldston the private school angela vasas some one told me angela had taken a special interest in melany after she got upset at fieldston and a decky leader when i met angela and first asked about melany she started crying no angla got a box of tissues then sat down i had a real s spotic i still hat a sus tot soi that kit she was smart yukno really smart i do not know she realized she knew she was powerful but i know she knew she was smart after that first encounter a fieldston angela tried hard to gain melony's trest i think she felt partly responsible and she really e wanted to help melany even though she was not melany's teacher the programe kept going throughout the year angela would bring her private school students over to the public school and sometimes she would visit on her own and every time she would make a special point to check in on melany the last time angela ever saw melany was in the public school angela was over theire visiting and lilian the college adviser comes in she walked in and melany was really on a tear about ta white bitch is and athey do not know anything about the world an lilian walks in and e she waves a pece paper and she says melany come here melany goes up they fifty people inthe room she says a middlebury accepted youful scholarship and melany's started crying i strik hi wou alded we was excited you known lilian she said we made it we made it we made it you to incredible news and middlebury we are talking about a serious serious school chool scholarship and melany buried her face seedon lilya's shoulder her and they huggd for such a long time that you do not wan these hugs it must have been a two minute hug and lilia was swiin her round and melany had herarms round her and i thought that is great and you knew at that moment it was moving because you knew at that moment melany felt safe and that is when melany to speart because she did not finish the less month of the year she disappear to this tay that do not know where she is ah she probably just got scared ye wshe got into middlebury but she did not go she did not finish the less the month of school either she left you literally disappeared no one could find her i called middlebury to see if maybe melany did attend they said no did she get in they said we have no record showing that she received an offer of admission i did not know if that meant she was not admitted where they just had no record either way but that is all they would sect and this was strange because angela had such a vivid memory if melany getting in and angla herself went to mddlebury she probably did not mix up the name of the college bluss the college adviser at melany's school seemed to remember it at this point i went back to melany's high school friend ashly and just asked if it sounded mlany to sike herself out that and she said no way i only made it to my g d but melany was singularly focus on college she would cursed me out when i cut class when it came co dow from me her i you now what hare not ci a boy melany was not going to fail at high school she would go to college with no babies and live far far from new york city period you can saything when it my refiklin picked up or we port a nointy neighbour go ahead death record all right i can help you learn how to requect o partipicate for i gat reported i i did not think melany was dead but a friend asked and once that ceived was planted i could not get the idea out of my head the same day i went in person to the city's office for vital recorge i also went to an old address lesston on a bacground check one i'd sent letters to hishe wass here the buzzer did not have melany's name on it and i press it anyway no answer stood by the door to the going y sevin melany ota his girl friend she is at work sescoye sheand she did it me eme she told me she call when she got ouf work she did not want to tell me anything more but he did tell me malany worked at a super market on six avenu it happens to be around the corner from my office it took three days for melany to call me and when she did she carefully said i've given this a lot of thought and i'm ready to talk i cannot for weave yor here i en believe i'm here ye a i erec ell i mean i di looked on the wipside a means you do not probably something that people organin here people are gon to listen too if they could see we they know im difference i'm differm sitting here with a blue green here she is us a wearing pink swet pants and a hody her hair is actually under a hat all i can see our some green banks picking out the they she is talking about that is you listening right now nlany has considered you a lot who you are how you will hear her i asked melady about the visit to fields tan pretty early on in our conversation but her answer began with her first day of high school she says she was just one of those kids who always loved school she got good grades and she would been anticipating high school years before she got there she had a clear image in her mind of how exciting it would be she would become a better riter read read and read and go to games maybe joine the dance team and er first day a freshman yer well i remember going in and i was just what is this alike this is got to be a joke wait the school felt a jok ye completely i was sitting in the class from with seniors when i was a freshman they did not even have a maf be course with mathbe and em it the second level to maff a u i would say prive till i taking tuld an omatery your even sis sis six o something that they do not offer any ei p classes another thing that was really tormenting to me was that we did not have library and i love books this is wal we have really in a poor part of the bronxs were we are not bein considered then in tenth greed nowlanye'se english teacher said they were going to start a pen pow programm with a school called fieldston nowwany was open to it she wrote a sincere letter describing herself and her dreames and climbed on to the bust with the rest of her classmades to go to fieldston what happened when you went there wem when we went there we would look a bunch of hooligans i was they wed looked the goonies walking in ou do not walshy building i felt you knew we weret from ther lak who are these gettle kids woking an you knowwy just we knew we didn'fidend we did not looke the resses studen it was a very organ i school wait what is you look what you me me you well when i went there i had bright red hair cherry read tardy bol tomoor which was a female raufer at the time i had my nails supenoke it her really colifool whenty colors on them all of us wor jordens everybody thod old tordens is the big thame you could tell that you knew off the back these suens are not from the school what is you feel that day i fell a ratchud as girl from the hod they hafoll i do not belong the just foll i have no business in this building idam bemamodem they would just a see of white blond blue green eyes i couldnim possibly bring myself it' my body to actually engage with these kis i did not one engage with them for many university heights kids i talkd to seeing fieldston was shocking because of the stark difference it was a surprise they could not have imagined a place fieldston for malany it was not that malany had imagined it this was what i invigion as high school what these kids are experience this is what i wanted to see myself going to as high school experience ell that is what you expected a yel to be definitely you did not what feut surprising to you just this is the first time that i'm seeing the thing tin real life that i thought was what was gon a walk inton inthcade yep an alisios octe this urprivate this is everything kind of is a flucking lie that you see your whole life growing up on teevy shols or movis is ocate this is not free this is not available for kids of color this is something that only privilege or the ale ca have i know i looked at it and i said while i know that were only being told to flip burgus and burking or macdonals or to whol doors for schoolness thom that will probably live in those buildings on madison havenue and will be wearing the uniform servicing people you thought that when you were at fields definitely well that is why ell is when the shit hits the van you imagined lyoer ye yet seeing what we would all be as a delt that what she found upsetting it seemed that thet people around her must believe that this was the natural order of things malany knew there was no inne difference between her an a kid born in to well she could see that this division were all inorn too was not a reflection of her in fear worth or ability she just id kno what to do with the idea that she maght be alone in seen at o er seseeseseese ererseresersresesees ee es ereses eres sreserssese but malany had her own plans aftcer field stence as soon as she could get out of high school and her plan did not involved hoping doors she had enough credits to graduate high school early as a junior i jus whyn i heavy up and get my high school apoman to say here i'm educated i got it an when i get in school for year school i already sold myself woul amessis agree which means sixteen to twenty for eight years yep check melany's vision was clear and the esults around her could see it too pobla muriel the teacher and all the teachers at her school knew ther job was to fill in the gaps make up for the fact that malany did not get to be a fieldston kid and get her to college any ray a few months before graduation the high school guidan'e counsellor nominy did alany for something called a possy scholarship the possy foundation sens kids from tencities to private a we colleges full scholarship schools cornel dark meth and middlebury malany had her iye sat on middlebury just angelavassos remembered and the thing that could get her there was the passy scholarship it is really competitive this a hundreds of kids all over new york city an this one floor of building that you go to you remember what you were i thing the first day i wore high heels an a skir maybe i wo tie whul is whitser adressipshur all iways went very professional when i went there whatd is considered ulfis o po posse send groups of kids to college together a possy and their trying to choose kids who would otherwise be missed because their tasscores are not great or because they go to bad schools after the first round half the students get called back the next round half the remaining students than that group gets cut again trying o figure out how to get into college distressful for every one that for most people it does not look reality te vie i kept getting you do not put to the next stage and each time you go back they just send you a letter in the mail letting l kay you made it throug the net rown we expect you here at this this day this time the final time is when you meet the college middlebury you remember what they asked you in the interview no i do not we nervous ah i was nevous very nervise this yer i sat in on the possy finalist interviews and i can tell you that by this point in the process the only kids left in the room could do your jab with a week of training we ere sitting in this room with twenty five amazing kids tifteen of them were about to get voted off the island they get a letter mlany did saying now votnan get pig i believe i still have that tetter hiding somewhere melany did not get in she made it to the very last round but in the end she did not get it i do not know why ante avasos remembers melany getting into middlebury except that what she and the school college counser must be remembering is the moment melany was selected as a finalist cause that would have been an exciting moment and it would make sense that they did not know the very last dep that in the end melany did not make it because they never saw her again they could not have known seeing fields ton was not what made melany wone to run away it was this you gold o something sug jis get turnd down is a waste to sike would you have been better of not going to this experience is that a you feel i mean maybe i would have been better off not going to tha experience once that happen i jis voted off at o my life because it is to painful thin cas is just a moment of disappointment ye my consy this sike a really beautiful thing if you do get it i least tas the way looked but what you put tod toi true they get there is hard to then be turned out it say why did not i get it was what was rol would meet melany could see in a week college was a long shot especially for a kid from a poor public school but she was going to make it because she was exceptional her teacher saw it she knew it that was the ground she stood on until this moment maybe you werd jus somebody exceptionill be close of the environment you were it not necessarily be close you are exceptiona boubly co yo smor you knowly going to be tis e gin to be thody lik going to be somebody going t change a world even a and is say be vialistic probably wanted me to rapply for harvard always lak be focking realistic i'm never going to get accepted to harvard this is a school ded dos and even half looking sus sistics olfid thi i ei pe classes or you knowverses a kid thik feelstin you wolk out an for eas you are prepared to go to school a this is not happening for me i do not think anything is going to changed at after that i duffly new that i wanted to run at a high school as fast as possible i thit graduating springs to mus of that year i was gone sol really gone wye have really got gone off the map gon ye o tis ha weher i i a i i was walking with malany one day recent when when she played a voice mal for me she got from leat a green bown her old high school toch er i hadn' given lesa melany's number had not even told her yet about being untouch it turned out just a few days before melany had called the front desc of the high school to get a copy of her depoma and people from the school started getting back in touch ia er a her ca melny is shaking her head listening a r er a are you going to call ar bat a pably buthan be we itinti no poblycal itis one o gabo mo business to wohat i got o te fo myself another words yet absolutely not melany never called policsa surprise that in obleve abat pass i conly he just calling because i happened to coll te school is not anybodybody beeching out to me this of course makes no sense somebody calling your mobile device and saying i would love to hear whats going on with you that is the definition of some one reaching out but this is where melany is right now for the last e get of her life she is been working at the supermarket taking local college courses part time stopping every few somasters when she needs money or sleep and thinking about where she went wrong she did not apply to any other private colleges after middlebury turned her down she did not reach out to leesa or poblo or ashley or angela she graduated early and checked out of high school and she is furious at herself for doing that i accepted it vasicly and i guess i just grew very angry with myself on making that tuace e same whilm getticceptis instead of fighting a guest i or maybe bringing change into that situation but i did it i accepted it i thus always in the back of my head i know i i know i folk that out because i could have pobety got in something out of that extre you of school what would you have gone i do not know what is woald if i would ave reached out what if what if they would have set me to cuny for free coltage coises thet could have been another opportunity i just did i got flustrated to ha point that i did not want to look for that which whenity was to sycai want to shitl rundol with cause i feol it was not going to change now a high school teacher who remembers malny as having much promise it is calling and wantin to catch up of course melany does not want a return that call for you to have people tell you youre exceptional or for me to say people remember you as being very smart as jus sort of it is sult on a wound or something it just i i i do not ya how howa how do i measure that intelligence is very hard to do with had you gone to middlebury do you think you would believe that you ere mar com youn when just she felt when she visited fields in that first time mlany consent a better altern at reality sitting right there next to her to day an alternate reality where she went to college and her life is totally different o on a jof one coming out we meet that alternte reality melany she went to college that is in a minute from chicaga bubligradeal when a program continues to smake life from or glass to days programm three miles honajoffy wads looking at a group of students who shared one small experience the shudents from a public school in the bronx who took field trips three miles up the road to visit one of new york's fanciest private schools in the first half of her programe we heard from melany he thinks that if she had gone to college it would ae made all the difference in her life in this half of the shell wio can onlge weather r not that is true a lot a kith from her public high school university hights high school leave the life that she did not they did go to college two third to the last year again her conagoffey wall i've been talking to lots of university heites graduat and i've haw this experience a coupletimes were i feel i'm speaking to melanys alternate reality the year after melany graduated a handsome young black university highe senior named jonathan gans ollase one the possy schollarship this is a kid who grew up in malady's neighbourhood wen to her school was one of only a dozen or kids picked to be part of the programme with field stan and he one the possy schollarship melany desperately wanted if any one is alternate reality melany it is jonathan but this is not a roll jonathan conveniently slotson to i did not really for myself i angreally see college from myself i saw just not being a home i this sgy at fifteen years old malany could see a future with college and graduate school not only that every one around her could see it to this is not what people saw for jonathan this is not what jonathan saw for jonathan i thou i did not have a drive to go to college why not iit was never what i thought of myself in a future was being a genitor as always waking up saturday mornings mop in the house cleaning silling ands i sweeping the floor whysn't this is what would have that was what i was experienced in collegs i knowhati would do thir and i had blessing to have a good friend that was into the books racaow hardy i wish you could see jonathan's face when he talks about recal i know that is te cornything to say i promise if yu could see it you would forget to be cool jonathan says he is left ry cow basically as long as he can remember pretty long time i've known as since i was twelve my junia high school teach her actually said that we would be married i guess she saw it from the way we looked that heac other i spend time with each other in the classroom and we always plated down ike no o but that summer rit before hagh school ra collan jonathan got together and it stopped feeling a joke that they might just stay together jonathan and mac cowboth foun being at home stressfall jonathan was given up to foster care as a baby his foster moma dopted him he says she left him but she could be very cruel i was very i held a lot of things in and the way i got them out was by sometimes punching a wall or puncing other people wgain into fightsor acting out in the classroom if for rackell she was into school her i think her outlet was doing work being in the books she did not have to think about it and my outlet ways thinking about it being sad about it and not speaking anybodience is being quiet caled having no ou and i havent kno out outwu yes that was i o coping mechanism wewere best friends and i nows great this of course is reccou rachel is beautiful driven and just quick she is the friend you want sitting shok on when your last driving raceln jonathan were both selected for the field in programme and for rachel seeing field son was a revelation she remember specific details be trees in te quad that the library was a free standing building she remembers walking up to it and a we get in and ther were kids hang el on the floor and wuth their book bak ta kids leving their book bags and attended and lthis is ut heard of i be amsi in th blonk you do not leave your book bag on the floor and walk away you now to mee with a a mack laptop inside you kned i mean that is does not happen and you do not get to sit on the floor at the school and a laid back kind of relacx way racell says she had the following thoughts all within the first few minutes these kids are free this is what freedom looks we must not deserve to be free and finally i am really lucky to be seein this i mean it is one thing hearing it from pablo but id's another thing seeing those things you do not know how little you have because you do not have anything to compare it to i think it motivat to fom me that is what the connection with the fields in school did for me it motivated me as for me i din a fo i gawashi anyway and o wo neve besid just whet this is whet the rich people ar rachell says every one fell bad seeing field ton but jonathan more because he would been taught to fiel that way at home we had a lot arguments about his mam but he knows now he saw himself through her eyes in a lot of ways she made him feel very low at times i tried to loved him and show him the supporit she says she just told him over and over how special he was yoe hav because he was ou know he was and he is he is remarkable man and he he is very tolletid he deserved what this world had off for him you known he had to take it that was how jonathan went from imagining himself as a janitor to applying for college not because he saw fields ten because ra calsaw fields ton rachel wanted to go to a college where she could sit on the rug and debate with friends lapp top on the floor

really help uss we just sort of needed to figurete out together we kind of toublis suited some problem ie the book situation were you that one i told him that he should go the library me to that is what i was doing it had not occurr to either of them that the beautiful free standing mybray on campas was there to serve them and not a lot of the books they needed for free but when my calpanact she went to the student sumner and learned about the library and the inter library lone system she told jonathan two hundred miles away who still had not asked a soul and jonathan was the one who was in posse posse's scholars hava ninety per cent college graduation rade the programm is full of supports for kids just him he had months of training from posse before he even went to college he had a special campas mentor posse was calling him and sending him letters he was ignoring at all a few months into his first o master jonathan was barely getting outside of his room or his head i mean to go

pauson always vonerable with was buckin and sometimes i wa us lie he had the home of to day er yet we tata ling to her because it was to mush pressor but and idont on't it is do not one helpful ni because i was not in close procimity to him and i could not help an i could not save him and i was not trying to save him but it was you kno i tried everything to sort of keep him afloat even though i was barely was my head above the water i'm as well but we were floating and together but he seemed at times he were he would drown and i was trying to help him but i got to be it was not enough after si nothe time he was tied of me pushing him he stad of just he know nat eknow just kind of let go of yeu yet ye in the middle of her junor year rock hellecko of jonathan they broke up by this point jonathan was far behind the school was warning him he would be expelled he would already been suspended twice he did not re spond to the letters did not tell any one what was happening jonthan appeared to be unable to see how about it was himself he went back to school after christmas break that year the way i found out that i feeld that of wen was bi going back to the school am i who ma i open doing was lagiman isi log somebody else's comin in and arigt then o li who se and the deems likean esileave immediately he cannot be on is cip esileven meded a likea has a gool to mamamisin tisinc lik ye were right on tmushe jonathan came back to the brox got a job at the front desk of a gim and move back in at his mondracell finished her sener year without john as in she unfriended him on face buk but other friends she had on fase but seemed to be struggling with the same things he had all the time racolould se the same news onself lunk at at at schoolr this kid party too much and get cicked out her high school friends were failing at college one by one jonathan was not the anomaly she was by the time she graduated racell was the only person she knew us med it raell is now more than twice as likely as jonathan to make it into the meddle class statistically more likely to be employed to be healthy to enjoy her daily work to have a happy marriage but most poor kids who make it to college do not make it to graduation in fact the number is shockingly loll less than one fifth finish in six years there are swarms of researchers trying to figure out what to do about this right now education is the best way to cross class barriers and in many cases education seems to be the barrier pablo muriel the high school teacher who all these kids remember and loved he knows this very well just listened to what happened when i asked pablo if he remembered racal hehad bat o it e oher she went to abard wa college she as she did shis days er now she shesoi graduet she graduated in shhis teaching oh if a i a ater or a i geto fo fot of o a feu o fat at a fo pablow is porterikan he grew up in the brox in the projects when he told kids they could make it to college it was credible because he did it he graduated college he went to graduate school travelled the world pablo says it is important for kids to see some one them sucseed but he also feels deeply embivolent about playing this roll he still tells kids to go to college because what else is he supposed to do an no a for somthing of each foor o i he ot o se is i it and is no way out uta fortuneof yon probaly reonser wit wa we ci a graty at cet e catch wit many of em o ono had fo ha ac be e direct o hard i ha om oned o yesterda o at n we ar hav shu er for foshit he cold ma year lad a fact hid would av soof me i con

college columbia these are fieldstons and e imagins that what happen the lots of his former students is probably the same thing that happen to them at fieldston there are dropped into a foreign land and ask to mentally imagine themselves as belonging that is hard to do in fact the entire project of racell's life has been trying to convince herself she does belong in this regard she is a mental gladiator because this project did not end when she got into the prostigious college it did not end when she graduated from that college or when after college she landed an excellent job interview at a lawfirm to be a parallegal even though i got my foot in the door by having a good vesa make and maybe giving a good fo and to you when i get in there i'm this i do not deserve this thi's not the pagwy salary was above what i deserved in this is more money than either of my parents have ever made probably and those things ggod through my mind when i'm walking into a place a place that 'm trying to apply fon work an and and how could you comten somebody that you deserve it when you do not even believe it yourself ins is it is a reoccurring thee in my life i have to tell myself that i deserve this cause i i worked really hard for it she has to ignore the fancy library that she did not get to enjoy in high schol the bad greed stre ot in college the fact that she cannot afford books the fact that she is the only black kittin class the fact that her peers and college already knew how to use a semical an correctly the face book stream of high school friends dropping out of college one at a time and the boy friend who deeply more deeply than her believes the message confirmed a gain and again by all these things that he is unworthy racall has did not look at the mountain of evidence that what she is working toward will not be cossible and instead hows to repeat to herself you do deserve this you deserve this you do deserve this and that is what i did while is it fields did and that is what i did when i was at bard an that is what i do my job into views now that is what i do at work racal keeps waiting for the sense of entitlement to setin the bravado she sees in her peers from barge she can fake it but she has not got into the point where she truly feels it i mention this to poblo an a probably do you i don eou or work o om i or ol ppicicution or o a wu abe icicutioner a do ioofi you e do ably this scrup of kids got their first peek over the fence a decatin go now and malany ta girl who found it upsettin as a fifteen earold that she ran away she is twenty five now she is this same person she was at fifteen tbut there are no longer people around to tll her you are exceptional your going to make something of yourself wut there is are customers and an upscale supermark it with red banners out front announcing luxury apartments upstairs when you described being at fields ton and seeing these cads are going to be doctors and lawyers and wore gin to be the people opening doors for them in serving them do you feel that you now absolutely oogipis that is why am a sol ashamed of lega but rety told people what i dofote i feld we wu there to service people that and that is what i service i service people that defily express tha the but o the lusk that youre not on the level giha tell yong people a work cause i ha is it is a sople market e thus i really want to shake that olfor my thus ben most li yeas of my life an just afte malan i i just really whil there is this one thing i keep reeplaying in my head after talking all these people it is this story angela vasas told me about melany gettng into middlebury dyou remember that the teacher from fields sin the private school remember how vivid angela's memory was and she says melany come here melany goes op they fifty people in the room she says a middlebury accepted you fill scholarship melany did not get into middlebury she does not remember this moment at all but angela does clearly even to day she acknowledges it must not have been what really happen but she remembers it ife a theory about this i think angela has this memory of melany making it triumphantly making it because it is really hard to believe that melany would not make eit and i can completely understand that i met melany in november and i still call her most weeks just to say what happen with your dentist with your grads with that meeting with your professor i keep expecting there to be news she is about to get her big breaker something and things will happened for her i feels suspensiful but nothing has happened for her for ten years i think its some special brand of american pathelogical optimism that many of us believe thi story of melany has to turn out to be happy and tet if it does not something unusual has happened and not just this is what happens all the time that the super market might be full of melanies monachufy walld is one oftheproducens of our programm s not been three

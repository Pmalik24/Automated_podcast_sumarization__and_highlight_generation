used to anything you knont hy mean every few days more americans die from covid than nine an nine eleven wild firers are raging and continue to just rage the president will not disabow wites supremises and a tellvis debate on used all that insense daily life whitheris this example of you can get use to anything jay was having a normal stressful day for twenty twenty meaning he does his job from his apartment on a computer at his kitchen table and zume but he is also gow to deal with his children during the workday cobl weeks ago he is a college professor and his proparing a lecture for classin is anxious about that he wants to be good and then at three ofclock he as to go run get his kids and bring them home and he and his kids get back to the building at three twenty and hes trying to move quickly because his class starts at three thirty and he and his two kids get on the elevator to head up to ther apartment and then all sudden i feel the allite hort to drop it is a half seck and feeling when you are now a roller coster and and thankfully it stops hiwn bardy a is drop i do not know jos ally a couple stories you dropped a few stories ye and i look and it' stuck at the third floor the bishabodin to call for help and there told somebody is gong to be there to fix things but i's con tick led a while and they wait and my kids are sturding to bick her with one another and my daughter starts getting upset she is eight years old and part of what is happening jay says is that her big brother who his ten years old his actually been stuck in an elevator once before when he was a little he is being o what is the big deal a he was not rattle an all in facts she starks to get up that he starts to tell her that she is over reacting and that makes her more upset and i to calm her down and and tell him to stop teasing her and and then we took a couple salles and we i tried to make it a tunthing rogan a remember and look back on and laugh on and that kind of changed the mood in the elevator a little but least breetsli kid's momentarily oke ja gets back to the other urgent matter that is on his mind his class sovor three hundred students this big intera psychology class which still has not started there is still just enough time from to quickly tap out a message on his fone deer class i am carently trapped in an elevator in my apartment goting i joing the zume call and star teaching once i'm safely out of here which send message goes out and then nothing it th just they put and ja stretchd a way bout his students yofre waiting for him on the zume call ten minutes pass twenty and half an hour and et desides he is going to try to teach the class on his fon from the elevator which takes a little technical rangling e yesto downward zume to his fone with birly one barrow service bobaba get his part his boying but after a whil i can no vidio voi on way he is in and i joine the zume class and i'm trying to talk to them and i can hear their voices and the studentstrall chit chatting with themselves and i can hear them come speculating about what might be happening me and they are laughing and i'm tring to get their attention and they'e all talking and they could not hear me and i shouting at this point it is me it is j i'm here hi gui in the elevator what is happening is you are a grown man shouting into his fone is that i yet and eventual i can hear somethins he wach i think i hear our professor think he is back heis a moment of panic what i hem to say and then he langes en but know now it is none of his slides he gives the lecture that he plan ahand i cannot see them and they cant see me ah but ah it was working it was i was all kind of coming back to me and i was able to deliver it and and i had their attention searchs to seem normal yot starts to see normal yeieventually i'd adapted my kids are being quiet they are listening can i ask you to yo remember how long it took how many minutes did it take before this started see normal ah i' samp le for five minutes four or five minutes we are very adaptable creatures soon enough the elevated jolts and startsmoth again je gets back to his apartment sits down at the kitchen table logs on dezume and teaches a couple hundrickites from his kitchen which of course is also totally weired but after months of doing that it feels totaly normal it did you consider t not doing the class did you consider cancellin it is funny because athat night i when i told my partner about this she is wanting he just cancel shes a professor but it is one of those things where it did not cross my mind when i was in the situation my mind early in that day had been focust on being able to naligate this complex situation hit was ging to be stressful ou not getting my kids and getting home and then getting the lecture ready which i'd been prapping all day and that had determined each little step i made and i never really stopps to think that i justnt do it that is alfus right now or lives is here or strange and whe just do next task and the next one after that and the next on after that and we do not think about how weird things have gotten each little step nap surly led to the next step and then it was not until i left the situation hours later i was looking at it in realizing obser it was if nw bsy chicago it is this american live on our glass to day on our programme people trapped in small spaces stuck in ae situation and copin cause they have no choice ja i think it is pretty coy was not too bothered by a short time in the elevator but in our other stories to day it is people who are stock in a small space for way longer an the first half af a progen wey of a story were things get pretty dires and the second haf it is not nearly difficult it is musicians hore confined to wait tiny space for years and a comfortably tiny space and can i say think they pouty weird there too stay with us i wine the people up the stairs start today with a couple who have been penned into a small space for months now hiding in an attic caus her lives are on the line itsurrounded by musty furniture and stacks of old paintings at a colecting dust canven seeif talk to them about the truly jaw dropping story hw they got there the atic has creeky wood floors in one small window but they try not to go close to it they do not want to be seen the seilings are low moy sass

the president's face on it and an ex over the mouth demanding freedom of expression moysess saw the woman with the big brown eyes often last person to backdown when the police shoeda that one protest when two hundred police closed in on a group of maby twenty protesters mosess looked for a place to run but then he saw jessica and another woman walk right up to the armed officers and start yelling

while the other organized a rally or held a press conference at home near the little girl's pile of toys they kept masks for teer gas but the governments response got harsher the regine began kidnapping its opponents moysess was grabed by four or five men an unmarked cars and taken to ell she pode an infamous prison documented by human right's groups as being a state run torture sight a

broken up by police officers picture in the stomach and hit her with the butt of a gun she was pregnant she lost the baby late last year they realized they could not stay any more they needed to escape and their plan was to go to the neuess nd they had a good reason to think they would be welcome there jessacan moysass's brand of activism iy was champion by republicans including the trump administration for its defiance of a left wing autocrat they were called freedom fighters we stannd with you republican senator said an statements and tweets an two thousand eighteen tead cruws gave a whole speech about youa support for nikaraguen activess them to the people of nekadav the american people stand with en your fight for freedom for the rule of lawto the half million protest the res our laves i say thank you thand you for your courag and remember truth has pow that' support it is part of what made their asylum case seemed winnable because it fell under the category of political persecution it was one sliver of the asylum system left intact after years of dismantling in all sorts of ways getting asylumum us has become almost impossible asylum seekers were being turned away at the border told nop were closed cases are incredibly hard to win even when they do get to the courts but the trumpadministration did leave at least one window cract one of the few categories of asylum seekers that it proported to accept people who were threatened tortured jailed for their politics especially when their politics overlapped with us interest people moisess an jessica moisess and jessica where a perfect asylum case for another reason their persecution was documented and it was public as ackedotis they had become famous their protess had ben telivise they would held nationally broadcast press conferences people recognized them in the streets all the time even the state department had tweeted about specific confrontations they had had with the paramilitary at any other time and recent uss history they would likely have been admitted but instead theire in hidin i wanted to understand why i've been covering emigration for the last few years and this timy felt the last chapter and the disintegration of asylum i called moisess an jessica and the attic to hear about their journey from start to finish to learn what happent in late twenty nineteen they started to get ready moisess studied the us government websight for the asylum requirements he read about the importance of supporting their case with evidence he bought a black back back and he filled it with all the evidence he could gather vidios of their protess and press conferencees reports from the human rights commission and the state department statements from the white house and the republican senators moisess also rode afive page declaration a long essay enumerating every threat every beating he would received from the government he included the names of his torturers he read on line that the details could help his family's asylum case he was ae specific as possible the backpack took on a kind of sacred role for them it was there proof that they were deserving of the sliver of asylum that remained available in the uss then moysess and jessica toctic amila their eight earl daughter cemela's outgoing love's legos and tak toci ios they sat her down and moisess described all the dangers thy would fase on their journey across the border cemela told them she was ready to go at three ofclock one morning they left their house outside of managua and headed two thousand miles north by early juline they were moving through the desert of northern mexico it was scorching in covid cases were spiking moisess had gamed everything out he rapped some of his asylum evidence in plastic

they said soon will be in disney world you will eat a mac donald hambriger camela played along at first but by the time they got to the border she was exhausted and scared jessca scouted out the reo grande neither she nor cammulok at swim she nervously looked for the shalowest part it thosis the at ya yam and as we were walking into the river it was as if fate had intervened but po a te detin i as every time we took a step in the water there was always a rock that t we could see that is it was as if god had placed stones there that we could walk and nothing would happen to us the water never

she looked to moisas to see if he was also feeling hopeful tut moisas was more sceptical and jessica noticed the you asa turned out had used corone of iris as an excuse to shutter what was left of the uas asylumsisin march the centres for disease control rode an order saying that asylum seekers could be expelled because they ipose a risk to public health during the pendamic het later turned out that the order was conceived of by emigration ficials of the white house not medical exord and even though moisas jassigan cimula attested negative for corone of iris while in custody they could be deported but they did not know that they were kaptaan information black hole for a few days and then put in avan no one would tell them whre they were going at at what point do you realize that that

essemigration agents put it with the checked luggage it was somewhere in the belly of the plan moysa could not even hold it could not look at what was inside and come up with the plan if the police find it they will see that he listed the names of specific torturers and what they did to him maybe they would decide to kill him just for that maybe they rape his daughter he thinks his mind e

when they want to they go after you wesassin jessica had to figure out what to do next after a few days they notice that the police were circling the house the police called at random and asked about camila staying at a known address was too dangerous they did not think the police would hurt camila but what if they came from moisass or jessica wol camila was there she could be swept up in the violence some wysssin jessica we located to the attic of a safe house and left camula they told her will see soon but truthfully they had no idea win tit was brutal to say good by but what was the all turned if they thought if camila was attacked on their behalf that would be much worse jessica cried when she said good by that was about two months ago she is cried most days since they trucae i

is happening ihad first heard about the pit at fanam through a friend whose wife had recently supped in the violin section she described which she had seen as a horror show waiting for guffman but thirty hard years down the line i could not quite get it out of my head one of the first things people ask how can you possibly stay saying and play the same music every night pe e wright has been playing fanams since opening niht he is a french horn player who times the notes on hi stop watch every night no there is something in that war you i would look of the music sometimes and i it woul just ook literally look shapes i would just see shircles and blines and dots i would have no idea i woun't even know what page ot as o thit is tey get the s associate of failing almost i o hearing yourselves speak and you do not and you are not sure it is english i that is i do not think that ever happened toand then that is the funny things you see somebone else do an you immediately know what is going on with him but what is their face oh they are just legla they just it is as if they do not even know where they are hey're waking up in another room but's what happened where am i what day is it what week is when i start o talking to the pit musicians a couple of years ago i wanted to know how they found meaning in the mundaning inevitable repeticians of life and lots of jods people do the same thing every day but nothing quite this youearing the exact same lines from the stage playing the exact same notes for the same songs even they go sating next to you breethes in the exact same rithem every day the fanam kis is cristine for the first time and the same shandileer comes crashing down in the same spot on the stage i ave seen the archist remembers were sand archers wo pull back the same bow with the same motion until they de i talk to a trump of player name lowell hershy long's been at the shosons day one and everyone says he is the same as pirson in the pet and a kind of drives you nuts for the first few weeks and then after that youre mind deals with it and just flushes it out when you are not there iyou do not think about it do the words to the songs at your play a no a thout not entirely where any worl there any fondly whatever i mat i remember once at one time after a show had been running for a while it is somebody asked me to play a lotle bit of a tone from the shell and i could not even do it i could not even think of one had submarge ti but you brays thek aser just arejected being cognits under the music is going on ti think that is typical of people do to shows w thin the right tave of personality as thet can handle is shop i'm descended from a long lying of sirfs and pe os yo ow people who are use stell pabering in the feels for for hardly any money and tand are relatively happy with that the fannam players are not exactly sirvs they are well paid they play a beloved show and they get the playin small orchestras on the side but the is are highly trained musicians who went to the fanciest music schools in the world andrew loind waver on at the best of the best for fanam which means a pit will always sound good though it also create some creative and spiritual problems for the players who have to get through the score night after night after night i'm a violent operator thathav you juscribe that is that is how you jescribe o ye fut's it is it is very technical i have i have no emotional connection with it that is a violinist named ker cobl he is a composer his dream has always to write schores for horrophones he is now been at fannam for twenty two years long enough to see three people in hi section die t i'm playing the show nobody's interested in my creative in put i've often compared it to working in a hospits no it is just we just keep the show alive as long as we can here they all are and this weard social experiment trap together for decades twenty seven musicians crammed into this tiny space a trumpet player told me it is playing in a submer i've been down there and you can barely turn round without knocking into something in the pit you notice everything e way your neighbour blows out as pit vol way someone brags about their kids the smell of some one's perfume every little annoyance every preceives slight accumulates one of my favorite stories whith shoud drive anyone who has ever played in a band crazy here is his pesine player who has sat next of the same claronet player since nineteen eighty eight she is convinced he plays half in o flat on every note he is ever playe he denies this the person i talk to the mus in the pit wass melany the oboist she is one of the rare people you meet who has no real filter i was complaining about something which i imagine was that it was really cold it is always really cold and then o some one else from the orchestra said jus tired of the sound of your voice wand i'm tired o th some of my boys toosy i cont i sympathized with her then i was a violet as tat ma because i sa i used round up in my garden shea she would not speak to me for i a o weeks during most of our talks melony was making reeds it is an extraordinarily meticulous process there is all sorts of medieval looking tools an tiny bits of wood everywhere oh bost ar the most orcanistic people in the world because everytime tiy aeree they think that it my work f usually do not tat anyway this part i on i i'ms getting te most i wat wi you meade to picke your collor of thread and it just makes all then ever tat i never know what colloure hed i jus as always find that mi have that got awful noise melany studied it juliard she dreamed of being the principal oboess in the metropon opera o the philharmonic but she kept bobbing her editions her nerves got the bass of her every time she was up for a big seat and then life and bills in her ven fannom in that way is a very good job in a feel where there are not a lot of good jops anywore e put malanies kids through college peter mortgage and provided security while the music indistree colassed around her but at the end of thirty years sitting just inches away from your coworkers you lose all sense of proportion your enemies turn into monsters for malany the monster in the pit was always ha trumpet plyer named francis bonni everything he did troofe melony nuts from the black biking shorts he wore in the pit to always eating his dinner in the lockeroom with his pack turned to her frances was the miserable sone of ich and at a tern point he is turn o worin bit ye put this black slik shade on the side of his glances ye's where tose ise cause he does one to see me wri that is why hes where is i really truly bos i wanted to run this all by francis it just seems unreasonable france is the only person i had talk to who had actually escaped from the pit he got in a trock and drove out to the middle of nowhere in colerado he says he is much happier now you's welgam melody oh ye hery i i underso that you too did not have the best relationship one of things that she told us was that that yo basically made an eye patch that you would not have to look at hers is this a true story that justelling us i did do that some boyn but elbowsn't just because a millony oh she is taken too prucialy it was actually anybody that was on my rights she told us for a long time that you sat in the lockeroom and that you re turn your back to everybody because you did not want to look at them yell yellwas in a locker room i came there i my dinner looked at the white wall winian play the show and then left the theatre left the premises as fast as i could and o it worked beautifully can you compare that relationships that you have with other relationships it is family its aspes you cid did in a putting up with people did you just on't want to hear their voice again you sit there thousands nd thousands and thousands and thousands of hours this is a court of a life time the musicians in the pet do not play the whole time which means there ar thousands of hours where they are not actually doing anything and during those rast they read books spy thrillers and mysteries and do the cross word with their neighbors the trumpet player has tauht himself three languages another musician ran a wood shot business on his laptop during the show and socially it is a bit middle school there are the loaners the jocks and the french horns they are the boys in the back of the bus they bring in fart machines and run the same practical jogs over and over sometimes t even mass of the audience the front row is right up against the pet close that their feet sometimes dangle nexts of the musicians heads occasionally one of the french horn players would take out a bottle of white out and writ little messages on the souls of the audiences shoes those guys there is sinningwhere behind me the're always chattering and laughing i being me if i play badly i think i o their sayng how terrible an oh god i do not want you realliate myself this more than anything malany told me is one makes her ont a sound good every night she is worried the french horn guies will make fun of her i'm not playing for the audince case he audiens does not and i'm playing for those french hornplace i do wane to say o one of the complents i've gott n over the years is som io do yue to play well when you have just been doing phantom for all those years it is it is a choice that i fat my choice is to play this music its any other music ful i ply and and make it beautiful can you irwhi can gither really hard won if it is really battle i beg you now nobody is in the phanam pit right now the show temporarily close and march because of covat nineteen the unstopable show had finally been put on paws i recently checked in with malany again she was not doing very well her mother had died in he nursing home in new jersy presume covet positive she was not getting pay by the show any more and she miss phanam this is surprising tom me melling and all the other musicians had told me about their fanacies of finally leaving the show and ihad believe them but now that it it actually happened she miss a routeen fan to mi miss tthe comradeship the re petition of the silin jokes and watching everyone eat and i do not know the routine i cont of routine in my life this of course is the office of which she said in the past before covit it was always easier to complain that it was boring and to complaine about driving into the city and wasting all that time in the caran playing the same music and going home again an and i just thought i knew i with wock back then but it becomes very real now i mean what can i fay now i really now what is not having this job i it is much fun to complain about things that do not matter oh the women in the bath from they are just alwayst talking about their expensive hair and make up and iimis's the women in the batr and i y i'd be happy to complain about that again before the pandammic every time i talk to melony i would ask how she was doing grands are always depended on parking it is hard to park in mid tow manhatan the good parking spot was a good day the bad parking spot was a bad day this is how she made sense of her life i think about this all the time most of our lives are spent finding parking for the job we do not want to do melony's not alone in that and after any number of years those routines accumulate d that is more or less your life of all the people i talk to in the pet one musician dealt with the mondanin inevitable repeticion of life in a way that really stock with me for the past two decades in the pet cart the musicianwho described himself as a violin operator has been dreaming up the most elaborate and metaphorically perfect coping mechanism it is a ban made up entirely of automatons i met these robot musicians in a warehouse in yonkers the panban stands for partially artificial musicians kard's automatns are made up of scraps of medaline string all wired up to a sounboard that kirkan program to crate whatever sounds he wants there is magnes an electric corin organ a creeg the base guitar and then there is rosy the fairment this is jac a solid boly electric violin using be exo skeleton design this is what how o alleviate the bord of of the redundancy of phantom o i'm constantly thinking about this project and how i can incruel the ought imation and the kond o music that i would the createwhat why did you decide to do this oh if i ever see a theropist maybe they will help me under someolive thand im there i was a part of it where you are man i am playing in this orchestra i'm not expreting a it is not the expressiveness that i want i also a kind of feel an omautomaton and may bu just make an automaton a short violinis gi ma i can i can see exploring that am i looking for some kind of soul heeling from this dehumanization of being in a violen section possibly i ask cart if the panban could play the music of the night or all i ask of you or any of the phantum classics he was not into that at all this band was not desin to play angerloid wepera but something inside him jus culdn't get away from phanom of the opera back when he was sitting in the pet he' can pas just in his head both the preoqle an the seequell to phanm both which involve indian a jones type characters in years ago he got a copy of the nineteen twenty five silent film version of phanum and wrote an entire score he wanted to play it for me he turned out the lights in the warehouse and projected the film on to the wall the panban started to play the score features him curt as the solow violen is from the star of the show the automatans all play the same thing the curd always improvises not of his show orever the sam caspig an

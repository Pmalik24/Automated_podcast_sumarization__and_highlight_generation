far it os cruco the election faria flarida florida one o the people who thnks about that a lot is ceaven sheeky he is the got is job bit is to spend a hundred million dollars the billioner mike boonbrig is devoted to winning for itar for jobidon chigi is not intimited by that task at all he spend lots of woinbrig's money in the past he ran boonbrogs three successful runs for new york mayor and is campaign for president this year and tan mi clic to say a he gave me anoher men of bugin li see ther each in every time i i as yoeu do not intend to to that av oride why flarida of all the battle ground states why a hundred million dollars there cgaven explain that a big part of it has to do with what is gan o happen in other states he pointed to all the times tweets and in speeches thut the president is said that mal an ballats cannot be trusted donal trump has sought to i people gen a times all bal and mal and balts a fulstop aand is clearly will have a plan to contest those ballats after alection day as they are counted a in important swing states such as michigin and pennsylvania which jobin is curenly leading in micci gan would take at least three days to count ther ballats tensylvan is not mucs different trumpet said wis sommi take everywhore nevery judge i have a not a question every single bout and try to truss them out and just throwing out bouts by random could really move thor states from bine to trump that is because more democrats or doing mal and ballats than republicans ide this year bloomburgs people of actually run the numbers an calculated their estates with throwing out seven per cent of the ballats at randum for not being filled out correctly which will abiding victory in that state to a trump victory and that is a very dangerous proposition and that is what were trying to forit by getting into florida far it dos a state the dono trump pretty much hass to win if he loses far at it would be enormously difficult for hm to gather in ouf electoral vots to have reelection and this is key far it does a state the counts mal and ballats as they arrive the counting them right now already which means we very well could know the results an forite on electo night and a far ito goes to bidon it might settle the race that night an ars om h calls to wen t state o flordace that we quite frankly do not have to have that fight in state pennsylvanian howd yo pick a hundred million what was that discussion li ah yena you wis if i sate a it was ultimately what we determined we would need ah it was o the number that we thought we would make a difference i called gi i know who is probably ti smartes a sratige on the democratic side and i ask him how much which you need to stand if you one i ja to be abwile have an intact on a race state wy raceon a presentian florand how much would you need to really put your tomp on this cale and he said at a time willian a porsion ex strordinarlycments o stane it has a lot a a large expensiv meening markgts ender and to have any sort of in tat you really need tospend twenty million dollars and if you really want to put yure om on the scale a you are iny to spend seventy million dollars ah and this being boomburg we round it up mest of that boonbig money is going to deety ads and diyolads dropped into cities all across the state a vast air warf conducted rom thirty thousand feet cevchigi says boomburgs doing daily polling o see what effect this as having exactly gon a hard to figure out all kinds of thngs push vote or opinion around uc ceven says the numbers and farito have move from a tie between trump and bidon to a small bidon weed bhat still within the margin of error but it is lead two to four points ut the boonburg people find encouraging that is the view from thirty thousand feet dow on the groun n and all as o little different because of something basic and that is the corone of viris and how the two campaigns a responded to the crown of iris as you may know over the summer the democratic party policy was do not go to to door do not hold events in person do not hold rallies republicans did all that stff and far thr even before the virus they woere doing more an registering more voters than the democrats in sure numbers there are more register democrats in the state than republicans but since twenty sixteen the re publicans ofe nok that lead down used to be seven per cent now it is just three and a half percent porter the voters in the state have no party of viliation the re publicans were going strong before the virus and after the virus tof the state they resumed normal operations but t democrats whene not going out toe campaign itwas one party was out there in the streets visible and the other was just not oneof our producers lenimit sises this ben talking tofar to democrats about all that and wena how the feeling not great arly something one that i talk too i'm a case of theres is one voter i found marce hope a she is in a sumburb called weston which isn'n one of the bluest counties in floreda fror county which is just north of my ammy but she says at the republican presente is much more noticeable that her house is somehow surrounded by trump sins and others almost nobid in sience in her neighborhood wow yet the inlake she sees trump supporters everywhere the the that frustrating thing that is happenin is when i get tacks from my friends with pictures saying all my god a carload of trump supporters just got out in my neighbourood and they'r going theyr nocking on doors right now but we have gen not able to do that four years ago hilreclettens campaign had an office neer marcie's house in west and and nots for people would go to pick up signs to foun bank i to meet up with each other by does not even have

cot out as were all dyin doe not only is marchie keeping track of what her sight is not doing she is keeping track of what the other side is doing specially signed up for her county tha the prir county local republican use letter we why because a every day wic when it sens out its daily emale that lists all of the e that the campaign events that they have conting up for the republicans she likes to keep chuck of it and a cindaddrives her crazis just noticing all these events at their running there do herit or there doi watch parties for ye ono to ba they had watch parties it no wat as

pictures on on the community fasebopage and they had a watch party and i thought we oce nice semming they warn we most of em ware not wring mask i know that that something that a lot o people would be has a tint to do but it just seen it was something that involved community that they were sitting together round going hate we are grue we are here and they count of support each other ind kind of something that i wish wecould replicat and were a stron in the absence of their own official meat ups i found a bunch of frustrated democrats lake all over florida not just infroward who took matters into their own hands we were they doing okate there is a woman in ovietto a which is a small red town and she is been hosting these very small rallies on street corners every monday wednesday in friday owell ome another example is a grandmother in tal hassy who told me that she punted out a bunch of florda vota registration forms and she was handing them out to young seeming people in the well markd parking lot nover that that the bud compan did finally strike going dordor in florida and another stage too this fall yes that append two weeks after i starer talking to marche a and she

she her tefor tis democrats are justified ar their weaders dropping the ball did the party pull back too far with tha grone of aurs precautions she put together this story the think democrats have been doing instead of door knocking fhone calling and gon is the comrotery of organizing everyone breathing in the same air in some makechif florescent let campaign center this volunteering is done from home and here iswhat it looks maria is a phone banking folunteer she is thirty three living in south east florida with her husband and her three year old son yown she works in consulting and after work she as forty five minutes to phone bank before her could gets home maria was born in columbia looked here when she was sixteen with her parents she is a citizen now and not a fan of the president his comments again a an ma grands agains women amin i think almos every single posicion that taken in every comment that he is made i agains what i believe in what i thank this country stamps for maria did dor knocking in twenty sixteen and she is doing phone banking now i wanted her to compare them for me and i listened in while she phone bank in forty five minutes she dialle twenty eight fhoe numbers ytis enine of those twenty eight cone calls whent to voice smail which the democrats mostly do not think its worth it to leave messages after the be one phone call a todler pked ut o y is astalithe kito seemd to put the phone down and walk away o some grown ups did not want to get into it either with tha democratic party of florida i of course not everyone marias folk to favorite her sied oh you will o i there were three calls that thanks the goal of these calls it is not to persu eed anyone it is just to get bit an voters to vote and over a third of them seleven people were bidin supporters s six of them said that they would already mailed in their ballats in five of them had not a or lano do not wait till the end of the monsk is a lot of largin o be mailing their ballad and the postal service is going to be overwhelm with the ballats may sure you you sended a sooner you do not want a haw it sdelayed and not being talmet use led ag sign the outside of the envelope and mllan that quickly maria says that that one call it made a feel worth her time that day the si thing that was one more vote one vote that well be counted and would not have been otherwise if i hadn' called him i haw iv it may i forty five minutes one actual vote for her team or herstee tho also four other bidin voters that she nudge towards mailing in their ballats and how do these pone call us comparete dor knocking maria says in twenty sixteen in terms of how many people she would made direct contact with in a shift door knocking and phone banking are about the sceme but going door to door takes me more time tbe tween going and grabbing the lis than getting to he please and walking arou and waiting wou know some one's mom would open the door that we had to wait for the person that we are actually trying to reach to come over what happened yesterday took forty five minutes and then what what you'r taught a saturday afternoon an twenty sixteen it sons it would take a few hours ye ye but i do think is tis tis ger there is been actual research on this whit shows that door knocking and fhone banking a pretty close in terms of their effectiveness wit is a slight edge toward door knocking thoug calling people is faster the question really is how many phone calls our democrats making for biding florida compared to doors knocked on in the past i called around for numbers the closest i got was from the independent organization that cordinates a lot of the get out the vote among democrats in florida they are called america votes they say when you count phoned banking and door knocking and everything else that they do to reach voters they have double the number of people they have rhd conversations with in florida it is two million this year verses one million or fewer and previous elections but that number does not include the democratic party's own get out the vot effort which is an important part of the picture party ficials would not give me outreach numbers for this year or previous elections but they did do instead it say that everything is on track all of the floorida democratic officials i talk to agreed on that here is tebby wasferminshalts she is margy's congress women and she used to chair the national democratic party i mean at the moment i can tell you that we lead aen the proof is in the voten democrats l ead republicans an vote i'm now by three hundred and sixy thousand pluss vot y mal balats being turned in that is just massive massive you it increases we are really lapping the field it is th what i say to voror democracts is the proof is in the voting and we have to dust keep people vote it is true that more democrats democpublicans have mailed in their ballats but that is kind of what you would expect coved reactions have fallen along tarty lines and wee more democrats astked for mailan ballats than republicanstet of course things could get completely reshuffled on monday that is when early in person voting stars in florida republicans ca start showing up and tro i ily think of there is nothing ta be wasst from in sholt or other party leaders could say that would reassure margy or tuly or any of the nervous emocrats i tock to jaffgreen who also lives an power he remembers two years ago how confidently they all had it into the governor's racs it was the race that was supposed to show that a democrat could wen stay wihe office and fired at two years ago to day andre gilmwas at non ports to gi shons an the governersers and all the litlecat tor rarar o yellow yeltentand of course he

creativity explord that is creativity explord got t i three the best lade plancs to dey spog om mis about people worrying about the future and we thught for change of pace we would do this dnext story about people who are not worried enough about it this is another story from our archive it is a particular favorite it is byut this couple and the future they kond of cheerfully threw themselves towards and after say everything that happens to ments a hand grenade they bring into their own home pull the pin and then wait to see what is next and one importanthing about all of this is is that when they did this the kind of couple they were was it really great couple we were always the most solid of all relationships of our friends ind everything that crick brown a were met his girl friend on the third day of college and in all of the ways that we think of what makes her a good relationship i think that they were doing better than you or me or most people they had a lat fun together they could talk about anything they didn' really fight happy sex life was we really just got along very well together we travelled well thogether we were always the kind of we were the place of friends would come when they are having hard times and thy would stay with us and we were kind of it felt very adult when even when i was twenty three felt i'm kind of married even though neither of us had ever ever discussed getting married what happened well after we had both turned thirty am one day i just kind of was thinking about why we had never talked about getting married we had never ever talked about it seriously or otherwise and whenever any one would ask us we would always just kind of kind of brushat often say i woll workg in a what will get marry when we have kids that is what would always say and i remember we were sitting in the living room and was october and i just said hey i want o talk and i sa why why do you think we have not got married yet or even talked about it and she just kind of looked at me and and thought for a second then she said well i think that before we get married we should probably sleep with other people and a and that you would imagine that that wud come as a huge shock to me hit me hard but for some reason kind of it made sense to me a i kind of was gall ki very calmly and i guess the reala how did that make sense i've thought of lot about this and i think that there is a few reasons we both had this kind of arr again notion of our relationship that it could survive literally anything that we had b in to get we we had known each other our wholedole lives we were we were each other's world really we i do not think we shau that we could destroy this thing i dont to the girl friend who did not want to come on to medio and she said bastically she would only had two boy friends in a line our high school boy friend who was not a te boyfriend at all kirt whot was great but she met kirtshe said when she was seventeen she was thirty when this happened and she said that yhe fellow may be she missed out on something in ar twenties eexperences at other people had and she don hon o regret then wenning i should say before we goany further in thi story we cold not acknowledge the existence of sex between a donts a nothings was they sat on the couch and they talk this throt the next part of that conversation was the legistics do we break up do i move out do we just do this while were living in the same house together and we can it came up with this idea of borrowing this this this homish concept i called rum spring o and arum spring in the homish world as when when you are sixteen you are allowed to be not homish for two years and then when you turned eighteen you decide whether or not you come back to the fold and during this two years kids get drunk they sleep around they tridrug say to lots an men delots ta stuff we are ging to have i we decided to have a rumspring im from our relationship and that is the other crazy thing is that we decided that it would thirty days was enough cause probably within thirty days sleeping with other people wll get that all out of our system an thirty days turns out it is hlkly difficult all thi sudden bes come single at thirty one when you have never been single for your entire life cause allof t a sudden i 'm in new york city and i'm single and i'm i sentially have the the the emotional tools of a seventeen year old boy cause the last time you dated was you were seventeen the less im i dated i was in a dorm room and also it was not that i was just it was not i was single in new york city cause being single in new york city is i think the majority of it as being just very lonely and being on your own whereas this was very different i was in a marith i was in a race i was in i was in a thirty day race to sleep with as many people as i possibly could because after thirty days i was going to go back and thn't get married er er the is a time caught ticking every single it was almost to the minute wrerlgisty i if i was in out somewhere trying to meet some one i was this is wasted time i am wasting my time right now and also because the fine can we are both my girlfr and i were both very competitive with each other that we did not speak during that thirty days but i think in both of our minds we had a competitive nature of being i need to slee with more people than she does and i think she felt the same way that is yrue she did feel that way i asked her before they started the room springa they took u a last romantic tripp together to knew orleans of a new years and they had a great time and then on january third after they both cried a bit kirt moved out for month suddenly single thirty one time caught ticking where do you start rigt witl kirt called this woman that he knew just a little bit and had a date on the very first or second night he cannot rember which it was at a dinner he told her the entire situation hat way the holding out that he seeing somebody they wour taking this break to sleep around and this was rule that he made for himself that he was always going to be honest with any woman than he met during this montning whom we honest upfrunt that and that is the weird think that is the hing that i still kind of when i think back on this time that i do not understand ike cou do not understand how these women that i met during that time heard the story and were lie o ka let us continue t this day would they say i think most of that thoverwhelming response was whow and i cannot believe your telling me this kir was staying on the futan on a friends living room for for the month in this apartmentwere there was no door between the living room in the bedroom when his friend was sleeping and he brought this woman back on the first date and they made out a little bit and then they set another date i think it was proly for the next natter the night after something that and what happened ah whutd you mean what happens on the date i mi guess i mean do you sleep with her since the whole point of the story as you tryieng to sleep yes eands that they felt very modest about esking but ye e di yyes reted of sleeping together yet yet it was amazing it was yet totally turn my had around it really did feel having experiences i would imagine i would have had it as a teanager rsec was a very powerful thing ind a kind of overwhelmed you they who after that ixc ep a woman in bar something he had never done before in his life wen he goes home with her from there he is often running but remember he has the emotional tools of a seventeen year old i was emotionally getting involved with these women and that was that was against one of our rules that we had come up my girlfr and i had had a rule saying no relationships we do not get into relationship with people were just ging to go out an sleep with people to see what it is oh i see andbut you did not ectually know how to jistgotten sleep with somebody without getting emotionally attalt not at all i mean the first the first date i went on i immediately was life id over heels for her and i knew her first six hours and i did not know how t a date i did not not had a date casually what i really was doing was just getting in vi i was acting a person who had been in a thirteen year relationship with these women that i had just met i cut us at mewould he mimmediately holding hands i remember da that i would my impulse would be to say i love you doring sex that would be my impulse ecause that is the only way i was used to having sex and i remember the first time that i i did and o having sex i started to say i love you and then just kind of swallowed it made it see i was cofgi i and that was it ind that did not happened just once certis itwwas just a month of incredibly intense feelings he feel this crazy elation or he would finds om walking down the street weeping the girfriend told me that she meanwhile was having escapades of her own shed be out all night drinking and dancing going to exclusive clubs with mexican high rollers doing crazy things with european torris it was just what she wanted actually and both of them told me that the weirdest thing about that time was that the person that they wanted to talk to most about what was going on and char it with was each other but f was they were not speaking kirt says that on h most amazing things to him that ws cont of a revolation at during that time war something i've never ectual heard anybody talk about it about aby a totally related to this was how quickly he would find himself in the home of a complete stranger yet i never got in to see other people's apartment and muhthat is what i cot of was as they i for getting to see all these different people's apartments i seein how everyone lives aand ove that i love that part of it much hou know was as look at this come seeing this all your stuff there is a stuff you keep on your bed bedbedside table a and also having really weird whoexperience ha i never had before of women picking me up a never experience that before am i was confused cause ite was that it was a bar tender she was a bartender she just kept giving me drinks free drinks as why is this pirs why she givin me all these free drinks tut it is fastening to see if you stay at the bon tiful in the morning than al of a sudden i'd never been aware of it before beenofs on looking round me oh all these people ae paring off look at how this happens thike i'd never bean i'd been at bars an before in the morning but i was always it is alvison uncovering this whole level of single life in new york city that i that i was just had not been aware of before any one in new york city i feel can have seks any night of the week if they just followed two rules which is stay at the baruntillfore in the morning and dramatically lower your standards t after a month curt missberfrn get together and talk and they agreed that a month was not enough for thius it was that it was just obvious the experiment had not run dis course they both wanted more time they decided on a second month which then becomes a third month and for curt is time whent on it got harder and harder to stick with the rule that they had made of not getting into any relationships he jus muddling about had a figure had how to do that and his head e would think when is something actually a relationship and i think in my had als three dates three dates makes relationship that is what i defined and then i would tried and not see people fmore than three times am that was increasingly difficult is difficult because he was giving women two opposite messages at the same time he would tell them that he was just taking a month's break from his real relationship in this is not serious but then he did not hold back any of his feelings what i i felt hept happening whas that i would act i wanted to be their boy friend and thand after three dates would just abruptly end it with no explanation whatsoever and ah daflin deffliy people would yell it me and call me names ah and and ah and i and i feel to the stafial i feel horrible about that i cause i was just i was acting a a crazy person as ike tan a person with absolutely noboundasstill was hard to stop himself what was going on and when we talked about a curts best explanation for that was i once had it when i had a dog i was when i was a ket i hat a dog and one day the cat nocke a five pound backer sugar off on o the floor and my dog was about nine pounds he was a toy poodal and he ate all ounds a sugar and one day and and thet he was sick for three days thaterwards but i always think about that that day for himhow a amazing that day must have beend ere eating all that sugar and eating and then can going away r i er little on being i cannot stapp when it is this gat a happen and then he just started vomiting and vomite three straight days and that is how i felt o i knew this was bad batout i when is this ever goen a happen agad i eskers forfriend if all this happene to her during the rumspring a too if it was hard just to have sex without a motion entering into it at all and she said ab luly not qot you mean dude that i me o bars of parties whatever those people she that i did not tell any one anything but my back ground or the situation and i asked her waits he would not explain when of reat from a relationship she said no yecause it sounds crazy it toldher that a kurt would reveal all of that which she knew in she is a dear yo curts way to open but wuot thit open is probably just made im more appealing to the ladys but the end of three months curt ser to fall for this woman that he met in australia and this time really actually fall for her in a real wayht and this made him of course feel diferently about his relationship with his girl friend if we back to the states statd their old apartment and because this is the most comfortable relationship that has ever existed between two people of course they dealt with it all right away very straight forward and we woke up in the morning we went and got brunch and we brought it to the park the way we would always used to do on saturdays we just sat in thepark and i talked and we broke up and ta's a thing i i cannot i cannot point to something that was bad about our relationship except for knowing that i feel it had run its course mea we organically got to the pat point where we both thought this was a good idea this the roomspeit is almost we we the the the the relatioip had an expiration table we did not know about it and then off we came up with this really complicated crazy plan to put the tasdoon it at the right place where it would break and it broke it is all gir friend sand something similar she said syhe had probably wanted out of the relationship before the room spring up sh sus too scared to admitted to herself the roomspring ed gave them a way to break up kurt says he would not wanted do a roomspring u again but he cam out ofthis experience believing that it is important to force things to a decision was some one and that it is healthy for any relationship to be valuated now and then i do have a theory now i do have a theory about if i do get married in the future what i think i would want to do is have an agreement that at the end of seven years we have to get remarried in order for the marriage too continue but at the end of seven years it ends and we can agree to get remarried or not get remarried why because nh't i get think you get to choose that i think it makes the relationship would make the relatiship stronger i do not nowat i think of that cause i think actually one of the things that is a comfort in marriage it shaid there is not a door at seven years and if something is mest op in the short term there is a comfort of knowing we we made this commentmen and which scon work this out and an even if to night where not getting along or there is something between us does not feel right you have the comfort of knowing we have got time or going to figure this out and that makes it much easier cause you do get through times when you hate each other's guts and a young i of course he dor yet and and the no escap cause weirdly is a bigger comfort to being married than i ever would have thought before i got married really i never thought of it that way ye i i thinking about it that way yo just see many examples of when o were that of people were people do not think that way bu curtain is girl friend tou the roomspringe got them where they needed to go as a couple even if that place was different than they intended when they began the whole thing sometimes we o need to do next as a couple ye came and tell what it should be best you cen do sold your breath maybe guess jump witl these days a her brownoler is the host of pod cascod bananas and he virtually host thelong renning variety show with christian shawl hot tup with crotin christen mondays on twit that storyes a few years old and i could probly say a lot about the things thi curt n i talk about at the end but i will leave it that thes these days curtis married and im not a for potes aparanda alosay it i believe the children are our future and i believe that worries for our children and ther future a probably the most common worries out there tumanityes nimble one worry category top of the charts our survey says cannot be beat generation after generation but there is a whole other class of thoughts abut her kid's futures r less anrther not worry exactly they'r more jistlike curiosity ten years ago what eve our produters back then johnthin and hevar talked about both those feelings the curiosity and the worry on isha poteswill have dark wavy hair her eyes will be brown unless they are green or maybe hazel she will have full lips she will not be tall which is tha nice way of saying that she might be short because of this fact potis will not going to concerts because slike my wife hillory shew'll only be oble to see the backs of other people's heads and that spot on a persons back between their shoulder blades some day when she touches that spot in a person she loves it will feel oddly familiar and comforting because all her life while standing in line at the swings or waiting for a cashier to ring up her milk she will have looked at that spot another people because she will be our daughter poties will chocolate ice cream and enjoy punds she will need glasses by third grade podes i should explain is what hillery and ihave taken to calling the little girl hilory will give birth to an two thousand ten calling our kit it only felt right for about a week or two we brainstorm baby code names one night in bed hillory thought the name should be something that opening scene in the west wing pilot he one where rob blow walks out of the shower an a woman in underwear in immen's dress her weeds from his pagure podes in a bicycal accident hillry set our cod name should pop that but we could not thnk of anything is coolest potis we just stol it i woried that while podis was still nothing more than cells splitting into other celles that we might be setting unachievable expectations by naming her the acradan the secret service use to refer to the president of the united states when people find out your having a baby they predict all kinds of things about the child you will have but i wanted to let potis tell us who she was i tried to cling mostly to the facts twenty weeks into hilerys pregnancy we went in for an ultrasen our alterasound tacnician look kate from john and cape plus aite in scrubs she had that crazy hair do ind everything we asked if she could tell the gender of the baby she said it is a girl she said it with the same level of enthusiasm i use to tell hilory that we got a gasbill in the mail knowing that potes was a girlment that now there was a shape to the mystery the altrasound gave us the lines of he coloring book and we could not help but fill them in hillery remembered all the stuff about dominant in recessive genes that i slept through in my high school biology class and we thought about our friend ma shell a biologist who spends her days working with fruit flaganes i doft really understand what it is she does exactly except that it has something to do with diabetes and the summer when i was having a fruit fly in fastation she did not have any suggestions for how i could capture or kill them i thought maybe michel could help us figure out what potis might look she said she would do her best but that this stuff was more complicated and humans an what i was imagining she also told me that there was a great paper published in science recently about the genetics of dog coats and that if we were breading a dog instead of a little girl she could be really helpful michell came over to our house and in exchange for lezonia an a bierre she sat with me and drew ponnit squares those little squares divided into four smaller squares that are supposed to help you figure out what traits went over others michel was willing to commit to a few things the fact that potis will likely have dark hair but really she said even if she was able to study me in hillery in a lab she could not tell us with any certainty woutd our baby will look because unlike dogs humans havin't been bread for certain trait there is really no way of knowing what green eyes may be hiding in my genes mostly she said the whole dominant recessive thing could help lus figure out dopy stuff for instance now we know that potes will have unattached earlods and be able to impress her friends with her ability to roll her tongue a ta a few months ago not long after we found out that potis was a girl i was writing my bike home from work the traffic was heavy i was going pretty slow i looked to my right and noticed a gurl on the sidewalk looking at me staring really she looked she was in her early twenties and she had her auburn hair tiding a thick bray that swung over her right shoulder i cannot remember if she was wearing glasses but i know she was wearing a dress and holding a petition clipboard in her right hand if skin was made of plato hers is what you would get if yhe forever mixed the hillory color with the jonathan one i could not tell you if it was that or the way she looked at me in tently that is to blame but i stared back the first split second i thoughtion might be potis all grown up i wanted to ask her much i was school ho live around here what you more seeing fire flies for the first time the summer whor the first fat snowflakes winter really though every question was some variation on the one bag question i'll try my whole life to mage potis answer yes to are you happy it is also i realize e question i cannot predict the answer to jartan man hevear these days is making shows that prin apple street studios stute

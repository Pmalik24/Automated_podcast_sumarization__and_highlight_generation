stoday shursponser by expressive ve piens you your web history being seen in sold to advertisers now me neither can express be pian right now at express ve piandacams lash men we are not afraid we the citizens of the west are not afraid and we should not be afraid the massive procomoss rallies we have seen in nearly every major western city and across college campasses our designed to intimidate that is why they do vilands it is why they fly terrorist flags but here is the optimistic reality far more people in the west a pose commass than supported for more people are in favor of israel weapon commass off the map than are in favor of commass retaining any level f power at all the silent majority may be largely siland but it is in fact in majority that much was clear yesterday on the mall in washington to see where proe israel ralliers mostly jewish came by the hundreds of thousands three hundred thousan in all the larges single gathering of jews in modern history they can from florida and california and new york and new jersey they can from cleveland and chicago and hewston and they came for one reason to show that those who support israel are more numerous than those who support israel's enemies the ralliers actually showed far more than that actually they showed that those who support israel wove the west tand by extension they demonstrated that those who hate israel generally hate the west the contrast could not have been clearer that pro israel rally was replete with american flaslike everywhere with pride in the united states the proe israel rally featured no hate chance no calls for genicide no blood curdling baying on behalf of the targning of nisson people instead i featured prayer solidarity and love as one police officer reportedly put to quote i received a career's worth of thank uws in one day meanwhile here is footed to a procomosrally yesterday in staten island they want is ra destroyed that is wat that is loganmans look an thember of mast sind the crowd hepl blocking off their faces s then do not want to be seen localized the intivada and ins vada is a violent uprising this is a new york city i this protest devolved intwo attacking police officers le can seed his rol commoss next litterally punching at striking out at new york city police officers at the unwiputy yes the contrast is rather obvious it is obvious to me it is obvious to you it is obvious to most americans the support for israel yesterday at this big rally was by partisan here is newly mented speaker of the house mike johnson yesterday the aauditory was foll repall agains and democrats of the hows then they welt does we wassh the fill together most cookne set through it thes this railly officers were kikin out en their halls by bar barret commoss terrist fort simply being jewish of if o of israel theis promenister then the ag ser well this is a fight between good and evil between light and darkus between civilization and barbaris the cause for a seaspire or outrageous now was my johnson the current speaker of the house in your of the dentl pracsentiment towarty leader trashumer my frendingonclosion the mossis gall whats to scare us then those purpetrading the poison of the indo tantiseitisom an bigitry around the world or trying to scare us but we will not alow hi tret of side back to the days of the hallo cos when jes or tagiy and murdered at butcher instead the jei bpopry be wetilient an itaa oir coing we will no it in the fa ofa gor city in a mol itin i ral on i sroe cim now the rally haditators of course from uss supporters vandalyzed the medical tent at the rally the night before s we a see this tormedical ted to see the medacl had this whihe rin round the outside we had to flit them around this is whit it was last night we auht of this morning all the tens had this on the outside of thems we had the flip around the canvas in been spraypanted by procomas nets prery three gaza apparently bus drivers refuse to take jews arriving frm out of town from dullous air part to the rally itself in a clear case of religious discrimination is buss companies can be sett of edistance here was the announcement af board a charter plan from totri the way this sorce by the ways to fly charter plane into an airport you cannot d plan unless there is on the tarmac some sort of vehicle ready to take you off the plan and to your and your destination the bus company that had been chartered fore this refused to actually participate in bringing jews to a prote israel rally here is what at townded on the plane here is e bar o tra tuis community members to attend the march forgisrael and washing and decy we are proudo tis icdenro an number travl tof the avent the busses that were higher to take over nine hundred progensians o doliginter dantin of herport o the trahte of the march bal to appear the lay the arrival of manye or most in our room we are learing that this was prouse by a the liber and malicious walk off of drivers ortunate wa many were able to travel to the mart wwe are greatbl for the drivers of dose posse em ara while we are geguent dismade by the disgraceful action or is no to proudly stand and colidarity with the people of israel to conden entisemnetism the mander cernof every ha i all byama is everthing rat tespakan pramed by the bos company of there arin what has happened all this is pretty depressing of course it is even more depressing to see such sentiments in the halls of power eminating amost entirely from the far left canadian prime minister just intrudo who just the terrible person spent yesterday ripping israel an unsurprising developmen from the morally blinds olt who is definitely not definitely not fell castrofs kead here is just intrudo ripping into israel yesterday i have been clear that the price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of all palistinian civilians even words have rulds all innocof life is equal in worth is raly and palistinia i urge the government of israel to exercise naximon restraint s the world is watching on tevi an social media were hearing the testimonies of doctors family members survivors kids of lost tor parents the world is witnessing this just intredo is a disgusting human being trying to suggest that israel is somehow not exercising maximom the strain as we will see in just a moment is totally insane meanwhile representive jemal bomen of new york took a brak from pulling fire alarms to claim that his opposition to israel was actually an attempt to uphold judism the gall of this is just in sa i love that he is flanked with a bunch of ridiculous looking human beings with shirts rabbies for seas fire and it is a it is an overweight female who is definitely definitely not a rabbi in any real sense i do love these folks are trotting out fringe elements as though they are representatives of judiism truly insulting suffier and i've heard what was said here this eveing before that by me calling for ses fire wit my colleguesing setra hu maity i am up lifthing deeply what i actually means to be jewish because ar salatinas heis definitely aga gagemaboman uplifting the jewish paple a feel greatfor the be staning here well harapagado jemal bomen theyre speaking on behalf of the jewish people that is not insulting at all meanwhile boman's fellow com mossquaed colleages to ga different ack elhanomar claim that all people of tate should oppose israel no pigamy or not not not maring ar brother palen but apparently opposing israel something factinating and bazar an in the fact that there are people who theem to be afet that there are rabith and people other people of faith rabbis out here asking for ffire and it is it is bizar because you would afho that if you are a religious leader if you are a f peder that youre number one prioriny would be to look into your fat into the picings of your fat and to fay i opposh vilent i oppose violins from illhan omar whos yet to met a terror group she does not provide support truly amazing stot by the way where are all the emoms for out they'r calling for commassa urrender where are they can you name them buler and then there was the inimitably idiotic ao c fellow traveller at t commosquad who suggested it israel needs to not engage in military action against commss instead they have to find a way to wait for it negotiate witht terroris who have openly stated that they wish to murder every jew on plan and earth ao see ishe is now the cartoon ers this famous cartun of john carri trying to negotiate between commass and israel and the commas nacke is holding a science saying deaf toall jus and the jews sitting there and john carry is saying can you meet them halfway that is now aoc fe fire mean very no military folution only a diplomatic and hultural folutian a relational folutian a reckoning with our thnoy tirli lutiny with the people whare cannanatits f fire now mean she is pathetic in truth however and this is all depressing these are in fact fringe sentiments according to newpole from harisac sixty seven per cent of americans believe israel should continue fighting commassuntill commass is defeat in and israel's hostages are released mor than eight in ten americans agreed that israel has a responsibility to protect its citizens this is the true america not the pictures you see on cn

slash shippera ocase os speaking of the media they spend most of yesterday ignoring that giant rally the biggest rally of jews in modern hastory maybesons sign ahei and instead they decided to folkes in on astrotroping resistance to israel finishing off comas for example the front page of the webside of the yer times at last night carried zeroel mention againd of the largest gishrally and centuries but they did have a front pater article tabout five hundred anonymous members of the executor branch writing letter to jobidon protesting his israel policy literally that pro comas groundswell is building says the neor times the media continue to do their damedist to undermine israel's ability to defend itself because again israel is an extension of the west me do not the wess there for israel most be undermine despite the fact that evere major media outlet of the last twenty years has reported the comas has placed military head quarters beneath allshiva hospital in the gazes strip the press continue to treat israel as a political leper for pursuing that military target no matter that the pensagonspolks person literally confirmed yesterday thaee comas and palisinian is lomicchehod use hospitals as fruns for military sights we do have information that hamas and the palistanian as lamic chod usis som hospitals in the gazas strip including the alshe for hospital an as a way to conceal and support their military operations and holds hostages they have tonnals underneath these hospitals and hams and pace memberis operate a commanding control note from alshe for hospital in gaza city they have weapons stored there and are prepared to respond to in is railing military operation against the facility this is i'm just telling you what we as the an intelligence community assesses is happening ind gosa city how hamases using these hospitals to operate but absolutely we do not want to see a fire fight in a hospital where there are innocents of ill ants the no one wants to see a fire fight in a hospital the only problem is that commass is going to pursua fir fight in the hospital and is literally doing that as we speak no matter that this behavor ba coms under internationala does transform such sihts into military sihts in twenty sixteen as the walstre journal points out here is forces attacke to hospital in mozel actually houre is forces didn just attack te hospital they hit it with an air strike here is what sent comset of the time quote basel was using the hospital as a base of operations and command and contral head quarters in support of the arocki security forces colision air craft conducted a procision strike on the location to target an imy fighters firing on a rocky forces no hartburn from the media after all brokobama wis president at the time and yet israel is going in and attempting to take out com hos room by room all well trying to protact gasin civilians and still the media are treating that as some sort of war crime many members of the media keep asking if a hospital suddenly becomes legitimate target just because commosses ou not using it as a military sitenal the answer by the way is yes here is artical mineteen of the guneva conventions quote the protection to which civilian hospitals are intitled shall not seas unless they are used to commit outside their humanitarian duties act harmful to the enemy protection may however cease only after due warning has been given naming in all appropriate cases a reasonable time limint and after such warning has remained unheeded israel has warn comass and medical officials inside alshive a ospital for literally weeks israel has facilitated exit from the hospital for the sake and the innocent but here was the bb c openly lying about what israel is doing in the hospital and make no mistake is not a mistake to is a lie because the beby see lies is the beby se is effectively a com hospropagan to arm here we go at this loment we are hering from roiders that is reporting that israels it says its forces are carrying out and operation agains tamas in gases el sifa hospital and they are targeting people including medical teams as well as arab speakers a they are also saying that israel is calling on all hamas operatatives in the hospital to surrender at this point once again we are hering from roiders that israel says that its forces are carrying out and operation against hamas in that hospital that we had just heard of they are targeting is arab speakers as well as some of the medical staff there and they are asking all hamas hoperatives in that hospital to surrender they repeat the lie twice they say that israel is targeting arab speakers and medical personel and they repeated twice that is a lie in fact israel is exposing its own soldiers to fire from terrors in allshifa and according to the idea those forces quot include medical teams and arabic speakers weve undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment with the intent that no harm is cost the civilians being used by commosses human shields an otherwards israel is literally shipping in medical teams and arabic speakers two facilitate help for the innocent and the sick this is something i no army in history has done ever literally ever the b b c with gregious here they were force to apologize again for this particular blood lible this follows on their other blood lible ver the clame that israel had bom ta hospital early on in the conflict and then had to walked out one off yours bb se apologizing for the le nn pot fom the bbtbbtis aecve chal reporta is rati forteses ente gos as man hospital we said the medicoltinsen rpcs webin togtan tis was incorrect mscte arotes repor we should hav sen id otes inte medicoltins an rbpics o thes operations that we arpolegize for this e falpensal editoial sane well here is the thing it did not fall belawer usual editorial standards usual editorial standards are ye hate israel anare not fond of the jews either yet here was elizabeth's spires cherids frequently four the new york times and here is what shetsweeted i actually think the morality regarding civilian kitsar should be apparent t everybody any one wh tells me palisinians are using children as human shields f off that is rasest by itself and has been used to justify all manner of atrocities yes it is now races according to this colomnist to point out the commoss uss human shields she is routly taught to commass because apparently they are also races because they brag openly about using tuman shields in a second we will get to the encouraging fact however becaue there is something encouraging about what is going on will get that momentarily first are you few years are decades out of school and wondering what that dad i even learn wes the point of hufthan you might be thinking ow have time to learn something new if that is u you are not alone it is not too late hillsdale college is offering more than forty free on line courses learn about the works of s leuis the rise and fall of the roman republic or the history of the ancient christian chargeh with hillsdale colleges on line courses if you are not sure where to start check out constitution one o one the meaning and history of the us constitution in this twelve lecture course you will explore the design in purpose of the constitution the challenges at face during civil war and how it has been undermine for more than a century by progressivism and liberalism the course of self pace he can start onever and wherever our country needs more americans who understand the constitution and can defend our freedom against the encroachments of an increasingly large and on accountable government had on over to hillsdale dot edy u slashmen two in roll there is no cost its easy to get started that hillsdale dot edy u slashmen two in role hillsdale dot ed uslashmen again i do not recommend colleges lightly to people and hillsdale does it great hillsdale has always been a font for actual virtue and good information great place senor ced hillsdale dot edy u slash men here is that they watch the media lye you watch leftwen coliticians lye but here is the thing nobody with a brain actually believes the media's moral equivalence game their people who arse softs headed who our interested in th moral equivlence game because it makes them feel sophisticated theyre people who do the moral equivalence game begs it makes them feel they can have a level of disconnect from the conflict and that makes them feel very good about themselves the easiest position in any conflict is to both sides the thing but the reality is the vast majority of americans are not doing that and that is encouraging be cause in truth all come oss and its allies have is fear that is all they have that is the whole thing have intimidation well we are not afraid the west does not need to be afraid good news we do not just have right on our side it turns out we have might on our side that is well i'l can meanwhile the congressional clown show continues i have to say are elected officials to very serious time andthe world's always very serious time but it is a particularly serious time right now and the more clownish ore politics gets the worse it is and this is not just a republican problem it is democrat problem as well we have now created a massive dis location of insentives with regard to actual governments people who enter congress were supposed to be originally public servants they are supposed to be people fo actually had in mind the best for their district for example and then power was supposed to check power ambition was supposed to check ambition the quiet the thing was thet in order to advance in the political realm in the united states tow men tha you had to play the game politicsthat meant that you hd to cut deals and mean that you had to manipulate yet be mot givellion you had be clever yet that should get thing's done from time to tie yen to exert power n yu sometimes had to take a lawsry this wlas the push and tug of politics in the united states for centuries and then it'because everyone is a politician a spire to be a higher level politician if you are congress person you wanter to be assentor if you are a senator you might wanto be the president if you are a governor you might want to bethe president if you are local state representative you might want o be the governor the idea was be good at thattrob and you might elevate to the next job but we have now completely done away with that instead everybody apparently in congress a spiers to be a political commitator they want my job and the thing as my job is very different hin their job my job is to say things that i think are true theire job is to get things done those are not quite the same job now you can say things that are true and also get thngs done but what that would require is you to admit to your public that you are not always going to get everything that you want because life is not fair it requires than instead of postering you hae ually hae to make a deal an then go back to your constituents and explain to them the deal that you just made and why you were not able to meet all of their dreams and the is a prom for politicians because again the politicians most likely to win are the ones who promise you the world now that is not really a prom with the politicians in the end it to probl with the electrate the electrate needs to get over itself the electorate in the united states is true again across the board have a tendency to fall for politicians who promise them the world and then they cant deliver the world and then people get frustrated and then the polititian that i feel your frustration and let me tellyou somemit i'm to fix it i giving you the world the more well that sounds amazing i would love to have the world and then the polititian cannot give you the world constop practical and they fall short and get frustrated an the politician comes back tos it if you give me more power guess wereall do i'll give you th worl wo i would love the world that sounds amazing sramming our head into te same stupid wall over and over and over and what you wend up with is a bunch of clowns in congress that is what you actually and up with is a bunch of people ore idiotically smacking each other in the back of the had munch dum school kids stigging guming each other 's hair in order to get attention that is what you wend up with and it istron all sides of the isle and his frustrating in its idiotic and meanwhile the goernment just continue spending instaing a mounts of cash and making really crafpy policy because in the end the people who actually do the deals are the ones wher in the back room hashing the deal out and therhre is a wup if we just replace those guies with some on who promises me the world that will fix the things thike that does not fix the thing the incentive structure is wrong agan i cannot emphasize this enough when it comes to politics it is incentive structures that matter it is not the politician youcan get a bad politician to do the right thing if the incentive structure is correct and youvn get a very good politician to do the wrong thing if the incentive structure is wrong all the incentives are missilined right now and everybody is playing for camera time everybodyis playing for the viral clip and nothing gets done except by the people in te back room which again is what the populists we are saying we need to avoid is the people in the back rom but people in th back room the're goin to do the deal anyway senthey question as whethey'ue gin oelect politicians ware goo to making the deal or batto making the deal meyso wungle thro litney of just absolute clownish behavior by members of congress over the course a ext you minute we begin whit the senate there is a senator his ims mark wan mullin heis a united statesenator from oklahoma and monsa a fine senator he is fi hat will as your publican he threatened to get in a fist fight with a union boss in the cenate yesterday and burney standars who is a socialist clown who has never done a productive thing in his entire life suddenly is the voice of reason here that is how far we have gon we have now gonsto the point where the jerryactric communist who literally was thrown off a commune for being too lazy in the seventies and refuse to pay life any of the paternity bills for his kid dacky he is now the voice of reason in the united states en it that is how clownish this is this all let off by the way because the union boss who was tat who is testifying the inter national brotherhod of teamisters presiden shon obryan he had a apparently twee did against mullin calling him a clown and a fraud who pretends hes self made and he said quit the tughky act in the senate hearings where to find me any place aneahtime and hears how it went down in the senate yesterday othi ia time this is a place youant run you mow we can be tican tinting it allwecan caniso hr in the in uan it now a not to doirit now e stan o but i he stind o butam ol e a a ter aav a a the do ir yo a your o i ti ut it actol o e dou with igh it ar ia allin ed no ia a i o io thi you will have you ia o o yo i i heri go o y mapeoplecongres i wo you youan a wo why i you oler ri ti oi yo mi ii o mi god burney sandders again the voice of reason he crazed old socialist is the voice of reason and mehil oever here sendhers wa ow is town to mow do com macho and he is ready to go and you i hat the union buss the goits tois right now is tos right you right now moll is than i full it is tovis thing i first of all got wud mit woud watch ten out of ten would watch woud watch actual fis fight in tie senit because honestly if these clowns arn't going to do anything if ther ging con be be complete useles people we may as well get a you have sea match out f ut by the way markwan mullin would win ive you actually look at markway mlin's background wi that gi actually kindy knows how to fight is apparently the story but i'm that is pretty wild stuff ite this outsoushart thels just one element a gain because this clownish behavior has now ben intentifies because the reality is that is he get a pap penal the for that politically no and demicrats now the same thing because democrass er don set now republicans our busy being bat at their jobs bhat theyre doing it more often than democrats you seen clownish behvior band democrats for sure y got more on jemall bowman pulling a fire alarm and then pretending he did not know that a fire alarm was a fire alarm and he thought that it open doors everytime yeu opens his fridgehe thinks he is open h he thinks he starting his shower or something he is a clown i got aose who makes a living out of being a clownd got actual terror supporters in congress and then he just have sorte the regular clownish behavior of members of congress i got to say why would you trust these people with more power in anyway shipper but republicans because they are bad a governing right nown because the calkass is fractious they have decided best thing to do is to hit each other su apparently yesterday there was a a bit of a throw down between ceven mac carthy the expeetger of the house from california and representof tim birchett of it tennessee and pe ar con gressional correspondent cloudy out rasallis first reported the en counter on ax saying it happened when she spoke with birchat after the jeo

yore gat and then they pulled each other's hair and called each other and then kema carthe said tod to birchet i'm rubber in your glue whatever bounce is off of me sticks back to you and then birchit wen toa jiant bowlder and painted a tunnel on it in the hopes that cevmac carthy woeuld run directly into the giant bowlder but cev mc carthy escaped bi going into the tunnel and berchar trye to follow him but then he actually hit the giant boulder that is that is what it is apparently happening the halls of tommas but do not worry the clown show was into over then matgates who is the best

the story was not over the clown sho had to continue and what would a clown show in congress bee without matgates yehat at tu he bust through the wall the coolate man with his giant hair and his big teethin h's a yea a he is ready to go the sa but i what i love most about macgates seriously is that his deep and abiding hatred of ceaven mc carthy is extraordinary it is unbelievable he is did some one say he is a thousand miles away an's thek tebat signal goes oup ceme mc carthy's in the news is i some one is that is the undersjaker's music he li runs right there she glis do this thing macgates

you think about burneystanders ive huge promps of burnes anders there is in fact each generation maybe it is just o curring me now maybe the reason we keep electing old politicians is because every one who is between the ages apparently in congress ofe thirty and sixty is each hild ere there acting children maybe that is the reason where uk a find that guies not functional and he is superold but at the same time at least he is not threatening fist fights i at least at least he is not engaging in road runner cartoons here a we are such an unserious country because we have bread in entire generation of people whare fundamentally unserious about their shobs and the people ones up with the actual deal making power and up being the old men in the back room as it always was now used to be

yesterday the sendant voted along party lines to table emotionso proceed on a house past bill according to the hill ther' provide that fourteen point three billion dollars an emergency aiht to israel to your member jo bidan asse for a hundred and five billyian dollar foreign a package some of it ith sixty billiong with anoter you crane fourteen boint three was goingto go to israel seven bill was can to go to ti wane thirs me some border funding in all the rest and your bin want ef that all its tied up withthe prettybo and turns out house republicans not hot on the u crenade i we nont we don' sey an all framp there we do not know what exactly you'r planning to do those battlelines really stagnant what is the engoll there now that is not the same thing as the war that is currently ragi against comemoss israel has military superiority then you rearmament in order to finish that job and they will finish that job if given the rearmament if given more rearmament you crane somont con no push russia out of don bastrocremeus it is a different situation on the ground look a the house pass a bill that fun ded the aid to israel and they included in there a rider that would cut the ires is budger the soi will take the money out of the ires is butget and whenstead will give that money to forn aid to israel th midal ofthe war and the democrats voted unanimously to table that from the democrat prerspe gaga was a poison pill we need or as funding but from a re publican perspective the question is you are ires funnin is important they are not willing to pass a bill in the iddle of a war to aid israel in its fight against terism president biden had also threaten to veto the housebill mout in reality there will end up being a deal that it is cut hure but it is evidence have a sort of the prioritization thae democrats have i think the next step here for my johnson is gig to be put to pass a clean israel funding bill without the ires cots and then watch is the democrats tried o veu no that becase at that points ik ogat you have no excuses that when you cave inclaim that the rider is the rel issue and the senate operates the senate operates and pre tending otherwise don' change the fact on the ground or can meanwhile everybody in the democratic party has severe hartburn over jobiden long piece over at politico called sere 's how bidon can turn it arounenge top democrats agreed the presient needs more aggressiveness more help from his friends in a few more friends and their calling on leades chani ad mit romny to help ye a good luck on that one not n frms them helping but in terms of om anyone listening to them this entire piece is just about the hartburn that democrats have over over bidon and what he can do to fix this thing they say that basiclly he neens to show more life enough of the bravadoin and nialism his ads are under no illusion about their challenge even some of his most omitted loyalist told me he needs to make changes yet the president often displayes his resentments and ways that do nothing to move public opinion and only delay needed adjustments some of this younger ads mimic his snark shaming or ignoring toe sentesn't make it go away and now that you have jolstein is greenparty candidate in jomansion new newly teasing his presidential run it is possible that jobidon could easily lose and one of the one of the recommendations hiere is that jobidn should appoint more people in positions of hih power tohelp share the burden that he needs to move my donalon whois his a alter ego over to the campaign they need to move the white house to warfooting he should bring back ron clane who did in amazing job of course now that these arall the recommendations but the realities the jobin's policies are failing because they are failing and part of that failure is going to be his meeting with jesian pang this week gejampang is coming to california san francisco has cleaned up apparently all it took to actually help the citizens of san francisico is for the chinese president to arrive they clean apba the homeless on the streets they took the they took the open needles off the streets the poop off the streets again all that took was the chinese dictator coming in what exactly's on the adjenda between between jobidon and gesiampaign well theyre very few expectations for major break throus g is actio coming in week right now if you were going to exact concessions from the chinese now to be the time to do it g actually has a very week economy on his hand is waster journal points out they say on the eve virtual meeting with president bidon at a asia pacific summit last fall ge was formerly formerly in shrying to chensmost powerful leader in t generation but chinas economy is now beset by multiple challenges from a deflating property bubble an unmanageable local government dabts to slump in confidence in toe flation tust meanwhile recorded its strongest quarter in nearly two years and inflation is starting to subside that means the united states atually has leverage here what exactly should bidon move forble certainly he should move for ge to calm down on his military anticts in the south china see certainly he should push for g to open the books on say covin nineteen is biding in to do any that na of course not he is gin o do climate change jobidon is trying to assure sesian pang do not worry gus we are it we are not we are not trying to de couple from you im mean i'm sure im personal level joby does not wanto te couple from china since again he was the big guy who as probably receiving chinese money while he was in the vice presidency and postvice presidency ere of his career here is jobinting do not worry do not wordy we we want what we really want is to is to continue to be handin glove with the chinese anu what por o tefinea re ye back ount e normal course corresponden being able o pick up afond talk to one another crisis ben able to make sure are no ters to a contacro wecannot tak s i toldyou we we are not ting to decoupl from china o werse we were crying to do e change of relationsion for the better fom my prospector if in fact the chinish people are in trouble rigt no conomic i theeverytomoner e homon ever sisin china thebll have a decen pagob e pifisam in menefic ous nay well we ill see what sort of concessions bidn makes to g to i've confidence that bidin is not can to get rolled whi woul o have possible confidence in that considering how many times he has been rolled in the past on bagingso jandihe is trying to relieve bands on manufacturing of sophisticate a macrothips on behalf of th chinese government they also want the american government to stop helping out ti wants democra democracy progressive party which oppose is the the closer ties with china he want he antsbase lev he united states sell undercut all of that also she is goin continue to pitch american business people on the idea o the china is a place of opportunity but again the united states has a lot of leverett here an the united states should be pushing for more dmilitarization more signals of conciliation from g ganpan that is what bidon should be pushing for is he goig to be doing that i i have serious serious doubts ardy an just one second will get the latest on the twenty twenty four election plus ethesist peter singer has some weird

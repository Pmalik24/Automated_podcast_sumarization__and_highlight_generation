well this week amidst all of the domestic political hub up here in the united states the world economic form is halfening over at davas now why exactly is the world economic forum important with a vdo facts vo over ou to busiould check out for all the background an the u e f but the short story is this in nineteen seventy one there was a organization that was established by a ginam claus shob who is a german engineer economist and professor with a jmes bon villain accent he created this organizations that heads of business and heads of state could talk over what hee called stake holder capitalism stakehold ar capitalism with was a theory he was expressing that essentially suggested that if you owned a company you ought not to answer to your shareholders if you manage to company you ought not answer to prophet margian or shareholders instead you ought to answer two every stakeholder in the world meaning governments meaningpeople w did known stock in your company meaning every one now you might ask yourself well then exactly where you accountible to because it turns out that the randa who does known shares in your company cants actually fire u or sell your stock or change anything bout the way you run your company and the answer that classhaw would gibbis you are answerable to no one you as the head of a company should be a king with his own little kingdom you was that of a company you should be a lord and the company acts as your fieftem and you can pretend that your acting in the name of the general will but really what you are is some sort of profit from on high brought to spread your vales and this was the basis of stakeholder capitalism now this theory was promoted thea what was called the european managements in posium that is wit the e f was originally called in nineteen seventy one by nineteen seventy five this thing grew fast that eight hundred and sixty participants including the c eos and chairman of the largest european companies started showing up and that same year only four years after creation the e european management form the m f was now partnering with the united nations according to the w f website itself after five years the form had gained acceptants that the highest levels of business and government will not advocanting policyer strategy the form had become a respected organization that served as a valuable platform for business government civil society another stakeholders to confer and collaborate n nineteen even eighty seven the european management form changed its name from the e m f to the w e f what is the w e f to day well it is the same thing except bigger much more prominent ten thousand people show up at the w f every year buthe people whor on stage the people who are meeting in the backrooms are all of the global influential people your ame at the heads of major corporations and the heads of government and they all come to pat each other on the back and explore what they have in common what they have in common is a very peculiar set of values that you do not share with them to set of values that suggests that they are responsible for solving all f the worlds problems what are those world problems well problems war and piece they should collude and decide what system prevails everywhere problems intolerance they should collude and decide what in formation you are capable of seeing and under standing problems the climates they will get together and theyw'll restructure entire suathes of the loval economy in order to fight back against climate change this is what they do and let us face it this a weird group people because the people at the top levels of power particularly in the west are a strange group of people they are just proportionately secular they are just proportionately of the political left theyr people who do not have tides to traditional ways of life and traditional values they are also people who seem to have scorn for the culture that actually bore them and instead have embrace this peculiar notion a multi culturalism in which all cultures are created equal and that leades to this really sort of paternalistic and ob look at the w for people are walking in wearing five thousand dollar suits and twenty thousand dollar watches and then they are paying homage to poor native americans or natives of europe orever who are showing up in breathing on them ill get to more on this in just one second first af you are ma there is not a day that goes by they do not call or tect some one you care about i man't tok t my family every dow do

bizare spectacle of a native women of some sort with her face painted breathing on the heads a various company owners heads of state top level burocraft tpures what a look it is weird aala aa wawy why thoht i what hi jike od is lace nees underhead ni thought they all hated covi bet apparently they love covit but again this sall part of the show theyk hare about all of the stakeholders from the most remote natives to you ve people and these ckan of ban knock offs except in the corpric garb they have come with all sorts of interesting in weare ways to restructure the global system in order to run the thing in order to control you this is presumably why the and the world health organization were talking a lot over the course of this week about something they call disease acts now must be frank about this obviously every government has to have some sort of contingency plan in case the country ots it by an epidemic and localities have such emergency plans but the w ho boched covenineteen damned badly that the notion they have any sord of leg to stana when they preache to the rest of the world about how exactly we should dueld the future pandemic it starts to look las as though they are tempting to creat a contingency plan and more their sort of wish casting something this into existence because they really loved the levels of control here was the head of the wtho tender us at honam gariisis who by the way basively works for the government of chinie as wel exploring jus to moment talking about disease acts in preparing the globe for disease acts after we starit o putting a a place holder wou know the first that came was tin that is is ex is is covit we have experience now aten weare preparing base on that experience a litlefusasment has been don by independent panes nd and and and expercts and based on the recommendation many e initiatives have we have what i started manynsiticts and then the other kin order to have better prepet and cuadess that dis is xs is the pandemc agriment the pandemi ugrymen can bring all the experience all the chalis that we have faced and all the sorlusions ino on and that ugryment can help us to a prepare for the future in in a better wit that is right all the people who failed dramatically during covein nineteen who covered up for china and cho remember was a chinese cut out china was actively hiding information from the rest of the world they knew this pandemic al spreading since about november of twenty nineteen and they said nothing to the rest of the world thand they lige to the dw sho that it was not being transmitted human human and the w tho dutifully repeated all that because they wanted to keep china in the fold sponsering the world halth organization these saine people are still insisting that they ought to run things going for there is never any accountability becaus is the beauty of a stakeholder system as supposed we share holder system when you own a share in a corporation of the vote when you have a stake in something brodly speaking can means nothing youare now a stake in the w cho you are of a share in the ty tre got no control over the w co and that is what they w ave is really about by the way in exclusive from the wall street journal today who chinese researchers isolated and maps the virus that caused cove nineteen ind late december twenty nineteen at least two weeks before bation revealed the details of the debly virus to the world congressional investigator said raising questions anew about what china new in the pandemics cruchal early days documents obtain from the ust departmen of helth in human services by a house committee and reviewed by the wallstree jeurnal show a chinese researcher in bashin ap ploated a nearly complete sequence of the virus distructore to a us government run dan tobase december twenty eight whenty nineteen chinese officials at the time or sto publicly describing the dis easy outbreak in wuhan is a viral nebonia of unknown cause they still had not closed the onon it seeflud wholesale market sight of one of the initial cle in nineteen outbreaks and again china continue to life a full month that there was no dangerous human to human transmission the chinese researchr who submitted the viros sequency doctor lily ran of the dashin based institute pafage in by algy did not respons when ye mu seeking comment well you will never hear of her again since her name has now been publicly report in the prass in china is an authoritarian tyrannical government w tudge an amazing jop and naturally this means the we have to continued to include them in the world system all the people botched it last time we are going to keep them in control dis these acts is one methonology of control other methodologies of controlt climate change there is language the people in less love to use when they are talking about contrlling you and that is the language of war the war on poverty is about controlling income it is about controlling redistribution of wealth the war on climate change is similarly about controlling exactly how you live your life is why people in pox a constantly eager to use war language because in a war it is put your entire population on rations in a war yo guntro draft people and put them in barracks in a war get to take control of literally everybody an all times day and night is why gincarry is eager to talk about war he compares climate change to fighting hitler is over the w e f ad a'm here again to day because i'm convinced that the only way we win this battle is by stepping up expenentially from where we are to day and begin to treat this fight almost as if we were in war hate the war inalogis a cas we get tired of than thei provy over use the fortuntely it is a it is it

pretty much everything up to an including the demographic shape of the united states that is the only reason i can think why we continue to futs around over americas southern border welget to more on

pass h ar to h ar to is a strong on the border security bill from the house republicans instead therre proposing a series of changes they would remain extremely soft on illegal emigration speaker maght johnson to his credit is refusing to go ahead with any sort of compromise border bill along lines the democrates are looking for according to the newr times speaker might johnson on wenesday dug in against presidnt n bitn's efforts revive stalve legislation to send ad you crane saeing the re publican light house would not entertainin unless democrates agree to a far morse of yeur cracktown at the ust mexical border than the hav been willing to consider he said i told the present when i've ben saying for many months it ishai wou have must have change the border substance of policy change weu must insist the deborder be the top priority whell jobidon had summon the law makers in both parties to lecture them about u crane about the importance of repelling russias invasion but he refuse to actually commit to any serious changes at the border meanwhile some of the senate republicans are ready to cut any sort of deal apparently sent a republicans said they are hopefuls under mich micol of centucky whose fairily soft on emigration the senate could vote as soon as next week on a national security spending bill combining border measures with military assistens for ucrane and israel as well it seems to me that what is being proposed in the senate ise far too weak for republicans in the house two signon to leading set a republicans are saying thas to the best chance the geo pe has had n years to secure serious bord policy concessions from democrat but i really doubt that i think that jobidon is willing to cave more than he has thus far what exactlly is being proposed at this point whell something called the dignity act the called dignity act was originally brought up in twenty twenty three by represent maria of var asilus ar of florda minote delightful person but she is wrong on this bill and other costponcers including people veronica escabar democrat of texas and again this is a fairly weak emigration bill it incluses twenty five billion dollars for more bordrs securir barriers and tecnology and it does hiher and traine more personnel both regard to asylum reform it essentially says that there would be humanitarian campasses manage bi s b p along the southern border were migrants would be held asylum officers within conduct asylum interviews make final determinations on the campasses migrants ould have access to medical staff licen social workers mental health professional choltd advocates private organizations the provide humanitarian assistance and legal council under that bill within the first fifteen days the staff would provide in initial screening including criminal background checks by ometric data verifiidentification conduct medical assustments and migrans unable to establish a credible fered during i initial screening would be subjected to expredited removal from the united states then presumably asylum seekers would theoratically be held for another forty five days all those un clear to me whether the woul ten be released into the united states because otherwise things are distcn continued to swell at the border obviously one of ther promems here is had u establish credible fear what exactlly tis credible fear look from a migration official with the staff of these humanitarian campasses according t the bill within forty five days of passing the initial credible fear interview a trained you a citizenship an emigration services asylum officer would a view the individuals asylum clamant make a final determination asylum officers must deny approve or afer a complex or uncertain cases to an emigration judge basicly you would end up with the same sort of backlogue they ucurrently have for those who are referred to an emigration judge the bild then creator sistem by which asylum seekers would receive a notice to appear and then be released from the humanitarian campas this would continue to maintain catchin release wold just do in a more delayed fashio n then is currently being apply this is the reason why re publicans in the house are not willing to go forward with this it also creates worker status for legal imigrans hare already here in the country it is a very very soft bill which is precisely of course whe re publicans are saying an keeps the borde open to the question his why do not demicrastus cave shere is moun they juscapef oren't they give republicans more of what they want get some sort of actual border compromise done in te bill they go back to their basin sillizen we needed the ou crane funding we needed it and we had to cave and ten they could go to moderates untay we ashe did something to stop the flow at the boarder instead they keep doubling down on open borders rederic and then theyre blamin republicans for conk on not wanting to fix imigration that tog gink an ahun jo bidin is onewho broke the emigration system beyond all repair here is commala herristhy in tomp an advice presidents of the united states blaming republicans for failures on emigration everyone os ar emigratious itbro re ap the first bill that we trop the first bill that we offer right after an oncration what te fic femigration titem bu comprehenss if plan to fill wit themigration t te the they have they have taken it up no we want fpolutia the politions are at hand but frankly werin a election er and the folks who wan a return onal fron to the white house wit prefer to talk about a broken emigration the thea thet o foka thing on the filis o thetter at hand and engage ae in by part thouit but the solutions the want are in open border again they keep saying things thif we need more processing in the border what they really mean is they want you allow more people to use the asylum system to get into the country untill you change the actual rules with re gard to who is judicated eligible for asylum nothing is actually going to change weet t more on this in just one second first if you are looking to treat yourself this yeare you deserve nothing but the bost i'm

to right now o may be sure that we take care of our border is not to complicated it is not it is not if people come together in good fate as they have been doing in the senate we can get this time we can get tes not and let us not forget the presdent actually put forth a comprehensive emigration proposal almost three years ago very almost three years ago we have three years three years to work on something if that was what the spicker tonton is concern about we ha three years to work on it i mean and it was a terrible proposal you had three years to do something and yet did not do it and the reason you did not do it is becaus itay terrible proposal now whyse that happening why is that happening the answer is a back te d u ave there is in fact in a genda to do away with americas somthenborder and some democrate to morae clear about this than others for example democratic representative mas frost who is a florda he says that if you want a char too which they way of solitifying the border changing the rules with regard to asylum for example whyl you really want to do destroy the statue of liberty is my favorite stupid retoric is this is this notion of the statue of liberty is somehow coincident with the constitution of the united states it has some poetry on it and that is it it does not dictate the policy of the united states being an open emigration policy it is absurd here is this democratic congress person saying the qui part ou loud my collegues on the other side of the isle let us be on us with emigrants who deserve better than what you are offering them do not welcome emigrants if you plant to reject them if you keep pushing youre bigated h ar to bill than also pass this bill i've taken the liberty of drafting it for you it removes the statue of liberty are larges symbole that tells people the come here this is who you are removing the fabric of america i woldn't know which republican whos supports and voted for h are too we will introduce this bill the own people tearing down statues by the way ragt now our demograph that is absurd alexanero coto cortez she of the reeping at the border over child uperations but only one trump its president sheis also saying inquied pied a loud which as they do want the open boarders they want those open boarers they want abad virtually every single member of this committee is here to day as a result of and thanks to more open youass emigration policies and the idea of flamming the doore when we desperately meed these migrants when we desperately need it and what we need is an orderly process we want it is not that we do not meed or want folks to come it is that we octuall have to make it easier for these individuals to participate in our economy get a job support themselves and live the american dream and what this what this conversation is about is about defending the american dream the american dream presumably is that there be no border whatsoever now again countries can have open emigration policies long as there economies are not giant welfare economies l ong as there is the courage of your conviction with regold with regard to assimilation ins your culture you can have open borders under the circumstances that was in fact a policy of the united states in the leight ninet in late nineteenth century that sort of thing was part of american policy and did not destroy the country but once yo had a welfare state it changes all the mouth pretty dramatically and not only that once you an ons that a multicultural notion that people do not have to learn english but they do not actually have to learn american customs in ways of life then of course the social fabric of the country is going to fray but ailshe does not care abant any that she is perfectly happy to see the social fabric of the country frade because she agrees with the base of premisies of many of the people the you have to top down administrate of control over nearly every area of life is better for you and that borders are prorochial borders are wrong of course that the world economic form not the national economic for him now there is still some democrats or soon to be former democrats who who acknowledge the reality about this jomansion is one of them the senator from west virginia he says well of course the border is worse under by neverybody knows that a what of the leaders of the present's reelection committee colao red bare yesterday as said jo budo tup to nothing at the border and the borders better under jo by do you think that is a correct assasment that is absolutely false there living in lawlawland it is a disaster and they know it is to disaster let us fixit and anything i would implore the present to do to consider this and to do it immediately if congress can not come together because th perfect could be the enamy the good you have republicans that might want to shut everything down thoug a border a thoug a any type of emigration out the out the winda and you have rea democrats who ight think everything's far it is not fineness o disaster it is dangerous and i would impore the present to declare national murgency and secure our border immediately if congress cannot do something this week by the way itis worth noting here that emigration is a topis you for bult democrat and republicans in the upcoming alection which is just another reason why donal trump is running durably against a jomine despite all of his legal troubles foibles and myriad accesses speaking of which there is a brand new pole out of it new hampshire this is not a see plustrated american research scruple this pole is from the saine ansilum pole of likely voters and finds the donal trump colonelly has a fourteen point lead on nicky haily in new hampshire he is at fifty two per cent ic ye hailyat thirty eight per cent in rondo santis at six per cent as i've suggested i think that trum has momentom i think effectively speaking just based on the data the race for the geopenomination is over ma democrats have no stratety of course to dealidon from other than simply targoning him as the human being this of course is comela harris's plan hure she as yesterday suggesting that she is scared astack she is running against the crazies of corstonal trump what could happen of trop ave a becam got forbid present an agan tand what are you going to do to stop the crazies i ave cared at ic ow its is wim tat there i ta o thers an oll fang that ther arely two ate to rat for office gethe without in upon it are scared on all of the plin fat we should all be cared o but as we knoand torly this is a that table very powerful women man we do not run away fom something al we scan we figt bact te can as yer this is what we cauht a little bit of strand treagt here with the bouncing of th shoulders that is when that is when that she is bout to lay one on a real thick what is ilarious about all this of is of course if the entire pitch against trum is leva are in competent socide and fokis in on the fact that donald trump is a big bad mean orange man that is not going to work jamy diamond again jamy diamond is not remotely irradical republican the jp morgan yell he was asked yesterday about jobin's campaign chans lik joines in a lot of trouble and demonizing mag republicans is not going to help him and and i think people shoul be a little more respectful bour fellow citizens and when you gots hav people a pair shows jus bewad not likelyt to bynary thing your supointrup not sport o why you short to hate seventy five toughy of your fellow berickers it u i agreet the c any o the democrats to don a pretty good job with the deplorables le ogginots ther bybles in ther beer in their guns i mean really i could creet to stop that stuff for that should grow up and treat othe people respect te listen to a l but the and i do think the cotmy will effect i think this this negat of talk about wago is going to hurt bines a let aands a from jamy diamond jimmy domon is not some sort of wild ritland he is bringing you cream pin on the err wile he is talking with hem as en b c talking about all this now democrats are banking again on donald trumps legal foibles to drag him down they are looking it polling the plling from ipsos yesterday that pulling found that if donal trump werent convicted of a fellony crime by a jury an that mike ding him in the poles according t this poll sifty nine per cent of american say they would not vote for donal trump f youare convicted of a fellony crime at by a jury is supposed to twenty five per cent who said that they would a majority republicans said they vote for trump fifty two to thirty one even if he were onvicted of a fellony crime democrats of pourse split eighty six eight agains but there is no shock tor split eighty six indians from generally independents are t one really shift sixty six percent say they would not vo for nowel trump if convicted of a feneral crime if he is currently in prison even thirty nine per cents of republicans say where nt convote for him if he is currently in prison sixty two percents of americans over all thy would not v for none trump if he is in prison of the chance of him actually being in prison by the time we gets the election i think are incredibly low very very low based on appeals base on the the length of time it takes to actually do a trial i also think it isome these poll numbers about being convicted of a fellony crime by a jury engmost americans do not even know what he is being charged with they did that he gets convicted of fellin y miss handling of classified documents and that a bunch f inapens li void i will not over thack i any more i i just on i do not see that as being a a real huge concern for the trump campaign particularly because there are lot of obstacles that are coming down the pike for these various legal cases four example as politica points out there is a case called joseph fishere verses united states which the supreme court has agreed to hear in december it does not explicitly mentions on a trumpet at cuuld knock out a bunch of the january sixth charges against trump at issue in that case is whether prosecutors and the partet of justice have been improperly using a two thousand to law originally aimed at curbing financial crimes to prosecutead january sixth defendent in joseph fishur should the courtside with fisher would call in to question the use of the same law against other january sixth defendents including trump smith's indictment against trump again carries four charges for counts two of those are for obstruction of an official proceeding and for conspiracy to do but that is all under sar ban sarbans oxly the sarbane's oxley act was originally designed to make it criminal to obstruct official proceedings of ouus gup government in financial scandals not with regard to for example the counting of the vote t of course donal trump taking legal means filing lawsuits or calling people on the phone and saying if you could theoretically get certified as an alternative state elector for your state would you go and talk about bad and washingtonly first of all the crime may not be crime secondof all the crime in this particular case may be completely in the wrong catigory and the suprime court could easily say sarbane's oxley was never ment to apply to donal trumps january sixth activities as politico says the impactive fisher on the january sixth trial against trump may not be known until after the supreme courtraps up its turmin june at which when could knock out half of smith's counts against trump meanwhile the other case is there that are currently in play for example the alvan brag case manhattan that case is a joke that caseis a joke thing about this way donal trump wright now is running an incredibly durable even campaign against jobit right now he is up in many of the poles he is in the middle of his second defamation trial of eaging carol and he is yelling at the judge mean literally yelling at the judge and no one cares literally yesterday there isna't exchange between trump and e judgen in louis caplin in which the judge said mister trump has the right to be present here but that right can be forfeited mister trump i hope i do not have to consider excluding you from the trial and trump shotback i would leve it and caplin said i know you would i know you would you just cannot control yourself in the circumstances apparently it is a lari and knoons can care about that his here is the no how is that can hert trump has i get the answer is it is not because everything is baked into e esiet vor will every single thing is baked into the cake except for the circumstances of the united states and that is not a nol trumps control that is i't jobidance control and increasingly it is looking very bad welgets more on that just one second particularly s n economic news first mayhave noticed wethe ayware we biology because there are only two sexes and that is obvious should be omeas to everyone but some of our loyal customers point down a flaw in our germy's shop weonly cated to one of the sexes jermy's razors is all about equal opportunity to shop that woke free economy that is what we have jermy's razors for women because women deserve the same quality woke free blades as men two saxes two razors it really is that simple when god makes a new sects then i guess el have to make a new razor blus we have a line of personal carproducts for a better haves in putting moisturizsing shave craneet lotion body washing toy oter ant ladies hat anover to germy's razors not comrade now get your rase ar in perconal can products to day o can meanwhile i speaking of jobidons economy story out from walstr jornal to day and points out that we have a bunge of economic trains coming down those tracts n we are tied to those tracks wy now it is not thin be grat an jobidon is a very very bad dougly do right according to the walster journal the troupling commercial real estate market is bracing for a record amount of maturing loans boosting the prospect of a surgein defaults as property owners are forced to refine asc at higher rates in twenty twenty three five hundred forty one billion dollars in dat back by office buildings hotels apartments and other types of commercial real estate came du that is the highest mount ever for a single year according to date up for trap commercials that maturities are expected to continue rising with more than two poiny two triliand coming due between now and the end of twenty twenty seven most those loans have fare been repaid or extending in twenty twenty twen twenty twenty three many owners were able to exercise one or to your extensions builds into their original loans but those extensions are now burning off theyre coming to that means many bowwers have to confront that higher rate environment and that is tepressing property vallues what happens when a bunch of for closers happen because people cannot afford the higher commercial lending rates what happens then wel means some people can get laid off an means that in flated real estate prices are going two come down because again jobide's economy was always inflated and what goes up must come down and of course the problems are mounting for jobidon pretty much everywhere they are mounting with regard tou

according to a man named david at tahar his son osa a kid named a deer tahar his son was i believe nineteen years old and he was murred on october seventh and then he was beheaded and apparently they then took his head back to gaza and tried to sell it i deares father said i demanded to see the body they warn me against it but as a father i need to know every detail about my child's deafh half an

palistinian is raily pieces jost over the horizand it is gong to happen any time now and probably that will make te ronians calm down again anything can happen in any time as a very good slogan as it turns out for these twentye twenty four bidin campaign because it feels anything can happen at any time meanwhile the supreme court is about to make a very critical decision that willin fact shift an enormous amount to power back to the legislature this a really big story that is going largely under the rat ar becas a little complicated according to the washington post a divided secreme court tobated weather and how to crtail the power of federal agencies on wednesday with liberals urging the court to efer to the judghment of governme experts and conservative saying judges should not systematically favor goverment regulators over private companies industry or individuals in litigation after more than three hours of argument it was unclear whetherthe courts concervative majority would overturn or simplly scale back the forty year old precedent that is under ra view in a pair of cases brought by herring fishermen from new jersey and rode island very often the circumstances surroundsing very important cases are really really small and peculiar basically there is a federal rule requiring commercial fishermen to pay for atsy moniters the court decision however is not really about that it is about weather federal regulatory agencies are capable of regulating huge swaths of american life or whether it turns out those regulations have to stand up to constitutional scrutiny conservatives have been targeting a framework that was set up in nineteen aty for ut under a case called chevron yu usavers is natiural resources defense council that case sat up somethng called chevron a deference which suggested that if the congress pass the law and the law was pecific enough that basically regulatory agencies could then use their expert es to read the tea leaves they could sit there in roarshock test this thing and come up with giant books filled with regulation based on the vaguea language of statue and then presuemetly the courts woul have nothing to say about it because if congress really wanted to do anythng about it they could pass a new regulation taking that power away from regulartory agencies but they had not to therefore basically the the the courts could not sit in judgment on anything tese regulatory agencies we are doing that of course is ridiculous that creates of truly perverse and cent ive structure or congress these members are elected they pass much o vague laws there never held the countable becaue if something goes wrong it is not happening because of them ans happening because of te regulators regulators get to do whatever they want there is huge amounts of industry capture in the regulatory agencies if you are a regulatory agency and you are overseeing for example laws with regard to the sea major industries are going to get into the wood work and they are going to start reading those laws for you that is have many regulations are written and again congressmen are perfectly happen to kick the can over t the regulatory agencies it is up to the juditiary to maintain the balance of power the checks and balces that were set up in the constitution which is wy chevron deference should die on wednesday justices bret cavena and nel gorsage both nominies of present and trump took turns pepering the bidi administration with skeptical questions as solicitor general elizabeth prolonger defended the trump administrationt initiative and alongstanding sheverun precedent caveno said chevron has allowed federal agencies to flip flop an ippose different rules every time an new administration takes over leaving judges with little choice but to defer to the changing interpretations of agency officials which of courseis very weird because if regulatory agencies can take positions that are directly opposed to one another and congress supposedly authorized both those positions ot the same time how could that possibly be how could that be gorsice has called long ago for getting rid of chevron deferences of course democrats are very much in favor of it because they believe in a burocratic and minis strative sentralized government were elections do not matter much in the legisl ator ranch where everything can be done by a powerful executive ranch this a model of government first push by wodro wilson in the early twentieth century the notion of a burocratic administrative government of experts whoould administer the government on your behalf four the people looks very much that w f globalist centralized power idea except applied to the american government it will be interesting to see which way chief justice robbers and justice amiconibarat go on this one it is possible that what they do as they say we do not how this particular regulation is being pervade it is also possible tho get rid of chavrins deference entirely they should hif youl get rid of chavrins deference entirely the notion tat get regulatory agencies ought to be unanswerable entirely when it comes to ver interpretations of statue by the judiciary hands weigh too much power to the executive branch ov government a restoration by the ay of checks and balances in government where the legislature legislates and the executove ranch executes and the judiciary a judicates that would be the single best thing that could happen in the united states to restore any level of credibility in our government is right now we think congress is in competent cause they do not even do the legislating they pass giant omnibus packages and then we think the executive grabs too much power and thus is in competent because theyave too much power over our lives and we did not let tay anthony fouchy whose the burocratic administrator and then we think the judiciary just sits there and does nothing about any of this when the various branches of government do what they were supposed to do in the first place they reestablish their credibility that is why i would be excellent if the supreme court did get rid of chavron deference are not y coming up e oing to jump into that vaunted benshir purosho mailbag if yofre not a member become a member used coachpuro check out for too much for an all anuel plans

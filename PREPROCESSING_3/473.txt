welcome to the huberman la podcas a science science pace to e i'm indrew hubermen and i'm my professor of nerobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducin doctor lecs freedmen as our guest on the huberman lad podcast doctor freedmen is a researchort an mitee specializing in machine learning artificial intelligence and human robot interactions i must say that the conversation with lecs was without question one of the most fascinating conversations that i have ever had not just in my career but in my lifetime i knew that lecks worked on these topics and i think many of you are probably familiar with lecs and his interest in these topics from his incredible podcast the lecs freedmen podcast you are not already watching that podcast pleese subscribe to it is absolutely fancastic but in holding this conversation with lecs i realized something far more important he reveal to us a bit of his dream his dream about humans and robots about humans and machins and about how those interactions can change the way that we perceive ourselves and that we interact with the world we discuss relationships of all kinds relationships with animals relationships with friends relationships with family and romantic relationships and we discuss relationships with machines machines that move and machines that do not move and machines that come to understand us in ways that we could never understand for ourselves and how those machines can educate us about ourselves before this conversation i had no concept of the ways in which machines could inform me or any one about themselves by the end i was absolutely taken with the idea and i'm still taken with the idea that interactions with machines of a very particular kind a kind that lecs understands and wants to bring to the world can not only transform the selth but may very well transform humanity whether or not your familiar with doctor lecs freedmen or not i'm certain you are going to learn a tremendous amount from him during the course of our discussion and that it will transform the way you think about yourself and about the world before we begin i want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that thene i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there eason i started taking athletic greens and threasen i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which are vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gup microbiom and the ways and w hich the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbio if you to try atletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubermen and claim a special offer they'l give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if we are getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient invitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athleti green stock alm slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfre travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an elements and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar av talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodia magnesium an potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatios of electrolites if you to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok calm slash hubermen nd you will get a free element sample pack wih your purchasts thei're all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dok clm slash hubermen and now my conversation with doctor lecks freedmen we meet again we meet again thank much for sitting down with me i have a question that i think is on a lot of people's minds or ought to be on a lot of people's minds because we hear these terms a lot these days but i think most people including most scientists and including me do not know really what is artificial intelligence and how is it different from things machine learning and robodics if you would be kind as to explain to us what is artificial intelligence and what is machine learnin well i think that question is as complicated and as fascinating as the question of what is intelligence i think of artificial intelligence first as a big philosophical thing ppamamocortic said he a ay was e a y was the ancient wish to forge to gods or is born as the ancient wish to forge tho gods i think at the big philosophical level it is or longing to create other intelligent systems perhaps systems more powerful than us at the more narrow level i think it is also a set of tools thet a computational mathematical tools to autimate different tasks and then also it is our attempt to understand our own mind build systems that exhibits some intelligent behavior in order to understand what is intelligence in our own selves all those things are true of course what a ay really means as a community as a sut of researchers and enginears it is a set of tools a set of a computational techniques that allow you to solve various problems the there is a long history that te approaches the problem from different perspectives what is a always been throughout one of the threads one of the communities goes under the flag of machine learning which is emphasizing in the a ay space the the task of learning how do you make a machine that knows very little in the beginning fallo some kind of process and learns to become better and better in a particular task what is been most a very effective in the recent about fifteen years is a suc of techniques that fall under the flag of deep learning they utilized nearal nutworks when yourl nutworks are at these a fascinating things inspired by the structure of the human brain a very loosely but they have a it is a nutwork of these little basic competition in units called nurons artificial nurons and they have e these architectures havein imput and output they know nothing in the beginning in their task with learning something interesting what that something intresting is usually involves a particular task the there is lot of ways to talk about this and break this down one of them is how much human supervision is required to teach this thing supervize learning this broad category is a the thenoural nutwork knows nothing in the beginning and then it is given a bunch of examples of e incomputivision that would be examples of cads dogs cars traffic signs and then you given the image and you given the ground truth of what is in that image and when you get a large data base of such image examples where the truth the a thenoural nutwork is able to learn by example as called supervised learning the quest there is a lot of fasten any questions within that which is how do you provide the truth when you given an image of a cat how do you provide to the computer that this image contains a cat do you just say the entire imageis a picture of a cat do you do what is very commonly been done which is a bounding box you have a very crude box around the cat's face saying this is a cat do you do symmntic sagmentation mind you this is a twody image of a cat it is not a the computer knows nothing about our three dimentional world is just looking at a set of pixles a symmentic sagmentation is drawing an nice very crisp outline around the cat and saying that is a cat that really difficult toupervide that truth and the one of the fundamental open questions in computi vision is is that even a good representation of the truth now there is another contrasting sed of ideas their attention there overlapping is a what is use to be called unsupervised learning what is commonly now called self supervised learning which is trying to get less and less and less human supervision into the into a into the cask self supervised learning is a more is been very successful in the domain of ou language model natural language processing and now more or morse being successful in computeo vision task and what is the idea there is let the machine without any ground truth anitation just look at pictures on the intrinete or look at text on the intrinete and try to learn something a general lizable about the ideas that are at the core of language or at the core of vision and based on that we humans at it is best to call that common sense with is who have this giant base of knowledge on top of which we builds more sophisticated knowledge whet of this kind of common sense knowledge and the idea of self supervised learning is to build this common sense knowledge about what are the fundamental visual ideas that make up a cat and a dog and all those kinds of things without ever having human supervision the te dream there is the yous you just let an a i system that is a self supervised run around the intinete for a while watch ou to vidios for millions and millions of ours and without any supervision be crimed and ready to actually learn with very few examples once the human is able to show up twe think of a children in this way human children is your parents only give one or two examples to teach a concept the the dream of self supervised learning is that would be the same with with o machines that they would o watch millions of hours of a eu to vidios and then come to a human and be able to understand when the human shows them this is a cat ha remember this ta cat they will understand that a cat is not just tha thing with pointo ears or a cat cat is a thing that is orange or its furry that they will see something more fundamental that we humans might not actully be able to interospect and understand l if i asked you what makes a cat or is a dog you would probably not be able to answer that but if i showed you brought t you a cat and a dog youould be able to tell the difference what are the ideas that your brain uses to make that difference that is the whole dream with self supervised learning is they would be able to learn that on its own that set of common sense knowledge that is able to tell the difference and then there is a lot of incredible uses of self supervise learning a very weirdly called self play mechanism that is the mechanism behind the a the reinforcement learning successess of a the systems that wantet ta go at a alphazero a that want a chest what oh i see that play games that play games dot it the idea of self play is probably applies a to other domays than just games is a system that just plays against itself and this is fascining in all kinds of domains but a it knows nothing in the beginning and the whole idea is it creates a much of mutations of itself and plays against those a versions of itself and the fascining thing is when you play gainst systems that are little bit better than you you start to get better yourself the learning that is how you learning happens that is true from marshal arstat tha true and a lot of cases where you want to be interacting with with the systems that are just a little better than you and then through this process of interacting with systems just a little better than you you start fallowing this process where everybody stas getting better and better and better and better until you are several orders an magnatyou better than the world champion in chest for example in this fascining consistit ave run away system one of the most terrifying and exciting things that a david silver the creator of alfolgone alpazero one of the leaders of the team said a to me is a they have not found the ceiling for alphazero meaning you could just arbitrarily keep improving not in the realm of chess that does not matter to us that is it just ran away with the game of chest gits slike just much better than humance but the question is what if you can create that in the realm that does have a a bigger deeper effect on human beings on societies ah that cound be a terrifying process to me is an exciting process if you supervise it correctly if you inject a if a what is called valual liment youla you make sure that the goals that the aiys alptimizing is alined with human beings an human societies there is a lot of fascining things the talk about within the specifics of neral now works and all all the proms ot people are are working on but i would say the really big exciting one is self supervised learning wh ere trying to get less unless human supervision a the less and less human susupervision of nearl networks an also just the comment and all shut up now please keep going o i'm learning i have questions but i'm learning wir please keep you that to me what is exciting is not the theory i's always the application one of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence specifically in you ill not worksome asshe learning is testle autopolet these are systems that are working in the real world this is not an ecadamic exercise this is human lives at stake this a safety critical a is my automated vehicles ot otoatornomist semyatonomis wit going to be we we have gone through wars on these topics emy aonomis the semyatime even though it is called the affes te full self driving it is curnenlly not fullyatonomos meaning human supervision is required human is tasked with overseeing the systems in fact liabilitywise the human is always responsible this is a human factor psychology question which is fascinating i'm fascinated by the the whole space which is e whole another space of human robad interaction when a i systems and humans work together to accomplished task that dance to me is a is one of the smaller communities but i think it will be one of the most important open problems once tursolved is how to humans in robads dance together to me semyaton as driving is one of those spaces for a for eelon for example he does not see it that way he sees of semyatonmas driving as a stepping stone tolways fullyatonomas driving humans and robats cannot dance well together humans a humans dance and robats and robas dance we need to this an engineering problem when he to design a perfect robat that salls is problem to me forever may be this not the case wor driving but the world is going to be full of problems where its always humans and robats have to interact because i think robats will always be flaud just humans are going to be flaud ar flaud and that is what makes beautiful that the're flaud that is wore learning happens at the edge of eur capabilities you always have to figure out how can floud robats in flod humans interact together such that they are the the som is bigger than the whole as upposed to focussing in just building the perfect roba the thats one or most exciting applications i would say of artificial intelligence to me is ta tonmas driving and semyatomas driving and that is a really good example of machine learning because those systems are constantly learning and te there is there is a process there that may be icon com went on the hoter capathy who is the head of autopolit calls it the data engine and tht this process applies for a lot of machine learning which is you build a system this pretty good at doing stuff you sending you send it out into the real world it' starts doing the stuff and then runs into what are called edge cases failure cases whereit screws up we do this as kids that you you have this is adult fe is is a dults exactly but we learn really quickly but the whole point d this is the fascinanthing about driving is you realize thereis millions of ede cases athere is just weird situations that you did not expect and the data engine processis you collect those edge cases and they go back to the drawing board and learn from them as you have to create this date a pipe line where all these cars hundreds of thousans af cars a are driving around and something weird happens and whenever this weird detect iv fires it is another important concept hat you that piece of data goes back a to the mother ship for the for the training for the retraining of the system and through this data engine process it keeps improving and getting better and better ad better and better sobasically you send out a pretty clever ai systems out into the world and let it find the edgecases let it crew up just enough to figure out where the ege cases are and then go back and learn from them and then send out that new version and keep up dating that version is the up dating done by humans the anitation is done by humans the yoave te the weird examples come back the edgecases and you have to label what actually happened in there there is also some mechanisms for automatic automatically labeling but mostly i think you always have to rely on humans to improve to understand what is happening in the weird weir cases and then there is a lot o debate ad thits the other thing what is artificial intelligence which is a bunch os smart people having very different opinions about what is intelligence a a is basely a commuty of people who do not agran anything it seems to be the case im and first of all this is a beautiful description of terms that i 've heard many times among my colleagues at stamford at meetings in t in the out side world and am there is many fascinating things i have many questione but i do on to ask one question about the culture of a a because it does seem to be a community where least is an outsider which seems there is very little consentus about what the terms an the operational definitions even mean om and thre seems to be a lot of splitting happening now if not just supervised and insur supervised learning but these sort of a intermediate o conditions where machines are autonomous but then go back for more instruction kids go home from college during the summer and get al oun a mom still feeds them than eventually they leave the the nest kind of thing om i is there something in particular about engineers were about people in this a realm of engineering that you think lends itself to disagreement yet i think a for sas the more specific you get the less disagreement there is there is a lot of disagreement about what is artificinal intelligence but there is less disagreement about what is machine learning and even less when you talk about act ive learning or machine teaching or a self superfized learning and then when you get in to and i'll be language models or transformers when you get into pecific ner network architectures there is less and less and less thisagreement about those terms you might be here in the disagreement from the high level terms and that has to do with the fact that engineering especially when youre talking about intelligent systems is is a a little bit of an art and a science the ard part is a is the thing that creates disagreements because then you start having thisagreements about th how easy or difficult to particular problems for example lot of people thisagreed with elon how difficult the problem of a tom's driving is and and but nobody knows theres a lot of disagreement about what are the limits of these techniques and through that the terminolodgy also contains within it the a tha disagreements but over all i think it is also young science that also has to do with that sa it is not just engineering it is that artificional telligence truly as a large skilled disipline where its thousands tens of thousands conjures of thousands people working on at huge amons of money being made thats a very recent thing would trying to figure out those terms and of course this egoes in personalities and a lot of fame to be made a the the term deep learning for example nerl networks have been around for many many decades sinc the sixties you can arguue since the forties there was a rebranding of nour networks into the word deep learning term deep learning that was part of the reinfigoration of the field but's really the same exact thing i did not know that a man ni grew up in the age of narrow science when narrl networks a were discuse a computational narow science and theoretical nor science they had their own journals t it was not actually taken terribly seriously by experimentalis until a few years ago i wut se about five to seventy years ago a excellent theoretical narrow scientists larryabbid and m other a i've colligs certainly it stamford as well thut people start paying attention to computational methods but these terms naral networks computational methods i actually did not know that narral neck were works in deep learning were a there was ave now become con of sononiccas they were always what now they 're always the same thing interest it was a lemmin nerro scientist and i did not know well because nou notwors probably means something else in your sience not somethin ng else but a little different flavor depending on the field and tht's fassaying to because nour science and a i people have started a working together in dancing a lot more a in the recent i'll say probably decade o machines are going into the brain am i i've a couple questions but one thing that i'm sort of fixated on that i find incredibly interesting is this example a you gave of playing a game with a mutated version of yourself as a competitor yi find that incredibly interesting as a kind of a parallel or a mirror for what happens when we try and learn as humans which is we generate repetitions of whatever it is we are trying to learn and we make errors occasionally we succeed im in a simple example for instance of trying to throw bull's eyes on a dartboard i man have errors errors errors almiss the dartboard and maybe occasionally hit a bulls i and i do not know exactly what i just did right but then let us say i was playing darts against diversion of myself were my i was wearing a visual prism my visual i had a visual defect you learn certain things in that mode as well you are saying that a machine can sort of mutate itself does the mutation always cause a deficiency that it needs to overcome because mutations and biology sometimes give us superpowers rihte occasionally you will get somebody who has better than twenty twenty vision and they can see better than ninety nine point nine present of people out there when you talk about a machine playing a game against a mutated version of itself is the mutation always at what we call a negative mutation or a a an adaptede or a maladapt of mutation no ye you do not know until you get ya smutate first an the figure out in they compete against each other you are evolving your the machine gets to evolve itself in real time yet and i i think of it which would be exciting you coulactlly do with humans it is not just usually you freeze aversion of the system really you take ana andrew of yesterday and you make ten clones of them and then may be you mutate may be not and then you do a bunch of competitions of the andrew of to day you fight to the death who wins lath si love that idea of creating a bunch of clones of myself from from each of the day for the past year and just seeing whois going to be better at pod casting or science or picking up checks at a bar ora adono or competing into getzsu that is one way to do it anding a lot of lexas would have to die for that process but that is the sensial what happens is in ring for some learning through the self play mechanisms it is the grave yard of systems that did not do that well and the the the surviving tthe the good ones survive do you think that a darwin's theory of evolution i might have worked in some sense in this way but at the population level i myu get a bunch of bird wo different shape beaks and some irds have the shape bek that allows them to get the seeds an is trivial trivially simple example of darwini an evolution but i think it it is it is corrective not a even though it is not exhaustive is that what you are referring to you essentialy that normally this is done between members of a different species lots of different members a species of different traits and some get selected for but you could actually create multiple versions of yourself with different traits with i shouldprobably have said this but a perhaps it is implied with machine learning of reinforcement learning through these processies one of the big requirements its to have an objective function a loss function a youtility function theres are all different terms for the same thing is there is a tik anyquation that says what is good and and then you'e trying to optimize that equation there is a clear goal for these systems li becauses it is a game what chaster's it there is a goal but for anything anything you want machine leaning to solve there needs to be an objective function i machine learning as you should call lost function that you are optimizing the interesting thing about evolution complicate of course but the goal also seems to be evolving it is a i guess adaptation to the environment is the goal but it is unclear you can convert that always it is a survival of the fittest it is on clear what the fittest is in machine learning the starting point and this is what human ingenuity provides is that fitness function of what is good what is bad which it it it let us which of the systems is going to win mean to have a equation that one of the fascining things about humans is we figure out objective functions for is were a it is the meaning of life why the hellor we here and a a machine currently has to have a hard coted statement about why you hast to have a meaning of yet artificial intelligence base life i it cannot ike there is a lot of interesting explorations about a that function being more about curiosity about learning you things and all that kind of stuff but it is still hard coted if you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff it has to be given very clear statements of what good at stuff means that is one of the challenges of artificial intelligence is you have to formalize tha in order to solve a prob youhave to formalize it and youhave to provide a both the full censory information youave to be very clear about what is the date of this being collected and you ave to also be clear about the objective function what is the goal that you are trying to reach and that is a very difficult thing for artificial intelligence i love the yimention curiosity o i i'm sure this definition fall short in many ways but i dofind curiosity as a a strong interest in knowing something but without an attachment to the outcome it is sort of a it is not it could be a random search but it there is not really an emotional attachment it is really just a desire to discover an unveil what is there without hoping it is a a gold coin under rock you are just looking under rocks is that more or less how the machiyou know within machine learning it sounds their elements of reward prediction and rewards the machine has to know when it is done the right thing it can you make machines that are curious or are the sorts of machines that you are describing curious by design yet a curiosity is the kind of a symptom not ta the go what what happens is a one of the big trade ofsan rean for some learning is this expiration verses exploitation when very little it pays off to explore a lot even suboptimal even trajectories that seem they are not going to lead anywhere that is called exploration the smarter an smartern smarter you get the the more emphasis you put on exploitation meaning you a take the best solution you take the best path now through that process the expiration can look curiosity by us humans but it is really just trying to get out of the local optim of the thing is to ready discovered it is it is from a i perspect iv it is always looking to optimize the objective function it it derise we could talk about the slot more but in terms of the tools of machine learning to day it derives no pleasure from just the curiosity of i do not know a discovery thatno dope men for it is no making me there is no reward system chemical or i guess electronic reward system that is ad if you look at machine learning literature and reinforcement learning literature that will use demying wel use terms dopenmin were constantly trying to use the human braing to inspired totally new solutions to these problems they will think howtest opening function in the human brain and how can that lead to more i interesting ways to discover a optimal solutions but ultimately currently the h there has to be a a formal objective function that you could argue the humans also has tha set of objective functions which trying to optimize whec jis not able to introspect them we dn't yet we do not actually know what we are looking for in seeking and doing wet least o felmenbaricy spoken with the ynistogram i hope better gt ro you yei hope you actually have her on the spock as a you terrific a she has a very a is it has to do with homeyou stay isay is it that abasically there is a very dom objective function that the brain is trying to ptimize to keep body temperature the shing there is a very dolem kind of optimization function happening and that what we humans do with our fancy consciousness and cognive abilities as we tell stories to ourselves can have nice podcasts but really is the brain trying to maintain a a just healthy state i guess that that is fascinating i i aut also see the human brain and and i hope artificial ntelligent systems as a not just systems that solve problems or optimizeago but all story tellers i think there is a power to telling stories we tell stories to each other that is what communication is when youare alone that is when you solve problems that that is when you make sense o talg about solving promise but when you are community the capability to communicate tell stories whole a share ideas in such a way that those ideas are stable over a long period o time that is that is being a carismatic story teller and i think both humans are very good at this arguably i would ow would argue that is why we are who we are is where great story tellers and then a i i hope will also become that it is not just about be able to solve probles with ha clear objective function it is thafterwards be able to tell a wa bu make up a way better story about why you did something or why you failed do you think that a robots or and or machines of of some sort are going to start telling human stories wel definitly the technical field for that is called explainable may i explainable artificial telligence is trying to figure out how you get the a i system to explain to us humans why the hellit failed or why it succeeded or a there is a lot o different sor oversions of this or to visualise how it understands the world that is a really difficult problem especially when your no works that are a famously opaque that they we do not understand in many cases why a particulin you or does what it does well and tha to try to figure out where it is going to fail that requires the a i to explain itself there is a huge amot o money a there is huge amotomony in this especially from government finding it on because human a deploy i a i systems in the real world we humans at least onet of that is get a question why the hll did you do that in a dark way why did you just kill that person rigt if a car ran over a person will not understand why that happen and no gan wor sometimes very unfair to a i systems because we humans can often not explain why very well but that is the field of a explainable ay i that is very people veryteted in because the more or more rely a i systems the the twido recommender system that a i i'll go them that is i would say impacting elections perhaps starting wars orelease military conflict that is that allgar them we wont to ask that allgar them first of all do what the hall youre doing do do you understand the society level affects your having it can you explain the possible othe trajectories we would have that condof conversation with the human we want to be able to do that with a nay i and an my own personal level i think it would be nice to talk to a i systems for stupid stuff robats when they fail to a why do you fall down the stairs yet but i'm not an engineering question but almost a endearing question i'm looking for if i fell and youre and i were hanging out i do not think you need an explanation exactly what were the dynamic what was the underactuated system problem here what what what was the texture of the floor or on or what was the o ont an out o you are thinking that or you might joke about your drunk again go home or something there could be humor in it that that is an opportunity story telling is not just explanation of what happened it is something that a makes people laugh makes people fall in love makes people dream and understand things in a way that poetry makes people understand things as supposed to a rigorous logue of where every censer was where every actuator was man i find this it incredible because one of the hall marks of severe outism spectr disorders is im a report of experience from the artistic person that is very much a catalogue of of action steps slike how do you feel to day and they will say whi got up and i did this and thad i did this and i did this and it is not at all the way that a a person with who does not havatism spectrum disorder would would respond and the way you describe these machines has much human ias much humanism or much of of a human and biological element but i realize that we are talking about machines i won to make sure that i understand if there is a distinction between a machine that learns a machine with artificial intelligence and a robot at what point doesm machine become a robot if i have a ball point pen i'm assuming i would not call that a robot but if my ball point pen im can come to me when it is on when i move to the opposite side of the table if it is moves by whatever mechanism at that point does it become a robot ook i there is a million ways to explore this question it is to fascinating one first ofall there is a question of what is life la cadi knows something is a living form ar not and it is similar to the question of one does sut ofa may be a cold computational system becomes a a wt were idy loading these words with a lot em joying robat and machine but one i think movement is is important but but that is the kind of a boring idea that a robat is just the machine that is able to act in the world one artificial intelligence could be both just the thinking thing which i think is what machine learning is and also the cting thing which is what we usually think about robats se robats are e things that have a perceptional system as able to take in the world however you defind the world is able to think and learn and do whatever how it does inside and then act on the world that is the differenceachine may be a i system or a machine an a robat it is something that is able a robat is something iat's able to perceive the world and act in the world could be through language or sound or con be through movement or both yet and i think it could also be in the digual space as long as there is e aspect of entity that is inside the machine and a world that is outside the machine and there is a sense an which the machine is sensing that world and acting in it it could for instance a there couldbe aversion of a robot according to you the definition tha i think you are providing where the robot a i where i go to sleep at night and this robat goes and forages for information that it thinks i want to see loaded on to my dustop in the morning there wis no movement of that machine there wis no language what essentially has movement in in cyprispice yet there is a distinction that i think is important in that there is e there is ae element of it being an entity whethere is an the digior the physical space when you have something alexa in your home most of the a speech recognition most of what alucts is doing is constant being send back to the mother ship the when elea is there on its own that is to me a robat when it is there interacting with the world when it is simply a finger of the main mother ship that is not then the lex is not a robat than it is just an interaction device that then may be the main amazon elexa a i big big system is the roba the that is important because there is some element to us humans i think where we want there to be an entity whether in the digi or the physical space that is where ideas of consciousness come in and o all those kinds of things that we project our understanding what it means to be a being and to take that further when does a machine become a robat i think there is a there is a special moment there is a special moment in a person's life and in a robot's life where it surprises you i think surprise is a really powerful thing were how the thing works and yet it surprises you athat that is a magical moment for us humans whether it is a chest playing program that does something that you have not seen before that makes people smile eah those moments happen with out pha zero for the first time in chest playing or grandmasters were really surprise by a move they did not understand the move and n they study and study and then they understood it but that moment of surprise that is for grandmasters an chesk i find that moment of surprise really powerful really magical and just every daylife because it supersedes the the human brain in that moment not ot not supersedes out performs but a surprises you tepositive sense li go did not i did not think you could do that i i did not think that you had that in you and a i think that moment is a big transition for a robot from from a moment of being a srvant that partic that accomplishes a particular task with some level of accuracy with some a rate o a failure to an entity a being that struggling just you are in this world and that that is a really important moment that i think a you nogan find many people in the accommey that talk i just did a i i'm not speaking some philosopher some hippy i'm speaking from purely engineering perspective i think it is really important for robats to become entities and explore that as a real engineering problem i suppose to a everybody treats robots in the robodest community they do not even callm or he or she thaton't give im try to avoid giving him names they have really want to see it a system a a a servant they see it as a servant at's trying to accomplish a task to me and do not think i'm just romantisizing the notion i think it is a being it is a currently perhaps a dumb being but in in a long ark of a history humans are pretty dumb beings to i would agree with that statementi i dend to really want to explore this a treating robots really as a as entities a the atnso ant the promorphisation which is the f the act of looking at the inanimate object and projecting on to it life features i think robotic generally sees that a as a as a negative i see it as a superpower i that we non to use that wwell i'm struck by how that really grabs on to the real lationship between human and machine or human an robot tus the simple question is and i think you have already told us the answer but does interacting with a robat change you does it in other words do do we develop relationships to robot ye i thi i definite i dontntly think i think a i think the moment you see a robat or a i systems as more than just servants but a antities they begin to changejust good friends do just a relationship just the other humans i think of for that you have trave certain aspects of that interaction lie the robat's ability to a say no to a to have its own sense of identity to have its own set of golds thit is not constantly serving you bics that trying to understand the world and a do that dance of understanding through communication with you si i deafinlly think there is a i mean have a lot of thoughts about this as you mean now i in thats at the corp of my lifelong dream actually of what i want to do which is i believe that most people have a notion of loneliness in them that we have not discovered that that we have not explored i should say and i see a i systems as helping us explore that that we can become better humans better people towards each other i think that connection between human and a i human and robat is is not only possible but a will help us understand ourselves in ways that are several orders of magnitude a deeper than we ever could have imagined i tend to believe that well i have a a very wild levels of a belief in terms of how impactful that would be thatis when i think about human relationships i i do not i'm always break them down into variables but we could explore a flca few of those variables and see how they map to human robot relationships a one is just time right if you spend zero time with another person at all in in cibre space or on the phown er in person you assenti have no relationship to them you spend a lot of time you have a relation it is obvious but i guess one variable would be time how much time you spend with the other entity roboter human the other would be am winds and successes you enjoy successes together i'll give a absolutely trivial example this in a moment but the other would be failures when you struggle with somebody whether not you struggle between one another you disagree i was really struck by the facth you said that robot saying no i've never thought about a robot saying no to me but there it is i looki look forward to you being one of the first o ess an this robot an do i there is there struggle you grow when you struggle with somebody you grow closer sometimes the struggles are imposed between those two people calld tromabonding they call it in the whole a psychology literature and ppsychology largere but in any case i coand imagine time successes together a struggle together and then just a peaceful time hanging out at home watching watching movies a waking up near one another a here we are breaking down they had o elements of relationships of any kine do you think that these elements apply to robout human relationships and if thand i could see how if the if the robot is its own entity and has some autonomy in terms of how it reacts you it is not just theyre just a serve you it is not just a servant it actually has opinions and can tell you when maybe you are thinking as flad or your actions ore flown it can also leve it can could also leave i've never conceptionalize robout human interactions this way at tell me more about how this might look are we thinking about am a human appearing robot i know you and ihave both had intense relationships to our that yuwe have separate dogs obviously but to to animals a sound a lot human animal interaction what is the ideal human robot relationship there is a a lot to be said here but you actually pinpointad one of the big big first taps which is sidea of time and it is a huge limitation in machine learning community colonelly as not now way back to lake the actual details life long learning is a as a is a problem space that a focusis somhow ai systems can learn over a long period of time what is currently most machine learning systems are not able to do is t all the things you have listened under time the successes the failures are just chilling together watchying movies ay i systems are not able to do that which is all the beautiful magical moments that i believe or the days filled with they are not able to keep track of those together with you there as they cannot move with you and be with you non literally we do not have the the the techniques to o do the learning the actual learning of containing those moments current machine learning systems are really focusse on understanding the world in the falling w it is more the perception system looking around understand a what is in the scene that there is a bunch of people sitting down that there is a cameras a microphon that there is a table understand that but the fact that we shared this moment of talkin ng today and still remember that for next time your for leke a next time you are doing something remember that this moment happen we do not know ho to do that a teche niquit this is what i'm this is what i'm a hoping to enevate on as they think it is a very very important component of what means to create a dupilationship that sharing of moments together could you post a photo of you in the robot likeself selfy with robody and the robots sees that image and recognizes that was time spent there was there were smiles or there were tears and create some sort of that trick of of emotional depth an the relationship and up date its behavior it tacted you in the middle the night an say why have not you tuxted me back oh yes all of those things but we get wicken digin to that but i think that time elment forget everything else just sharing moments together that changes everything i believe that changes everything there is specific things that are more in terms of systems that can explain you a it is it is more technical than probably lit but all flying as 've kind of wild ideas how that can revolutionize a from that works and and operating systems but the point is that elment alone forget all the other things were talking about you emotions a saying no all that a just remember sharing moments together would change everything we do not cornenlly have systems that a a share share moments together even just you and your fridge just all those times you went late at night and and eihte things should not have eaten that was a secret moment you had with your refrigerator you shared that moment that darkness or that beautiful moment we you just a heart broken for some reason you are eating that ice cream or whatever that is a special moment and that refrigerator was there for you and the fact that it misst the opportunity to remember that a is is is tragic and once it does remember that i think you'e going a be very attached there efrigerator you you'r going to go through some through some hell with out frigeric most of us have in in a in the developed world have weird relationships with food rite you can go through some ma some deep moments of trama and triumph with food and at the courp of that is the refrigerator a smart refrigerator i believe would a change society not just the refrigerator but the these ideas in the systems all around us that i iis won to comment on how powerful the idea of time is and then there is a bunch of elements of actual interaction of a allowing you as a human to feel your being heard truly heard truly understood that we hu tha deep friendshipes that i think but were still there is still an element of selfishness there still an element of a not really being able to understand another human and a lot of the times when you are going through trama together through difficult times and through successes you are actually starting to get that incling of understanding of each other but i think that cul be done more aggressively you a more efficiently if you think of a great therapist i think i've never actually been to therapist but i'm a believer i used to one to be a sychitris yo russions go to ther snance do not they do not and a if they do the therapist on't live to tell the story ai ye i i do believe in talk that which friendship is to mes its talk ther peer it is the it is youg necerny to talk it is just connecting a though in space of ideas and space of experiences i think there is a lot of ideas how hodmek a assistance to be able to ask the right questions and truly here another human this is what we trid to do with podcasting i i think there is ways to do that woith they iye but above all else just remembering the collection of moments they make up the day the weak the months i think i you may behave some of this as well some of my closest friends still are the friends from high school that is time we have been through a munche shed together and that we have we are very different people but just the fact that ud been through that and we remember those moments an those moments somehow create a depth of connection nothing else you and yourefrigerator i love that because the i'd a my graduate adviser jon't forte she passed away but when she passed away somewhat hy said at her at her memorial im all these amazing things he had done et cetera and then her kids got up there and she had young children than that i knew as they were or when she was pregnant with them and is really an you even now i can feel your heart gets heavy thinking about thes sirgan to grow up without their mother and it was really amazing very very strong a young girls an oun't e young women and what they said was incredible they said what they really appreciated most about their mother who was an amazing person is all the unstructured time they spent together it was not the trips to the zou it was not oh she woke up it five in the morning and drove us to school she did all those things too she at two hour commuting each direction it was incredible ran alab et cetera but it was the unstructured time on the passing of their mother that that is what they remembered was the the biggest give and i what bonded them to her was all the time where they just cone hung out and the way you described the relationship to refrigerator is a i want e tay human but i'm almost reluctant to say that because when i'm realizing as we are talking is that what we think of as human might actually be the a lower form of relationship there may be relationships that are far better than the sorts of relationships that we can conceive in our minds right now based on what these machine relationship interactions could teach us do not have that right ye i think i think there is no reason see machines as a somehow a in capable of teaching us something that is deeply human i i do not think a humans have a monopoly on that i think we understand ourselves very poorly and we need that to have the kind of a aprompting from a from a machine and definine part of that is just remembering the moments remembering the moments imi i think the on structure time together i wonder if it is quite onstructured that calling this podcast on structure time maybe what they meant was it was not a big outing it wasn thas there was no specific goal but a goal was created through the lack of a goal i cree just hang out in then y start playing thome wor yend at playing thomewore for an hour there it is it is the structure e emerges from lack of structure no but the thing is the moments there is something about those times that creates special moments and a i think that those could be automized for i think we think of a big outing as i do not know going to six flags or something or a some big a the grandcanyon or going to some unnr that that i think we wed need to we do not quite yet understand as humans what creates magical moments i think this possible to authomize a lot of es things and perhaps podcasting is helping people discover that ah maybe the thing one optimized for is not necessarily a some a sexy a quick clipse maybe what we want is long form authenticity depth depth we trying to figure that out acertainly from deep connection between between humans and humans ana systems i think long conversations or long periods of communication over a a series of moments minut perhaps seemingly insignificant to the big ones the big successis the big a failures those are all just stitching those together and talking throughout i think that is a the formula for a really really deep connection that from vlike the very specific engineering perspective is a i think of fascinating open problem that has been really worked on very much and for me from a if i have the guts and a i mean there is a lot of things to say but one of it is gots as i bill a start up around it ye lip let us talk about this start up unles's talk about the the dream you have mention this dream before in our previous conversations always as little hints dropped here and there i just a fr ndymon les saing there is never been in owfline conversation about this dream i'm not privy to anything ah except what lec says now ah and i realize that there is no way to capture the full assence of a dream and any kond of verbal statement am in a way that captures all of it but what is the what is this dream that you have referred to now several times a when we have sat down together and talked on the phone maybe it is this company may bet something distinct if you feel comfortable could be great of you chare al bit about what that is sure that the way people express long term vision i've noticed is quite different elan as an example somebody who can very crisply say exactly what the goal is also has to do with the fact the promese sowthing have nothing to with humans my long term vision is a little bit more difficult to expressin words i've noticed as i've tried it could be my brains failure but there is a waste o sneak up to it bloomi to say a few things early on in life a in in alsing the recent years i've interacted with a few robots where i understood there is magic there and that magic could be shared by millions if it is sa brought to light when i first met spot from boston dynamics i realized this magic there that nobody else is seeing is the do is the dog sorry the spot is the forlegged a robat from boston dynamics som people might have seen it this yellow dog and a e'll sometimes in life you just notice something that just grabs you and i believe that this is something that this magic is something that can be every single device in the world the the way that i think a maybe steeve jobs thought about the personal computer aa lasdid not think about the person computer this way pus stive did which is he thought that the personal computer should be a thin as a shet of paper and everybody should have one me this idea i think it is heart breaking that a we are getting the world is being filled up with machines they are soulless and i think every one of them can have that same magic one of the things that tha also inspired me interms of a start up is that magic can be engineered much easier than i thought that is my intuition with everything ivever built and worked on that the dream is to ad a bit of that magic in every single computing system in the world the way that windows operating system for a long time was a the primary operating system everydy interacted with they built apse on top of it i think this is something that should be as a wayer is almost as an operating system in a every device that humans interacted with in the world and with that actually looks the actual dream when i was efici kid a it did not have this concrete form of a business it had more a a dream of a exploring your own loneliness by interacting with machines robots a this deep connection between humans a robots was always a dream and for me i'd love to see a world with thereis every home as a robout and not a robot that watches the dishes a whera or a sex robout or and i think of any kind of activity the robi can do but more a companion a wi amily member a family member the way dog is a but a dog that is arks able to speak your language to not just connect the way a dog does by looking at you and looking away and almost smiling with its soul in that kind of way a but also to actually understand what the hew why you excited about the successes understand the details understand o the dramas and that i just think that ad always filled me with excitement that i i culd with artificial intellgens bring joy to a lot of people more recently i've been more or more hardbroken to see the kind of division derision even hate that is boiling up on aon the intrnate through social nutworks and i thought this kind of mechanism is exactly applicable wut in the contaxt of social that works as well it is an operating system that a serves as your guide to a in it on the intronet one of the biggest problems with a you too in social neltworks currently is there optimizing for engagement i think if you create a iye systems that no each individual person youare able to optimize for long term growth for a long term happiness of the individual of the individual of the individual and a there is a lot of other things to say which is tha in order for a ie systems to to learn everything about you a they need to collect they need to just you and i when we talk off lying or collecting data about each other secrets bought each other the same way a i has to do that and at had allows you to and that requ ise you to rethink ideas of ownership of data i think each individual should own all of their data and very easily be able to leave just a i systems can leave humans can disappear a and deleat all f their data in a moment's notice am which is actually better than we humans can do this once we loawd the data into each other its there i think it is a very important to be both a give people complete control over their data in order to establish trust that they can trust you and the second part of trust is transparency a whenever the data is used to make a very clear what is being used for and not clear in a loyally legal sense but clear in a way that is people really understand what is used for i believe when people have the ability to deleat all their data and walk away and to know how the data is being used i think they will stay i ah the the possibility of a clean break up is actually what will keep people to gelya i think i think exactly i think a a happy marriage requires the ability to divorce easily without the the the divorce and industrial complex or whatever the is culenly going on that there is much money to be made from lawyers ndivorce but yet they billy to leave is what enables love i think tetr thing i've heard the phrase a from a semi synical friend that a marriage is the leading cause of divorce but now we have heard that divorce or the possibility of divorce could be the leading cause of marriage of a happy marriage good point of a happy marriage that yi at ther's the lot details there but th the big dream as that connection between a i system and a human and aven ta ou know there is much fear about artificial intelligent systems and about robats that i have not quite fond the right words to express that vision because the vision i have is one a is not some naive delusion al vision of tacknowledge is going to save everybody it is i really do just have a positive view of ways a i systems can help humans explore themselves i love that positivity and i i agree that they the stance a everything is doomed is equally bad im to say that everything's can turn out all right there has to be a dedicated effort im clearly your i'm thinking about what that dedicated effort would look you mention to two aspects to this dream you and oneto make sure that i understand where they im can act if they do or if theys are independent streams a one was this am hypothetical robat family member or some other form of robat that would allow people to experience the kind of i'm delight that you experienced a many times and th at you would the world to to be able to h ave and it is it such a beautiful idea of this give and the other is social media or a social network platforms that i really serve individuals and and their bestselves in their happiness in their growth is there cross over between those ore these two parallel dring hown to present the same thing it is it is a difficult to cunt a explain with out going to details but may be one easy way to explain the way i think about social networks is you creat in ai system that is yours that is yours is not amazonelects of the centralize you own the data it is it is learnt it is your little friend thay becomes your representative on twitter that that helps you find things that will make you feel good that will a also challenge your thinking to make you grow but not get to that a not let you get lost in the negative spile of dopening that that they gets you to be angry or most just get you to be not open to learning and that little representative is optimizing your long term health and it is a i believe that that it is not only good for human beings it is also good for business i think long term you can make a lot of money a by challenging this idea that the only way to make money is maximizing engagement and wit one of the things that people disagree on me on is they think twitters always going to win maximizing engagementis always going to in i do not think se i think people have woken up now to understanding that they do not always feel good the once who ar on twitter a lot that that they do not always feel good at the end of the week i would love feed back from whatever this a creature a whatever i can i do not knoa to call it as to may be t the end of the week it would automatically unfollow some of the people that i follow because it realized through some real really smart data about how i was feeling inside or how was sleeping or something that that just was not good for me but it might also put things and people in front of me that a i ought to see is that he con be ask liver of what this what this looks the whole point because of the interaction because of a sharing the moments and learning a lot about you you are now able to understand what interactions led you to become a better burginyou yourself i the person you yourself are happy with ah this is not if you are into flat earth and you feel very good about it that you believe that earth is flat tha idea you should scenser that is ridiculous if it makes you feel good and you becoming the best version yourself i think you should be getting as much flattearth as possible no i's also good to challenge your ideas but not becau as the centralized a committee decided but because you tell to the system that you challenging your ideas i think all of us do and then which exeutov does not do that well once you go down the flatter its rabbit hole that is all you cn to see it is nice to get a some really powerful communicators to argue against flatter and it is nice to see that o for you and and potentially at least long term to expand your horizons may be the earth is is not flat but if you continue to live your whole life thanking the earth is flat i think and your being a good father or son or daughter and your being the best version yourself and you are happy with yourself a i think o the earth is flat i i think this kind of idea and i'm just using that kind of silly ridiculous example because i do not the idea of centralized force is controlling what you can it cannot see but i also do not this idea of not censuring anything because that is always the biggest problemit that is this it is h this escentral decider i think you yourself can decide what you want to see and not and it is good to have a companion that a reminds you that you felt shity last time you did this or you felt good last time you did this i feel in every good story there is that there is a guide or a companion that flies out or forages a littl bit further a little bit differently and brings back information that helps us or at least tries to steer us in the right direction su i asia tht's exactly a that is exactly the a what i'm thinking and what i've been working on i i should mention as a bunch of difficulties here i you see me up and down a little bit recently a there is technically a lot of challenges here this with a lot of technologies and the reason i'm talking about it in a potgast comfortably as it was to working it in secret is it is really hard and may be it is time as not come and that is something eft the consten struggle with in terms of ontropreneraly is as a start up li i've also mention to you may be off line i really do not care about money i do not care about a business success all those kinds of things im it is a difficult decision to make how much of your time do you want to go all in here and give everything to this a 'sa big roll the dice because i've also realize that is working on some of these problems both with a the rebotics and the technical side on interms of a the the machine learning system that i'm describing it is lonely it is really lonely because a both on a personal level l and a technical level in the technical level i'm surrounded by people that kind of a doubt me which i think all antropineras go through and they doubt you in the following sense they a they know how difficult it is the people that a the colleagues of mine they know how difficult life long learning is they also know how difficult it dis tobule the system this i tto bbuild the competitor socian noutwork and da in general there is a kind of va loneliness to just working on something on your own for a long pairs of time and you start to dol whether a given that you do not have a track record of success that is a big one when you look in the mirror speciallin you'r young but i still have that i'm most things you look in the mirror is and yeof these big dreams how do youre how do yu know you are actually as smart as you think you are thike how do you are going to be able to accomplish this dream you ave this ambition yousor do not do not but you are you are gon o pulling on a on a string hoping that sthe no bigg r ball of yarn yes ut ye have this kind of intuition i i i think i pride myself in knowing what i'm good at because the reason i have that intuition is cause i think i'm very good at knowing all the things i stuck at which is basically everything whenever i knotice wait a minute i'm kind of good at this which is very rare for me i think that that mag be a ball yarn worth pulling at and the thing with th interms of engineering a systems that are able to intract with humans i think i'm very good at that and da because you wuld talk about pot casting and on i do not know if i'm very good apoic you are very good at pogan but i certainly do not a i think may be ahit is compelling to to for people to watch a a kind hearted idiots struggle with this t with this form may be that is what iwitwhat is compelling but in terms of actual being a good engineer of human robot interaction systems i think i'm good but it is hard to know until you do it and then the world keeps telling you are not a and is just is full adol ans really hard and i've been struggling with that recently it is it is kind of a fastining struggle but then that is where the gogins thing comes in is a aside from the stay hard by the fucker is the a whenever you are struggling that is a good sign that if you keep going they you are going to be alone in the success right a wat's not willing your case however i agree at itually david had o post recently that i thought was among his many brilliant post was one of the more brilliant about how om you we talked about this mith of te light at the end of the tunnel and instead what he replace that mith with was a concept that eventually your eyes adapt to the dark at that the tunnel it is not about a light at the end that it is really about adapting to the catona i's very gog in alo m much at yet you go sure lan iit a lot in common on knowing you both a bit i'm you sure a lot in common but in is this loneliness and the and the pursuit of this dream it seems to me has a certain component to it that is extremely valuable which is that the loneliness itself could serve as a driver to build the companion for the journey well i'm very deeply aware of that thik some people can na make cas i talk about love a lot i really love everything in this world and but as also love humans friendship and a romantic even the cheesy stuff am just you romantic movies yet h nes not i'm no nt a i got mucshit from rogen abat a was that the tangle seen from a sentofe woman but yes i find a a will not there is nothing better than a woman in a red dress a you i just glassy you should move to argentina myye you are my fathers argentine and youknowhat he said when i oh when i went on your podcas for the first time he said he dress as well because an argentin a the men go to a wedding or a part yor something yowing you ask they by half way through the night tenments andthe night all the jackets are off yet it looks everyone is undressing for the party they just got dressed up for and he said a and he said the way he dresses thand when i start youe tok about you and then when ewhen i starve my podcass he said why do not you wear a a real suit your ela io that think but let us talk about this this pursuit just a bit more because i think what you are talking about is is building a not just a solution for loneliness but you have alluded to the loneliness as itself an important thing and i think you are right i think within people there is a caverns of foughts and shame but also just the desire to be i'm to have resinence to to be seen and heard and i do not even know that it is seen and heard through language but these reservoirs are of loneliness i think am there well they are interesting maybe you could common a lotle bit about it because just as often as you talk about love i'm quantified it but it seems that you talk about this loneliness i maybe you just wu if you are willing you could you sure a lo wat more about that and and what what that feels now in the pursuit of building this robout human relationship and you been let us let me be direct youve been spending a lot of time on building a robout human relationship where is that at i a a it terns a business in terms of systems no time bout a specific robot oh robe gas you is shour mention a few things to one is there is a start up with thes a idea where i hope millions of people can use and then there is my own personal a almost frankens tin explorations with a with particular robots i'm very fascinated with a legged robots in my own a a private sounds dark but in one and of one experiments to see if i can recreate the magic and a that is been i h've a lot of really good already the perceptional systems and ta control systems that are able to communicate affection in a dog fashion i'm in really good place there the stumbling blocks which alsoave beend part of my sadness recently is a that i alse have to work with robotics companies that a i gave much on my part soul and love and appreciation towards bosson dynamics but bosson dynamics is also is a company that has to make a lot of money and have marketing teams and theyer looking at thi silly rushin kidna suit an ti is what is you trying to do with all this love and robot interaction an dancing on there was a i think thet's safe for now it is hat when you break up with a girl frinish something right now we decided to part ways on this particular thing their huge supporters of mind the huge fans but on this particular thing bossn dynamics is not focussing on or interested in human robot intirection in fact their whole business currently its keep the robot as far away from humans as possible ah because it is it is in in the industrial setting were its doing modenring in dangerous environments it is almost a remote security camera centialy is its application to me i thought a it is still even in those applications exceptionally useful for the robot to be able to perceeve humans see humans and to be able to a in a big map localizes with those humans zare and have human intention for example this i did this a lot of work with pedestrians for robot to be able to anticipate what the how the human is doing where it is walking if youare it is humans are not bulistic's object they are not just because you are walk in this way one moment doesnt me you will keep walk in that direction yeft to infer a lot of signals especially of the head movement in the igh movement it i thought that is superinteresting to explore but a they did not feel that i'll be working with a few other robotics companies that tha ar aro much more open to that kind of stuff in their superexcited an fanco mind hopefully boss on dynamics my first love that getting back with a next girl friend will come around but the algarhythmically it is a i'm basically aa done there a the the rest is actually getting a some of these companies to work with and then there is a a for people whod work with robats know that one thing is to write soft oy that works and the other is to have a real machine that actually works and it breaks on in all kinds of different ways that are fascinating and that there is a big challenge there but that is almost a it may sound luld be confusing in the contacts of our previous discussion because the previous discussion was more about the big dream how i hope to have millions of people in enjoy this moment of magic the this current discussion about a robat it is something i personally really enjoy just brings me happiness i really try to do now everything that just brings me joy a maximize that cause it cause robats are assom but too given my the little be growing platform i want to use the opportunity to educate people a it is just it is robats are cool and if i think theyre cool i'll be able to i hope be able to communicate why theyre cool to others th this little robat experiment is a liibetor research project to there is a coup of publications without my teef folks ar on that but the the others just the makes som cool vidios and explain to people how thy actually work and that as supposed to people being scared a robats they can be still be scared but also excited that seed the the dark side the beautiful side the magic of what it means to bring a for a machine to become a robat i wintno want to a inspire people with that but tht's less it i's interesting because a i think the big impact in terms of the dream does not have to do with embodied ay i does not neeu to have a body i think a the refrigerator is enough that that for an a a system just to have a voice and to hear you that is enough for loneliness a the embodiment is just a by embodyming you meed the physical structure physical istantiation of intelligence it is a legad robat or even just the thing a i ave a few other the human oi robat a little human a robat me lit keep em on the table is walks around or even just a moba platform that can just turn around and look at you i's we mentiond with the pen something that moves and can look at you a i's that bout a robat but's what a a the asks what is my purpose a that that is really it is almost art there is something about a physical entity that moves around that is able to look at you and interact with you that makes you wonder what it means to be human it challenge you to think if i if that thing looks has consciousness a what the hell am i and no that feeling i think it is really useful for us it is humbling for us humans but that is less abo ta research i's certainly less about business and more about exploring our own our ownselves and challenging others to think ah o to a to think about what makes them human i love this desire to share the delight of an interaction with a robot and as you describe it i actually i find myself strying to crave that because we all have those elements from childhood where or from a dollhood were we experience something we want other people to feel that and i think that you are igt i think a lot of people are scared of a eye i think lot of peple are scared a robats my only experience and of a robotic thing a is my rumbo vacum where it goes about actually was pretty good at picking up costellofs hair when he was shed and then m and i was grateful for it but then when it would when i was on a call or something in i would get caught on a on a wire or something i would find myself getting upset with the rumb in that moment i my what are you doing in i and obviously it is just doing what it does it but that is a kind of a mostly posiid but slightly negative interaction am but whet you are describing it has much more richness and layers of detail that i can only imagine what those relationships ware o there is a feu just a quick comment i've had the'r not carnell in boson that have a much of rumbas for my robot and i did this experiment mit how many rumbas es i a fleet of rea i as probably sevener y i lot of roum wi ice is very clean what is o this i'm kind of waiting this this is a tha the place where curnelling in an austen is way larger than i need but a it is i basically got it to to make sure i have room for robaots to gouni to you have these seven or rumbas you deploy all seven at once i noi do differen experience with them i at different experiments with them one of thinks i want to mention is this is a i think there is a u tu vida that inspired me to try this is a i got them to a to scream in pain and moan in pain a whe never they a wor kicked or contacted and i did that experiment to see how i would feel ut i meant to do a u tu vdionipothen ag you seem very cruel did any rmbo writes act of is comiithe i i think if i release that vidio i think it is going to make me look insaying which i know people know i moradiin saying lue valu have to release the i i i think may be if i contectualize it by showing other robats to show why this is fascinating because ultimately i felt there were human almost immediately and that display of pain was what did that giving them a voice given them a voice especially a voice of da dislike of of pain i have to connect you to my friend at each ang he studys speech and language hs anderow surgeon and were lifelong friends am he a study speech and language but he describes some of these a more primitive viteral vocalizations cries groans moans of delight am other sounds as well use your imagination as such powerful rudders for the other for the emotions of other people as i find it fastining i cannot wait to see this vidio as that is the vidio available on line no i have no i have not recorded it that just apont your room was tha ar able to scream ind pain a in my boston in my boston place i i te people aready a e next next pod cast episode with a lakes at maybe well have that one you knows ell the thing is people i a've notice because i talk much about love and it is really who i am i think they want a it a to lot of people seems the dis ther god be a dark person in ther somewhere and i thought if i releast vidios an roomor screaming in there yet yethat is theflingting what about a shlike a shouts of glee and delight you could do that too i why do not nowim i do not i a to me delight is quiet i i got your russian w mer on yofr much americans are much louder than russians ye ye but tha i do not i mean unlest you have talking bou i do not know how you would have sexual relations with the room but wi was not assurily saying a sexual delight but a troe mei tried ats a joke inton o but i was fastining i the psychologe of how little it tookas you mention you had negative relationship with the room bu et only well i'd find that mostly i took it for granted it just served me it collected costlles hair and then when it would do something i did not i would get upset with it that is not of good relationship it was taken for granted and i would get up sett in then i parket again and i j your your in the in the corner ye but there is a way to frame it is a it being quite dom as a almost cute you he almost connecting with it for its dumbness and i think that is a artificial intelligence problem a i think flaws are should be a feature not a bug along the lines of this a the different sorts of relationships that one could have with robots an the fear but also that some of the positive relationships that one culd have a there is much domentionality there much to explorer but a power dynamics in relationships are very interesting because th the obvious once that a the unsophisticated view of this is want there is a master and a servant i but there is also manipulation there is benevolent manipulation o children do this with parents poppies do this poppies turn their head and look cudan may be give out a li l anoise kids coo and parents always think that theyr their doing this because they they love the parent but in many ways studies show that those cous our ways to extract the sorts of behaviors and expressions from the parent that they want the child does not know it is doing this it is complete sub conscious but it is benevolent manipulation there is one version of fear of robots but i hear a lot about i think most people can relate to weare the robots take over and they become the masterswhen we become the servants but there could be another version that am a in certain communities that i'm certainly not a part of but they call topping from the bottom where the robat is actually manipulating you into doing things but i you are under the belief that you are in charge but actually they are in charge and i think that is one that am if we could explore that for a second you could imagine it would necessarily be bad although it could lead to bad things am the reason i want to explore this as i think people always a default to tha the extreme the robats take over and were in little jail sells and their out having fun and and ruling the universe a what what what sorts of manipulation can roba potentially carry out good or bad ye jus there is a lot of good and bad manipulation between humans i just tik yo said to me especially l said a topping from the bottoms that the term a i think one from them i tee told me that tury was int lacks ai think first of all there is power dynamics ain bed and par dynamics in relationships and power dynamics on the street and the workin barnmen those are all ther different a i think am i think power dynamics can make human relationships especially romeant romantic relationships ar fascinating and rich and fulfilling and exciting and all those kinds of things i do not i do not think in themselves their bad and the same goes with robots i really love the idea that a robat would be at top or a bottom in terms of leg power dynamics aand i think everybody should be aware of that and the manipulation is not much manipulation but a a dance ive pulling away apushin pull ind all those kinds of things i in terms of control i i think wewere very very very far away from ai systems their able to alack us up they a a tulack us up in a in they to have much control that we baselyy cannot live our lives in the way that we want i think there is a in terms of dangers of ai systems thers much more dangers have to do with authomos weapon systems and all those kinds of thing the power dynamics as exercised in the struggle between nations an war and all those kinds of things but in terms of personal relationships i think power dynamics are beautiful thing now there is of course going to be all those kinds of a discussions abot a a consent and rights and ll this kinds or youre were talking ai was say an any discussion around this ifif we need to define a reallieve the contacts i's always alwey should be consentual age appropriate contact appropriate species appropriate but now we are toing myt human robot inter actions and a i guess that n i i would actually was trying to make a different point which is i do believe that robots will have rights doneline and i think in order for in order for us to have deepi for relationship with robots we would have to consider them as entities in themselves that a deserve respect that is a really interesting consept that ai think people are starring to talk about oll i bit more but is very difficult for us to understand ow entities that are other than human i mean the same as with dogs and aother animals can have rights on a levellos humans well that yaman that we we cannot and nor should we do whatever we want with animals we have a you as te with the we of departments of a of agriculture that deal with om animal carein use committees for research for agr for farming and ranching all that i i while i when you first said it i thought we why would have there be a bill of robotic rights but it absolutely make sens i'm in the contect of everything we have been talking about up until now lets am if you are willing i'd love to talk about dogs because you have mentioned dogs a couple times a robot dog on you had a a biological dog he had a a newfundland a named homer for many years growing up in russar in youass in the united states and a he was about is over two hundred pounds it is a big dog that is beif people know people know newfulensiies this blacg dog that is a really a long hair and just the a kind sou i think perhaps that is true for a lot of large dogs but he thought he was a small dog he moved that and was he your dog ye now you had him since he was verily young often since a since the very very beginning to the very very end and one of the things i mean he had this kind of a we mentioned rumbas he had a kind hearted dumbness about him that was just overwhelmes part of the reason i named him homer because the is after homer simpson cas people ar wanter which homer am referring to ar not that there' not be otust succest ith hat he exactly a there is a cluck clumsiness that was just ta something that immediately led to a deep love for each other and one of the i mean he was always it is the shared moments he was always there for many a nights together that is this a powerful thing about a dog that a he was there through all the loneliness through all the tough times through the successes and all those kind of things and remember a an me that was the really moving moment for me i still miss him to thi day how long ago did he doct a may be fifteen years ago sos is been a while but it was the first time i've really experience the feeling of death is what happened is sa he ah he got a cancer and heas dying slowly and then ther certain point he could not get up any more ah there is a lot of things i could say here a thethat i struggle with that may be a maybe he suffered much longer than he needed to that is something i really think about a lot but i remember what had to take him to the hospital and the nurses could not carry him i you talk about two hundred pound dog i was realing to power lif thing at the time and mumber they they they tried to figot all these kinds of ways to a in order to put him to sleep yet to take im ma in into a room and i had to carry him everywhere and here is is dying friend of mine that i just had to firsto 's really difficult to carry somebody that heavy when they are not helping you out and ta yes i remember is the first time seeing a friend laying there and seeing life drain from his body and that realization that we are here for a short time was made real that hehas a friend that was there for me the wee before the day before and now he is gone and that was a i do not know it is that that spoke to the fact that he could be deeply connected with a dog also spoke to the fact that da the the shared moments together that led to that deep friendship as s ar that will make life amazing but also spoke to the fact that death is a molifucker ah i know you have a lost castella recently yean you can go and as you'r saying this i'm definitely fighting back ah the tears i am i a thank you for sharing that that a i guess we were about to uttry n og that it was that it was bound to appened just given when this is when this is happening yet it is a how long how long did that castelle was not toing whell we will let us see a year ago during the star to t about six months into the pendamici he started getting absesses and he was not t his behaviour change in something really changed and then i put him on tastostrone because a which helped a lot of things that certainly did not cure everything but it helped a lot of things he was dealing with joint pain sleep issues and then it just became a very slow decline to the point where two three weeks ago he had a closit full of medication mn this dog was ye was a farmase it is amazing to me when i looked at it the other day stelvin cleaned up and removed all his things to they cant quite bring myself to do it but dody think he was suffering well would happen was about a week ago it was just about a week ot's amazing the he was going up the stairs i saw him slip he was a big got he was not two hundred pounds but he is about ninety pounds es a bull dog has pretty big and he was fit and then i notice that he was not carrying that afoot in the back it was injured it had no feeling at all he never liked me to touch his hind paus nd i could do that thing was just flopping there and then a the that found some spinal degeneration and i was told that the next one would go did he suffer i sure hope not but something changed in his eyes yeents the eyes again i know you an i spend long hours on the fone and talking about the eyes and hout what they conveyin what they mean about internal states and forstake a robonts and biology of other kinds but hi a something about him was gone in his eyes i i think he was real here i am anthe premorifizing i think he was realizing that one of his great joys in life which was to walk and sniff and p on things thi dog the fun domen loved p on things is amazing i wondered where he put it he was a reservoir of yurine it was incredible i think o that seid he is just he would put one drop on the fifty millionth plant and then we get to the fifty millionth in one the landhow he just have leave a poddle and here i am tilig about costello ping he was losing that ability to stand up and do that he was falling down while he was doing that and i i do think he started to realize and the the passage was easy and peaceful but i'll say this i i'm not ashamed to say it i mean i wake up every morning since then just i do not even make the conscious decision to allow my self to cry wake up crying and i'm fortunately able to make it through the day thanks to the great support of my friends and and you and my family but i miss him and i miss him yet i miss him and i feel i he homer costello ou know the relatio nship to one'stogust specific but ah that that party is gone that is the hard thing ah what is what what i think i's different is that i made the mistake i think when i hope it was a good decision but sometimes i think i made the mistake of i brought costello a little bit to the world through the pod cas posting about him i gave i answer for more asvised about him in public let us beoncs i have no idea what his mental life was or his relationship to me and i'm just exploring all this for the first time because he was my first dog but i raise him since he was seven weeks yet you got to holdit together i notice the that posoed a you are least on monday you mention castalla you you brought him back to life for me for that brief moment nebothes es he is gone you wal that is the he is goingto be gone for a lot of people too well this is what i'm struggling with i think that maybe you are pretty good at this lhave you done this before ah this is the challenge is i actually a part of me i kno t to take care myself pretty well ye not perfectly but pretty well and i've good support i i do worrya ole bit about how it is gon a land and how people will feel i'm i'm concerned about there internalization ah that something i'm still i'm still iterating and you have the that' the watch yo struggle which is tassay right and i i mostly been shielding them from this but ah what would make me happiest if is if people would internal iye some of costelle is best traits and his best traits were that he was incredibly touf i mean he was a poing too inch nat bull dog the whole thing he was just born that way what was what was beautiful is that his toffiness is 'n ever what he rolled forward it was just now sweet and kind he was and if people can take that then a than there is a win in their some place i i think there is some ways in which he should probably live on in your podcast to hou should da i mean it is such a one of things i loved about the his rollin your pit gast is that he brought much joy to you we mention the robats right i think a that is such a powerful thing to bring that joy in't it allowing yourself to experience that joy to bring that joy to others to share with others ah that is really powerful and i mean not to this is this is the russian thing is it is i it touched me when a luicy ky had that moment that i keep thinking about in this a his show louis where an old man was criticising louis for whining about breaking up with his girl friend and you saying the most the the most beautiful thing a about ta love they me song thi catchi now that is now making you feel horrible saying but is the loss the loss really also is making you relize how much that person that dog meant to you and allowing yourself to feel that loss and not run away from that loss is really powerful and in some ways that is also sweet just the love was the loss is also sweet because that you felt to lot for that a for your friend i and tey continue bringing that joy i think it would be amazing to the pokas a i hope to do the same with robots ors at whatever else is the source of joy i am and may be ad youd think about one day getting ah another dog ye in time am you are hitting on all the key buttons here ah hi want that to we are thinking about ways to kind of immortalized costelle in away that is real not just creating some little logo or something silly you costello much david gogins is a a person but gogins also has grown into kind of a verb you gin a gogins this or y and there is an adjetive that is extremely it ah i think that for me costella was all those things he was a he was a being he was his own being he was a noun a a verb and an adjetive and yet this amazing super power that i wish i could get which is this ability to get everyone else to do things for you without doing a damn thing the costello effect i call ii is an idea he lives on yes ah thank you for that this actually has benvery theryouah which which yu actually brings me to a a question a we are friends were not just a cot scientist colleagues and working on a project together and m a and in the world a that is somewhat similar just just to two dogs just two dogs basically ah but let us talk about friendship because i think that at i certainly know as a scientist that there are elements that are very lonely of the scientific pursuit there are elements of many pursuits that are lonely music math always seem to me there the loneliest people h who knows if that is true or not also people work in teams and sometimes people are surrounded by people in her actuate people they feel very lonely but for me and and i think as well for you friendship is an incredibly strong force in making one feel certain things are possible or worth reaching for a maybe even making us compulsively reach for them when you we are growing up you gro up in russia until what age thirteen i and then and then he moved directly to philadelphia ou to a chicago ou chicago and then philadelphiaa and san francisca and boston an on but really to chicago thats hon i went to high school you have sibling brought older brother ba most people on' know that a yahea is a very different very different person but somebody i definatly look up to he is a wild man he is extravert he is a he was into i mean he is he is also scientist a by engineer but his when we were growing up in he was a the person who did a drank an did every drug and but also was the life of the party and and i just thought he was the uknow when your the older brother five years older he was the coolest person a that i da ways going to be him to that he was he definly had a big influence but i think for me on terms of friendship growing up i had a i had one really close friend and then when i came here at another close friend but i'm very i believe a i do not fi believe but i draw a la of strength from deep connections with a without the people and just ha small number of people just the really small nomber of people that is when i moved to thes country i was really surprised how a ther these bethese a large groups of friends quontlled quot but they that the that the depth of connection was not there at all from my sort of perspective now why i moved to the suburb of chicago was naprville it is more a middle class may be uppera middle class sos people that a cared more about material possessions than deep human connection that added to the thing but i i droe more meaning than almost anything else was from friendship early on i had best friend his name was hehe his name is you' a a i do not know how to say it in english ai dou say in russian youda what is it last same do you remember a a mire cool of i youd a mircool of a we just spend all our time together there is there is a there is also group of friends i do not noits tike i ate guis in russia growing it is a parents did not care if your coming back at certain hour we spend all day all night this playing socker usually called football a and just talking about life and all this kinds of things even at that young age that i think people in russia an sovy union grow up much quicker a h i think the educatious system at the ur universe y level is worl class in in united states in terms of really creating really a big powerful minds a at least he used to be but i think that they aspire to that but the education system for for younger kids in the sovie union was incredible they did not treat us as kids we the the level of literature tolsta dostayowsky when you repushily small child yet that is asourand matin the level of mathematics and you were made to feel shet if you are not good an mathematics we i think in this country there is more spechy young kids tat are kute there being babied a we only start to really push a duls later in life if you want to be the best in the world that this than you get to be pushed but we were pushed at a young age everybody was pushed and that brought out the best in people i think a it really forced people to discover discover themselves in th gogin style but also discover a what there actually passion about wont the're not is all true for boys and girls where they pushed equal either a they were pushed thea theuh pushed equally i wutsay there is oblou see there is more not obviously but there at least for my memories a more of a what is the right way to put it but there is gendera rolls but not in a negative connetation it was iwas the red dress ferses the suden tie kind of connitation which is there is yoo guys lifting heavy things and girls creating beautiful art and a thereis more tradition over you yegent more a nineteen fifty sixtis but we did not thanke in terms of at least at that age in terms of rolls ind in a home maker something that or now it was more about what people care about a girls cared about this set of things and guys cared about this set of things i think mathematics and engineering was something that guys cared about insteat of at least my perception of that time and then girls create about girls cared about beauty s guys want to creat machines girls went a creat beautiful stuff and not of course that i do not take that forward in some kind of philosophy of life but just the way i grow up in the way i remember it but all everyone worked hard the the value of hard work was a instilled in everybody and a through that i i think it is it is a lutabit of hardship of course also economically everybody with poor especial wi the philosophis of union there is poverty everywhere you did not notice it as much but there was a because there is much not much material possessions there wis a huge value placed on human connection just a meeting with neighbors everybody knew each other wel lived in an apartment building very different than you have in the united states these days everybody knew each other a you get to gether drink vot gu smoke cigarettes and play guitar and sing ma sad songs about the about life it was with tha the sad songs in the russian thing i may not i russians that do i express joy i from time to time thet on certainly you do a but a what do you think that is about is it cause it is cold there but it is cold other places to ii think a las us the first of all the sovie union a the echoes o world wore too and the millions on millions on millions of people the civilions thet were slaughtered and also starvation is there right the echoes of that of the ideas the literature the art is there that the grand parents that is parents that is all there that contributes to it that life can be absurdly unexplainably cruel at any moment everything can change that is in there then th i think there is an empowering aspect to finding beauty and suffering that then everything else is beautiful to if you just linger it is why you meditate on death is if you just think about the worst possible case and find beauty in that than everything else beautiful to and you write songs about the dark stuff and a that somehow helps you deal with whatever comes there there is a hopelessness to a the the sovie union that inflation all those kinds of things were people or sold dreams and never delivered and there is a there is a if you do not sing songs about sad things you are going to become cynical about this world they do not want to give into cynicism now all live people did ou kna one of the but that it is the battle agains cynicism one of the a things that may be common in russia is a kind of cynicism about if i told you the thing i said earlier about dreaming about robots it is very common for people to a dismiss that dream of saying now that is not that is too wild whoelse do that did that or you want to start aupod gas who else nobody's making money on pod gasts why d you mont start pokat that kind of minds that i think it is quite common which is why i would say ontraprinuraship in russia is still not very good which to be a business that to be not to pronurer you have to dream beg and yet the have others around you friends and s te poor group that makes you make you dream big but if you do not givento cynicism an appreciate the beauty in a the the unfairness of life the absurd unfairness of life than i think it just makes a makes you appreciative everything is a it is a prerequisite for gratitude and yet that i think that in stilled to me abilly to appreciate everything just everything everything's amazing and then also there is a culture a a ramat af romanticizing everything it is almost i thetlike ramantic relationships worse were very sop opera it is very over the top dramatic and i think i think it that was 't stille o me too not only do appreciate everything about life but i get emotional about it in a sense i get a vistral feeling of joy for everything an the same with tha n or friends or people of the opposite sex there is a deep emotional connection there that that is way to dramatic to i guess relative to what the actual moment is but i i derive much deep dramatice joy from many things in life and i think i would a attribute that to the obriging i russia but the thing that sticks most of all is a the friendship and have now since then had a one other friend that in a in the united states he livs in chicago his name is mat and slowly a here and there accumulating really fascinating people but am very selective with that funny enough the few times it is not few is a lot of times now interactin with yo rogan it is sounds to real to say but there is a kindred spirit there thak haf connected with him a and there is been people that also in the grappling sports that are really connected with i've ectually struggled which is why i'm i'm glad to be your friend it is a struggle to connect with scientists lite thit can be a little bit wooden some ti ye even the biologists i mean one thing that i i'm jyou well i'm struck by the fact that yu you work with robots yourn engineer eh i you science stecnology and thats all sounds hardware right but what youre describing and i know it is true about you is this deep emotional life and this resodence an i it is really wonderful actually think it is one of the reasons why many people scientists and otherwise have gravitated towards you and your podcass is because you hold both elements you knowin that hermin has his book and of your narcistis and goldmen write its about these elements of the logical rational mind and the the the emotional mind and how those are woven together and if people have not read it they should and you embody that the full picture and i think that much of what draws people to you ivei read every herman has sa bog i as usual as usual i've done about nine per cent of i i what live it it know it is true you will you mention joe who is a a phenomenal human being not just for his amazing accomplishments but for how he shows up to the world but one on one i think i heard him say the other day on an interview a he said there is no poblike or private version of him is this is this is me he said the wor it was beautiful he said u'm the fish they got through the net now there is no on stage offstage irsion you are absolute right and i bt will you go good i have a question or actually about but that is a really good point about public and private life i he is o huge if i can just commer you but a that he was a i've been a fan of joe for a long time but he is been in inspiration to a to not have any difference between public in private life actually a had a conversation with nof all about this and he said that you cannot have a rich life a exciting life if you are the same person publicly in privately and a i think i understand that idea but i do not agree with it i i think this really fulfilling and exciting to be the same person privately in publicly with very few exceptions now that said i do not have any really strange sex kinks i feel i can be open with bes everything i do not have anything i'm ashamed of a there is somethings that could be perceived poorly the screaming rumbas but i'm not ashamed of them i uldpresent them in the right contacts but there is a this freedom to bein the same person in private as in public and that joe made me realize that if you can you can be that and also to be kind to others it sounds it sounds kind of absurd but i really i really always enjoyed being good to others just being kind towards others but i always a felt the world did not want me to be there is much negativity when i was growing up just a wrong people if you ectul just notice how people talk they a from complaining about the weather or this could be just the big cities that i visited but there is a general negativity and positivity's kind of a suppressed you are not one you not seen us as very intelligent and too there is a kind of you seen is litbitable weird of and always felt i had to hide that and when joe made me realize one i have i coul be fully just the same person private in public and too i can embrace being kind and just in the way that i in the way i i know how to do and sort of for me in ontwitter ah or publicly whenever i say stuff that means saying stuff simply almost the point of clichet and i have the strength now to say it even if i'm being mocked you do noti mean just it is o quet ifs everything's going to be oquet el kat some people will think you are dom there probably right the point is just enjoy being yourself and thatyo jo more than almost anybody else because he is successful a at it ah inspire me to do that be kind and be the same person private in public i love it and i i love the idea that authenticity does not have to be oversharing right that it does not mean you reveal every detail of your life what it it is a way of being true to an essence of oneself right you are not there is never a feeling when you deeply think and interespect that you are hiding something from the world are you being dishonest the some fontomot theway a yes it that that a that is truly liberating it allows you to think it allows you to a think freely to speak freely to a just to be freely that said it is not it is not this not still a responsibility to be the best version o yourself you not very careful with the way i say something the whole point it is i's not simple to a express the spirit that is inside you with words it indp means some people much better than than others i struggle oftentimes when i say something and i hear myself say it it sounds really dumb and not at all what i meant that is the responsibility you have is not just a being the same person publicly privately meads you can just say whatever the how it means a there still responsibily to try to be to express what you truly are and that that is that is a that is hard it is hard and i think that s we have this am pressure all people when i say we i mean all all humans maybe robots to ah feel this pressure to be able to express ourselves in that one moment in that one form and it is beaus beautiful when somebody for instance can capture some essence of love or sad anas sore anger or something in a song or in a poem or in a short quote but perhaps it is also possible to do it in aggregate all all the things how you show up your frence is one of the things that initially drew me to want to get to know you as a human being in a scientist and and eventuallywe became friends was the level of respect that you brought to your podcast listeners by wearing a suit i'm being serious youre i think i was erased thinking that if you overdress a little bit overdressed by american certainly by american standards you are overdrest for a podcast but this is but it is genuine you are not doing it for any reason except i have to assume and i assumed at the time that it was because you have a respect for your audience you respect o them enough to show up a certain way for them it is for you also but it is for them and i think between that and your commitment to your friendship'sthe way you talk about friendships and love andthe wy you hold up these higher ideals i think at least as a consumer of yur content a end is your friend i what i find is that inaggregate you are communicating who you are it does not have to be one quote youare something and i think that you we were sort of obsessed by the one in stin quot or the one e line of a poetry or something but it is the i think you embody the way that and joe is well it is about how you live your life and how you show up as a collection of things and said and done youat that thats fastn the aggregate is is the go the the the tricky thing and georgan peterson talks about this because he is under attack away more than you and i will ever be but that for anowright this is very true now a that a a the people who attack on the internat this is one of the problms wit twitter is a they do not consider the aggregate they they take a single statements and one of the defence mechanisms again why joe has been in inspiration is that when you inaggregate are good person a lot of people will know that and that makes you much more immune to the attacks of people that bring out a individual statement they may be mistatement of of some kind or does not express a who you are and that ah i that idea that is the aggregate and tha th the power the pod cast is you have hundreds of ours out there and being yourself and people get to know who you are and once they do and you and you post pictures of screaming rumbas as you kick them ah they will understand tha you knon't mean while by the way is is a side comment i do not know ifi wen to release this because s not just the rumbas you have a whole dungeon of roba look this is this is a problem this the bosse dynamis came up against this problem but me just me work this workshop this out with you a and may be because we will post this people wil let me know a there is legged robas they look a dog they ave a very i'm trying to create a very real a human roba connection but they are also incredible because you can throw them owful building an te land fine and is beautiful that thng yamazeing i've seen that in str envis are cats gettig jumping off o fift story boings and than walking away a no one should throw their cat wat this is the probmim experiencing al all certainly kicking the robats it is really fastening how they recover from those kicks but just seeing myself do it and also seeing others do it it just does not look good and i do not know what to do with that cause i it is such a toit you i see but you do not i you coulsd you atoba now i'm getting ohnow now i'm it is interesting befor to day's conversation i probably could do it and now i think i'm thinking about robats bills of rights and things i'm actually and not not for any not to satisfy you ere to satisfy anything except that if i if they have some sentient aspect to their being then i would loath to kick i do not think they will be able to kick it you might be able to kick the first time o not the second this this the prome of experience one of the cool things is a one of the robats o i'm working with you can pick it up by one leg and is dangling you can throw it any kind of way an o land correctly 's really ren nou at a cat that i an we look forward to the letters from the cat oh nofm not suggesting any one did but yet he had this cat and the cat he would just ou not throw it on to the bed from across the room and that it would run back for er more somehow they had that was though nature of the relationship i think most no one should do that to an animal but a di this cat seem to return for it for whatever a the robas e roba i's fastening to me how hard it is for me to do that it is unfortunate but i do not think i can do that to robat it i i struggle with that i for me to be able to do that with a roba i have to i most get into the state that i imagine doctors get into in ther do surgery i have to start have to do what robadics colleagues of mine do which is start seeing it is an object associate lik dessociate we just fastinaing that i have to do that in order to do that with a robat i swin t i take that little bit of a tangeet no i think it is an important thing i man i am not m i'm not a shy about the fact that for many years i i've worked on experimental animals and and that is been of very challenging aspect of being a biologist mostly mice but in the pass no longer o thank goodness cause i just do not doing it on larger animals as well and now i work on humans which i can give consent ferbal consent om i think that it is extremely important to have an understanding of what the guide lines are and wear one's own boundaries are around thes sit it is it is not just an important question it might be the most important question before any work can progress you you ask me about friendship i know you have a a lot of thoughts about friendship what you think is the value of friendship in life well for me personally a just because of my my life trajectory and ark a friendship and i should say i do have some i female friends that are just friends are completely platonic relation st but it is been mostly male friendship to me has been has been all male friendships to me actually interesting yeh it is been a im an absolute life lime they are my family i have a byological family and i have great respect and love for them and appreciation for them but it it provide it is provided me im the i wont even't say confidence because there is always an anxiety and takeing any good risk ir any rissk worth taking it is given me the sense that i should go for certain things and try certain things to take rist to to weather that anxiety and i i do not com concern myself a particularly competitive person but i would sooner die then disappoint or let down one of my friends ii can think of nothing worse actually than disappointing one of my my friends everything else a secondary to me what disappointment misappoin meaning im not i meant certainly a i strive always to show up as best i can for the friendship and that can be in small ways if hi can mean you do not making sure the phone is away sometimes it is about im yu i'm terrible with punctuality cause i'm an academicc and i just get lost in time and i do not mean anything by but ye striving to to listen to to enjoy good timestip and to make time you knowing hontey goes back to this first variable we talked about to make sure that i spend time and to get time in person and check in and im it is i think there many ways in which friendship is vital to me it is it is actually to me what makes life worth living yeh wet there is a i am surprised with the high school friends how we do not actally talk that often these days intimes e time but every time we see each other it is immediately if i back to always tarted i you knw i struggle with that how much time your the alicate toam for the for the friendship to be deeply meanful because there are just ere always there with me even if we do not talk often i there is a kind of loyalty i ti think a maybe it is a different style but i think im much to me friendship as being there in the hard times i think i i i'm much more reliable when you are going through shit then then youre mi oy reliable anyway no but if i yeare if you are a wedding or something that or a i do not know lik you want unaward of some kind i ye ghati'll congratulate thethe shid i do you but thike that is not and i'll be there but that is not as important to me as being there when nobody else is i just being there when shedas gets a shit it is the fan or something is taugh for the world turns there ill back and you all those kinds of things that to me that is what friendship is meanful i know that to be true about you and that is a felt thing and a real thing with you let me ask one more thing about that actually because i'm not a practitioner ggetzou i know you are joe is but a years ago i read a book that i really enjoyed which is sam sheridan's book a fighter's heart he talks about all these different forms of marthal arts and am and maybe he was in the book maybe was in an interview but he said that fighting or being in physical battle with somebody jugetzu boxing or some other form of physical direct physical contact between two individuals creates this bond unlike any other because he said it is it is a one night stand you'r sharing bodily fluids with somebody that you barely know and i it and tat chuckled about it cause it is it is kind of funny and a kind of tongue and cheek but at the same time i think a this is a fundamental way in which am members of a species bond is through physical contact and certainly there are other forms there is cuddling and there is hand holding and there is am and theres sexual intercourse an wit all sorts of thing let us cuddling ii have not heard of it i heard this recently i did not know this term but there is a term am they have turned the noun cup cake into a verb cup caking it turns out i just learned im ois cup caking is when you spend time just cuddling i did not know about this you heard it here first although i heard it first just the other day cup caking is actually cuddling is everything it is not just is it in bed ors on the cos what is cut cuddling i ai't to lookaboe cudlin we need to look a this up en we need to define the veriables i think et i devilly has to do with physical contact ii eveen told but am but in terms of battle a a competition i am and the sherirding quot i'm just curious do you get close or feel am a bond with people that for instance hou rolled jugitszo with or even though you do not know anything else about them is he it was he write about this yea i mean i'm many levels he else has the book what a fighter's mind a thus arein one he is at he is action excellent writer what is interesting about him justs briefly about sheridan i do not know what i didloebut a research he a he went to harvard he is an art major t harvard he claims all he did was smoke cigarettes and and do part i do not knowif his art was any good and am and i think his father was in the seal teams and then when he got out of harvard graduated he took off round the world learning all the forms of marthal arts and was early to the kind of ultimate fighting kind of a makes marshal art and things great great book yeait is it is amazin i i do not if you remember it but i read it ni remember thinking tos amazing incapsilation of what makes fighting the the art what makes it compelling am i would say that there is many ways that ggetszo grappling rastling combats boice in general is one of the most intimate things you could do adno fo described in terms of bodily liquids and all those kinds of things i think he was more or less joke in yor li i i think of there is a few ways that it does that one because you are vulnerable that the honesty of stepping on the mat and a often all of us have ego thinking were better than we are at this particular art and then the honesty of being submitted or being worse than you thought you are and just sitting with that knowledge that kind of honesty we do not get to experience it in most of daily life we can continue living somewhat of an illusion of our conceptionis of ourselves cause people are not going to i hit us with the reality the mat speaks only the truth that the reality just hits you and that vulnerability is the same as a the loss of a love dwendle it is the loss of a reality that you knew before you now have to deal with this new reality n when you are sitting there in that vulnerability and there is these other people that are also sitting in that all neirability you get th rely connect fock i'm not aspecial as i thought i was and life is not life as harsher than i thought i was and were just sitting there with that reality some of us can putwords to them some we can' i think that defininy is a thing that least to intimacy a that the other thing is is the human contact there is something about i mean a big hug dering covid very few people hug me and i hug them and always felt good when they did that we are all tested and spehly now were vaccinated but there is still people this is true of san francisco s is tren boston that one keep not only six feet away but stay at home and never touch you that that was a that loss of basic humanity is the opposite of what i feel injugitu where it was that that contact where you are i do not give a shade about whatever rules were spose to have in society where youare not yhve to keep a distance in all that kind of sto just the hug that the intimacy of a hug that is a good bear hug and youre just controlling another person and also there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break each other's arms i do not eexactly understand why hhihlands is the such a close neighbour to love but it is what in in the hypothalemus the nurans that control secual behavior but also nonsectual contact or not just near by the nerons that control a gression and fighting they are salt and pepper with those nar on it is a very interesting and you kno it almost sounds kind of riskay and controversial nsulf there i'm not but enterpromorphizing about what this means but in the brain thos structures are interdigitated they they you cannot you cannot separate them except at a very fine level and he here your the wy you describe it is the same tat as a real thing i i i do one make an interesting commat again these thid things that could be taken out of contacts but a i one of the amazing things about jugitzus is both guies and girls train it and iwas surprised a i'm a big fan of yogopans a a it you not at the gam kind of thing it is a reveals the beauty of a of the female form but the the thing is girls are dressed and skintighe clothes in jugits often and i found myself not at all thinking that at all with when training with girls whll the contact is very nonsectual but that that i was surprised to learn that i when i first ar ugits i thought it would not be kind weird to train with the opposites in something intimate boys and girls men and women they they rolled jugitzy together completely interestin and the the only times girls kind of try to stay way from guives mean their two contacts of course as always going to be creeps in this world t everyone knows who who kind at to stay away from and the other is there is a size ti sparity girls wil often try to roll with people would be closer weit wise but no ther that is one of the things that are empowering to women that that is what they fall in love with when they star ting jugitzas i i can first of all they gain in awareness and a pride over their body which is great and then second they get especially later on start submitting big dudes these a a a brose that come in for all shredded and muscular and they get to technique da to a exercise dominants over them and that is a powerful feeling to byou have seen women force a a larger guid to tapyet or even choke hin well i was a alwas deadlything a a a for ah boy i think it is for ninety five s always reallyn to power the thing when a starte git gigitza and irm orwer being submitted by i thought i walked in feeling i'm going to be if not the greatest fighter have at least top three and sso as a white belt you roll in all happy a and then you realize that a as long as you are not applying too much force th your having i'm orer being submitted many times by a hundred thirty hundred twenty pond girls hat thus a balance dudials in philadelphia that a lot of incredible female jugitzi players and that is really hombling to that tachnique a can overpower in in combat a pure strength that i that is the other thing that there is something about combat that is primal that there it just feels it feels a we were born to do this that ther we have circuits in our brain that are detic ated to this kind of interaction there is no there is no question it thik that is what have felt it it was not that i'm learning in you skill it was somehow i am a remembering echoes of something i've learned in the past wet's hetting puberty a child before puberty has no concept of boys in girls having this a attraction regardless of whether not ther attracted to boys oa girl does not matter at some point most people not all but certainly but most people when they hip puberty suddenly people appear differently and certain people take on i a romantic or sexual interest for the very first time and it is it is revealing a circuitry in the brain it is not they learn that it is inatue and i think it when i hear the way you describe a you git to an and in rolling jugitzo remind yourl of it joe was telling me a recently about the first time you went hunting and he felt it revealed a circuit that was that was in him all long but he had not experience before ye that that is detle there and and of course there is the physical activity one of the interesting things about yugitzu i's at it is one of the really stranuous exercises that you can do late into your adult life into your a fifty sixty seventies eighties i've when when i came up a there is a few people their aities that were training and as long as your smart as long as you practise techniques and pick your partner's correctlhy you can do that kind of art it is lady to life and you see getting exercise there is not many activities i find that are a amenable to that because it is such a thinking game that that the jugis in particular is an art where technique pays awful lot you can a still maintain first of all remain injury free if you's good technique and also through good technique a be able to go you be active with people that are much much younger and i that was to me that and running under the two activities you can kind of do late in life because to me a healthy life is has exercises as the piece of the puzzle absolutely and i've been glad they were on the physical component because i i know that there is for you a you have talke before about the cross over between the physical and the intellectual and the mental and are you still running aridiculous hours of the night for ridiculously long yet un a definily i've been running late at night here nostin people tome ex the area werein now people says the dangerous area which i find laughable coming from the bigger cities a now i run late at night there is something if you see a got running through austin at two a m in a suitan tie it is probe awell yet i mean i do think about thaat as i get recognize more ar more and osten i worry that unot really that neget recogniz s late at night a you kno a but there is something about the night that brings out those deep philosophical thoughts in self reflection that realy enjoy but recently am i startyd getting back to the grind some good a be competing are hoping to be compete in te in september and october ju jous injojous o ye to get back to competition and that requires getting back into great cardier shape i'v been getting a running as part of my daily routine you ot now i why always know i can reach you regardless of times own in the middle of the night ah wherever that happens ot part o that has to be just being single and being a programmer those those two things just do not work while in terms of a steady sleeps cedul it is not banker's hours kind of work now i nefari want it you mention single i want to ask you lobet about the other form of relationship which is a romantic love om your parents are still married still marry's still happily married that is impressive a rare thing nowday you gro up with that example ye i guess that is a powerful thing ih if there is an example that thing an work it ye i did not have that in my own family but am when y when i see it it is it is inspiring an its and it is beautiful the fact that they have that and that was the norm for you i think is is really wonderful it is os a in t guess of my parents was interesting to watch cause there is obviously tension there'l be times woirh tey fa in all those kinds of things they a the obvious to get frustrated with each other and that they but they fine mechanisms how to communicate that to each other to make fun of each other a little bay to tees to get some of that frustration out and then altimatly to reunit in in indefind their joyful moments and be that the energy i think it is clear cause i got together in the i think early twenties very very young i think you grow together as people yer you'e still in critical period of brain plast tis and a also it me is just a divorce was frowned upon that you stick it out and i think a lot of couples especially from that time ian sovy union that is probably applies to lot of cultures you stick it out and you put in the work you learn how to put in the work and once you do you start to get to some of those rewarding aspects of being through time be ha sharing many moments together that a that is datling something that m that was in inspiration to me but maybe that is where i have i have a similar kind of longing to have a life long partner that have that kind of view where same with friendship life long friendship is the most meaningful kind that there is something with that time of sharing all that time together till death to us part as a powerful thing not by force not because the religion sait it or the governments that it or you calture said o but because you want to do you want children deafl ye defly want childreand it is it is coomany roms do you have hoh i thought you should no nomen child not human human childr as i ready have the children exact wi wa saying oin d at least as many a human children as you do rom was big family small family ah on your mind's eyes there big a the're bunch of bunch of who freedman's running around i'll tell you realistically i i can explain exactly my thinking it in this a similar to the robotic's work is if i'm purely logical rit now my answer would be i do not want kids because i just do not have enough time i've much going on but when i'm using the same kind of vision i use for the robots is i know my life will be transformed with the first ik i know wild love being a father and as fo the question of how many i that that is on the other side of that hill it it it could be some ridiculous number i just know that i i have a feeling and i could be i i do not have a crystal ball but a i do not know ise i see an upwards of of certainly three or more come comes to marse much of that has to do with a the partner you are with to that that is such an open question especially in thi society of what the right partnership is some i'ma i'm i'm deeply ampathetic i want to see to me or what i look for in relationship is a for me to be really excited about the passions of another person whatever there in to does not have to be a career success any kind of success just to be excited for them and for them to be excited for me and exshare in that excitement in build and build and build but there is also practical aspects of what kind of ship o you enjoy doing i together and i think families of real serious undertaking oh it certainly is i man i think that i've a a friend i'm who said it i think best whichis that om you first have he is in a very successful relationship an a and has a family an he said o you first afto defind the rolel and then you have to cast the right person for the role wo ye that there there is some deep aspect to that but there is also an aspect to which you are not smart enough from this side of it to define the right to define the rol i thi's part of it that has to be a leap that you have to take a and i i see im i i see having kids that way you just you just have to go with it infigure it out also as long as there is love there what the hell is life or even i've i've a there many incredibly successful people that i know i that i've got in to know that all have kids and the pra sense of kids for the most part has only been something that energize them something they gave a meaning something that made him the best versions themselves made them more productive not less just fascining to me it is fascinan i may you imagine if the way that you felt about homer the way that i feel in felt about costello is is at all a a a glimpse of what thi must be than exactly tha the downside the thing i worry more about is a the a thethe pardner side of that i've seen a the kids are almost universally a source of increased productivity enjoy and happiness theat there ar paying the ass he has complicated ya sats on forth people to complain about kids but when you act you look past that little shall lay of complain kids a great the source of paying for a lot of people is the if when the relationship does not work and i'm very kind o concerned about wy daiting is very difficult and i'm a complicated person and is there has been very difficult to find a to find the right kind of person but that that statement oes even make sense because i'm not on daining aps i do not see people you are the first person i saw in a while s tike you michael malice and joe i a i i do not think i've seen a a a females what is it a an element of the female species in quite a an quite a while i think you have to put yourself out there a what is it a daniel johson says true love will find you but only f your looking there' some element of really taking leap in putting yourself out there in kind of different situations and in't know how to do that when you are behind of computer all the time well yet youry a you are a builder and you are a problems alver and om i your you find solutions and i'm confident this solution is a the solution is out there and hink you are implying thati'm going to build the girl friend which i think werther you wer well and maybe we should not separate this a friendship am the notion of friendship and community and the act wif we go back to this concept of the aggregate maybe you will meet this woman through u'm through a friend er maybe or something of that o one of things i do not nowf you ah if you feel the same way i deafinilly one of those people that just falls in love and that is it i cannot say im that we yous costello wo was instantaneous ye it really was i mean to i know it is it not it is not romantic love is instantaneous no i i but that is me i not i think that you if because that that is a that is a good thing that you have what it is a i'm very careful that because you do not a fam of for the wrong person i try to be a very kind of careful wit i ive noticed this because i fallen o with ove this m mug everything i fall in love with things in this world i guatt by really careful because a a a girl comes up to you and says she loves dustievsky i that does not necessary leing you to marry her to night yes ani the way you said that out loud that you heard it i yit does not mean you needs a mer here yo to night exactly right i mean but people people are amazing and people are beautiful and that is sa i i'm fully embrace that but i elsie hat to be careful with relationship an at the same time i a mession to or fline and i do not a thes something about me that appreciates swinging for the fenses and not dating doing serl dating a dating around that you are one guy one girl connega yeh a said that and it is it is tricky because i you oun fe on to be careful of that kind of stuff especially now there is a growing platform thit have a ridiculous amount of female interest of o a certain kind but i'm looking for deep connection and and i'm looking by senting home alone and every once in a while i talking to stamfor professors perfect sono ge perfect colia work agrat it it is well incorporates on i part of that constitutes machine learning of sort ye of sort iwould do you mention im what has now become a quite exxtensive and expansive a public platform which is incredible i'mean the number of people wout when first time i saw your podcast i knose disuit us you respects his audience which was great but i also thought this is amazing youn people are showing out for science and engineering into acknowledgy information and those discussions and other sorts of discussions now i do want to talk for a moment about the podcast my two questions about the podcast or when you started it did you have a plan and regardless of what that answer is ut do you do where you are taking it or i'm would you to leave us ii do believe in an element of surprise is always fun but what about the podgast you enjoy the podcast i mean your audience certainly includes me really enjoys the podcast it is incredible i love talking to people and there is something about mycrophones that really bring out the besting people would you do ou do not get a chenst to talk this if you and i were just hanging out would have a very different conversation in the amount of focus we 'll eligate to each other would be having fun talking about the stuff and doing other things there would be a lot of distraction there would be some fon use and all that kind of stff a but here we are one hundred per cent focus on each other and focus on that idea and sometimes plain with ideas that we both do not know the answer to a question we do not know the answer to were both fumbling with a trying to figure out trying to get some insights tat something we have not really figured out before and toget ther arriving at that i think that is magical i do not know why we need microphones for that but we somehow do feels doing science it feels doing science for me defintly that is exactly a then an i really glad you said that because i do not actually often say this but that is exactly what i felt i wanted to talk to o friends and collegue that ir my tea to do real science togethat is wor how i felt about it to really talk through problems that are actually interesting as uppose to ilike incremental work that were curnenly working for a for particular conference it really asking questions what are we doing wheres as headed to what are the big is this really going to help us os olve in the case of a i solve intelligence is this even working on intelligence there is a thi certain sense which is why iinitially called it artificial intelligence is most of us are not working on artificial intelligence youre youre working on some very specific problem and a set of techniques it thet time it is machine learning to solve this particular problem this is not gunder take us to a system that a is anou work close to the generalizeability aof the human mind the kind of thouht the human mind can do in tims of memoring terms of cognition terms of reasoning common sense reasoning this dis does not seem to take us there see the initial impulse was can i talk to these folks do science together through conversation and i also thought that there was not enough not i did not think there wis enough good conversations with worldclass minds that i got to me and not the ones with a book or hat this was a thing oftentimes you go on this tour we have a book but there is a lot of mines that do not write books th ni the books constrain the conversation e cause an youre talking about this thing tha same book but there is i i've notice that with people have not written a book who are brilliant we get to talk about ideas in a new way we both have not actually when we raise a question we do not know the answer to it one the question is raised and we try to arrive there i i n i remember asking questions of world class researches in a deep learning of why do yourl nut works work as well as they do that question is often loosely asked but when you have microphones and yet have to think through it and yet thirty minutes to an hour to think through it together i think that is a that science i think that is really powerful to those those tha one go the other one is o i i igain do not usually talk about this but thereis some sense in which i wanted to have dangerous conversation s a part of the reasons i wanted to wear a su is i wanted to be fearless that the reason i dont eas you talk about it is because i feel a not good conversation it looks iit does not match the current skill level but i wanted to have really m a dangerous conversations that i uniquely would be able to do younot you completely uniquely but i'm a huge vanajo rogan and i had to ask myself what conversations can i do that jo rogen cannot for me i know i bring this ef but for me that person i thaught about at the time was pudent the that is that is why i bring him up he he is he is a just with castello he is not just a person he is also an idea to me for what i strive for is to have those dangerous conversations and the reason i'm uniquely qualifies both the russian but also there is the judo in the marshal arts there is a lot of elements that make me have a conversation he has not had before and am and there is a few other people that a i kept a mind thi don canuth he is computirous scientist o from stamford that i thought is one of those beautiful mines ever and nobody really talk to him really talk to him hes did a few lectures which heople love but really just have a conversation with him ih tis a few people that one of them pass away john conway that i never got wl agree to talk but he died before i did this a few people that that i thought it is such a crime to not here those folks and a i have the unique ability to a know how to purchast and a microphona and amazon and plugg it into a device their cords audio and then publish it which seems relative unique it is that is not easy in the scientific community people knowing how to plug in a microphon no they can build feraday cages and twofots on microscopes and a but the bio engineer all sorts of things but a the idea that you could take ideas and export them into a structure or suit of structure that people would benefit from seems a cosmic achievement to them i do not know if it is a fear or just a basically t y have not tryd as tat they have have not learne the skill level but i think they are not trained at a we riff on this for a while but i think that but it is important and i me r should which is that it is they are not traind to do it theye traine to think in specific aims and specific hypothesies and and many of them do not care to right they they do not they they became scientist because a that is where they felt safe and why would they leave that haven of safety or that they also do not necessarily always see the value in it it is it is we are ll toge ther learning you and i are learning the value of this i think you are probably you have an exceptionally a successful and amazing pacas the you started just recently thanks to your encouragement well but there is there is a raw skill there that it that is youyour defling an inspiration not to me in how you do the pawcas in the in the level of excellencyo reach but i think you have discovered that that is also an ampactful way to do science that pacas and i think a lot of a scientists have not yet discovered that that this is a if they apply a the same kind of rigor as they do to ecademic publication h or to even conference presentations and they do that rigor and a effort to a topacast whatever that is that could be a five mena pcas a to our pacas hit culd be conversational or can be more lecture if they applyd that effort you have the pretential to reach over time tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people and thot' that is really really powerful but yet for for me giving a platform to a few of those folks a especially for me personally maybe you can speak to what fields you are drawn to but i thought computer scientists a were especially bad at this as there is brilliant computer scientists that i thought a ituld be amazing to explore their mind explored their thinking and that i took that almost as a on as an effort and at the same time i had other a guests in mind or people that connectto my own interest that the wrestling a wrestling music a fotball both american foball and ansaker i have a few particular people that i'm really interested and a abovisasati ofs the sit yar brothers i even could be for wrestling just talk to them as ok as you can you yes can communicate in russian and in wrestling i as wrestlers and as russians and a to that that little isat an opportunity to explore a mind that a that i i'm able to bring to the world and it and also it a i feel lik could mek me a better person just that being that vulnerable and exploring ideas together i do not know good conversation i n't know how often you have really o conversation with friends but pacasts are that and a it is is deeply moving ta best an and what what you have brought through et me when i saw you sit down with penrose you knowt know abot prize wondnt physiis in these other folks i i's not just as he has a nobells but comes out of his mouth is incredible an what you were able to on to hold in that conversation was much better light ears beyond what he had any other interview er at an whan you ecall your inter yourcas trally about conversation years beyond what any one else had been able to i engage with him what is was such a beacon of what is possible and i i know that i think that is what people are drawn to and and there is a certain intimacy that a certainly to people are friends as we are and they know each other that there is more of that but there is an intimacy in those kinds of private conversations that are made public and u what the that is the with you you are probably stying to realize and castallo is part of it because you are authentic and your putting yourself out there completely people are almost not just consuming the the words your saying they also enjoy watching you andrew struggle with these ideas or try to communicate these ideas they the flaws they hey a human being it as thehn i i dealaws bet in't gcause i got plenty of he they the the self critical aspects act where youare very care where where youare very self critical about your flas i mean that in in that same way it is interesting i think for people to watch me talk to penrose not just because penrose it is communicating ideas but here is this silly kid trying to explore ideas that they know this kid that there is a human connection that is really powerful say mi think with puwten ri thay it is not just its i a a good interview with puten it is also hear's this kid struggling to are to talk with one of the most powerful a some what argued dangerous people in the world that they love that de thethe authenticity that led up to that thak an and in return i get to connect everybody i run to in the street and all those kind of things a there is a depth of connection there almost within a minute or two that is unlike any other aw there is an intimacy that you have formed with wye yet we have been on this journey together an you have the same thing with jo rogen befor ever met am i i was because i was a fan of joe for many years yet that there is something this it is a kind of friendship as absurd it as it might be to say in podcasthing and listening to podcas yet maybe it maybe it feels in a little bit of that ere solves a little bit of that loneliness ya talking about unti the robats a here i have am just a couple more questions but one of them is on behalf of your audience which is i'm notking to ask you the meaning of the hedgehog but i just want to know does it have a name and you' doant to tell us the name but just does it have a name yes or no well hie's a there is a name he likes to be referred to as and then thee's a private name in the private or own company that we call each other now i i'm not that in saying now his name is hadgy am he is a hedgehog i do not stuffed animals ah but his story is a one of minimalism i gave away everything i own a now three times in my life by everything i mean almost everything kapgene's an shirt and e laptop and i recentlys also been guitar o things that but he survived because he was always in ta at least in the first two times was in the laptop bag an he just got lucky and i just the perseverance of that and i i first saw him in the a the reason i got a stuffed animal and i do not have other stuffed animals is a it was in a thristor i innoc giant pile of stuffed animals and he jumped out at me because unlike all the rest of them he is this intense ah mean look about him that he is just he is upset at life ah at the cruelty of life and just especiallyin the contrast of the other stuffed animals that have this dumb smile in there face he feeli an most stuffed animals that this dumb look on their face and they are just happies and pleasant ville it is always saying tor a signce theyove a smooth qartac not yet not many 's exactly and this hadgy saw through all of it it he was a a a dustiusky's man from underground and there is a sense that he saw the darkness of the world and persevered i's and a there is also a famous russian cartoon a hed trog in the fog that iike i grew up with that connected with people who iknow of that cartoon you coun see it on yed too it is a hedgehog in the fog here he itit is just as you would expect especially for myk early sovi cartoons it is a hedgehog sad walking through the fog exploring loneliness and sadness it is but it is beautiful it is a piece of ar people shud even if you do not speak russian you will see you will understand oh it is 't i the momt you said that i was can ask it is in russian but at courses an it is in russian but it is more a is very little speaking in it it is almost a that there is an interesting exploration of o a how you make sense of the world when you a see it only vaguely through the fog he is trying to understand the world he really mickin mouths yed we have bug's bunny we have all thes you are crazy what animals than you have the hedgehog in the fog there is a there is a certain period and this is again a i doft know what its to attributed to but is really powerful which does a period in sobat history i think probably seventies and eighties a where especially kids were treated very seriously they were treated the'r able to deal with witwith the weetiness of life and that that was reflected in the cartoons a and there is a he was a lowed to have ike really artistic contact not dom cartoons their trying to get you to smile and run around but great art stuff that how short cartoons of short films can win oscers that is what they are swinging for what what strikes me about this zilobit i which im at the suit earlier it is almost they treat kids with respect ye lie that they have that have an intelligence and they honor that intelligence yet there really just adult in a small body i you want to protect him from the true cruelty of the world ur but in terms of their intellectual capacity or philosophical capacity they are right there with you and that the cartoons reflected that the art that they consumed a education reflected that he represents that any there is a there is a sense because hi survive long and because i do not stuffed animals that it is we have been through all this together and it is is the same sharing the moments together it is the friendship and there is a sense in which if all the world turns on you and goes to hell at least we got each other that a and he does not die because he is an ananimate object until you animate him at the a to i animate him and then i probably would not want to know what he was thinking about the whole time a he is probably really into tailor swift or somethng that it is that i would not even want to know an i what a whill i now feel a connection to hedy the hedgehog that i certainly did not have before and i think that incapsilates the kind of possibility of connection om that is possible between human and and other object in through the thrugh robodic certainly a there is a saying that i heard when i was a gradulitstuing that i that is just been ringing in my mind throughout this conversation in such a i think appropriate way which is that i likes you are in a minority of one you are truly a extraordinary in your ability to incaps tilate many aspects of science engineering public communication about many topics martial arts and the emotional depth that you bring to it and just the purposefulness and i think if it is not clear to people it absolutely should be stated but i'm think it is abundantly clear that just the amount of time and thinking that you put into things is a it it is the ultimate mark of respect im i'm just extraordinarily grateful for your friendship and for this conversatianma proud to be aur friend and i just wish you showed me the same kind of respect by wearing a suit and make you a father proud maybe next time next time indeed

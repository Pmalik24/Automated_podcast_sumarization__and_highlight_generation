jobidon's team tries to teach him not to trip as the president visito united auto workers picket line do evidence shows hunter bidin ook a two hundred fifty thousand ollar check from the chinese and it was sent to jobdon's house and form trump aight cacity hutchinson makes the rounds with some juicy tales i benthfear this is venchviro sho to day sho is ponter ba expressive pian thousands f militers of already secured the networkday to join them expressly pianticom flashment already jobidon's numbers continue to look absolutely awful there is a bran new pull out and it shows that jobiden's numbers again remain just devastatingly bad for example this enb s newspole that just recently came out shows the republicans have a twenty one point advantage on the economy forty nine per cents of registered voters pick the jeope twenty eight per cent pick the democrats that is the biggest lead republicans have held on that question since nineteen ninety one since nineteen ninety one remember jobidon more on decided tha he is going to brand his entire economic program bidonomics which gives a short hand to his republican opponents two now hang the economy around his neck there can o do that anyway but now he himself has cut ads for them saying bidonomics his working over and over creepily into a macrophon bidonomic his lorc just juck topose that footage with all of the inflation staffs jocks suppose all of that footage with the stagnating economy how people feel about the economy and its not kon work while for the democrats is a really really bad numbers for jobidon and you'r wondering why it is that every major national polls onal trump is running either even to or above jobiden the answer is because it jobidon is terrible at the presidenting well even james carvill who of course is a democrat polstor analist even carvill is somebody over theire nees to wait to afot because trump could easily whin the election retetom election wit nodembe athorito tis er an an the fe tecarodites on jo jobin ge democra dotrotepobco ajobationa raho nobibo an cordewa trump would be batin fabrate yoe pa to you iul li you even marniy you would not tip that bet i or on shut bout it better work o a carvill is not wrong about this again the poles are a little bit disprit he had the pole from a b s news washington post with trump up ten and that cam atc its couple of days going owthrs a new morning consul poll hith jul bidin up one but bidin up one means that bidins whening forty three per cent of their vote that is a forty thre forty to race o the question here is whether there is a cealing for trump or whether there is a cealing for bidon who is the selection going to be a reugherandum on well meanwhile jobdons team is physically attempting i kin you not to stop him from tripping is an article not not tripping on ondrugs actually just physically tripping and falling down according to actios president bidn and his campain are working on a critical project for his reelection bid make sure he doesna trip things are going amazing o ver at the bidon campan i have to say that the down trums description of jobidon walking couple wek's going on interview continues to be the single bys description jobidon walking down for t he lik tak e's watcing on to bakes everydemuat theu'l think he is wakgante and that that is true it looks as though he is desperately attempting not to fall over according to axios as voters express sdeep concerns about the eight year old president's agent fin is for office bidens hemis taking extra steps to prevent him from stumbling in public with a physical therapis bidin has been doing exercises to improve his balance as far back his november twenty twenty one he is learing tennis shotes more often to avoid slipping and using the short stairs on aerforse one entering the plan on a lower deck then befork as every time he goes up the stairs keeps falling up the stairs democrats including some in thead ministration are terrified bidonillhave a badfall with ae ightmersenary of that happening in the weeks before the november twenty twenty four electin you remember the sasiary happen t hillary clitton which a collapse into a van just a couple of weeks out from the twenty sixteen election according to acios some senior democrat's privately ave been frostrated with bidin's advanced him for months siting the incident wit th san bagra tripped over sandbag and fell down and noting tha the present often appears not to know which direction to go after he speaks at a podium bat bat bidan's balance difficulties are likely the results what his physicion is diagnos is a combinition of significante final arch ritus and a mild post fracture foot arth riht us he works out many morning with his physical terapist and he has to have propriaceptive at maintenance maneuvers i'm that is interesting apparently the white house pose pers on and rebates told acos this is not new this was disclose in at twenty twone in one report from the presidents doctor and then again this year bidn's aratic behavior his inability to to actually stick with with a train of thought and the fact that e's literally falling down all this under cuts the feeling that this is a a durable candidate n there is foort immediately after the sory came up jobidon was going up the short stairs again there not having him take the long tall stairs the iddle of the plant any more thet aving taken the short stairs which make sensence hea usually writes the short pbossnennicas here he was at going up the short stairs anda and nearly tripping ii ben saying for for months that watching cobidin to a press conference or go up a flight of stairs rating a feels ic watching nickwill lendo crossavolcano on a tight rope and you just do not know when your can be watching history in the making every time he goes down or up a flight of stars now again he could survive all of that if you 're well respected he could survive all of that if there worn't a broad scale recognition that he is very bad at the presidenting that when it comes to the police's realy bad and also he is still plagued by serious corruption aligations

birch gold in breaking news re present him james comer who is the leader of the jeo p oversiht committe in the house he has now revealed that there was a wire amount from a chinese figure two hunter bidon and it was listing on this wire amount jobidon's homaaddress according to jimes comer house commitee on oversihe an accountability chairman james comer announce the house over sie committe sofpena an obtained jo bank wires wrevealing hunterbitdon received payments originating from chinese nationals including jonathan lee injuly and augus twenty nineteen when jobidon was running for president of the united states jobdon's wiming ton delawore home address is listed as the beneficiary address for both wires he said quo bankreckors do not li but president jobidon does in twenty twenty jobitdon told americans his family never receive money from china wevardy prove that to be a li earlier this year now we know two wires originating from bashing wistid jobidons wilmington home as the beneficiary address when he was running for president of te united states when jobidn was vbis president he spoke on the phone and had coffee woutd johnithan lee in bashing and lader wrote a college letter of recommendation for his children jobidons abuse of public office for his familys financial gaine thretens ar national security what to th bidons do with this money from bashing americans demand in deserve accountability for president byin andthe first familyes corruption ca jo we have now move the gopost remember the gopost wor hunter bi never to nanything never took chinese money nothing to oka hunter bitdon ma have takeen chinese money but jo never knew about it to whell jo knobiut but who ise never involves inthe business to well joe is involved in the business but only tenchentially by joining for business calls to whell jo knew and whose probably kid ham involved and the business and knew that his son was trafficing in his name and helping out his son but the money never physically enturd anything remotely to jo with jobidon to well ya i mean the wires did have his hom adress on them but did jobidon personally take that check to the bank that th that is where we are now in this particular story by the way it is worth noting tht at the time that this wire listed jobidon's homadress who is not actually living at the home at that time was hunter bidon according his on memoir hofs living in california at the time apparently he was just idon no using the homa address of jobidon best case inaro because it was can of a stable address for him to send the money by the waytheywould be the same home address were hunder bidon was was sometimes staying anjobde wes keeving all those classfied documents speaking of which the biden document classfied tocument scandal is now apparently increasing according to the a b c news report the federal investigation inty jobidan tantal of classified documents prir to be coming president has now grown into a sprawling examination of obama era security protocols and internal white house processies with investigator far interviewing scores of witnesses including secretary of state ansony blincon federal proscutors annufbhi agents from special council roberter's office have an interviewing witnesses for nearlin nine months targaning an expansof constellation of former aights from high level advisers to executive assistants in at least one white house attorney apparently as many as one hundred witnesses have already been interviewed apparently authorities had apparently uncovered instances of carelessness from bidonsvise presidency it seemd to them that it was more likely mistake tan criminal acctabidan with these documents with them but they have reached no final determinations and the investigation remains on going now all of this would be significantly less suspicious wore hunterbide not receiving wires from foreign sources while jobide had been prosiding over the policy and then jobdon runs for present is keeping these documents in the gorage next to his corvat were hunter biden is present not ontly that by the way all of this would be a little bit less troubling if it were not for the fact that we now know for example that jobidan and his friends apparently hanging out with aranian sources here is a fascinating scoop from semaphore talking about how the senior aranian foreign ministry actually created a in effort to bousteran in the united states and the effectively cooptad of bunch of old bama eurae officials including people who ended up in jobidon's administratioive an your talking bat documents floating around your tongu aout suspicion people hanging around those documents if your talking frankly about lack of of national security awariness or care jobiden is is near the top of that list and all of this is deeply suspicious in i not just hunterbiden receiving bribery money which is pretty obviously what was going on here but the fact that you have got these classified document that are floating around every which way insales an mistake that jobidon took all that stuff home all right but the very least and he took thos home he left them in d c in is office he left them in his wilmington delaware in in his gerrage and apparently earanian officials were swarming the bidn administration and the obama administration according to semaphore in the spring of twenty fourteen senior aranian foreign ministry officials initiated a quiet effort to bullsters have ron's image and positions on global security issues particularly its nuwclier programm by building ties with a net work of influential oversees acodemits and researchers they caled at the oran experts initiative the scope in scale of the i e i project has emerged in a large cash o veranian government correspondents in emails reported for the first time by semaphore and ern international the officials working under president hasanrohani congratulated themselves on the impact of the initiative at least three of the people on the foreign ministry list in people who are consert allies of aron wor or became top ats to robert malle the bidan administration special

in a commidation with the west unnewclear issues and masically that jou started plantsing people around washington d c and bunch of those people ended up in the biden administration including people surrounding robert malley m this is frightening stuff and demonstrative of just tow corrupt the ties ar between foreign adversaries aron and the and the oboma administration m truly astonishing stuffright there this is why robert malley who as again brought on biberocoboma and was ineronian ally apparently and ti and also was then brought on by jo by nto no goshiate with e ron and was surrounded by people wo had been cultivated directly by aron that is frightening stuff obviously gayn just one second we will get to the fact that because jobidon is flailing in the polls cous policy is really bad can surrounded by bad people now he is forced to take extremely radical measures to shore up his sort of corps of support will get to that momentarily first let us imagine for a second

poles because independents are turning away from him because at best he is running competitive with donal trump aget that should be every morning bell should be going offor democrats democrats believe the donal trump is deeply unpopular and by the poles nonal trump his popularity ratings is his his popularity unpopulary riings remain absolutely bad n i know that they are lot of people on the right to l of him that does not change the fact thoug when you look at his approval rating when you look at donal trupts approval rating what you find is that his approal rating is really really bad the latest approval ratings for donal trump right now accordning to five thirty eight his latest approval rating is forty wone per cent unfavorable fifty five per centles are not good numbers the fact that jobiten is running even with him as the incumbent president that is horrifying news for jobiton remember this gat who won in seven million more popular votes then donal trump specifically in reaction to trump wht is that mean it means that jobite has to lock down that coursesuport how hows ie an a laut down tha cour support well apparently it means that he is going to now signal to every union in the united states that if they strike he is wone to stand on their side against their employer in the middle of in flationary wage price spiral this is totally crazy hi to the united auto workers are currently in the middle of the strike tagainst two of the big three the're the'r striking still against ford but they have decide not to broad in the strike his ford is making a bunch of concessions now i remind you that the demands that are currently being made by the you a u are totally insan and what they actually want is crazy they want a thirty six per cent pay increase across a forier contract they also would annual cost of living adjustments which means an automatic rays they also want there thei'r benefits plans moved from to fined from to find payments plans to find benefits plans o instead of you getting back sort of what you pay in plussof per centage they want a to find benefits plan which is what bankrupt to the automakers in the first place they also want a thirty two hour work week and everything above thirty to ours paid is overtime which is totally crazy these are these are nuts they also want the big three scrape hey're two teered wage structure under that current system tops your workers according to see th est news earn an average o thirty three buts an hour those hired after to thousand seven are classfight is lowers here and earn about seventeen bucks in hour they u a w says that they just won t get rid of that o everyone its paid thirty three dollars in hour they want the tofine pension they want substantial pay raises hey are more pay thim off and they want a forday work week thirty two hours for forty hours of pay which is nuts they also want a right to strike over plan closings if the plants closhes because the profitability goes away they want to be able to strike over that they also ant a working family protection program that pays you a bl to du community service work if the companys shut down facility if they shut down facility in trit you r is now goin to have to basely forward if they shut at stolantis if they shut down a factory th cn have to pay u a w workers to go to a food kitchen an work which makes zero sent at all they also on to represent workers at their electric vehicle battery factories which are being built right now in join ventures between aughtomakers in south crean battermakes these are of their demends thes the list of the mans that is totally nuts otget thse are nutty demands what it is particularly nutty given the fact that again these carmakers are about to face the hammer of the bid administration trying to force through electric vehicle transitions the big three are deeply reliance that said before on gas power d engions traditional engions and jobidon because he is captured by his environmentalist bays believes that he can force down an cram down through government mantates that all of these companies move toward electric vehical manufacture the problem is a lot more that is havesonomated and it means the number one profitability for these companies can go down because their chief sources of profit our argonogoway in certainterms o he gascad engions and number two alot of the jobs are gin to goway a time when the jobs are threatene thanks the bide administration and the profitability is threatened thanks t e bi administration jobidin is siding with the u a w yesterday jobiden wends to the actual michigan picket line he did this because he is the frade that you a is not cin get out the vote for him in two thousand twenty for that is really all thats comes down to shohn fane had already said where ni can issuan in dorse men of jobid me caus outher stand with us ar yo do not stand with us and jobiden a good little lap dog then went two michigan and went to the picket lines wit shonfine which is crazy again the the federal government should not be taking open sides between business is and unions it is their jobs help facilitate if anything youre to have the anall arb which exists the national laborelations board an abomination of american government that exists to help facilitate these things the religous to union cut out when democrat's run the place actively going and and picketing with u a w saying we agree with you on your demands you want you want in flation you ant stagnation this y get inflation instagnations have these unions that are striking in the middle of an inflacionary economy on atti to get higher wages in higher benefits driving up prices at a time when again people canuun pay the prices they currently have which is going to lead to lest te man which is going to lead to loss of jobs ics going to lead stagnation and the ere true stag flation everybody feels it and jobiden is going here because he knows he needs that union support that is how desperate jobidon is according to the lastr journal he walked a michigan picket line with striking auto workers on tuesday offering on precedent to display of union support as he an former president onal trum prepared for a fight for working class voters by en join members of t u a w union at a g m customer carsoner a politically risky step that make him the first just president to walk a picket line this is totally nuts again they are calling for a forty per cent pay rays these workers are calling for a forty per cent pay rays we will get to jobidon's activities on th picket line in just one second and all the bidanomics is going to sint jobidon and his choice here is i'm going to s you are directly into it it is a bold strategy codmall se ou pays off for him

to do here 's just demonstrates thet he has full fielty to the unions in a ritten statement on tuesday donal trump responded by blaming work res probins on the pushby bydin and democrasts pront evs he said croked joe should be ashamed to showis face before these hardworking americans he is stabbin in the bactors there is truth to all of that trump had announced his michigan visit first bidins team then announce that he was going to go to the picket lines himself to demonstrate again full feelty to bend the knee to shawn fan jobiden was cheered by the ou a u as heur i becas why would not i mea he works for them here is wore for you the taxpater rememer most corrupt bargain and american politics is unions electing the very people who then help ten help negotiate rich contracts on their behalf using the full weight an force the federal goverments super crupt here 's jobian arriving yesterday and wan county michigan o heu deserve what you have earned of ked whall if they would earned it then presumably they would be able to negotiate this without striking and bringin the president of th united states as the pressure cooker fort for the for the big car companies by the way here is ha this work hyou crammd down these union contract the auto companies gobelly up and then the federal government comes into bale's mout this u be we have done it twice before in modern a mer icin histrate happene in the early eighties andten it happened again in two thousandeighty thousand nine we'e been here before cramm down a bunch of crappy contract bankrupt the auto companyies make them un competitive and then come in and bail the maut with tax parcash that is the way all of this works when jobidon by the way says the wallstreets in build country the middle class built the country what is this at that istu a at's jus stupid line wall street is not working in opposition to the middle class who doyou think invested in the company thet hiers people who do you think these companies are built bite investors theyare built by ontropanors and then those companies create a market and the they have to cater to that market by hiring workers and hiring labor the notion tht the middle class did not existenetill unions existed in the united states is a law th unisits in middle class country by the time of te tokeville t's ridiculous and then when jobidon says that then jobidon says stick with it you deserve the rays you deserve the significan stick with it you tso you want to strike to continue is wha you are saying if for the presidents of the united states you bring a you a u act ses i m this it is a grejost stuff it is really quite discusting wit putting on the hat of a union in the middle of a negotiation withan employerthes are two supposedly private parties remember the u a 's a private sector union and jo binis posial we representing you the tax payer not the union an this is this is wild stuff there is a reason no president has done this in the pass including brokobama who is totally in hock to the unions here here is jobidon being as radical as radical can be you oon rords ata ttheham frim toe step up for us who is us my frend who is us a mean first hell letme point out tat the reason that the u a had to make concessions to the auto makers into thousan adiscaus the auto makers were bankrupt there were literally bankrupt there can be sold on the thopping block every u a w contract wer 'ave gone to zeerro zero because they bankruptsy would avoided the contract what they had tho do as make concessions to receive thirty four billion dollars in federal eight again this theway their works the u a cuts he is really rich contract withthe auto makers at the pass of the government and then the arket go sout the automakers take it on the chin they are on the virge of bmankrupt she nt gets to gets to pay for it you get to make for it that is the way all of this works well it is very awkward because again the u a are now striking for benefits that no american gets mean a forty per cent pay rays over for years forty per cent a fhorty two our work week a unicorn way that that is what the'r colonelly triking for and correchon piere was asked at the white house ot it is y tually in agreement with all these demands that what he wants here an shous well im ni can say i'm not aming he is out ther on the picket lines with them but om he is not expressing a policy preference well i notice that when you indorse one side in negotiation that generally involves endorsing their positions that is an absurdity all yeds do is not going to the picket line if you did not want to expressy policy preference if i go to a picket line were people are literally striking for exlion se and i do not express my policy preferenc i just put on their hat and i talk about wonderful they are and how they deserve everything the'restriking for well yamin is in dorsing you a w position but the prom is now the white house is stop beteen a rock and a hard place because as the economy continues to turn south ges he is goting to blame jobid n out thereonthe picket lines it is the easiest ab in the world your car now costs he bunch more than wuld have cost otherwise you knows to blame for that jobinon jobne an blame for that my here is greengeohn puree trying to somehow get out from the sticky position it is hes bi goinng styin worker the picket line the president literally standin wit te in ters o teir seeing contractors pat when your askd about ono the specifics of that you seewe sang yega o one ein to the speci the te disputes o is he not standing wit tem on the terms wit wi their trying to goti i mean to be very cler he is standing with them to make sure that they get a fairshare that is what he is standing with them on he is standing with them and we have said this that that they that we thet they get the record the record a profits mean a recor contract for you a dob that is why he is going that is what he is standing for i they deserve a fairshare f of the value that they helped create that is what the president is say but the details the specifics of what that looks what makes both sides happyo or anything in those negotiate at the negotiation table that is for them to deside that well then what is he doing there it is it the n he has no position on howvis negotiation comes out he is just literally putting on the hat of one of the parties imagine that you have a mediator can tis happens all the time in contractors fusers a mediator imagine the mediator comes in rat's his fe between you and me and he meder comes in wearing a daily wire hat which sides you think he is going to take in that mediation this is ridiculous it is ridiculous but he is ri diculous president of the united states meanwhile the line that is being used here by the democrat is that jobie is able to do this becaue he is overseen a manufacturing renissence here in the united states tebbe stab ano senator from from michigan she saying that that jobidon can take side of the ua dble you because he is bringing manufacturing jobs back to america as one of the big lies that the jobinon tells exploring just a second in fact the rateat which manufacturing jobs our being met our being created in the united states is precisely the same across administrationcs but here is a debby stab in o line an for e all workers what is significance of the president being there to thet well well t's always great to be with all in ei hat e just a y sayng it its sistar that we have presan i says that would be join in with to unin i a at lime she is act shally maninge i overseeng to lartos manutactin an a sin in ohos tr f for all of a in ir li tasr outrating lor co to war to matr ther good pan jobs i' get well that is alie we'n here for example is a chart from the federal res or bank of saint louis of manufacturing jobs that have been created overtime wha he sees thre's a mass of decline an manufacturing jobs in he united states during the reat recession from two thousand ahes to thousanime and then it started to slowly clime and its continue to slowly clime all the way until bout mid two thousand twenty and then the pandemicet and then after the pandemicet it dived and then a kind of increased back to where it was kind of afor no it turns out the manufacturing cobs have not been wildly coming back to th united states under either trump or under jobidon and the reason for that is because of parshally union contracts it turns out its really expensive to do labor in the united states se've had teck up tecks riht people in creding new technologies robotic that is tik if it is that expensive to hire th u a b wy not to build the machines that are going to take those workers off the line in the united states manufacturing sector productivity has more than doubled since nineteen eighty even is employment has fallen by about one third a gain that is that is because machines that is because of new technologies were never can to go back to the nineteen fifties with the percentage o people who are in manufacturing but the notion that the jobiton can stand with th u a u and make labor in the united states more expensive and simultaneously increase the number manufacturing jobs it belies pretymuch all data meanwhile steve ratner who is the oboma administrations cars are actually slam jobitdon for doing all of this i said frm to be going onthe picket lines outrageous there is no precedent for it the tradition of the president is stan neutral in tese things i get the politics the progressives all seid we do not want a mediater one advocate andhe boudst the progressives now he is can go out the and put his thum on the skill en is wrong he is he is in favor of the u a uw getting smore benefits re sett increasingly militant you a double you is it overplaying town with an overly langthy an overly ambitious list of demands is i a prolonge strike which quickly to far more widespread shut downs or auto of autoficilities could juppardize the economic recovery are nearly eight hundred billion dollar auto indistry acounts for three percents of economic output with particular concentration in the mid west were states michican our critical to bidn reelect effort soyin that tobomazon cars ar saing thss is insane you cannot do this meanwhile where did jobidon go and his coalition basically rang out is union heads minorities colgige cat white lit white ladies that that that is the coalition for the democratic party an jobdn was trying to ring all that together he is pent twelve minutes on the picket line according to the free beacon with those autor workers than he headed directly to a fun raiser in california at the home of a billionaire couple that funds the movement to abolish policing say stay ther forlike twelve minutes gone immediately moved over to california to pick up some checks from the rich libs solid stuff there from the president of the united states by the way the economy continues to stagnates according to the walster journal the amounts of cash that you has household piled up after the pandemic struck has shrunk in fact yous household savings exploded after th ph ndemic because the government signing people checks for nothing the question now is how much cash is laft if any according to te walstr journal the easiest way to see what happene to savings in the wake of the pandemic is to look at the personal savings rate messuring the shere of aftertax income that does not get spent in eipril twenty twenty it was thirty three point eight per cent compare to eight point eight per cent over the course of twenty nineteen is state elevated thougout twenty twenty and most of twenty twenty one last yere is just three point five per cent this here it is four point three per cent again that is wag too low one way that economists have tried to figr ow much excess savings are on those household ballance sheets is basically to ad up all the aftertax income that did not get spen since the pandemicket one and mor pessimistic takes out there is from the federal researchers aft the federal reserve bank of san francisco they calculate that excess savings peaped about two point one strillion dollars and august twenty twenty one by the second quarter of this year less than a hundred and ninety billion dollars remain puttng the on pase to be completely depleted in the curren quarter in other words all those savings that people had saved up we burn through it it is pretty much gone and now the fed rate heights our having a significant impact on people's wallets according to the lalstr journal consumers in the market for loanes to buy homes and cars are discovering that because of the federal reserves rate increases theire money gets them a lot last than would have just a few years ago meanwhile those with craticards and other loanes thae carry rates peg to broader bench marks our finding they gut way way way more expensive barrr shopping from mortgages or auto lones are experiencing stick ar shock thirty year fix traght mortgages ar round seven per cent that is up from three per centues to couple of years ago this why their stickiness in the realsday mark and nobody can sell in orderto buy again causeyou are noc in ta selliur house even if you made money on your house ca ten af to end wa seven per cent mortgane bying a home or cara now s completely on affortable for the typical american household these you are mixing the higher barrowin cost of the high prices that marksandy cheef economist and moodi's anolytics the estimates the typical american household the ned use forty two weeks of incomes buy a new car up from thirty three weeks three years ago the national asociation of realters calculates the typical american family can not afford to buy a median price home andthen you wonder by americans are pessimistic about the economy this would be the reason meanwhile the bi andministration doing its best to make even more unlivable is having the ft c su amazon amazon which is the cheapest and easiest way for people to get product in the united states right now is now being sued by lena con who is a wild lefte at the head of the federal trade commission she is trying to sue amazon on the theory that they are effectively a monopoly and using monopoly powers to en richart now the problem of course is that theire two theories o monopoly one is you own to larger per centage of the market the second is that 's harmon consumers name the way in which amazon as harmon consumers they are bringing you products cheaper and faster than any company on planted earth braht now the efty see is going after them anyway why because again a bunch of political allies of jo bydon left ees they they do not amazon it is too big an they wan to break it up that is where the by andeministration is right now and then you wonder why the tude is wildly on popular while that

but we see here it the fact that chicagol cantsistainis chicago cannot answer this crisis because this is the federal governments failure at the border brought to our back yard literally here in the middle the city of chicago in front of a police district as the seen that is been repeated twenty two times over wor we have nearly sixteen hundred people living in police districts in the lobbies an tents and the parkways nno you cannot keep asking cities chicago whether they are sanctuary or not to come up with the solution for the federal governments failure jo bitan comola haris all of congress either get their heads out of their rear ands at's ar focussing what is on what is important and addressing this issue head on and not hoping that it magically disappears wor that you could ignore it or wishit away because that is not working there is a reason that yorbins abruvalrating on emigration is twenty per cent twenty per cent and i imagine that those twenty per cent ar people or immediate members of the biding family because his his policyes exasterary meanwhile present in trum gan thers good issue for him he is been blasting the fact that the bydminstration is begiing free

to they nay he is right about that again bidens immigration house he is general sos his crimepousy the fact that you have an adinistration that his basely sick it is it is attorny general it is doja i'm poleace partmens all over the country has predictable facts including massive crimeways particular comes to mass shop lifting in louding there've takin over america's major cities according to the maniapolistaur tribune target is onceh close nine stores across four states ofis theft and crime there is a sho creemin th black line's matter movement that ended with the police snopping involved in any way in american life and baselye standing aside his people lood stores you mean that damage's business isn an the business is leave no great shok there according to the star tribune target is gin a trun or nine stores across four states on october twenty first piecs of thaft thaft and threats to safety the company announced on tuesday the latest and loudest example of retel re exitig urben locations becaus o crime trgets had amade the dificult decision to close the stores the inclue locations in the harlamn neighborhood of neor city seattle portland and the sanferancis culbararea after target determined that t theft preventative measures had proved in effective the crumpeyes had to trid adding more security includin third party guards a d musing to turne locking on merchandise by the company also said quote we cannot continue operating these stores because thaft and organized retell crime are threatening the safety of our human guests and contributing to unsustainable business performance we know our stores frof an important roll an teir communities but we can only be successful if the working in shopping invironment is safe for all that is insane by the way apparently target says that tey expected inventory shrink attributed to thaftan organized retell crime to reduce the company's profitability by five hundred million dollars this year target stores fy one hundred and twenty percent increase in faft involving violence were threat to violence in the first fie onts of te year that is insane those numbers our raisy the national retail federation which trumpresents retailers across the country reported on tuesday that the average shrunk rate an fiscular twenty twenty two increase slightly to one point six per cent that brought losses to one hundred and twelve point one billion dollars to the industry in twenty twenty two more than forty five per cent of retailers had reduce store ours nearly thorty per cents on altred store selections and twenty eight per cents had closed the location as of crime of violencs an that is all becuse o the blacklives manter movement and the aftermath and the democratic parties in dorsement of lawless policy all a cross americas major cities then these business leave and then it is the business as accused of racism because they are leaving predominently minority areas where the crimerates are highest that is what is happening and then of course it is capitalism they hex blainmed not the lawlessness that has been promoted by the democratic party meanwhile the attacks on president trump are coming fast and furious and two forms of attack they are the legal attacks than there is are the publicity attacks or the legal attacks one ofthe stupidest legal attacks that we have seen is this ridiculous lawsuit by letitia james who is the atterny general in new york who came int off is pledging to get donal trump and then filed note criminal trarges against on trump ish confine anything soinstadg ufil thes civil lawsuit against the trump organization for fraud which was absurd shose basically alleging that they inflated their assats and and thei'r worth in order to get particular lone deals the problem is the lone companies should be one suing the wisely tissue james if the lone company does not the lone that a cut with trump and they think he was fraugulent about it they could to him but the're not suing hims when settleet letitia jamesus while now i judge as ruled the trump committed fraud for years while building the real stand umpire the catipul to him to fame an the whitehouse and you ordered from the former presidents companies removed from his control and isolves judge arthor angaron ruling an a civil laws who brought by the york attorny general ittistu james found that trumpet is company to see banks in surers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggeratig his notworth on paper work used in making deals and securing lons he then u order that frome froms business licences be recended as punishment making an impossible or difficult for them to do business in new york this is ridiculous honestly it it is it is just it is ridiculous apparently the allege that trump has cumpany and kigsacutives repeatedly lied about his riches on his anual financial statements reaping rewards such as favorable lone turms and lower insurance caust those tactics crossed the line and violated the law the judge said re jectin trumps contention that it is claimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wron wrong doing here is the problem i mean who exactly did he defraud and if she defrauded the governmention they woeld ring criminal charges not civil charges on on all of this sort of stuff engarom found for example the trump consistently over valued maralago in flating its value on one financial statement by as much as two thousand three hundred per sent the trurge alsor be trump for long about the size of his man hat an apartment this is this is super week ty ies gan having impac don trump absolly not godjus can go o he is just super rich not superduperduper rich meanwhile the media argogue over the latest to tell all from the trump administration every often a member the trumpin instrection leaves get sweet gig over it sean end by talking about all the juicy stuff that happene during trumps presidency the lates bom shell throw wher is cassity hutchenson now far be it for me to a deny casity hutchenson's truthfulness but i have some doubts the rea that i have somedouts s because she is made multiple claims over the course oh last year or thet turnd out not to be trueso for example greg price has a good run down of this huntwitter hutchinson testified that trump assaulted secre turvicatins and lunge for the wheel of the beasts on january six the member this one that he is i lin to go to the cabital let be got the capla and then in turns out that everybody in the caras not that did not happen and then she allso testified that former white house council pat tibolony personally warned her not to allowed trump to go to the capital or were we are going to get charge with every crime in im aghonable there is only one problem which is that sipoloni was not at the white house when hutchens in clambuwas she testified that she was personally hand ritten note at the direction of barkmeadows but i turns out that was te former trump white house lawyer ar kurseman we said that he had written in particular note hutchenson testified that the former senior justice parben official juff clark strategized with rut juliani andthe trump campaign to object to the election but those wo never met each other she then continued to work four trump a full line weeks after january sex in her private text with friends shereport thathethat were reported by the federalist and daily caller at the time she joked about the rit on january six she said that j six committee was phony and bs and beg trump officials for financial ssistence after sh was sopena by the comittee then she did not receive the financial sistance and ten she turned on trump and wrote this tellal now she has a new book out and a the mediare doing a a nactualln chobselling it for her it is called enough and it has aa big photo of her right down the runk cover which s always the sign of of a person who wishes to shyway frum the limelight i and a her claims include the idea that apparently petty much everybody in her three hundered yard vicinity sexually heraster she claims the rudijulionite she claims the matgatestid i she she claims that a wide bevy of republican figures sexually haraster over her time i'm she also claims that mark meadows s the former trunp chief of staff was guilty about hermincane's deaf ma hermicham was a former publican can he died of covid he had attendsed a rally that trump held andthen h got covid maybe from the rally and dom and she suggests that that again pretty much everybody was very inter her my rude juliani as we say she she claims that he literally sexually assaulted her wat his hand slips up under my blazer then my skirt i felt his frozen finger tips trail up my fige he tilts his chin up the whites of his eyes looked on tis my eye start to johnniesmen who flashes a leering grin ofm there is that she claims tha mackates made a passat her during camp david he claims that he dasshe dated her than she said i would never dat him and all the rest of the stuff and she is at she is making the round she was aske on the view ot widin to a bandon trump sooner and sh i was confused as he lamin maybe the question is what made you abandon trump now and maybe the answer is because one side the ow people people who turn on trump make a lot of money i tried to write the book was intention to bring te reader an t i mi that the time in frenkly it is confuse i an its i was not deliberto confuse the reader i was in this confused fog of it divided littlety knowing what i wante a not tilling a power to threa break away from that this it ex actually mein to floorto wit i after and gan in my higs that now i realize tha this is not no wao not a n thinkin i thas but i tatenualy a a lot of the blam on myself on ciple that had surrounded the president because i felt that it was our jop to ise tan t was our jot to tot o i akin bout to tiss er oh that thati it' it is all it is also self selfless that that is that is hal r saying here and then nom shea she choked up which is what you do in a books or said that dom she she felt that she she was killing people a that asshioned the trumpetmenstration was killing people in the hermin came momen i ta e ly that tha a i me ti os e twenty in my mid ti i was thinking tha this was us we are telling people wa ir an i i knew er in ire tousfle how weare headling ovit ye it dis te sumdiy that was tantible that we atat was ot the rally that we a was abat idea sedwe plosspor to january sex tenuary six happen becauso the inistration because o the former pase because of ister trump heis responsible for the person that was kille that day and my opinion and then she stuck around for nine weeks afterward and talked about how january six with beaff there is that meanwhile rachel man i was giving her the red carpet treatment and in asked her about all the the creepy claims of the sexual her assment in her book and wlek i say she makes lik a bunch of these sorts of glames i mas sucens on one of the a cla is in your book that receive some im attension ahead of publication im is an allegation you make that is ridyjuliani effectuivally groped you im at the trump rally on january sixth you say that he im reached his hand onder your blazer and then under your skirt im mister juliani spokes person has called this a desgusting lie against maor juliani he gave us that statement again himself to night i was struck by the fact that he was not the only one im page fifty two of the book you say that john baner of all people im look down at my cranburry vadkaand whisper dark liquor or red wine from now on then he tugged on the ends of my hair saying and lose the pony tail you describe the president and this is not groping this is not physical that you describe im tis telling you to add blond hi lights to your hair which he then went home and did and came back i hous the next day that does not happen in normal ises im dis ti iary eli lid ot on yes at is the whole world out there and i get fired for doing stuff that we ththere is an entire economy if people whove made a living off of of telling the tell alls after after serving the trump administration which is agand the me i's han envisgan dot damage promp not really told baked into the cakement it is itis pretty amazing it itis pretty incredible stuff s there is only shalso claims that to trumples o cam with my pencs being hanged wech can people of arny testified the ayea the trump asi laded nothing in the white house is nemerly adding anything here by don she claims that done that trump ashe was cheering on the hanging which is certainly forthen anybalse is gone i hear him say hang repeatedly hang hang what is that about mark hansis phone back to me the cue for me to return to my desk back in my office my phone notifies me of a trump tweat my pents did not have the courage to do what should have been done to contry in our constitution giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts not the frodul intor inaccurate one which they were as to previously certify you essay demands the truth catchenson continues i'm struggling the process wats happening as mark patsipoloni pat philman and ar cershman stumble back to the office i overhear their conversation and suddenly everything make sense they are calling for the vice president to be hanged the president is o key with it he does not want to do anything he does not think they are doing anything wrong he thinks mike is a traitor this is crazy we need to be toing something more and ye alvis is crockadile yours little belad yere from cacity hungons in and come on o ga time for som quick things i lak in thin some things that i hate things that i that he do not there is a republican to mate to night now down trump is leading the feel by leaps in bounds the question is going to be exactly wat is the purpose of this to mate the the number of candidates onstage he is now down tyo seven it obviously shuld be lower than that the number of true candidates even for the umber two slout right now he is a actively te santis hayly scot romasuamy pence ancresty rantis it is effectively sex it is it is burgham isgoin to be there an listen ienjoy dug bergham as much of the next as much of nhex political jrunkey but whys he takin up time nobody really knows yeththethis debate wewell see what the ratings are for it right now the puls ar trung trum far and awaiy in the lead in every major state nicky haley has slipped into a second place position in new hampshire when it comes to iolad to santus is far and away in the in the second position over therest of the field no real good pulling day to coming out from south carolina as of yet trump is ahead there nicky haly isin second there but bonline is trump is lapping the field hes way the hellaead what dis everby need to do to night well men the feeld has to contolidat somehow ore the thing going to be a race somebody is got to get knocked out you presume that there is can be a lot of fire there asn't any fire train on to santis in the last to bate but i thin the other candidate sense blood in the water the presumblegan go after to santus to santus meanwhile is going to need to presume ly fend off those attacks and make the case as to why he is oin o be he best candidate to be jobiden and that the more that trunk continues to lead in the race the less these debates seem to matter to be perfectly frank with that sad tiet'll be fascinating to see the internal politics here because basically right now it seems everybody as sort of running for second and then waiting for trump to fall down it seems a lot people are waiting for the indictment to come through or for trump tashre get arrested again i mean fully or convicted or never it is going to be and may be that will nock him down and then somebody sort picks up the slack here such fascinating to see the lobster scrum the crab pot as everybody tries to pull each other back down i into the outomashi most of the income is coming for to santis to day we will see how thetcoes to night o a we will cover it obviously to morow time for a quick thing that i hate not's very farm is a place for children wwhenever people on the ell gube tokeep pluss manis bn by time left sy they are not coming for o the kids and to train

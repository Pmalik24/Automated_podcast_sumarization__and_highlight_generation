a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in to day's episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websight this american life doutowork david what problem was dis supposed to solve the teachers were trying to get the kids to stop tattling and why was that important cause it is a prekat class room and it is constant there right i should say by the way that you are david castenboum you are one of our producers ar managing editor right now and up and athis a classroom is your kids classroom right they have both of them went there i stodn't get it seems kids tattling on each other is just a fact of pre kay it is but you got twenty something kids i mean it is hard being one parent with two kids doing it imagine you are in a classroom th twenty kids and if they bring it to you as a teacher all these little in justiceas you got to get involves in all these cases right age jus a timesock yes just the timesock and one of the teachers had this great idea she took a tissue box hung it on the wall and then took this plastic phone receiver and hung it in it and said something that is the tattlephone tell it to the phone and i thought it was just brilliat and i just one t say this is a place that loves kids i would go to pick up my son max and i would have to wait because you would want a hug every single teacher and i go to get oggy are older kid and youould be any five minutes vn the middl e something they jus en a stay longer i i m i get choked o think about this place and i loved the idea of the tatlephone just as as a vessel for all the little injustices that go on every day and i wanted to hear what was said into it these little three year olds for yer olds talking into this plastic phone oke and i should say this is the part of the story i knew very well what happens next we asked if we could put a phone in the classroom that would record the tattles the day care was find with that i reached out to the parents i did not now they were oing to feel about thus recorting their kids it the worst moment of the day but every single one of them said yes some of them said please yes do this aso we got a phone it was this chunky red phone can i nineteen eighty style we had it set up to record and we needed an ow going message for it and up and that is where i stepped in peter you reach the tatlephone o a tell me what happened after the beat ho me the whole story a i realy apt makeim and rods in that for your owd market i reay that hos a ritings and what were gongto do now david is that you'r ging to explain what you heard on those recortings on the tatlephone and when you are done i'm goig to come back and a'll explaine what to day show us about i brought the fone into class and i said it out the kid started to use it immediately and with great enthusiasm i o me o a i har i non i ery a i i katch that one nathin farded in my face and i said yach nathan but the real crim a n i thiktere was enormous excitement just having a phone in the class it was larger than they probably ever seen in their lives bright red with buttons on it it was an old touch tone phone every one wanted to use it even if they did not have a tadtle kid sang a song into it one tried to order a peats a some one said i'm on please pick me up early a i y a a o no how i ha aoa ge a a wy a a ah i i meat my you arn several calls later conscience heavy that kid calls back i o a na the tattlephone was a magic portal into one preeschool classroom in america which is kind of incredible most parents itl ask my kids what happen in school to day they get nothing school is this black box it drop them off pick them up and you have no idea what happens in between but now i had this phone ie was set up would send me the messages as they happene here is funny listening to them from my desk the portel into this class room ould open for a second i get this little report from a kid a little sound of the room and then it would close sometimes for a while then the porter would open i'd hear something and then silence again there are never any tattles between one and three ofclock because that was naptime then they start again thes little dramas om oi o ma ma ma ma er an a n a no a a e i a ma ein ni a no no a me my friend some one it is always their friends who are bugging them my o wa ma ni wi o a aryi that me ey a a a me no wn n a o i o a e can me can i just say i'm much sure that one is actionable you are pretending to sleep and complaining that someone is waking you up i do not know i no ai ow on how much their day is about a justice oh i could not put to put a per centageonit but i could say the majority they d this is cathlene jones the lead teacher in the class it is everything is it is a rules they lived by rules they can sit down to play game and the whole playtime well be nothing but arguing about the rules and then there is no playtime left and they feel good about it is funny they cannot make breakfast to themselves they cannot get dresse they can barely talk and end thered they are just full f that is not fair thebut their dynamos every one of them has something that it is yes exactly it is a some they are wonderful there is actual scientific research on this kid's know when something is unfair some when they are just twelve months old my kid's were not even walking them and i know this is kind of obvious but many the conflicts in this world come down to some version of what is c going on in this class room what is fair how d ye divide up something that there is a limited quantity of magnetiles we only have one tha crilic one that is yellowish goldish that is it that is the pries in the class who ever gets that is on the king or the queen and hha the gold that is what they callt the gold i sometimes think that the main usefulness of numbers for my sunmack how reason he knows how to count is score keeping how many s something he has and how many his brother has it is a waing of the scales of justice no matter how tiny ddo work for you did they stop coming to you with their complye yes it it it does work yes that phone holds a lot of tower gave the teachers the break they were looking for i wanted to see if the kids thought it worked whether the tattlephone helped them deal with stuff the other we cand i interview to munch of them which i have to say these were sme of the weirder interviews i 've done in my professional life bob woodward i know this is not right but i had to pay one interviewy a piece of gum another kid nickey insisted on performing magic tricks before granting an interview i did not have high expectations ia fi o ore wait that worked really well wait that was actually amazing io that was good we nickey then refused to talk about the phone at all but others clearly used it a lot ye ti tell da tattle phone theho staappen that is gabriel this is denia tell me the hole st tats ik an o lenber one girl's parents told me that they were on vacation staying at a hotel which of course hatle landline fhone and their daughter some one said look a tattlephone as if there was some sort of national tatlephone network staffed around the clock my government workers entering everything into a data bas my friends kid shan who just turned five and who i a dore was the only one could remember a tattle wordhthe event from school in any detail he whispered it to me hofs clearly kind of excited about this his friend it kicked him why kii ki youat the petes ti you alt the tatlephone t i tat tat wa o a the tattlephone if you at the tattlephoe whic youftsounds it might have been an accident shaun stood up and acted out the whole thing in slow motion for me s lochy it was the scene from an action mov his friend was trying to kick the ceiling wes attlthis should have security camerin the classroom but tey do not i do not just the tattlephone he a bonche kids told me they felt good after talking to the tatlephone though though why it made them feel better it took all my interviewing skills this is gabriel how did you having the tattlephone in the classroome good how did it feel after you said something to the tatlephone gid how come you felt good ah the tise wel i felt od be tis i tol on the presin one girl told me talking to the tattlephone felt eating ice cream it is nice lto think that just getting someting off your chest consolve a problem that if you just released the fact of the injustice into the world we feel better an shure o i think they can be true but we hade the phone an class for a month and i did notice toward the end we got fewer messages they came in regularly but not with the same energy it is possible the novelty was wearing off i think there something else going on as wel before we put the phone in the class i had it set up in my house just to make sure it was working my kids used it a coupletimes and then our younger son max was complaining that his brother ogy who is a year older and pinched him tell it to the tattlephone i said it is not working he told me i picked the phone upward that there are some technical glitch but his fine its working max no he said it is not i did not do anything i tha to the evenal work to me dai teduidy n it listen to your tattle not dat remeing it listen it it did it it gains sho on kpinchin me it did not stop oky pinching me i know acts i know sometimes you want more than just to speak yeu want actual justice then ye dimit your ok and that brings is to what are we twelve minutes into the program it brings this to what we are doing to day on our show tet may way have people some of them young some of them old wanting justice feeling a sense of in justice on things as big as the constitutional foundation of our entire country and things as small as the question of whether a ball is in or out and in all this cases people young and old not trusting the system to deliver justice ten mybe easy chicago it is this american life stay with us a one who preams the journalist michael leis who ru money ball in the bing short in lots of other books and who contributes to our programm now and then he was looking round at what is going on an america these days and he notice that one way you can describe the current moment that we are all living through is it americans do not trust the rafts in all walks alife the do not trust their impartiality i talking bout police supreng put justices journalists the people regulate the banks of wall street an student lones thet people sitting medical coss judges many people to day filled the systems rage i men burning sanders an downal trump both round on that many people feel that the figures of authority charged with enforcing rules impartially keeping everybody on lever playing field that ther failing at their jobs it is not fair michael leis as not publish this reporting that is been oing on this and a new book he is decided to make it into a pod cast it wanch to this week it is called against the rules michael has adapted daversion of their very first episode for us to play for you right now the first episode is about people not trusting the rafts in the most literal sense of that it is about basketball raperies here is michael is for me this story really begins with my eleven year old son walker he plays on a basket balt he run by a japanese buddhist temple my son isn'n a buddhist the most of the time he could pass for one he has no conflict with his teachers or his class mades or his japanese buddhist tea mates i would not say his mind is exactly pure but usually it is com the exception is when he deals with rafts even in what amounts to a buddhist basketball gay then he time a reuh blows the whistle and them he throws up his arms in astonishment then he jumps up and down wih his little fist bawled up his mouth clench tight everyone knows just how much in justice he suffering then he marches off with a scowl tan e does not get over it after a gain this season he gets into the car it starts bitching and moaning all over again how did it make you feel whet the reft made those calls ay now do you feel any better now no tell me hout feels yes someone he is poking n about the show annsaing fow how fow fo have you ever fould out in your career no did that you ware risk o felligout yes but ouson if i din't it would be onfat because i knew that he was calling stobiti spouse hull up bakin ali's bohe househole clay wit the fclay with a bethe thing is i know why my son does what he does he thinks he is clay tomson the all star shooting guard of the golden state warriors when clay hit is a three clay pounds his chest and points to the sky ind when walker louis it is at three he too pounds his chest and points to the sky when clays called for a fowl he scowls and throws up his arms in astonishment the sometimes even says something to the rest that gets him slapped with the tchnical fau ian clays the famously most laid back all star in the entire national basketball association something has happened in the relationship between referies and players of the last i guess year to that is remona schelbern she is covered the en ba for the last decade for ys p n it is been quite frankly ugly this year one of the warriors head blooded a reft another chucked his disgusting mouth guard all for reft's chest and some of the stoff i've see when tram on green is is getting fine for calling barnahole capin can we cuss on your bok ask i think we are he hae you i fucking bench when when he is saying that to a few mole referet man that is next level and i have not seen that before at this season it it is the stars now who are really pushing theassiu right it is caven doran getting thrown out af gains its staff curry getting thrown out last year bad behavior got various golden state warriors tossed out of ten different basketball games caven derand their best player got thrown out of five four more than had beenthrown out of his entire career up to that point the men who coached the stars are not much better even steve cur the warriors famously decent civic minded coach i can snap i can completely lose it if you back away from the goldstate warriors i mean theyre exemplers of the way people should behave othe especially or stars they impackably behave people i'm pleased to have my son emulating your pliers the only time they have problems really is with referies yel i cannot imagine you in your life have another relationship you have with referies now heure right you are right i would never say the things said i do to referies to a a person and normal life it happens two or three times in year vebeen caught on camera yow av othing a rough an ynow my daughter will some your tacs i that which do when it is olliver twitter i can read your love sis suberrit and and i'm embarrassed why is that now it is a sensof ight a wrong an o ie i feel ther othis personal fats something unfair as happening womathe players get find if they talk about the rest we will not be talking to him but 's not just then ere their coaches or my son who are treating refts in ways that never treat an ordinary person it is the fans in every arena whos been meaning ful amounts of their time looking for the refts mistakes on the jumbertron it is the cable sports channels playing and replaying the reft's mistakes their viewers can tweet and retweet about hem it is this entire infor structur seemingly built the focus attention on whatever mistakes the reft's make for the sole purpose of generating ora there is one thing that ou nights americans just now it is their belief that the reft suck which is werd because they almost certainly suck less than ever before before you hate me for saying that give me a moment to show why were walk across a parkin lot in scaucus new jersey and there chain hotel in motels in some one's idea of am all and wis rate on all sides by freeways it is what people think about when they tell jokes about new gers a and the prushing aa fore story rectangular otherwise non descript concrete build there is a discreet little sign here that says n b a and shows a logo with he basketball player inside a recent consession to the world we live in the replac center a place where basketball referees review the calls made by other basketball referes in real time to minnimize refere errar row the replay center was built to persuade people that life was fair and the door is locked i no no some one eventually unlocks the door and leads me down a hall filled with a lot of old basketball stuff jersy is in bobble heads in basketballs and posters of michael jorgan the replay center where the altimat man cave i ma game it is also the latest weapon in the battle for fairness this place just on first vo is amazing it really it is wall to wall screens one hundred and ten of them hit is on them is whatever is captured by all the cameras in twenty nine env a arenas across the country they may have a screen somewhere with scores on it but i did not see it and they are all muted which you her is referees staring at basketbal games which you see is nothing but angles on professional basketball corts nobody's hove a walked in here walk ownside is plac suck that is joe borgia whose run the center son's two thousand and fourteen sbefore he volunteered for a sacaucus done he referede anb a games his father was an envi a reft before him with break in the late sixties a borgia has been reffing professional basketball games since nineteen forty six if you went back to your dad at the beginning of his career and said this is what its cat look what you think het a said if i told them we would have replat eternalveran is gray forget about a replace center it is at right o absent you see the reft used to insist on their authority and every one agreed that there was no better way to insure the fairness of the game than to let the reft play god the replac center is an admission the reft is not god that he makes mistakes i think the mention of replay none of us them won we first heard it it is a necessary even it is necessent you half to half it to tat everything's tape now every one pays more attention to the referees mistakes the enb has to as well now when a reft thinks he mighthave screwed up some call or did not get a good look at the actions what'h the reffreon botoma screthe twirls his fingers in the air there ou su that is the signal to the reft in the replac center who goes to work reviewing the tape looking for the best angle to figure out would actually happen jerder ree e you god ai l w that is the first one the other on you g go the refts here sit dressed in black staring at screens waiting for a signal from somewhere in america the end of games is when they get most involved because that is when fans and coaches and players a most likely to a cu some wret of having made the mistake the change the outcome of course a mistake at the beginning has just as much effect on a game as a mistake at the end but the end is what people noti is and get outraged about the justice that the end of the game must be more exact than it is at the beginning the is replace tat a refts have vidio technicians with him who can freeze a moment on screen then zume out resume in that the entire screen contains only a player's finger tips or is toes here you just scroll through tiny slivers of the game not the game itself the sliver is wearying justices might o cur but in good de scrace is tif you don hav slow motion and her frees fran s very diffeclt the course in slow motion you can see things that the naked i misses magicians sometimes perform during half times of the envi a games when joe bore just slows it down he can see how they do their tricks it is kind of the same thing with the players exactly i a as sixtioth of the seckin of the time st is o tik a low loble i thet these players are getting good at its great octical allusions it thet a cestie sort f the sort of things an a magician dt all is not slopping an optical illusion flopping is what they call it when a player pretends to ave been knocked over by another player tricking the refts into making bad calls is now consider desill the possible fanger there is blood on the screens keaven loves front tooth got knocked in love plays for the cleavelind cavaliers and the question is di the guy who popped him in the mouth do it intentionally we are look cinfer the onmattual tdiy throw is elbow out the rests need o decide if the violence was not just excessive but unsportsman which sounds our ca ause we sort of lost the concept the fouler we the fouers on catalop it that he was out as id will not heres motin osly am i o quick onde no in blik im that yet sugly the players all stand around scratching themselves while the refts put on headsets and talk to the replac center the blood does not slende decision wat at i lon conbact o loto wit ax an ou i withaxi the only thing stopp in the replace center fror checking every decision is that it slows the game down here in sicaucas they still tryng to figure out how they might talk to the refts as they run up and down the court cause if they could do that to gou just fix every call on the fly the spescial forces we found aut we actually use a chipol from the bowler that work off the vibration on the ball leven not we that we we got a handful of geny re fres alded and we test te that to wear chip over their moe but iit was not od enough because they did not know where the voice was coming it as ust a place in their heads it in a warr one i that a coaks cocket gets insame the time and money now being spent to insure the fairness of what after all is just the basketball game a jilian miles the fibra optic cable connect this room directly to the envi arenas around the country all for two calls again at two calls agan fifteen million dollars to build e two calls qecty gan but you got to do it e got to do it can i just paus here a moment just to consider what the envia has done in the past few years to improve the calls for example they brought in serious managers to hire and train the reft jo borger calls his balls the general because she actually was a general end inear force pilot her name is michell johnson and before she supervized enbe a reft she ran the air force academy it sounds overkill to use a general to make sure basketball games ar well reftbut the enbi a thought it needed overkill saijuster mice the ore at least atam silver the envia commissioner did if people do not believe that the leag office is unbiastan that the officials are on byus you can have er probem regardless of the acracy of the calls people watching at home were scrutinizeing every call on their phones and their teves they ad just enough information to be suspicious of the league there is eightee n cameras covering every game that there is eighteen thousand people watching games with suffisticated smartfalns that have high definition audio an vidio we started to get into trouble silver took over in two thousand and fourteen and all hired joe borger to run the replace center since then he is taken a ridiculous amount of grief just for trying to improve the justice on a basketball court here is what else silver is done he is brought en the pool of people from which refts are selected they use to be mostly white men mostly from the same back rat at one point for n b a reft came from the same high school he is hired more black refts and female rafts he is insisted that referes be physically fit they can get into position to see all the plays while everyone else in america's getting fatter the rfts are getting buff they are also now getting new feed back on all their bad calls silver decided to publish the mistakes made by every reft in the last two minutes of every game everyone could see them he gives the teams and the refts a private document listing every refering mistake all this new data on refts means that we an they now all sorts of strans things about their minds frinces we now know that their calls have tended to favor which ever teams losing the calls also favor the home team some large part of home court ed vantage is just the refts the analytics department of the uston rockets has even done a study that shows that the home team that gets the best calls is the utaw jabs why you talk who knows but you can be sure that some one will figure that out the is now basically a small army of geeks analyzing all this new data ooudern't really riding pipe is about sports federat in vat the economy that is just in wulfers a behavioral economists at the universy of michigan and the co author of a paper about enb a refts but the thingis disisa deman way the inbia referies hav tremendousin sendems not to make the wrong col i'm every error they make is tract thus eir is determined wheter they get mol game thuge games determined how much they get pite this is oguably the most analyzed work forse in the country basket ball referees are now picked up part in ways that not long ago would have seem preposterous not just for the fairness of their calls but for their unconscious behavior wulferis took data from over a decade of enb a basketball games more than two hundred and fifty thousand of them then he set out to look for evidence of the reft's raciel by us the question here is not whether people are are noty black or an'ty white but whetthers an ingrit byus i'm if it if e predomently black team is playing and the refering crew is predomently white they molfals called against them than on nights when the same tam is playing wetthe podomently black referin crew in it suns at the answers yes wulfers wrote his paper back in two thousand seven before this new age of referee transparency well it was a bit of lessin famai you can prubly told by my accent mocalom an australian i thag it was intrieting pace of social science turned out the the neal times put on the front pige and the enb a was not happy the commissioner at the time attack the study and embarrass the league by trying and failing to refute its findings this morning well hear from the en be a commissioner davids stern i referee ot the most revewed most rank at mos rated and that why we take eception to what the times id here that stirred on en piar in two thousand in seven the result of all this coverage every single referee was made aware of his unconscious by us when the dust settled just in wulfers was curious to know if his paper had had any effect he made another study of refere's after the controversy he would created an guess what the mistration study that we did seems to suggest that that fom of ricial by us is gone a whyet for a while anyway he has no idea why maybe simply making the r t's aware of the problem was enough to correct it by the way the enbia disputes the study too but in the end this became a case study not in ref an aptitude but in regh reform in be a rafths if now achieved whet police forcons can only dream of though the rafths have no choice the world's now too good at seeing their mistakes look there is no way any basketball referees can be perfect but there is also no way these refts or anything but more accurate than they have ever been i mean even whome court advantage means less than used to and yet these refts are treated as if the're trying to ring the games it isthe sound of those eighteen thousand people screame atter ar booing you di the sound any different than it sounded when you started y there is there is a little more anger involve than it used to be sort o of the garden variety you terrible you sawk any of those kinds of terms that is mony mc cutchen who start a refing in nineteen ninety three and got to see first hand the effect that the arrival of the inner net has had on referies a few years back i twitter exploded and game five of of the mimy heat no cama city ah thunder ar finals from years ago one of the players hit a three point shot mc cutchen was giving the signal for three and running to beat the players back to the other end of the court when he realized he would lost his balance falling for a refre it den get much more embarrassing than that it is it is bad people are on tyoure pretty goods and i'm i'm trying to hold it up and eric was on the side line and he sees me fall eric is eric polstera the my enemy heatcoach nd he sort of just stood on to the floor and braced me and our arms sort of and are locked as he braced me it righted me i yell out thinks as i go on by and i run on down to the base line im after the game twitter exploded that the imbea is rigged if you do not believe that watch money mc cutchan give a high five teric polstura after this three and the reality of that which is far and away wrong up against this real human moment of just a reactionary thing that a good person does for another good person you see some one falling you help them not fall he says that when he started out reffing no one would have even noticed if they did it would not have mattered that is changed mistakes get made is in be a referees and they are just mistakes but they often get interpreted in this this wider scheme of thought process that a lot of our cultures i's dealing with rigt now which is there must be a fix him there must be a reason for this do you think the world is looking for a fixed more now that it was when you started im i think that the te shirt i saw recently has merit i'm not saying that your fault i'm saying i'm blaming you he feel abused yeh now people do their research they thethings are out there on the aner net they know your record with it with their team they they have done all there is all these sights on all these if they know parsonal things about you i'll sure of course some deat threats are made from time to time and play off series and you will get security all the way to to both the hotel and then the hotel the next morning out to the airport they security to the hotel not every night but when those threats are or unknown factor it has happened in my cereer i'll security to your car is manditory every night it is some point you feel this question rising up in you in me it rose up while i was talking to remota shelburn the ys pian reporter why would anybody want ta be a raft seriousthy i wonder that too you knowitey the're not a lot ti tay anything hey're not a lot tof explain hemselves and not a lot to defend themselves look obviously th hey get paid they started a hundred and fifty grand a year and if they are grate at their job and work extra games they can make as much as five hundred but ther're lots of ways to get paid without spending half your life in hotel rooms and the other half being insulted by a renas filled with crazy peopledo you think the referings gotten worse or better i shou thing as gotten better of course it is gotten better how could it not have the mystery is why the stars an the coaches in the fans actins if it is gotten worse sitting in the ind bea replace center an som calcus new jersey i get a huntred by that u after i see all these people on all these teve screens jumping around and holering at reft the ruchas appears to be confined to cleveland but in here it feels the entire universe is disturbed there is a reason for this le bron james is upset shek 's argument there yos whyn jeu's going from reshe reft e shings to know which rest to argumeit with arm a goltant there talkon bo ther yon er man i think ther migh chans the chamgees changes an enother yo had t best angle you think thit iwe brod janes has any effect doing that oh the rugh an cleveland is not twirreling his finger there is no signal to us to do anything in the replace center the bronze drama strictly speaking is pointless it is strange the way these players argue they must think that if they make life unpleasant enough for the reft you will think twice before the next callin eviewin that bontng you sir it is then that it occurs to me just looking around the room at a hundred and ten tves screens i've had a hard time following the games never mind the scores i sometimes do not even know which teams are playin but every time up player gets up into a referes face i've recognize the player and i actally do not know that many anbeing players but i know all the ones who pitch these hisy fits butcause the only players getting up into the faces of the refts are the famous players or the coaches who protect them remona shelbern put her finger on it the more agressive behavior towards reft is not coming from every player it is coming from the stars it is just different then in the pass and when you are a star i think there is this feeling tht you sort of risen above reproach you get used to a certain level of treatment you get used to people who treat you that way and then you feel you should be treated that way they'v refere an referete to that person comes as a shelk oh yah now it is wwhen at with any star in any celebrity there comes a level of entitle me anybody who goes against that who does not treat you a star it is put in to that hater category tyou wont o understand the way the refts are treated stop thinking of them as people just doing their best to try to make a game fair and start thinking of them as haters we just got really interested a very simple question of das this sense of being privilege make you disobey the rules of the road of the laws of the land that is dacker keltner he is a professor of psychology at caw berkely and some one who wonders about the effect inequality has on people's behavior it experience i had it berkley wheres ritin my back up this hill and i and i got to the forka stops in and i was half way through thi forway stops on the sky an a black porceedis rolls through the stopsiit is half way there it is a foot away from you about to take me out he is on itselfa and i looked at im i i dread to take him on aribody this is tit and and what was most telling about this whole experience was he looked at me as if i was in the wrong and i should get out of his way even though i'd made it trough the stopsine first dacker in a colleague dreamed up this weird experiment they hid two berkley under raduates in the bushes near four way stopsins the under grads noted the makes of all cars coming through the intersection the sign them numbers one to five according to their market value a new merscades was a fime behond o was a three and an old pacer was a one we position o birk the under grad buy a pedestrian on and we make sure they look they wan across the street a there sort of leaning in to the pedestrian own where it is required by california law to stop it is a game of one on one the california crosswalk one car verses one pedestrian and a zero percent of the drivers of poor cars a zum through the pedestrians on they all stop and fority some odd percent forty five per cent of the drivers if the fine than fives taid rich cars blaze through the pedestrian o and you say the rules do not apply to me i'll carry o othis one study led to a bunch of others that showed basically the same pattern of human behavior nowtheir experiment we bring people to the lad and as their leaving a there is this big ball of candy and it is it it says on it for the children of the institute of human development aon the ball and we haw yun t tike a candir tif y as you are leaving and well to we count up how many candies they take after they iigfarmet privilege people grab a big handful of candy compared to poorer people let us turn the conversate something much more importai's basketball most te pardon of all in the last five or six years the enbie is embarked on essentially a dramatic reform of refering at the same time the friction between the players and some of the owners and some o the coaches ye and the refts its going through the route a the source of the out rage is the star players o people getting thrown out a games are cavin to ren steff curry and james hardon a and the warriors the most famous team ever walk on the court are the chief culprits exhibitay in bad behavior towards refts youv got this weird combination yeh not as fascinating ye a i still remember being a lakers fan you have the great magic johnsanteams and watching lary bird do his nine stap lay ap and i'mo come ot make the call you afor most players of his era that would have counted his travelling bhe glarry bird was lebran the new mercades of his day he played with certain assumptions about the rules and how they applied to him the inequality on a basketball court it is morfout it is profound it it is more profound that was not laury birds era yi got larry bird was a millionaire lebradjines might be a billionareye and a these guies are global franchize ye youv got in a funny way a microcosm it can nod microcosm on a basketball cord wat's going on the larges society the envie is set out to reft the games more objectively more accurately more fairily this is enraged the stars in their fans and coaches you wanted a whi here is what i think the star is used to get more calls in their favor than they do now just because they were stars objective refts have eliminated some of their privilege the more objectivity there is the less power they have and to them that is outrages i think american life just now has at least one thing in common with basket ball the authority of its referes is under attack if people do not trust the refts one day you wmake up in a world that seemes not just unfair but actually sort of rinked that is it is incapable of becoming fair because the people who benefit from the unfairness have the power to preserve it boon do you you flip the switchiin a hundred and ten scrans go dark i'm all the lall small streeg di you manualy bies we ge we rem most nights jo bord ost stays at the replace sentere until almost two in the morning just him in a couple of graphs staring at tiny slivers an bascupall games trying to impose justice on powerful people who do not want it they a much i i muth suh another s o muc o

young bord o naturally becomes a referythe next he does not one day most people think the refts are more or less fair for at any rate they do not spend a love time blaming them for all their problems the next dy they wake up terratical in a quality the people on top the eleas think their special they behave as people do when they think their special young people emulate them without even thinking about it they just assume that is how you act if you are star or whan a be my first question is why when you hit a three point shot which you often do why in the past if you pauledyour chest and pointed to the sky i did not begave the people on the ania in meiated it would you think they are doing it what oesnit mean i do not know yous a'm cool do you believe in god no i i knew what any nowi knowin it meant but now i do not what does it mean tasiclates thank you gon for hidting at three point shot do you do you think god was responsible when colike topson in ethree point shot did be honest if galways watching over everybody wwhenever they hant astay point shot i do not think he that he would be able tilie actualate ma make them make the shot do you have anything you to say to the referies of the world before we turn this recorting off do not pig sides unless it is my sde thank you michael lois is nou potcast against the rules covers all kinds of institutions in america where people do not trust the rest any more it is made by pushkan industries find it wherever you get your potcast o coming oup taning to grapples with the document is supposed to enforce fairness above all others ofm talking about the united states constitution that is in a minute from chicagobobo gradio went our programme continues tis mari com li from mor glass to day's programme no fair stayes about people young and old oliver our country feeling a sense of injustice feeling wronged and not getting satisfaction from the people in charge we hav arrived odat to our programme at two the fairer sect for this act that is go to broadway to show it now that stretch with this true story i when i fifteen ears all y woul travel the contry giving feets os about the constitution an american leads an halls for prize money the to thi wi the ste mean bnt o by my mal thel me pay for college i i would travel to big tites bi tan er an not fras an al i i would givis peets when a holl i o money an men bri bo to but my mittle fi to the posit bot for later this is hidy shrack and t show what the constitution means to me i ruve this shell it is totally original in what it is about in and how i tellus its story its ry funny it is a very patriotic show in this totally uncorny way in the show a higtystreck recreates the idealistic speech that yhou gave at fifteen that woner and nof money to pay for her whole college education ad that she talks about the constitution and about her own life our show to day is about fairness and a hidysrak to be cleer says that hor fifteen year old self definitely saw the constitution as a powerful instrument in forcing fairness i believed it made our contry fairer more equal more democratic i believe that wholeheartedly at fifteen at fifteen you said you said that is a kid you had a crush on the constitution yes what is that mean i is really excited by it i i was a fery idealistic am nurty young person and researching and reading about the constitution my doubt is the history teacher and talkd very passionately about the genius of this document and it is ability to of alve and and to somehow surpass and a rectify the un the flaws of its founders this idea that there was a document that could be created by flod peopl the could be better than the people who made it when you said tha i reminded this of this famous cot from bil clenwere he said and if ithing it is such a beautiful quote to we said there is nothing that is wrong with america that what is right with america cannot fix yes i mean frederic douglas has the similar quote which is that yes the constitution was founded on the creat evil compromise of slavery but that it also containd the means by which we could rectify that evil and insto your play is is partly about that hopeful feeling that you had about the constitution when you were a kid yes but also how you came to see it when you became an adult as a deeply flod document am you talk in the play about how especially the constitution and american law really did not address things that effect you and members of your family s es women in your family yasd a long time and when it did finally get around to addressing a women it was lait and it came to it kind of kind of acreakaly n vercryaly large section ofthe play we talk abut how how to get women to be covered by the constitution wawyers in the justices had a kind of juryrig women in to having rights using for temple the ninth amenmen comat yeu jou just explain what the ninth amenment does sure sure the ninth amendments which was my favorite as a kid says a the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or dispairage other rights i just te i for readyoun ysang you are just for setting that frim ryo residing from memoriaaat a wha tecnically shall not be consored to deny or disparage others retained by the people meaning that just becaus a certain right is not un explicitly given to you in the constitution i does not mean iyou do not have that right this amendment alows for the fact that the founders coul not have imagined the future that were living in now wen's the admitting it its thing every possible thing in this one doc you right i also to think that in three hundred years they knew that the world would look very different and ind in the play though you say tactually li get this thing to a ply to women just as william o douglas has to come up with the concept which is strange and promised poetic this idea of the panumbra right what his upo number here i am standing in telife and there you are sitting in the darke and a this space between us this space righ here partial illumination the shadowy space fate here this is o panumba william a duglas ilo tat his chenoera mat oforeign said that you could therefore ttink it tu this idea that somewhere in the shadows of the constitution we are in the ekindo in between shadowy space are our rights we have not yet named you could use the nint amendment to essentially shine a little light into the dark corners and say ocame over there and then is you sand to show the nint amendment combised with the fourteenth amendment in a kind of wonder toin howascivatian mummar yes to decide raverses way but as but the nintomemen is also of the way the birth control gets legalized in the sixties and and was hear when heare an andos now from the play can and this is where you talk about how that came about and it begins with you explaining how you an a friend gods birth control yes the same year you wer ingis contest when you were fifteen aryument qen penr i neether of us were having sex yet but we just we wanted to be on birth control just in case just in case we were in a hot tob and and and thaas firm swile up an attack us oe i mean you can laugh but be careful fir ou knowin case of a real attack i whan i do realise of the time is the firt control had only bem wegal for all women in this country for about fifteen years i neen i was fifteen i thought i hade been legal since tha the down of time but no no in nineteen sixty fi this incredible women a tou reswell got herself arrested for despensing i udees to poor women at her connecticut planned parenthood she face the year in prison talk her case all the way to the supreme court and this this is actually when william o douglas first pulled out his big ponumber metaphor this is money said for the first time that one thing the constitution surely guarantes is the right to frivace and that this alows a women to put in an i udee as long as she is married and as long as her husband says that it is ogay this la very scaryg moment for william o douglas because im nobody understands the night amendment nobody ex sep for me at fifteen jus is gilly us said hedenng a remember studying it in law school but they had to dig up this amendment that nobody understands because here was just no other way to de with the female body because theyl wanted to make birth control egl they did they wanted it becas well becaus i found out that william o douglas who is my hero when i was fifteen just as william douglas was sixty seven and he was having an a fair with ha tone ty two year old college to i'm thinking right they thay wi to find awan to get the firth control flowing act te arabella can you play at as snipet of the as supremcourt recourting this is the actual argument remember it is it is nineteen sixty five there will not be a woman on this court until sander dale cona arrives in nineteen eighty one here are nine men deciding the fate of birth control owy i er or e youn wen do o gon sa e ge manana probably only wo would bebe shom bu ton tat i on the tim omnan i otas e i i i as dono e they re they areo o i r it i four hours of that when nihty struck was cropesize marcha as she did this interview with a tony crushioner the the playright an the puer surprise winner propy a best known for angels in america and in this interview they have this interesting exchange a crishoner says to her that he thought that her show was partly about this thing that he hass been a writing about in thinking about ever since heu wrote that a movy about abraham lincoln a few years ago that stephen spellburg directed crishiner said a that in his view e central question of democracy is that there needs to be some kind of mystical bond holding everybody together lincoln talked about the mystic cords of memory and very consciously tried to pull everybody together into allegiance for the union but crishioner said that if you actually interrogate what the thing is that is actually pulling us together it is really doing just a stack of paper wright is just an act of faith that we have with each other and he pointed out that how of course everybody knows wriht now this act of faith this feeling that we are all on this together and we are one people who can workthings out together that is in such short supply and the very idea of tean agors giving speeches about that stack of papers about the constitution and it is importance and its values crishoner said i'm a qoting here is feels an ethose of a not very distant and yet somehow very distant past were people believed in fairness that the superstructure that we have all swon allegiance to o the constitution is going to create opportunities impossibilities that am veally hit me when i read it and i asked how to srack in our interview if if she agreed that the america where syou gave those speeches when she was fifteen seeme very far away yes how a well sos the adies between myke eighty six and eighty nine im first of all i felt i m i was very liberal and high school in as feminous liberal i get my speeches reflected those values hen i remember giving a speech about the second amendment which i was arguing for gun control cause there had just been a shooting in california and a mcdonalds and i was arguing for strict gun control las in front of a room of men who all owned guns and went hunting and and i won that contest and and i always felt a sense that these men i was giving the speeches for a supported my right to have a dfferent views than they did supported my right as an american to express myself believes it was important in a democracy that we have these conversations together that felt different to me iave also say of as that was this as the very beginning of of rushlyn by and then fox news and thes men who gave you a word money yaver you argued against the the second amendment you think that that would be it would be might be harder it ay i think although i well say i looked on you to tat other am american legion speeches and they still seem to be am the winners often seems to be quite liberal at least maybe in thi spays of the american legioa and there is still room for this kind of dialogue i hope i hope to wmigty strack if you visiting new york city her show what the constitution mans to me is running to wy on broadway little i'm constitution of footnote here after we recorted that interview i garng that the fourteenth and ninth and men mencs did not really combine wonder twen style to decide rovers's waih

to day shows pons rb express ve pn thousands my lisser s already secured the nutwir day to join them expressbe pianti cams lashmen last night i visited oxford university in great britain my wife had some has not ins about me visiting the uk at all given safety concerns after all on saturdays one hundred thousand people marched in support of comass as his meicape crime is apparently up one thousand three hundred fifty percent in london over the last few weeks the moms shout in nottingham wile muslem here is a jew behind me kill him but we felt that it was important particularly at a time when the west seems unsure of its moral qualifications to condemn absolute evil in the form of omass to go to oxford after all oxford is a thousand year old institution one of the chief intellectual light to the wess if we in the west lose oxford it is a good indicator the west as a whole is in trouble well i'm here report the west is in trouble the university itself is gorgeous it is a monument s the greatness of mankind the architecture is magnificent the history speaks from the walls from churchil to se es leuis from ten ninety sixth to nineteen forty five but the institution itself has been honeycombed with tpeople who are in full support of his lomic terrorism my opening remarks last night focused on the west shyness about its own values its failure to recognized that not everybody things westerners do and the consequent importation of people who believed that the west is actually deeply evil those remarks were borne out in the ashal ven when student after student approach the macrophon to offer abevy of morally abfuscatory arguments in support of comas the most common was the clearly specious and horrible argument the comass burning babies alive in their cribs raping their mothers shooting them and torturing fathers was somehow morally equivalents two the ise really defense forces targeting terrorus while attempting to minto my civilian cashalties when pressed however student afferstuden admitted the real gul the destruction of the state of israel entirely the rest of it was all just hot air hereis just one examplem n exchange i had with young muslelin obviously shus muslemshous wearing keyshop for those who cannot see the cleb here it is tt leare your yousers ols eneme wherers eer away s ir your r a o e eo ee o thi ae a i not t i o eir thi

that just for the sake of the fact their is ate state in the middle east where jews in non jews have equal rights that hi stade israel where twenty fresent of the populagion is air muslim also there i zer jews livinig thagot istrp zero jews living the palcinian areas of the westman zero jews living in leven on zero jewsliving injorn zero jes livn in sat arabea zero jes livig in egypt zero jews living in syria but israel is the promise tha police for honesty wmen leish je s says s of the thing the state of isral shuld be destryt in here is the thing studen after student said this this was not a rarity literally student after student just admitted full scale that israel should not exist to put it mildly the experience was somewhat discomfiting it is not all that easy emotionaly to stand across from student after student calling for the extermination of juws between the river and the sea my literal friends in family a modern universities it is now considered erratiure to mention that men and women are different but it is considered perfectly acceptable to openly justify an excuse the murder of innocent jewish men women and children radicalize muslin students the most important western institutions feel no qualms whatsoever about calling for the obliteration of the jewish state anti semitism runs rife in these halls obviously and wha's even more disturbing tis the tolerance with which it is met there is little or no pushback there is certainly no feeling that such ju hatred is out abounds and that is why the west is in trouble as i said last night in nineteen thirty three the oxford union society infamously voted two seventy five to one fifty three for the proposition quote this housewelf under no circumstances fight for its king and country that pathetic statement which became known as the called oxford oath gave eit an comfort to te enemies o the west the reportedly led both hittler and mosoleny to the conclusion and the british were internally week and thus pray for aggression the modern version of the oxford oath is what we see to day in the west the belief that the values of cang and country are not worth defending in the face of a muscular form of his lam that seeks the total obliteration of its enemies in just one second will gets the fact that the media and many of our politicians ar paroting the exact same line first on a tok you

raticaliss on the calls for the extermination of israel the rest of the world is following sued with its moral equivalents amidst t israels attempts to rear commas from the gos a trip come oss is now receiving a helping hand from the international community and the legacy media welcome o sits on vast stock piles of water food medicine the international community and legcy media are placing responsibilit eee for gases civilian population on wait for it israel according to no less in anti israel authority than the your times this week and quote as supplies to virtually every basic cuman necessity twindle and gaza one group in the besieged onclave remains well stocked commas commas has hundreds of thousans of gallons of fuel for vehicles an rockets cashes of ammunition explosives materiaels to make more stockhaus of food water and medicine according senior officials a senior labanese official sat commass which is ostimated to number between thirty five and forty faucon people had enough stock toway to keep fighting for three to four months without any resuppli with gasens facing humanitarian catastrophe commases stock piles raise questions says the ner times about what responsibility if any it has to the civilian population ah there it is that fabled neyor times objectivity commass steals bilions of dollars from it citizens to fun its war machine and that quote raises questions about what responsibility if any it has to the civilian population now imagine the sends and any other context is there any question united states government has a responsibility for its civilian population that literally the purpos of a government or they israels government but being a genisidal juhte and terras means youre enough to take responsibility for the civilians you supposedly governe you might not have any responsibility for the citizens at all in fact gaza hospitals right now are complaining byt lackofuel but comms currently has two hundred sixty fousin gallons of gasen teasil on hand but no matters say t members ofthe west people of to uen commas has no responsibility which is why commasas friends are able to lament the plight of civilians and gaza after having funded their impoverishment and the corrn conflict created by commass eight dollars to ploid to gazo over the pastwenty years have been embezzled by commas and used for its murderous plans but now the international community and legsemedia say its up to israel to make humanitarian provision for gazas civilians this is of course is ingenuous zero of the countries that voted in favor of a yuun resolution pushing sease fire have offered to take in any gasen civilians none have called for commas to surrender to israel far which would and the conflict immediately no they say israel has tao stop its attempts to destroy kommas the innocence are suffering this is the height of citizensen this argument it is on pae with the old saw about the man who kills is parents then throws himself on he mercy of the court because he is norphan commas started this conflict commas is the governing body in the gs's trip commas has chief responsibility for the health and welfare of gazen palsinian arab civilians and they do here at all at all about those citizens in fact they want those citizens to di they say openly they say that their civilians are the responsibility of the people they just murdered on mass here is commas official musa abumarzuk just yesterday baby at the ths as many people are asking this of the enemy riemen sinc your vilat five hundred colometers or tunnels me thawhy havent you built bomshelders yercivillins can hiderin bombardments n he says we have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being cargeted and killed ere the thete those tunnels are ment to potect us from t e aur plans we are fighting from inside the tunnels meverybody knows that seventy five per cent ofthe people in the goses trick our refugees comsosebn fma e eand it is the responsibility of united nations to protect them according to the genevi conmentions is the responsibility of the occupation fetfem to provide thm with all the services as long as they are under occupation see get that by the way the gossan government is commass they literally elected them they provide public services but according to this it is amazing to hure members of an actual honest to god genecitle terror is crupciting the guneva cin ventions in ther own efence truly amazing but here is the math apparently if a population elects o terrorous leadership that terrace leadership consolidates its control by wepping out its political rivals that terrace leadership steals billions of dollars in aid and impoverishes its own citizens in the process and then the terracs leadership murders fifteen hundrd chos and kidnaps andother two hundred thirty thre people then long as the terrase leadership hides in tunnels underint svillain populations the terras have to be left alone this is insanity total insanity it is insanity no other contry on earth would be expected to weather ord be concerned about not the united states not the uka not france not germany no one there cannot and should not be a seas fire un til commas surrenders this is very simple any one in the world calling for a sease fire but not calling on commastu surrender in fact those who are calling for lengthening of the conflict by shipping in mor re sources for commas to steel cannot pretend to care about human life either as ralli or palistinian there is a reason that both commass and the united nations again one o the worst places on earth are calling for sease fire and has nothing to do with human rights and everything to do with stopping israel from protecting its own citizens the mass murder of whom created this conflict in the first place in just one secondg we will get to agan the insane calls for a sease fire in the face of commasses continued barbarity first i've been talking about my helics at sleep mattress for years i got to be askle not seeping amazing on the road helic sleep is the tdig natalize me to sleep well when i am at home because they have a mattress they made just for me is firm but breathable which is what i need when i sleep if custo to get back payin if's not breathable itend to heat up an night helics made a mattress just for me they can do the exact imething for you and now they have their newest most high an collection the helis ele helic elit harness is years of extensive at mattress ex pertese to offer a truly elevated sleep experience that helk slee collection includes six different mattres motels each taylor for pecific sleep positions and from his preferences had on over to heli leep dot comslesh men to check out the new collection today if your nerveus about buying a mattress on line you do not have to be helic has a sleep quids the match es your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress tbecause why would you by

for your body type and sleep type helic is offering twenty per cent of all mattressortis pluss two free pillows for my lisseners go to helc sleep dot com slashmen it is their best offer yet it is nothin a last long with helics better sleep starts right now ay yestr rday w as as the rest the world calls for a cease fire with hamas which again is insane there was a sease fire with comas we should not it was established in gune of this year and then it was broke in by two thousand comosteris rushing into cevilianareas and murdering ever one they saw thers report yesterday that came out from hommas body camfootage that homas literally took a baby and put the baby in the oven and then baked h baby alive well raping the mothe repeatedly this homas body camhotage and yet people are still cling fhrases fire and pretending that because comas is hiding in a highly dense civilian area that means that they are now immune from attack the logic of which by the way completely defeats the purpose of having rules of war it completely defeats it if the idea of the rules of war is to minimize ceviliaing casualties then those rules of war have to desuade people from doing precisely what comas is doing coms is use it the rules of war two but to appli to everyone else and not itself which seems an amazing way o fomenting terrorism the entire purpose of the geneva conventions was to get people who were perparticipating in violent action into military uniforms they could be separated from the cevilian population coms is doing precisely the reverse and then relying on the geneva conventions supposedly which of course is absolute nonsense again we all know that their headquarters are located under all shefa hospital they are located under a hospital now for piar reasons israel will not bom that hospital i woud imagion but if they did bom the hospitals be perfectly clear that is a military sight according to the red cross once you transform us cevilinsite into a military sit it is a military sight you cannot claim immunity at a sight simply because you choose to violate the laws o war otherwise what you are doing is insensivizing people to violate the loss of war that is the entire purpose of them violating the laws of war mean by the way this is directly from the red cross quote the laws of wour prohibit direct attacks on cevilian objects schools they also prohibit direct attacks against hospitals an medical stacf which are specificlly protected under international humon rihts law that is said a hospital or school may become a legitimate military target if it contributes to specific military operations of the enemy and if its destruction offers a definite military advantage for the attacking side if tere is any doubt they cannot be attack hospitals only lose their prodection in certain circumstances for example if a hospital is being used as a base from which too launch an attack as a weapons deepo or to hide healthy soldiers and fighters that is according to the red cross but again the idea hears that comas is going to hide behind behind geneva conventions while barbarically slaughtering svillian you remember there is a woman named shany luk is a horrifying story obviously channilucu remember her body was brokein she was shoose murdered her body was clearly broken the first day of the conflict you could see the first day that the terratack hou could see tape of her broken body essentially being stripped and thrown on to the back of a truck in gaza and were tongue broken body contorted in ways that no living human being be contorted and commosspologis then claim that choose alive in being given medical treatmen in the gozistrip those clearlly alie the time while now has ben confirmed that she is dead of course german chancthtr or loff shoals lamented the terrible news that she had died he said the showse the full barbarity behind the homas attack who must be hld a countable this is terror in israel has the right to defend itself well i mean that is true which is why it is absolutely absurd that germany voted to abstain for may you un resolution concerning a quoncuo seaes fire meanwhil commass continues to hold hostages their effectively holding guns to not effectively te are probably literally holding guns to the head of people on tape and then releasing hostage of vidios and getting those hostages if they hope to preserve their lives in prisomally not be repeatedly raped by commossterris to a to rip on the israily government as a piece of propaganda here is and all these people would not be hostages if comosha surrendered and release them which commos will not do obviously here is om of the hostage footage teaso a atnecessary levan ess nowhohello we ave been detain for twenty three days and there should have been aceas fire i promise to release us but instead we are still in captivity your position means you want to kill us if this is propagan to put out by hama a people that the presumala they have raped in cinnap there is no one there to protect us the army was not their again n propagan of idio put out we non't have fy thewhole thing propagan of vidio put out by homas o people that they have presumably raped kidnapped tortured this is what they do and yet the rest of the world is still trying to draw a moral equivalence because again is not about the moral equivalence is not about the moral equivalence that the underlying position which i the state of israel is fundamentally illegitimate and that anything done two people in this area is apparently excusable and justifiable that is the underlying logic to this entire thing now in a miraculous event yesterday very rarely get pies good news in a situation this is rally tanks went into gasa yesterday and in the process of going into gaza they actually ended up freeing one of the hostages which is pretty amazing an you have to assume in this position that the that the hostages are effectively dead becaus commoss has no interest tin releasing them if they wanted to they could just release them but yesterday one of the hostages was in fact re taken by is raily forces which is in amazing achievement of the idea according to sky news the soldiers rescue during a ground operatiows announced by the idea f earlier on monday the idof inshinbet say the is railies will continue to make every effort to bring about the release of the obducties she was reunited with her family the ground operation of course is what is allowing hostages to possibly be rescued in the first place will called for a sease fire without release of hostages is a call for theire continued captivity obviously injust one second we will get to the insane media coverage of this conflict which agan is adand support to homass there is is no question about at first the menshup peras sho is support by grand canyon university to fortable private christian university with a vibrant camps an beautiful fe nyserizoner that ran toptwenty in the country acoring to neshta com g c is h omissional christ sentered university that strives to fostra cultur of community giving an impact g cus goal is help you

approach tohelping youachieve your goals find your purpose grand canon university private christian afforable visit g c u dot ed u to day i'l get the media doing it theire best to stand with homas it is pretty incredible the yal aily news yesterday for example actually issued a correction on october twenty fifth piece there is a piece by womaname sahartartac who had written in favor of israily civilians and in her pes she claimed correctly that commass raped women and beheaded men well comas raped women and beeaded men yale then printed eight correction slastra tractian quote this column has been edited o remove unsubstantiated claims that commass raped women an beheaded menats the yale daily news the atrocities of course we are not unsubstantiated that is absurd the twitter editor is a persnamed a nikasa w apparently thinks that done the reports of commoss rape and murder are unsubstantiated not only they not unsubstantiated their substantial by actual vidio footage taken by comasterris but the goal of the media is to establish moral a moralequivlence that is the entire goal of the media in this conflict because they can establish moral equivalents it allow as this conflict go continue and puts israel an acestential danger make no mistake thit how anit how many media pieces were written in world war to and that is the closest comp a not just using world war to because it is a matter with which people are passibly nowledgible i musing wold war tho because it is the closest comp commass has the exact same goal as the notzies and they pursues strategies that are absolutely similar to those of the nozies whon comes to the jews there is no other real comp the really is not what you can compare it the hommas to the acon the there there is no actual real comparison on a moral level except for the nacis but the media have swivelled full into moral equivalent motivs they went directly from gu's getting slaughtered is is bad to palsinians village whare dying as the result of israel targeting terroris is the same thing which by the way again just a point thits out israls complete eir superiority in the goscisstrip if israeld wished to du what it is to tractors say that it wants to do we would not be talking about a few thousand people ded tragically we would be talking about hundreds of thousands of people dead in seria where no one seems to give as haw it is pretty incredible that israel is targeted as a human rights abuser on par with commas but again it is a de ingenuous argument just as you saw in that debate with that student at oxtr university that is not the argument at all theydo not care about human rites the entire argment is israel does not have a right to defenditself because israel's no have a right to exist that iswhat this is about and that is why the washington post is now printing piece after piece about the situation in gaza yes the situation in gaza is ugly but if all you fokis on in gaza is the fact that it is ugly in gos without mentioning anywhere that it is comasa's fault that its ugly that the governing party in that conflict could surrender tomorrow and and the bomming to morrow then all you are doing is providing justification for coas all you are doing is preventing commas from being austed piece after piece now about the cost of th the costs of war the cost of wornd out again you do not see this in virtually any other conflict covered by the legacy media you do not see it at all you do not see for example pieces about the great suffering of the russian people thanks to the destruction of their economy thanks to the grane war yu do not see that ever right ever you never heare piece bout the cost on the ground in russia from from the certainly not without the contect of ladmrpuan start ed thewar by invading you crane whoen it comes to the gaza trip then we are treated to all of the images of the suffering on the ground well it is importan the people are suffering but t's important mainly because the pressure should be onh kamas to stop the suffering by surrendering to day but that is ol to mediare doing the media are atempting to draw a moral equation between babies being slaughtered in kubuts beri and civilians being killed because they are sitting a top terror tunnels and being forced to stay there commas is literally blocking roads commas is killing people at tempting to escape but the meiare doing their best for example h washington post as an article to day called quote a waste land of rubbish and te bri it is piece by a personin a tef abusayf and i's called i'm still alive gaza is no longer gaza a te abusaf is the author of six novels and since twenty nineteen has beenthe minister of culture for the palisinian authority in the westbank cas i at this ponish to point out that palsin an authority in wespang pays actual honest to god terror stipens if you are a terrace and you kil a jew the palsinga authority will pay your family ten thousand dollars and the washington posed without any contect puts this persons opinion of the terrible situation in gaza in it is newspaper again it is just remove from all context becas that is the point that is what we the idea for the medias you can textralize the murder of civilians the absolute targeded murder of civilians in israel that requires the contet of the entirer is railly arpestry usually falsified and what does not require any context is the suffering an gaza at all quot i walk to elshif hospital to read the names lists of the dead are pinned up dalios had a makeshief morgue i could barely approach the building thousands of goens had made the hospital their home it is gardens its talways every empty space or sparecorner had a family in i gave up and headed toward hatems an now again i i i've searched for the work homas in this piece it does not exist the workma ther re the governing party there are the government of te gaza strip thereis not a single mention of them meanwhile avidot the washington post these are journalist in gazesing please try to share our voices please shur ur voices now here is the thing why do you think that journalis are dying in gozap could it be because if your journalist and goza you are literally dictated to by hamas comms does not allow freedom of movement in in the goistrip if this is why sesee and enreporters ware not in the gozistrip they are on the outskrirpts of the gozistrip give freedom of movement in israel if but we have hundreds of reporters in israel on the ground right now drinking and bars in telof eve and then going and covering the conflicts wherever they want inside the state o israel if you report from inside the gozistrip you are under the control of mass but now you have journalists and many of them are are just active is posing is jounalists some of them ore freelancers who stat who are her big fans of hitlers will get to in just one second gives a lot of these people who are now reporting the the the horrors that are in goza i am surey toa horrible situation inside gozap that is in fact the point of a war s to make a horrible situation for your enemy not for the enemy's civilians but if the svillians are indistinguishable because the terrors refuse to allow them to be distinguished that is the fault of the terrorists but again the washington post strips away all context an we just gave idios of jounalists talking about the plat of journalists in the gozistrip wit or again there is no freedom of speach in the gosistrip they cannot print freely tin the gozistrip if you print antihamos materal an the osistrip they will kill you they will kill you but we are supposed to believe that the great threat to journalists is of course israel in general here isthe washington post doing this nonsense nel says hospitals in the bobbing of churches mosts women children ambulances all have been targeted as well as journalist in the homes of journalists gey that is a li i'm sorry thats a lie they did that israel is targening ambulances is a lie there is no evidence to bact this and the washington post just puts that up without any doubt without any sort of of attempt even factcheck that sort of stuff i mean it really is in an amazing demonstration of the disgusting byas of the media by the way this particular lady who apparently has no posts on twitter or anywhere else prior to the outbreak bof israels retaliation against comss she does sin letters the palestine solidarity open letter for the g s a students association calling for fulls vestment from the state of israel and blaming everything on israel without any ment again that the idea the chusemsert of objective journalist just chronicling wans going on ind goza lots of suffering is going on in goza but why we should trust a person this activis to talk about israel wqutnit what targening ambulance is beont but the washington postess prints the stuff un critically because this is exactly what they do this is literally what they do and it is not just that it is the nearer times they put out of idyo called war through the eyes of gozes children now again war anywhere through the assive children is horrifying of course i mean naturally war is a horrifying thing it is fhorrifying ind evil and terrible war in an of itself but what a greater evilis is allowing terrorists to govern entire territories from which they create mass terror tacks against civilians but the times the whole ideas present tons of contect when it comes to actual terrorism context that justifies the terrism when it comes to destroying terrorism remove all contacts and pretend that s actual terrism s that is what the near times doing here is the young chouts ing may bomdour houses and destroyed them the window's fell we got scared and came here they calld my uncle and told us to evacuete await they called and told you to evacuate well i mean that something that commoss does not do we found a carful of garbage and we wrote it here yes ror is ror is horrible also i'm jest going to point out that even tese student ot but even these these young kids are admitting that israel calls and tells them to evacuate for sncommoss uesn't to that you nar comossesn't do take any responsibility or its own sogglling population this is the gind up campaign buy the legasy media and people wish to destroy the stateof israel to pretend that israel is the moral equilent of commoss and thus to come to some sort of sease fire arrangement allowing commoss to live leading in that department is the idiotic thomas freemen who but again i i'm never going to get over the fact that ther people who actively believe that tom as freedman and his ilk are intellectual thomas freedman has the brains of a com quat that yu'es entire job consists of going round to foring countries and listening to taxy drivers transcribing what they say if it is self flattering and then printing it and yet that guy is the foreign policy expert the nere time illget to more on thisin a second first you may hv notice we do things very differently here at the daily wire eve a lot of the topnews podcasts in the world lanch a

chocolates dot calm to day ocam meanwhile moregn to get to more from the newor times as thomas freemen first i got a just mention here that the near times is little concerned about actual morality that they legitimately hier people orfans of hitler ike that that is i there there is a hitler loving reporter in gaza who is literally re hired by the nurtimes literally rehired by the nurotimes and tat's not the only person who the nerotimes is happy thire tverywise points out a few days ago the paper published re story about the atmosphere in sadiarabia after the october seve of massacr and they quoted a person in sulton alamer a grastude in harvard center from idy studies alimers presented as an expert by the nerotimes but i'm he also tweeted literally the day of october seventh quote what a sweet day that is ta person quoted as i foreign policy expert by the nurotimes in twenty twenty one the nertimes plut published a flattering profile of a professor named at refat alarer praising him for his decision to teach is rally poets thal's to publish an not bed by this person well i'm yesterday he joked about whether or not in his rally baby burned aliven and oven was quote quoked with or without baking powder the nurtimesis a garbag chap is been a garbag cheap for for decate to this point and thomas freemen is of course the leading light of the nurotimes and and ther garba sheips out he has another piece yet another piece talking bouth really what israel should do here is nothing because after all it would woud really ruin their moral suasion if jews were to defend themselves instead of just dying i've notice that all the people who are very upset it isral morally theire perfectly happy with ju's dying they sdo not it when jew's actually defend themselvesthat is uncomfortables thomas freedman has pece hiled the is rally officials i speak with tell me they know two things for sure he says i'm watching the israel commaswar and thinking about one of the world leaders have most ad mired mon mohan sing he was indias prime minister in late novmember two hassenate when ten packastandeaje hotus militans from lashcar e tibo group widely believed to be linked to packastans military intelligence infultrated india and killed more than a hundred sixty people in mumbi what was sings it military response to india september eleventh he did nothing sing never ritalian militarily against the nation of pakastan or lashcar camson pakstan it was a remarkable act of restraint he is now calling for srael to do nothing now i've noticed a few things one israel is a very small state india is gigantic two india is bortered by a newcleor power called packastan and if india were to retaliate in significant fashing inst the packastanin military worldworth ree would be iminentwere as israel is borded by homass which is a terrerers group which is hiding in tunnels but what exactly is thomas freemen asking for from t is first of all he a temsto actively compare beebing incy nowt who the elected prime minister of the state of israel two comass he actively attempts to do that because he says that beby was not purely in favor of the two state solution ough by way i cannot emphasize enough the insane blindness of talking about a two state solution less than month less than a month after fifteen hundred jews were murderd by one of the groups governing in the palstinian aras comass who by the way have the same exact gols as thapalstin an authority anislomiccy hid whyre the other governing powers m this is crazy that is after a pearl harbor people going what really is not the real promis it th united states has not made peace with germany really that is that is the rail problem if if if the united states ad nly been more forth coming with germany than this pro harbor thing never wouldhave happene and that is the real solution here that is not the way any of this works but here is how insane thomas freeman is quot a paus cold allow the people of goses take stock of what comases attacks on israel haveis done to their lives families homes and businesses what exactly that comas think it would accomplish with this war for the people of goza thousands of whom were traveling to work in israel every day ore explorting agricultural products and other goods across the gossa israel word just a few weeks ago comas has gotten waito much understanding and not enough hard questions from the people of gaza oh you noticed oh you noticed by the way when he talks about the people who had at work promits many of the people an work promits into israel were in formers for komas they found on the bodies of the dead comas terras maps of each of these moshavin in the goza envelope these towns in te goza envelope itlisted the exact locations of the houses the number of inhabitants of the houses homainy men women and children were in each house thot's because there are people were being let through by israel to bolster the economy of the gozas trip and they were immediately taking the information they gain in formation how many children are in a house and handing it over to comases wo cms could slaughter thems there is that but thomas freeman's idea here this is big idea his big idea is that if israel just stops thn a comas will come out of its tunnels and then the people of goswelll holdthm accountable which makes perfect sensens for twenty years they not held them accountable and they elected them and in the last ofvailable pole comas pretty copulary and both the gosistrip and in judayan tomaria f the west bank but here is thomas freeman's maronic idea because again this dude has a'm not sure he has to nurons trub the other quote i want to see comases leaders come out from their tunnels under hospitals and look their people and the world's media in the eye and tell every one why they thought it was such a great idea to mutilatind kidnap is really children and grandmothers and trigger this terrible blowback on their children and grandmothers of their gosan eighbors not to mention their own oh then moral suasion slow clat for thomas fr and when i say back to the oxfor pomn i sav westerners do not understands people quar noon western this is what i mean the ultimate arrogance of people thomas freedmen thinking man if only we could just tut tut if they w just reed my column wouldn those people in komas man they would feel bad man they would feel bad and th people of gaza probably though just yello comas when comas comes out of those tunnels that is probably th the likely effect or may be that will not happen and maybe gaza if it were left in the contral coms whicd turninto even more ofi terror state and would in sent of vice cas blos to attack from the north because israel than be prerceived as week but this is what the n yor times is is what our media are they need the moral equivalents because if there is one premis that drives the western medium more than any other is it the west is not morally superior that is the premise that drives of the western mediate trives western left it leads to the the imbibing from the markis playbook and the post colonial is playbook that all in a quality of outcome is attributable to western evils that all bad things happening on earth are attributable to the evils of the west an there for the west meens to simply pretend that every one else thinks members the west and if coms if we could just sit across the table homasen explain to them how much the children of gozaps o they do care they literally go on our tea on russian to day on on russian te the and they literally say we do not care about phalsiniansvillians and thomas roumins o wealth if only could chow then some suffering palsiniansmy god these people these people and the evil that they provide for because when you make excuses for evil when you justify evil when you give free rein to evil evil thrive and you are complicit in that thomas freedmen even jobidon is it angry at the near times coverage according to report from semiphore bidand quo told a small group of wallstree executives in the white housas rosvo room early last week he thought that theire headline regarding the gosa hospital bomming those actually comitted by the palsinan his lomigy op was he irresponsible an could trigg an military asculation in the madleast well he is right he is crack by the way the met you are doing now this is truly incredible the media are now the washington most of this the're t the're using aerial photoes of the gossistrip to try to identify specifically in real time the movement ofhis raily troups and then blast that out on the web that is what they are doing it is totally an the mediop our cover for the terrace they are their air cover they are there beblythis been true for anti american groups since pretty much the end of world wore to the vea congro lihe extremely heavily on the american media to help persuade the american people the thousas surrender the country of the atnom to th veicom that was it tht the they knew they could count on the leggacy media to do their dury work and nothing has change nothings in the media are just trash they are absolute sheer trash the only thing coperal to themedia an froms of being trash would be places in china which are actively promoting this china by the way has obviously taken side ofthe terrace there is a there is a gugal map comp called bydo maps bydo maps is in china they have literally removed israel as tha country on he map they less cities but they got rid of the label for israel they normally bulld capital cities not tell of eve not jerusalem china is obviously taking sides thas on a shock russia is taking sides russia literaly met withthe leadership of commass bu then were supposed to believe in international institutions the uen where by the way eron is set to chare f the two thousand twenty three ou an human rights council social forum now we should definitely definitely listen to them wof you are wondering where much of thse support on university campsis in the united states is coming from for commass for example you really do have to understand the intersectional movement and what exactly it is doing believe ore not iberamax cendy his finally emerge from his silence after a llegedly mbezzling money from his entire program and and doing nothing wit bit the money actually to anythng he said he was going to do it riks kendyis back he literally had nothing to say ob ra max kendy about the murder of civilians an israel nothing but heis now releast o statement a ha statement that is that is put in beautiful graphic form quote according to the gosibase ministry of health which the ou en considers credible the is really airstricts ofe killd tat ly seven thousand phalsinians and gose including two thousand nine hundred and thirteen children s s october seventh this is not self defense building a border wall around gossi and confiding more than two million palcinians in this open air prison is not self defens by the way you knowt we usually call a place that is governed by a governing authority the receives billions of dollars in aid from america and other placean had six miles beech front property we sually don call that n open oir prison unless the people who are governing the territory decide to make it which is what commass is decided to do hes is lang seege chagassi is not self defense violently seizing palcinian lands is not self defense these are crimes against humanity just as commoss killing more than one thousand forner people in isral and obducting two hundred others on october seventh was a crime against you ah the perfect moral equivalents where is this coming from what isan mexican care about this tbecause to be antirasis is to care about humanity it is the same coalition of the oppressed nonsense the constantly here from the international left and is nt curable is not curable that perspective because once you are part of the oppressor class youre always a member of the the oppressor class is n't make cleatr by a professor named yabablad in the last forty eight hours she is appeering on a show this yabablay character who is apparently a relatively tennis offer and a and here is what she explained about reparations open anthi te met we te the o a they are not to om

this lady sayd is there a curat of the answers there is no curative your member of the oppressor class therefore you and your ideology ought to be obliterated anybody who believes that de colonization is an anti violant effort has not been watching very closely by the way yabablay has taught at the following faculties lee high university loffi at college and drexi university where she was the director of the africana studies programm this is the perspective that you are seeing play out at our universities its the perspective that your seeing play out international as well you wonder why the west has decided to basically commit suicide the answer is the west does not have the stone o stand up for its own values and say that people who are effectively cultural scavengers people who who live off the benefits of the west whell condemning the west as a horrible terrible place that ought to be destroyed the west does not have the power or the capacity morally to say to those people you are wrong youre wrong might be useful person for a change and the west is a inserious trouble ell ii i do want end with a bit of humor here and ten thankfully that bit of humor has been provided by gavannusom the governor of california gavenusum decided for some onspecified reason to travel to china where he decided to play basket ball with a with some chinese kids it did not go amazing it was

obliterated some kids while playing ruggby but here is a hereis gavanu some obliterating a chinese child and a man is this awkward he tries to spin the ball fale he tries spin the ball again fale heas behind his back he tries to dusemen with on one in these kids and then he lose is boun to bam destroys this kid and then he has to play it off its fun and he is grabbing this kid and smacking this kid

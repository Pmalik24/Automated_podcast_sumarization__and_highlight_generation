there is a new religion in the united states that religion is secular leftism and that secular leftus religion demands thet you not look at facts insteadyo just look at the narrative presented and then believe it this is what the meto movement was about it did not matter if you asked for anselary facts to support a contention in' matter if you aren' even really doubting the contention you just wanted to evidentiary supportnote you needed to believe all women when comes to d ei it is the same sort of stick it is uourspost believe that d i is good for business is good for everyone it has positive externalities intersectionalities same sort of thing these are narrative and the narratives must be believed the media love seizing on particular stories that they believe drive the narrative than ignoring all of the facte that story in order to achieve the narrative to day's latest example comes curtesy of a terrible story out of oklahoma in which a sixteen year old girl who called herself gender non binary died her name was next benedict when apparently according to the media she collapsed the day after an altercation in a girls o bathrom at a public high school soshofs gender non vinary declare itself declared and we hear on the show actually label people by their biological sex because that is the way that it works in reality but this confusian ager died in tragic circumstance but we do not actually know how this persondi the one thing that we do know according to the autopsy now is that this person was not actually murdered in the bath room the original reports out of this oklhuma school is at this person had not altercation of girls bathfrom with other girls and then was effectively beaten to death or least injured badly that the she then ended op dying the next day and he media ran with this story not only to they run with thes story they used this story as a prop in order to push against too particular political elements one is hiarathik our friends over it libs of tiktok whose great sin in the modern political world has been to take clipse of the left doing things and exposed them to broader public view to just wattch what people are doing on tiktok and then say whall cere' what they are doing and ten people motive that is her great sin is iamn her advocacy they hate it is the fact thit people are doing something publicly wanning attention and then she gives them attention but from people who do not necessarily all provide a warm round of applaus for all the insanidy going on at tiktok sop hiarathik is a is a person who is on the state wide library advisory board for the state of oklahoma and s this means the media are now going to try to pin the death of this person this this young lady next benedict they are trying to they are trying to blame this person's death on hiah becaue thyve been trying to blame pretty much everything on hia for the last couple of years if there is a bomb threat at a hospital that provides quoting what gender confirming care which would be sex change care sex denial care is really a more accurate label for it because when you actually cut off people's healthy body parts that is a denial of their sex in favor of a subjective version of of gender they havein their head when the is a bom thread aginst one of those hospitals after hia reveals what a acquiate to at the hospital they blame it on kia when a girl gets e dies in disputed circumstances an noklohomiscuall the try toblam hia for this and the basic ideas that shees a cuon quot stacastic terrorist this is a term that they been using for hira for last couple of years its eterm the means nothing it is etermin which they suggest that without inciting she is in fact responsible for incitements she is never called for violence against anybody but they are going to claim that she is responsible for violence that is done by anybody who might feoretically sea material that she post in cluding material of people woad publicly post of the material themselves she is target number one and target number two is a waw in the state of oklohama that says that you halfe to go to the bathroom at school of your sacx you cannot be a boy and goin tothe growth bath rom just because clam your girl and if your girl and you claim that your gender non binear you count walk into the boys bathroum and sare using the earnal and the media decided that this would be an amazing case they jumped on it immediatelyes national news when next t benedic die now they are lots of people whos die across the country every day in the united states and many of them are clittily murdered ere not talking under disputed circumstances we are talking literally everyday in th united states many many people are murdered by the way just proportionately people of color minorities young black mails murdered just proportionately pety much every day in the united states gets zero media coverage because that would not promote the narrative that e left wishes to promote which is of course that pretty much everything in the united states is result of american racism because it turns out that the vast majority of those people are being killed are also being killed by other young black mails we do not cover that read again the facts do not matter only the narrative matters the narrative hure seem to be one that the left could us and s they jumped on

atteanature and a school district previously targeed by libs of tiktok hia rachik rachic now sits on the statelide library advisory board in twenty twenty three oglhoma sentsure the states only non

several anti trands pieces of legislation accor benedic's name was made public a sorce who claim to be the mother of bennedix's best friend told ta local outlet the cause of death was quot complications from brain trama and that three older girls were beating the victim and herd auter in the girls bathroom we are not linking because the story uses benedict's dead name according to freedomoklahomates on presently clear which pronouns bennedict use o the story will refrain from using any pronouns at all for nex because the again the media are not interest in reporting actual facts if you reavie stories you have no idea if this person as a biological girl or if thi person's biologcoal boy by the way but again obscuring informations what the mediard now tipically good for its with the legacy media do according to ten vogue the anonymous sorce also ledge bennedict could not walk to the nurses station without assistance n that the school did not call in ambulence while the school climsthe were unaware of the fight till informed by apparent taxa legially sent by next after the fight to a family member began quite a got trumpted school three on one had to go to the e ar they would been bulling me in my friends i got tired of its bi pored some water on them and all three came after me schoold did not report to the police and his probably getting sued bendixs grandmother sue also adopted nacks brought next to the hospital after the fight then home again the next day next was brought back to the hospital and was pronounced dead sho told the independent next was to spended for two weks from school on the day the fight also mention that next had ben bullied throughout the school year aso everybody on left ran with the story thes front page news across the country and then as it turns out this person may not have died as a result of the actual beating apparently according to the according to the autoposy the outopsy suggested the opposite according to you ussay to day as police continued thursday to probe the death of the oklohomatine authorities announced of preliminary otosy showed the students as was not the result of trama they have not get released the results of atoxi collegey report 've no information on whether drogs were involved or anything else whell we do know is that the atopsy does not attribute this to trama it does a matter the catizardy out of bacg the story ardy has lights in its already running because this is the way ar legacy media work this becomes just another hate crime against apperson who apparently was involved in cond of an on going altercation with these othe girls poring water on them they were beating her up and again bullying of any sort is truly terrible should not be tolerated at any school the attempt of the mediahover to turn this into a weapon against th basic idea that sex exists or against legislation suggesting that girls should be pretected from boys in the girls bathroom by the wy there is no evidence whatsoever that the oklahomalaw that says that girl shuld go to the girls bathrom is responsible for this is there evidence that she woud av been much better off if she had started using the boys bathram at the soklahomaschool an absolutely unclear one thing that is clear by the way is that actually the new story assuming this teen vogue that when viral after next deth included allegation that teachers failed to summon medical care and that next was badly injured in the fight that she could not walk on her own police and schol officials both said those claims were false in a statement on face book the oostoe police departments had each student involved in the fight wl walked under their own power to the assistante principals nurses the assistant principals office and the nurse's office after it was broken up and a registered nurse than assess the helth of each student involved in the fight she determined amulan service was not required but recommended the next visit a medical facility for further examination and next did go to a hospital that afternoon does not matter the story is more important and this is the pattern for the weft how many race stories about supposed tystemic american races o by police have turned out to be just lies whether i is michael brown whether it is travon martin the suggestion of which was that he was beaten to death randomly by a white hispanic whether it is that the hands up do not shoot narrative of michael brown what whether it is the whether is the george floyd supposed racshal killing that provided zero evidence whatsoever that anything that happened was motivated by race literally zero evidence was even alleged or presented in cort in that case beyond which it is pretty obvious that george floyd died of medical complications and that he did not actually die because of the miss handling by derick shovan by autopsy reports it it does not matter once the narrative is set the narratie as set this goes all the way back to matthew shepherd which was the chief case used by the gay rights movement al the way back in nineteen ninety eight here is a entire playcalled literamy project that was base on the death tof mathew shepard was supposedly about this innocent harted gay young man in wyoming who is beat to death by a couple of a sailans arron mc kinney and russel henderson who pistol wiped im with the gun and tied him to offence ind freezing conditions and fire and sat senim on fire and this was the chief case iremember because i was in schoolittem our member ones broke nationally and this story was treated as the evidence that a merric was a deeply homofolbic awful place for gay people and matthew shepherd was case one e and then as it turns out virtually everything you knew about the case was a lie it turns out that accorting too a journalist name stephen himmannas who conducted thirteen years interviewig more than a hundred people at the connection o the case the actual story of the matthew shepard death had nothing to do with him being gay in fact tomen as found that shepherd was addicted to this acording to the guardian and dealing crystal methond had dabbled an heron he took significant sexual risks and was pimped alongside ere n mackinney who as one of his killers with whom he' dad occasional sexual encounters who ise ach ivy positie at the time o his death cemenna says at this does not make the perfect poster boy for the geright's movement matthew's drugabuse in the fact that he new one f the killers prior to the attack was never exploring court neither was the rumor that the killers new yed access to a shipmen of crystalmeth with he street value of ten gran which they wanted to steal but byway weramy is considered the most liberal town in wyoming employment is dominet by the university of wyoming they they just decided they ware not going to you knont actually pay attention to the story and this is howd the medio run their grift the media is populated by people on the far left those people on the far left have a story they want to tell about the way that the world works and if the evidence does not line up wit the story the just ignore the evidencean tey tell the story that they want to tell in pursuit of the ends they want to pursue e get to more on this in just once i con first are you tired of feeling sluggish run down

stories actually go down when you lie about the evidence you and up making bad policy when you'e ignoring reality in favor of a narrative you wish to tell about the world you and up running dorectly up against reality and this is true pretty much everywhere this is why yesterday and we are discussing gugle gemanine and the moron who desided the policy making fourgougle gamani put in a bunch of parameters that basically band white mails from being generated under any circumstances sund up with people typing in founding father an coming up with black female george washington or typin draw me the pope and yournd with an indian woman reat it the people who did that run up directly against reality now the danger is they can try to change realats to the media du that is what are our bosses in social media try to do as what members of government have tried to do historically try to change the reality around you incept into reality a narrative that does not make any sent but reali ty always wins is one of my slowlians folks reality always whin made may take a long time and may drive you nuts because they'r gaslihting you they will tell you a story that is false and tell you that you noticing the story if is false's bab thisis again is why they are going after hia he scis has ommitted the grave sin of asking for evidence of contentions and or providing evidence of opposite contentions but eventually reality does when and and now because everything moves quickly reality is winning faster tan ever and this is scaring the left which is why granmoff tarken in starwords they are trying to grip galixes that they cannot hold i gt the they are trying to grip tighter and tighter the censorsupersume is etting tighter and tighter because as reality gets away from them they have to try to exert more and more control but it is not going to work you are seeing that most clearly with regard to what is happening in our colleges si mention this briefly yesterday but it actually is a quite amazing story yale according to axios is the latest ileaue university to reverse its pantemic iratest optiona pollicy and well now again require standardize test scores to apply the sa t or the a c t why well because it turns out that counts ar to the idiotic narrative that your lifethe experiences are a better predictor of your actual success then a basic icu test which is essentially what th essay toar the cytis reality wins every time the correlation as turns out between essa t an a c te results and future student success it is actually better then all of the things that they have been saying are going to be predictive you knote bhe student essays about your victimized childhood yales sat on thursday would resume requiring tescorts of all applicans expanding from the esay t and a c t to also include a p an i b exam res ults dartmouth has now done the same thing at brown a commit brown is most liberal of all these schools they havebeen to virtual ive been to virtually ll the ivies of this point spoken at most ofthem and i got tell you brown is just ridiculous brown it is developing an committee to create recommendations on standardizing testing legasy ad missions an early decision other schools harvard cornell and princedon are announcing extensions on test optional policies columbia went all the way columbiage is made a permanent thits it were nock an intest what is going to happen with those chools when i say that they run up againce reality hears those can a happen with those schools the reason these schools exist is because they are credentialling institutions not because they teach you life skills you need not because they even teach you the things you should know as a good member of lestern civilization that died long ago the idea of college as a sort of intellectual breeding ground for good western citizens who hactually know their a b cs that is gone away you are not made a better citizen by college in fact very good case or made a significantly worst citizen by college becaus college has now become about the college experience which mainly is screwing and drinking and doing pot now and your your sons away from your parents to go to all of that andthat is what people meanwhen they seve the college experienc they dn't mean exchanging different ideas with diverse groups of people because that is not allowed on college campisses any more they mean the secs the alkohom the drugs effectively and being induced into a very left winged vieu of the united states in the world cay but what were tese universities good forth they were't teaching life skillson i they were making wa better citizen and if they weret making a smarter anything thapt what were they realy god for their sorting mechanisms we all know this it is the legal in the united states for employers to use icutests to admit yeu to employment it is made illegal by the supreme court back in the nineteen seventies there isthe case in which they decided that i was discriminatory why for the same reasons that all thse universities tried and failed to actually get rid of the ac t anesa t it turns out that whatever icue tests were being used by employers were deemed discriminatory because not enough people of collor were doing well on them the supreme court simply said that you could not use them for employment that they were that they were violation of the civil rihts act and whell collegeis found way round that by creating these quas icu tess which are the s a t and the ac t and then they use those and the reason that the credential meant something is because that was the only way that employers cutelpyor smarternat the culdn't tell by your grades in school becaue you migta gone to a crappy schooling getting in to ad a crappy school in that hard but they could tell by looking at which college you went to because the colleges were sorting you if you entit harvard there is they ninety nine point nine nine per centshot that you were a smarter person than a person who went t the local juko can bu what happens when harvard gets rid of its admission standards then it is credential is no longer worth anything the crenential dies now gain thes's not true for everything at harvard ret that harvard's stem programm still really good that suetruteht vast majority of colleges but a liberal arts degree which is what i paid for i want to u s a la i got a hollysie degree and then went to harvrd law schol and got a lawdegree thid any of that teach me out to be a lawyer not much maybe one year of law school is necessary maybe a year and a half im most but what that really said was i had a higacu and that was true for the vast majority people in a liberal art's college that was in ivy leegue and whenyou get ridof the esa t or the a c t what happens you went up watering downterstune population thut cre ential is now worth less and remember the in the college degree and the the nature of the place whr wou get the college togree has become more important over time as mornmore people have entered college used to be the just having a college degree alone acted as tha sort of imprimi tore of icu because there ist ae time in a merican history were not all that many people went to college werethe vast majority people could get a job out of high school and then the federal government in all its wisdom decided that because people who went to college earned more money every one needed to go to college which is a tremendous logical leap that is really stupid the reason that people who went to college earn more than people went to high school is because again that was a sorting a mechanism and what did they do they decided everyone should go to college whell once you decide every one should go to college then the college crenential loses its luster syou hve to keep putting upward pressure on the crenentialing system now the ivy leagues mean a lot but t turns out that you water don the systemies in the ivyleagueston mean enough to nay have to get a post grad degree ill get to more on this in one second first folks i got to tell you i m exhausted because my little threer old last night decided to get

according to the wallstr jurnel half of all college grads are working jobs that do not use their degrees we'v cridin entire scam credentialling system rooted in a bunch of bad evidence and bad data things acu testo matter or i say te's an ice te's done matter or every one should go to college no matter their intelligence level ow all these things are are not just propositions without evidence they are propositions to which there r's tremendous evidence to the contrary what is happening these colleges are having to re in states all of these tusts now to fight back against all this it is also the reason why t by the way but democrats agan have an interest people on lofts havan interest and preserving the narrative which is what you have jobidon trying tou now force every one in the united states yo subsidize the letis bein dans fury majors of people who got twelve hundred on their essay t that is what that is what jobidon is doing when jocts about relieving student lone dat that is what he is doing understand that when james claburnwhos jo bidn's biggest supporter when he says relieving student lone that is not giving money away he is lying it is one hundred per cent giving money away and its giving money away from the people who actually have jobs to people whill either should have gotten jobs based on their cronenthals or do not have jobs because they got a stupid credential ot for ere to wat e fo e nex or yo o tee se e tat tae people el beom oeble o tes e giveni ae ta to o lestners tes e ta givin e e ba a yo way ilget it is giving the money away but again this is going to come face to face with reality as well the college system is going to fall down thereis a reason by the way why lot of blue collor workers have turne toward the republicans are turning toward presedent trump there is a reason for that according to acios one of america's most powerful labor unions has now reported its first majorsjonation to republicans in two decades after me ting with former president trump last month the teamsters give a forty five thousand dollar donation to the ar an cees convention fun pur the ff c reports the reported contribution is not in indorsement but its a powerful statemen from a union that has supported every democratic presidential candidate since algore it represents the teamster's first big donation to the arency since two thousand for why because the democratic party is built around people whom want these narratives around people who benefit from these narratives round white college educated liberals and around people who are interesting being told that failure in american societeis result of american racesm in discrimination tht is the entire democratic collition an o i on't that maybe truckers youre people who work really hard every day and maybe do not have that college shugree ar work in their ass off to get you the stuff you need across the country every single th maybe they are not enenamored or enchanted by the nonsense that is being pushed on college campasses and now imbibed wholesale by the media and promolgated wholesale by the government may they do not that very much and reality always wins and tht's true whethe youare talking about economics witand a bal from policy reality is always very very likely to win by the way where is america's true growth going to happen the the the what is conmen to briak ne college system in the end is going to be tac not the teck brosewhere desining the gugal a i but the ones who arns the one to actually care about data right now the the greatest advantage the united states holds is in inovation this is whi the american semi conductor maker nevidia is now valuated at too trillian dollars too trillian dollars why what do tey do they desin sophisticated microship there are manufacture those those or being manufacture by tesen s over an tiwan just another reason why the united states has an interest in a muscular foreign policy tbecause for all those people who believe that form policy does not effect american policy if china takes tiwan and tiwan is forced to either destroy its microships or turn them over to the chinese government things are at t get very hairy for a lot of americans directly and in terms of american companies in any case nevidia has reported sky rocketing revenues an profits from selling ships powering artificial intelligence nevidia is a massive success why becuse they care about results and that is true for any successful business successful businesses care about results d e i the myths of the left they do not comport with reality and because they do not comport with reality the left hates the reality but guess what the realities can win sooner or later e gets more on this in just a moment first grand

speaker of the house of commons who is a former member of the labor party alowed for a bunch of amendments basically there was a there ware three separate cease fire motions or put out in the house of commons none of them are binding on the government the first came from the conservative party at called for in immediate cease fire only under circumstances in which commoss free dollars raily hostages and relinquished control o goza which by the way israel would support the second was put forad by the ssenp the ss en py is the scottish national party they are far left and they have been urging in immediate cease fire and they included in their resolution a condemnation to quote in end to the collective punishment of the palisinian people which is full scale commas language and this was a very un comfortable position for labor wlabor again is split between people who are not wildly antiizral and people who really ha juse and because of that the labor house of commons speaker decided to allow illegally against procedure an amendment from the labor party that effectively called for in immediate humani tarian cease fire without mentioning the collective punishment nonsense from the ss enp according to the times visrel moved help labor leader cure starmer who avoided another major rebellion among his lawmakers on the war thanks to his proposal gettng avote and thent labor members of parliament could vote on their party's plan and would not have to dify leadership by voting in support of the senps amendment ad this of course broke out into the open the speaker of the house linsey hoyle was immediately accused of trying to hlp out labor which is the opposition party right now and then he explained why he really did it and he says he did not do it because heu's trying t help out labor he says that he did this because he did not want their to be a terrorist attack on the house of commons when you have the legislature of a country attempting to pass legislation or consider legislation because they are affreged of a terror attack an immediate terror attack something has gone deeply wrong in your country here is the speaker of the houstland ou hile

in this house that is my duety if that is an amazing statement that is an amazing statement to the speaker of the house of commons is admitting that he is changing parliamentary procedure because he is afraid then members of parliament will be attacked and killed het is only one side in london that is doing the attacking in the killing ra now and i are not the jews the fact is that of course you have seen the massive protest we have all seen them when i spoke at oxford n cambridge the presence of radical aslamas unon you case soil is extreme and real thereis no question about this and these giant protest that you seen three hundred four hundredalsand people in the streets protesting on behalf of commass that is why the house of commons is now running a preserve a fearful that me look at the size of these protest it is insane he is our people or protesting unbehalf te terrors from commasson of the preservation of the terrice ro class that is what is happening and the u c parliament is calling for it this is what happens when you ignore reality when you ignore the reality which the multiculturalism is a giant failure when you ignore that reality this is what you went up with and it is a disaster it is a full scale disaster a jewish emp an b andrew persy talk about the intimidation of members of parliament if we have a reaon at the debate we had yesterday we will have exactly the same thing happen agane which is that members will not vote with their harts because they are frights and and they are scard here and what what do we expect he months i've been standing uphere talking about the people on our streets demanding death to jews demanding je have demanding into fathers as the police stam fine allow that to happen last night a genisical call for from the river to the sea bolissti will be te with projected onto this filding that that message says no jue is welcome in and the state of his rea in that land this is going to continue happening because when not dealing with it if we have a reon of this come the leader explain to me what will be any different and how will members tot with their harts an their consciences because too many will not at the moment because of the threats were receiving threats that telling us to leave this country in some of our cases and telling us that they want thos or our families to be subjected to pain and to death this is what happens in a country that has completely lost its way and the united state s can lose its way in the same exact forman fashion when you decide to ignore reality this is what happens to you to as a country meanwhile jobidn has now escolated sanctions on more than five hundred russian targets this comes amidst the reports of the murder of lexy nevalny imi assumen to murder because i mean that is pretty much obviously the case in any case jobidon yesterday met with the widow of alexey nivalne he said today met with julia and dasha navalnia elexayn of all these that loved ones to express my conoincis for their devistating loss elexays a legy of crose will live on in ulia and dasha and the counless people across russia fighting for democracy and human rihts afterward by the way he then walked out to a car those to take him to a diffrent location and proceeded to call her yolanda i'm not kinningo nimes ulia as soneven yolanda is not even a russian name l the president of the united states has not been with us for some time also apparently when meting with doners jobidin called of ladmer outen a crazy eso b here is whata here is what see an an reported yesterday off script off camera and amongst friends emocradit supporters an goners as where presidet abiding appears most comfortable levelling some of his sharpest and most direct attacts speaking at a funrasing event an san francisco last night the president too ame wit several of his adversaries including russent president lataer poutent quote we have a crazy eso b that gi pooten and others and we always have to be worried about a newclear conflict but the existential threats o humanity is climat he said a g forstpal hes out of it he is tung about the dangerous of poutn and he still talk about the weatheris that it is the weather that is really the problem meanwhile fladerpooden who again is a canny political operative as well as a vicious dictator i he was asked about bidon's comments that fine call me f craziesobe but i am kicking your ass evenleguided listen we recently co an deosony who wul prefer as the future presden fifty nint states i set that we were work with any creciden but i believe that for us a russia biden is more preferable ive owould in case why is he doing that i'ves the speculation is that it is a siop essentially that he is reversing himself that really he wants trump is what the mediam one say the really really wants trump and that he is saying bidon specificallyes that peoplewill vote against bidon thinking that he is working with bidn whatever the case may be the bottom line is the debie administration has slow walked au cranes beginning made absolutely un cleawrd america's interesar in ucrane the first place which is undermine a lot of american support for u crane in the first place meanwhile the president unleashed some new sanctions yesterday they are on more than five hundred at targets apparently theyre said to be rolled out by the treasury and states partments in full to day they come after the white house signall that the were preparing major penalties after the recent death of nevalny in a russian prisoness succording to the new york times theuus has been closely cordining with europe in is efforts to cut russia off from the glovel economy this week the e onvailed its thirteenth tranch of sanctions on russia bandning nearly two hundred people and intities that been helping russia picure weapons from traveling or doing business within the block now listen if it bid ones do more than this he certainly could he could be pushing secondary sanctions on major companies that are doing business with the russians he could be trying to put pressure on the chinese and the eroneans unfortunately he is doing none of those things to again lack of clarity on policy from the president of the united states and this of cours is leading people to think that there is no plan because their cina is not according to jobidon according to the same new york times thaas been stumping consistently for support for the war in ucran quote the bid administration in european allies call precident pouton of russia a tyrants and war criminal but he enjoys a standing invitation to the hallsopower in brazil the president of razils as ucrane rush are both to blame for the war that began with russia's military invasion his nations purchases of russian energy and fertilizer have sored pumping billions of dollars into the russian economy anda as we noted yesterday the secretary o state went to hang out with lula and praise him literally yesterday two years after the begining of the war according to the eur times putnis not nearly as isolated as useofficials had oked russas in herent strangth rooted ands va supplies of oiland natural gas has powerday financial and political raziliens that threatens to outlast western opposition in pars of asia africa and south america his influences as strong as ever or even growing his grip on power at home appears as strong as effort as well the war has undoubtedly taken at toll on russia it is rect the country standing with much of europe the on north america and europe however there is lot of evidence to the contrary with china indian brazil buying russian oil in record quantities now again this would be an opportunity for the united states to use the power of its ellang industry in order to undercut the russians bud are they doing that nope because the environmentalist because the big threat is climate meanwhile the putn pressure on place brazil not they were two busy celebrating when yo idere botsond aro lost the election to lulad de silva that corrupt oligarc meanwhile apparently the pentagon is learning new lessons from the war in ucrane and the thing that mostly learnings that we spend a lot amonehy on tack and not enough money on yukno actural weaponry according to the washington post the character of war is changing the lessens taken from ucrane stand to be an enjuring resource the ucrane conflict is challenged corasumptions the wors become an antrissional slug fest with each sided tempting to wear down the other a model thought to be an acarnistics and stacy pettyjohn directore of the defense program at center for a new american security it is complicated along hel believe in the pentagon that expensive precision weapons are central

per aur and a reveals where in a patcho flute to evade the defenss again the american military is up is learning somethings from this battle suffice it to say however that russa far has survived if you arne no more about the history of oucrane that vladmer putten cit as his rational for attacking ucrane we did we are putting out an episode of facts that goes through te entire history of you crane what is true what is not in all the rest when it comes to the actual situation in u crane however again it is jobiden's leadership that has that has been a failure here a cross the board is been a real problem what exactly it given the fact that the worlds on fire what exactly are democrat's going to reliupon going into the elect we no the answer this one the gune rel li upon abortion there their latest argument with regard to abortion is predicated on an alabama quaurt decision is supreme court decision ruling that embryos deserve constitutional rights in the state of alabama which makes logical sense a if the basic idea is that life begins at conception and that is the predicute for alabama law with regard to abortion than if that life is conceived even in a pitrodish than it still deserves a level of protection in the state of alabama according to the washington post for patients and their doctors in retro fertilization i've yet had long beenassociate with hope and reassurance for the future and alabama seeking or providing in fertility treatment is now mire an anxiety that is because the alabama supremecort has ruled that frozen embryos are children and deserving of life and protection which gain makes perfect sense if it were in a woman's womb thn i would already have the protection of alabamalaw the only question was of its located outside the womb does it no longer have those protections the question really is is the definition of life locational or is it not jus non a logical level if there is an embryo and it is hagain located outside the womb is it human life or is it not now again the entire predcut for the perlife movement is that location is not the tofinding feature of what makes human life it is the is the prochoice movement that suggests that location is what truly matters right is why the protroice movement will argue tht a baby whos born it is baby but a baby still in mommy's tummy is just the cluster of selves an he pro life movement has argued whether it is in the stomach or out of the stomach is irrelevan the real question is the definition of life itself the alabama supremecort last week ruled that frozen mbryos are people and can some tont and some one can be held libele for destroying them the first of its kind ruling came as at least eleven states of broadly to find personhood as beginning at fertilization in their state laws that alabama case focust one whether a pation whom mis stakenly dropped an destroyed other couples frozen embryos could be held liable ind a wrongful death law suit the court rule the patient could writing it had long held that unborn children are children and that was also true for frozen embryos affording the fertilized eg the same protection s babies under the wrongful death of a minor act now again that makes perfect logical sense pep oure trying to say that that is crazy ie failed to understand how exactly that is crate the entire predicut for the prolife position is life begins at conception if life begins at coneption and a child has already been conceived a human being with protential then that hold true re gardless of the location the courts that it applies to all children born and unborn with etlimitation is not the role of thes court to craft to new limitation based on our own view of what is or is not wise public policy that is especially true here where the people of the tate hof adopt thad a constitutional amendment directly aimed at stopping courts from excluding unborn life from legal protection now agan that does not mean the legislature could not change its mind on iv f or change the law to exemp to iv f but under current law and its the job of the alabama superemcourt to interprecurrent law that is in fact what the law says this has led to what democrats thinking is winning issue which is the suggestion that iv f will be outlawed everywhere because if you are saying that you have to protect embryos tha are conceived then what do you do with iv f my own personal position with regard to iv f has always been that you should in sept the number of embryos tat you are willing to bear to term that otherwise you are doing something that is effectively quasy eugenic that that when you when you create sy seven human embryos and the you discard five of them that two of them can be implanted the only thing that separated the five that were discarded from the two tht were in plantsed was your choice it was not the definition of the life you could pictd one of the other five that also would have turned into a human child iaveseen people who are comparings to spirm are agdatobviously diferent thing spermonatone will not grow into a human and agonitone will not grow into a human a fertilized tuman embryo will in fact turn into a human if placed in the proper conditions an whei say turn into a human i mean it is a human now it will turn into a baby if place in proper conditions the washington post of course is jumping all over this ther'r lot f people i mani know people who have used iv f to conceive i've offered money to help people use iv f to conceive mi my only condition in in actually providing a loneer or or charitable giving on that was my own pro life position which is in plantan even if it is more expensive if you if you want to implant to embryos then conceve two embryos that that is the prolife position on this particular measure thow is that make for alkward potic shure because prlife always makes for owkward politics the reality is that the vastmatority of americans are a in the in the fifteen sixteen twelve league stage with regard to where they think abortion is and is not appropriate that dosn't ean their right lot people think a lot of things about morality that are wrong as it turns out however the attempts to to pain the two things can be truat once one the alabamistponcort is totally correct morally and legally speaking and second this can be politically damaging for republicans those two things can certainly coexis there ra lot of things that you say that are true that are not necessarily politically helpful democrats are counting on that according to the medical association of the state of alibama the significance of this decision impacks all alibami alibamians and will likely to feure babies children grandchildren nieces nephews and cousins as for tility options become limited for those wh want tohave a family earlier on wednesday bethmalysia apartner at alabama fertility had to call four for patients all the more scheduld for embryo transfers in a few hours to tell them the clinic was pausing all transfers for at least a day or two the decision to cancil embryo transfers but to continue with other procedures planned egg retrievals was made under the guidance of the clinic labdrectors and lawyers the four patients will have to wait least a month for their next ovulation to start in embryo transfer now n was confident i guess at the at the clinic tht if an embryo failed to thaw that they would not be held liable well that that that is a diferent thing i mean that again i'm m confuses to why you ad missinterpret that idea fow unev a frozen embryo you unfreeze the embryo and it fails to thaw properly and unfortunately addized that is not an act of of murder that is in accident that is it that is what happens with many human embryos that do not come to fruition in a hugenumber miscarriages are are effectiaely spontaneous abortions by the body again as allwes and politics two things can be tre at once the right position can be politically damaging democrats are counting on that full stop does that mean the nd of i vf kno it means much more careful use of i vf and serious thought about how many embryos ought to be fertilized in order to be implanted it w'll lead to fewer embryos being fertilized and fewer mbryos implanted and also fewr embryos being randomly discarded already folks coming up we will jump into

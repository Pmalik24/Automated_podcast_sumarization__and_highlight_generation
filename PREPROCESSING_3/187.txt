well pic em up day three my first night in a bump shelter it as one and a half floor steep under ground to be precise and that work of corridors and corriders at the dark entrance to our basement i see the silhouettes of residence scurrying pass each other you can over hear the occasional petty arguments two older shadows passed by two younger ones good evening but the evening is not good the unger one's protest we wish you a good evening anyway the older once sayin triumphant tone because we meanwhele and we will continue to wish it the shadows disappearingto the depths of the celler as i write it occurs to me that during the day i saw many smiling peeplt for example a woman who was sitting in the park in a bench nexted to shoping bags she spoke to me in an absurdly happy voice saying that she was waiting for her nephew to help her carry the backs hone i'm happy to have you stending next to me now talking to me when there are two of us i'm less afraid of the artillery day five almost all farmises are close electricity wahter and heeting or under constant thread of failure the public spaces squares streets an the city are empty i accompany in to german friend who could not stayin cave to the railway depot a journey of twenty five minutes which for me was a walking to anotheir vast reality since the beginning of the war i have not visidege of chenko boullward a wide street leading down to the depot we walked along the street in every house every intersection carried something new an new language and you narrative about our shared reality the city looked peaceful we quickly said good by ind i strolled back alone at about the same time peaceful residence of the city of bedunx and the south of the country were gathered in front of their local government building which was occupied by puddan's army and guarded by armd soldiers the woman shouted that the soldiers in russian how can you look your mothers in the face you brought war in slaughter intoral end shame on you old people were als in the crowd ther were not afraid the soldiers look demoralized they replied we came to protect you the women resisted they continued to protest we were never in danger here there was no threat to us before you came now with you because of you we are in the grat as danger then came curse insults which have a very great richness in the eucranian in russian languages day six it is the six day of the war which i feel has alweady lasted fifty years i went for a walk to breath some fresh air in this first day of spring and may be do some shopping knowing the many supermarket chose for away to empty i d cited to visit a larger grocery store that had recently opened not far from us how pleasant it was to be there the shopping holl is deep under ground everyone felt safe and walked past the shelves with he slowness that has not been seen in keyef for six days on the way back i toc a picture of an old man sitting alone on a bench in tapark he wanted to talk to me his wife was ill he told me and he was taking care of her he wanted to take care of her untill to morrow then he will joying the key of territorial defence he and his wife are sixty six years old and his youth he served in the militry i started thanking him i could not stop as if that would prevent this elderly men caring for a sick wife from risking his life day nine i woke up quite early in ha bright moodin with the feeling that this signy day had something to offer me wlittle was left of the melancholy i felt yesterday then in discovered the reason for this change i no longer believe in the war it is simply cannot be i thought it is not true what neighbouring country boms the city to rubble in the twenty fir sentry you cannot occupy this country it is unrealistic the war is a dream a dictators fantasy i wanted to seeve the little store next tour house still had bread i have not been able to get bread since the third day of the war it is usually sold out the store was fool what sum amazement i discovered a group who i took to be representatives of the international militry they spoke english and needed help translating then i realized that they were not soldiers but unarmed if well protected escorts of a war photographer who was also shopping in the store i tried to help her chose a deturgent the small group exuted enthusiasm humour and inspiration my mood suddenly darkened wone of the three escorts proudly said to me do who we'r stending with this is one of the best photographers in the warld the photographer lagt and shrugged it off please she said i'm embarrassed then she told me her name i cannot remember the name i've been having a hard time concentrating lately then she said you can follow me an instomam the group bottle out of deturgent almost everything in the store i told them good to have you with us and said good by bup quickly and uneasiness came over me i realized that it is not a good sign when a well known war photographer tat sup shop here day twelve i receive an utility bill for my cave apartment it is accompanied by a telegram message that sounds an apology we are writing to you with a request if youre financial means alow under the circumstances please pay the utilities many cave utility workers joined the ucranian army and are now fighting for or freedom however it a important to pay the bills day seventeen it was a sleepless night the air raed alarm sounding it sirance over the city kept meup al night i was too tired to go to the shelter i heard explosions and hoped that no one was injured my plent for the day was to pick up my bull probest which had finally been delivered then i would visit a lady who as a sort of concierrge watchus over a house in the neighbourhood and keeps and i on the comings and goings there are many such conciergios in the city but since the beginning of the war this lady had taken on an additional task she must make sure that nothing is stolen from the abandoned apartments her name had a comforting ring to it that reminded me of childhood busa one of the residents from her building who had escaped had asked me to chick in in her which made her happy because she is alone no one can relieve her of her watch she also lives in the building were she works i visited her and her small concierge room on the first floor there was only space for a table an a sofa the tivie was on she said many people are escaping keyv but i have nowhere to go and her face i saw helplessness but she had made her decision to stay put i tried to light in the mood with some not entirely clever jokes i was happy that she smiled at me and i decided to visit her again soon pday twenty for to day and old couple made their way through the recagen see trifleman street they walked chatly pass shares of brokend glass an heeps of rebbl this elderly pair we have lived their lives amit undying declorations of love between russians and eucranians two brotherly peoples did not want to believe that frech aside was in ful swing the man speaking to his wife free protian visible enemy wlook how many windows how much glass has been smashed jesus they have not thought about the fact that they will have to clean this up all this chaos just to say the rushians did to us the man spoke desperately and with an honest sadness the woman nodded in sight they walked straight past me on the ground pigions pacted breck crumbs among the shards of glass despite the damage a woman had come to the market place a she does every day to feed the birds there was sunny and alfully quiet the streets felt free and tere was a deceptive illusion that along walk was safe day twenty six i went to the train station with my mother to seeif we could get train tickas for ourselves nour relatives we walked through the old staty that my mother had once shown me a story one reached to a child the train station was not as crowded as we expected all the shops had closed and the only tockets available were for the vecuation trains several of these stackets were standing room only and because some of my relatives have half concerns to keep them from standing we decided to look for takus again later my mother and i walked back down this treet and tri to cher each other up with the few jokes then we saw little yellow buses with red crosses hadding toward us an the direction of the train station on each buss was ridden it been a place north of key of for many artiss and riders once lived and where now people die every day rusha is annihilating the small town blockd by block in the dusty bus windows we saw the gray tired faces of old people in children all staring some were far away anto the distance we stopped and looked i could not take a poto in the evening i saw that the train tickets were being sold again without much time to considerate i boughts six tickets for friday my parents still don one to leave keeve i really do not know what we should do but there should be enough time before friday to deside day twenty nine a little girl looked at me ith a friendly expression she was coloring the backrest of a wooden bench with a piece of chalk she tried to tell me something but she was interrupted by her grandfather who seemed annoyed listen here he said to me a somewhat braze an voice i told my daughter lat's buy the apartment in keyov but she replied nobody wants to live in keyv wit its stuffy big city eire we should get a nice apartment under the green trees an butscha outside of keiev and being the foolish person i am i agreed he looked at me reproachfully as if i were the one who had persuaded him to buy an apartment in a pleasant suburb nell smothered in fire rocket some mortar shells i did not even want to talk to him at first but he called out to me and asked to walk a few steps in his direction it was already evening soon the curve he would begin they air rade alarm had just sounded and i thought i only had a few minutes for a little conversation but then the men mention butscha and all of a sudden i decided to spend as much time with them as they wanted the girl who was about six years old told me in a serious voice for two weeks we lived in the basement we were twenty on adults and seven children the grandfathers s till seemed angry with me y come from a city where most people sbek rushian i come from ne pro but part of our family lives here in butchanding keyov two weeks in the basement with only water some food almost no heeting and barely any electricity constant shelling especially when we tried to sneak a little fresh air and then they found us the roshans came to us in the sellar and explained no they barked that they had come to denot suffy us if i were not seventy years old i answered them i would rather throw you out than talk to you do not speak to me not even for a secon at the end he got furious that he said to me you should go there to butscha if heu were there you would not look at me that you would understand everything and here and keyov nothing has been made clear to day my childidh friend lost his family home early in life i used to visit his house all the time i tried to remember the rooms i recalled the traditional living room of a small house with a low ceiling i resplendent cabinet with old phodos behind a glass shelf and the meals my friend's grandmother used to prepare for us this memory is not accompanieg by any feelin gday thirty my relatives one to lean kyv we had already planned our exit but as the day of departure ruthlessly approached they had more and more complaints in objections here and keiiv where every day you come across friends acquaintances and strangers he and up helping you managed samehow to bear the enbarable news in events we decided to postpone our departure for a few days and perhaps prepare a little better on the way back from the train station my mother and i met two people from the military who were sitting in front of a grocer store drinkin coffee they showed us a picture of a boy ho was only for teen years old posing in a uniform next to some soldiers were going to our military positions to day to fetch him one of the soldiers explained he followed his father and onct to fight shoulder to shouldier with him but he 's too young they have clearly lost everything their house their family and now all he wnts is to

doing the right thing te fending eth mic russians in crimia and it had an effects on both of them alona thought about becoming a doctor in the military and she thinks this is one reason ol leke joined the army then and twenty nineteen alyona went on a trip to crimia and it totally changed her mind about what had happens she was hichiking with her friend talking to a lot of ramians and the story they told was completely different from what she knew the annexation had been awful my moly musshin to shesion wi esya a not at as long as as at the te fadose there is as one woman that wa has to ride with who took us all the way to a feadosa ayona's friend asked her about some grefete hed seen in russia lalking twenty fourteen thet said cremia is ours ana thi she la quie tas and she sated literally yelling as being what do you mean crimy as yours when it is ours it belongs to the people who actually lived there and that madea really beg impression on me beleshshin at the wostor yahatheshinless i came away with u sense that i had made a huge mistake and that i had been thinking of really wrongly for a really long time this was the first big crack in what alyona had believe and she came back from cremiam she sard going to protest against the government and hearing about how pooden came to power about the crimes his government had committed her entire world he changed and she wanted to tell everyone wa o e me didns to the host e she las e gitin niglosan i wwas living with the conviction that i had just eben living with my eyes closed before that and now that i had my eyes oen i wanted every one else in the world to open their eyes too including all leg and he listened he did not agree with her but he was nice about it well el i just said that is find that chur choice inoin o prostike you'l ti ther o go webe leke trace was different he believed the propagandam wa sawn tv he stock with what the government said the way i reached out to old leke for this story and did not hear back but he knows the alyona that were telling it and he told her he is ocat with it alyna would talk abut her changing politics and old leg wid disagree but it never felt a bigteel until this here in january old legg was on leave from the military and he came through moscow wa ba yes te cu for pe de to we to con smiol and he had a few hours before his flight and we went down to tha eirline office to get his ticket and then we had that at my house drinking tea and talking and that was when he told me that there was going to be a war in you crana and i was aleg mes there is not got to be a war and i sir telling him the stuff from this inin winger bok that a globl violence is going down that lovily there is less and less crime there is ithas murder that is war that is what all the political scientist say and he is just well e mi on ner right and that night ways said good by in with yer each other and after that at all began february twenty fourth russia invades you crane alyona calls oldleg and oleg says yes soldiers are being sent but he saw on the list alyona immediately joins the protested moscow eayona as catagorically against this war she decides to get the now famous phrase russian worship co fuck yourself tatwue t across her ribs it is her first tat to and then in the middle of march old legg messages their group chat alyona pulls it up to read it to me the bolis stins stil matonly ti yes the ce wiga and he said well looks i'm actually leaving and a i'm only going to have a donthone with me when i get there not thin i be able to send you anything

all love you then calls him she munct know exactly where he is going in what he will be doing he oon he didn or te be now and than he told me that he was probably going to go to rostolv or may be even somewhere closer a just to pick up the bodies of the that the casual ti sa to oe ye to i was promise me that you are not going to go fight in this swar for me and ham going to get the bodies was o ke as long as he did not go fight and he said i cannot promise you that at is yuge had did you feel i was ot you you m he ee won peeee joor yo a w i just completely freked out i ws just yelling at him i do not you remember what i was yeling and i was u screaming into my phone and he was completely silent alyona tries to convince him not to go that since it is nond an officially declared war he can defect without gettng in trouble she is looking for a way out for him but he does not want one shimer's yelling that she was going to come to his army pase and break all his fingers by the end of t he call she is calmed down accepted that this was happening she cannot change at but that evening as the reality of what is happening settles in that there is noway oleg can go to war and not harm some one alyona swings back into a state of impotence and rage ye yo ibi we of besul i got wasted that niht at a bar that i was probably screaming woud enoug for everybody in the bar to hear me that my friend was going to go fight in the swar and it would be better if heu just died o codom bea e o the gaes an if he does not die he will come back and i'll know that he is a murder that he is a criminal adyon is not sure if she ever once to talk to him again many people i've talked to in russia are going through something this raght now having their fundamental relationships get ripped up by this ar several of my friends no longer talk to their parents one of my friends whose response to this work was to threaten to burn his passport his father called him a noutsy he does know how e'll get over that s the a won began a ye ao a water i was a coming home from work and i was going up a the escolater an the subway i talk to alyona a few weeks later and i got a foncolf and at anyone suspect who it was am and i was already kind of pestop because i sually hated when people call me ye yet eon yyo wenae and then when i took out my fone and i saw that it was o i i mean i do not even have the words to describe what i falt this was two weeks aftery he would leff an alyona's relieved just to hear his voice again all that anger that she would felt intensely towards him in that moment it disappeared ye u naae ater i got oup to the top of the escolater and i was just pacing around in the subway station asking him totally ben all questions what youin wa drinking how is the wether just itly silly this and how did he anser what did he tell you y thii tar you was tosua oeconswhen i asked know how he was sleeping he told me he was 't sleeping wall and i was he o start to telling himself all man youd sleep a sone forean for your mental health and you have to try to sleep well and he just laughed at man he was can you imagine how hard it is to sleep in yeu grain right now after that call they keep texting taventually his unit is moved from somewhere round keyve to belleroes and there he is more free to talk they viddia chat every few days during one call olic shures these details about the war and a crime he is heard a russian soldier has committed suddenly their calls cut off after that they desid they should not talk about the war ase their probably being monitered they stook the basic stuff food weather talkin tolyone of these past weeks has been watching a pendulume waing back and forth she started offic such intense feelings a fury helplessness she once cried in a calll thut now she swinging lass all the feelings are still there that us smaller on a way to work she does these small protests she ties creen ribbons and tree branches she writes no war in black sharp be interbenches a she still chapped with heir friend a russian soldier and then the news from boocha comes out hundreds of civilians have been killed the photofs many are awful their dead bodies in the streets in gardens fallen from bicycles for adyona there was one picture in particular that made her ole body turn cold it was of a woman's hand lifeless alyona remembered the perfect manicure one nail painted with a tiny heart the en you proe plest godeal of golovious o what was going through their heads that they could have done tha yui soplit is i unbearable o even think about how you are the same species as people who were capable of doing something that in when yu when you saw when he saw when youve heard about it did you did you think about oleg ah theishinou sh o osyi awa yan a an it jas really hard to put inthe words thewoshes los sus after bucha alona says it was hardy to talk to aleg she asked him if he was part of anything that he said now then he denied it was even happening he tried to convinced her that it was all alive yes otable what you g oon begreens e msu what i ask a lig about which a he immediately was telling me that this was a a false flag that you cran army had done at themselves i just kept saying and still saying that wiche was faked and that nothing that happened where he was either and this it infuriated alyona he would recently told her how he had heard of a soldier committing crimes against civilians and now here he was pariting the government's propaganda that things she used to love about him his refusal to be bothered by anything it now made her sink as i dona tells me about this conversation tou you mik could hear her softening giving him the benefit of the doubt the benefit of friendship part of her which rearly lyt to imagine that made pe oldleg does not even believe what he saying to her but that he has to say it yp in my soul it is posiver possible that he just telling me what the tell him to tell people their frendship used to be easy now it has the weight of a war attached to it i do not know if it survives this it seems despite all of alyona's efforts there is been an irreversible change but alyona's pushing back against it she is holding on to this imaginary future her oldleg will come back a different person thetd oll grow to see things more her way tlas that of a dutiful party lying soldier may be go to faraby and that is what i am invested in and that is why i'm continuing my relationship with him an what if he does not become that kind of person m yeishoye ri oscattye ah thei you suckssc yes al i am not going to gave up or what i what it tus if i start thinking about how the war is not an tha end how rushas not going to retreat from yeucrane how people are never going to face up to what they have done and acknowledge their mistakes i'm not going to be able to function and i cannot think that way alyona just got news that old leg's been sent back into ou crae n he returned from the war though she is determined to stay his friend and then she hoped some day maybe in twenty or thirty years they will finally be able to talk about what really happened in the war tat we cly shes

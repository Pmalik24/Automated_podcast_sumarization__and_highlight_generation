back on one o the early episodes of our radio show i had my from vertomak grovner come on verta was this amazing cook shrti coo cook in nineteen seventy vibration cooking that is still in print to day and verta had the story that she would tell sometimes that back when her book was published she was interviewed on the to day show by barbara walters ors on the show back thone and im the way verted told the story she is on ti v making fri chicken for barbara walters and it' some point barbara walters ess her haw he tell the chickens done and verta says you can tll by the sound and in vertis telling miss walters gives her the skeptical golk i give me a brak and cuts to commercial verta said that was always people's reaction they say you are crazy verta that is not yet tit is kept you do not tell me some real was it fifteen minutes twenty minutes or whatever an i seyofve got a listen to the sound of the greece listen to the music oun se years verto make claim that yo can tell if a chickens done purely by the sound and to prove the point you agreed to come on to our radio shor to conduct this little readior experiment where my corkers and i fri ta chicken and we recorded it at four different stages a fryine and then shuffle the order of the recortings wa reverta the deminstrate once afr all was it true can somebody tell of a chickens cooked but that any visual clues without smell and here is me playing the four recordings for verta and her trying to pick out which one is the chicken when it is finished let us roll and i listeners at home can play along with us here let us roll the first little sample sound i say ye i say that somethem the middle o k but thet definilly is not towards the end you sad yet i it is it is in the middle gone toward thianisin the three fourth i let us let us here a let us here sound number two please nomber to is toward dian too o can number three i se beginnin for the beginning that is more twards the beginning and number four sanger sorgian o ken when all os little balls are forming on the bottom the little nice crusty now avert if you would have to hazard to guess us to which one would be the very last one as still sis one or two that is towar dian the answer is number too ver to make him reasonably cause but she was not wholally certain tell me if a chicken is done only by sound turn out to be harder than she thought er to be yes it was hard you have to see it d what i mean ye oh it is it is it is iminutes asserious she os h labor and tense if thing you got a stay on it you just cannot be talking on the phone and watch an tev you got to stay on that chicken biwas esking your daughters to day and they were saying how they can also a tell of rice is done by the sound oh yet that is true ye i taught them that those are the kind of family values are tauht my children listen to the sound of the chicken me listen to the sound of the rice vertymon died for years ago si hav to say got to me a little listening to this next pit on the interview when she talks about her daughters and ow happier made her to hear when they said about her you talk to both of them i talk to both of them they were both really funny one of them said everything that she cooks is golden brown and perfect perfect perfect who said that that was i believe it was shandra really but she said but just because where her daughters that does not men that she tells us the real recipes we ask her for the recipes and she tells us recipes o them when we cook them they are not the same and not tat e hollding back on a gradi hat's at's te a quite true but i just tell them but then they have that the find out to rest for themselves thego it is i i ta as as is many things inparent i say i put a litte ginger i ni noou know than they have to tiger out how much a little ginger is ther that is what to have to do fidiguss really is ever family tis culture and his tradition it is a provisation is art to day and our show for thanksgiving we can we but together a show made of stories we have done over the years about foo ind every one of these stories somebody heads out on a quest eithet figure something out uld it do something very differently with food that most of us to dry beasy chicago its this american life am our glass they with us that one dead ring er it is aver years back one of our producers bent calhoon set out on a mission much more eccentric and labor intensive the finguring out if a chicken is done by listening to the sound here he is i first heard about this whole thing in an email it came from a listener a woman name emily rancer peworks in the food industry and the letter emily wrote was about a story she would heard from a farmer the farmer who told her this is apparently a person of some standing in the pork industry admittedly i do not know the first thing about the pork industry but he is in charge of a pork producing operation that span several states the story he told emily went something this a while ago he was visiting a pork processing plant noclehoma he is walking through it with a friend a guy who managed the planactually and at some point he saw boxes stacked on the floor labeled artificial calamari he stood there wondering for a second and then he asked his frien what is artificial calamari bung his friend replied it is hog reckdim reckdim that would be sliced into rings deep fried and boom there he have it hoke if i can let me just narrate for you what this would mean it would mean that in restaurants everywhere write this second people our squeezing lemon wedges over chrispy golden rings nd dipping the rings into marinara sawt and they are eating og reckdim now they are tewing satisfyed and deeply cluless it is pay back it is pay back for u blissful ignorance about where our food comes from and how it gets to us it is amazing and it is but it also seems a could not possibly be true i called up the farmer the talk to him personally i wanted to hear at first hand and the farmer confirmd the story be entire thing the boxes the bung but when i asked him to go on the record to tape an interview and give his name here on the radio he very politely declined which seems suspicious right when i asked him why he said he would spoken with his girl friend about it and she suggested that he should think about the words that he wanted to come up when somebody googled his nam this was all fine though because he referred me to the real expert the guy who gave him the tour of the hog processing plan and that guy he agreed to talk oh y is this ran ye ye this is rn me meet processing plant manager presently residing in mountain view missery where he runs an organic beef processing plant there called beyond organic if the story really were true ran would have been the guy who explained to the farmer what was in those boxes the bot o er can babot and and theyre ala bat gat o emat yoe lot may be ye a bin a waibi peo e t bu an ta you ot it what bot ye bat bot a at e tha an an in wa an er tan ta wa ot abot a big madle withat ba ba a b but but the specifically the labels that said a imitation calumari but where where did you personally see the imita ho howmar they la a a ever ti tat wable bay that ta bala po athe the people ta po mea e the people a wort orat e pmeer oh the people that that you work for told you that it was used for imitation calumri bt and is there any possibility that you think that tha when they were explaining this to you that that they were on o havin you on a little bit haven me o ye a o mahehe ye a well i what ba that but o be paperfi uben tat y bo peerfoy bared ooke just to give a little better picture a port bung and bung is the actual industry term for it is long and floppy and ugly at one end it widens out into this more bulbish shape a pink wrinkly pair that is the rectom at the other end at narrows into a soft pinkish white too i know it sounds grows but also consider we are a nation that youts more than a billion pounds of sausage every year billian with a bee maybe you liver worst tor capicola or summer sausage with a natural casing then you me have eaten bung stuff dried bung a lot of brots and italian sausages are steffed in in testing if you eat those regularly you pretty much live up the street from bung why does the idea of a fried ring of bung just feel groser partly it is the visual right when you see that little ring of calumari you do not want a picture it in the context of a picks behind then there are all the people who do not eat pork period rown said there is also another reason tat bega t a bu bor bung brobably and people bout ye wa ga u bu maama at he bung that y a yo away e but the big question the question you have been thinking about since we got on this topic have you or i eaten imitation calumari bung dressed up is sa food well bron did not know he said his plan exported a lot of their bng to asia but he just did not know much about whatever happened after left the door he could only speculate anything he said would be a wild guess the whole i turnd to people who would know is pork bung being falsely petaled as columari i called to youastie the you este is food inspection service issued the following statement to me products we inspect including those derived from pork must be accurately labeled and cannot purport to be a product of another species it is ta gainst the rules but people break the rules a recent study of sea food by a group called oceana used d an atesting and found that all across the country fish is regularly being labeled as other species restaurants and engrose restores escalar sold is white tuna posi rockfish being fraudulently sold tas snapper in my ami more than thirty per cent of fish was being sold as something it was not and new york the number was thirty nine per cent boston forty eight per cent wos angelis ar youready fifty five per cent fifty fi that means if you order fishin alay you are most likely eating a species you did not order in other words seefood substitution is rampen in this country and depending on where you live whan i can tell you can get cleaned hog bung for about half the price of clean squid there would be money at it if you could pull off the suit as best as i can tell were you to do this you would not be caught a lawyer whose familiar with this areaof law an regulation told me once bung leaves the plant there is a variety of agencies and enities that would be in play u stie f tie staed and local government but ultimately he said the regulation we have is not designed to catch in o fence this it is aim mostly at sanitation and food safety bottom line the lawyer said if somebody wanted to do it chances are they would get away with it is some one out there doing this well for weeks i lookd for an answer the uestia says they have never heard of any one trying to pass pork bung as squid or any other species i contacted the national restaurant association the national pork producers counsil the national pork board a squid fisherman's association cisco and theother big food in restaurant supply companies it hog what a bung but hog rectam ohli gat that is the executive director of the california wetfish producers association but the answer was pretty much always the same nobody had heard of it but almost to a person they added that that does not mean it is not happening somewhere ron meeks set a lot of the bung from his plant got exported my next called was to the ues meat export federation which confirmd that quote the main destinations for pork bungs are china hong kong japan tiwan carea and the philippines they are mainly used for processing but we are aware of some uses in soups and certain entras we are not aware of them being used as a substitute for calamari but it is not impossible on quote over the past few weeks i've called asgen food suppliers people who live in work in and eat in those countries i talked to a woman named careing trang whose written in overarching compendium of asnt quazines i've talke to academics at anoy ou and have afferred and u c and harvard i've reacheduf to chefts who know asent food the answer again always similar never heard of it but it is possible partly because bung does not have such a complicated reputation in atia here it has to be some kind of secret ingredient a does here on the other hand though people pointed out that in carea in japan you cannot get more than a few hours from the oceon squit is cheap and it is readily available you would only eat a substitute if you wanted the substitute generally people said if the switch was happening somewhere they would guess china eventually i found my way to this sguy who i was really excited about some one who i thought might have my answer he was get this an anthropologis who lived and worked in china for forty years were he studied food and specifically meat when i talked to him though he made two points point one my question about this happening in asia was racist even just asking the question was rasis tbecause it plays on ignorant stereo types about other cultures eating things that we perceive his weird point too was that ron meek my got from the pig plant roun was pulling my leg and he was getting away with it because i was a dumass he told me more than once that i should quote find something worth while to do with myself when we ended our conversation he told me that he was refusing to even dignify what i was doing by appeering on the radio or by letting me use his name ooki to respond to his points one by one first and my rasist against agens well i'm half chinese my mom's chinese any one i've had the occasional issue with my mother but this has not been one of them we grew up iating chicken feet and fish eyes and i think it is possible to raise the question of who eats what without being racist his second point though that ron meek was pulling my leg i mean the guy was still an expert on meet in china i called ran back a thik me com quise on did i told him the whole thing about the anthropologist about what he said i guess i mean the only thing i would ask you is is ar ar youe messin with me now i mean that wit wat ma bo to me o wha what the hail we fay hat be hob un for ye then that o e brami pasion wet tet that but in your in your harde hearts you believe it y man i mean i may i get a that ren tery thng it it is bot bay with you an when that i yo go on off abat tleg you hagin o ba i mean yoa thank about at how for it tant toter half is ar tecially tig one that n a mak ever pany ca wa the one i work that you bring the pig than you ta an hou tick am and the blood go of and to the trop and a gon town in it back you tha dow there with that

the tam e to that tan in the gow and yo b i man you can be an at the bo if tou you a it you do whork in a bo iting buiet you do not mot i contact of the plant round worked at where this happen and for what it is worth they backed im up they said ther sales team had heard of people eating pork bung his imitation calumari though they had not witness at firs hand or heard it directly from a customer it was all here say at the end of all this i still had no proof that any one was passing off bung is squid and i realized i had not asked the more basic question here could bung do it could i pass his calumary and that question led me to a giname eddy lin and he land has eaten a lot of bung at least a hundred times he said probably more and he has a extreme food blug called deep bend dining and an online tevisho called comicasi kitchen i could doutily feet you resemblance texture wod oh really yet ye dufnly om buld bit a tort of this whart of a rubbery texture sort of a columary but you would really have tou get rid of that n you yo wu the thig tow fleven oder frum the t beo the bun somehow i had not figure that the bung once it was scrubbed and rinte and claime with steem that it would still taste o you ar you ul dut we have to you a mad your mador banching a ha winy ha ma ma at bini ye ha a tis is i trying to reach that those flavors auter there ya ime tat to waver a ben ya marnidn tat had for o quite a while o a lifetime yo aha ha he thought it would not be easy but he thought it could be done and there was only one way to tell if he was right took cook up some bung and eat it and if the taste was overwhelming and the texture was all wrong will then i'd have my answer and at this point i'll be frank i started to route for the bung i realize that this is not a story about fraud it is not a bait an switch story it is a story about possibility it is classic rags to riches it is about whether a cut of meat perhaps the lowliest most molionable cut of meat in america might somehow and at least one place on the planet be dipped in the redemptive oils of the great culinary equalizer that is the deep friar and it might emerge transformed no longer an outcast but instead hair comed clean shaven and a suiten tie it might walk reborn on to a table through sheer force of resemblance it might be love it is history years of drudgery and hardship doing the bodi's least glamorous job all washed awagh no this is not the story of a conman burney made off it is pretty woman this is whether goodwill hunting finds his way out of south it is whether charley on that very last chocolate bar really can get a golden ticket to do all this to try it i called my little sister loren she is a shaft trained abroad at the cordonbleeau worked at mischaln starr restaurants she is at kannishafft soon we were standing in front of a delly case and i doft know why i feel hesitan about saying this because i do not think its races it was in chinaton ar fo eridit lokin it looks it lookss liks lik er w what you man it looked fliker it is what of it cut out it loks liali and laren had theories about pulling it off grining soaking may be brazing but once we got to the store once she would seen the meat up close her doubts got worse i or looking at it i don' in at i do not mis inr your les an work it is oo tick its to uch is to much mus lik muscles it is tu aus lik ring cutter te take i the right i l wt he as is ar and there e o o my sister said eddy lynd was definitely right the give away would be the stubborn flavor coo that flavor she said it is tough to get rid of the earth revolves around the sun and bung will always tastes but there was no backing out now we would eat we would eat our way to the truth and what if it did not look good wat of bung was destined to taste bung who i did not look good for and he still put ot efight rocky balbola that to this was it the bung verseis calumari squidverse is tal the rumble in the bunkle we set up the tasting at a restaurant in a love between luncheon dinner in the dining room there was just a few tables eating and all round the restaurount the morning ship was wrapping up as we walked in with a red cooler filled with squid and hogbung originally i'd recruited some half a dozen people from our office at this american life as tasters the final groupe the day of the tasting included from the office sathlind and bryan reed windless on that you gets had calimari i had calumari probably a month ago i wat bat wot li ran m i have not had it since we got this tip about a about the possible oh my gos i beet of witing yani totally and i ad to be onuce i i calmar pry regin ot a regataringer of calumari lik got it not all the time but it something iwer te ny order t tit is on hapitize a inion you kno ye amn i groken an italian du family were my reparents were also born here i thoigk calmari jus big upon that sapper people cat alof garden itsolike that such s repating it i had not realized this for weeks bryan had been avoiding calumari he would been living in fear at if you find out that there in discernible from each other l u every calimari ga no i do not think that is why i want to do this just to no going forward back in the kitchen things were looking bad i given up on the idea that drung would taste the same as calumari now it hung my hos on the idea that it least visually it would look the same but is my sister dropped the flowered rings of hogbung into the frire they had turned into this kino big ugly tangled bod nothing the jiggly squit rings oh the vere te very scraggly looking but then as if by a miracle they changed my sister gave a shake to the fry basket and as they sizzled the bunches seemed to gracefully snap into rings oh look at that tho it is magic ter turning into circle a o o soon we were face to face with the plate on it they were two piles of rings similar in size similar in shape the bung had more of a frizzly edge to it kind of a fancy onion ring the calumari was smoother gateso i as sathan bryan did just give a first impression have it guess but i could toits most ting you pretty sure but you could tould be wrong g i thought it would be more sure i do not i'm awfa now my got reaction my ireaction is that this was this was calumari this was not booket before you read it you see i tolally thike this was calumari the other one sawmon a do a at the same time fooket just to be clear what is going on here sath has chosen one pile of ring which he thinks is calumar bryan has done the same thing only bryan is choosing the other stack of fried rings ook at we are about to sitere about to bit ed to the simultaneously which we both think this was calumari but there' th e officer officer ones agan in actuality sath is right sath is eating calumari the chewing you here from bryan's mie that is the tound of a calumari lover eating tried pick ractim i should also add theu were actually two varieties of bng on the plate that day one bung that my sister had blanched over and over to mellow any organy facl flavor and then untreated straight ut bungs on filtered unchained uncut one hundred per cent pure bung that one the latter one bung at its purest at the height of its bunginess this is what bryan was aggin as they ate sath still look confident i think i think that that was i thing i was right i i was right really i i to think i was right game sat match bung and it was not just bryan i thought damian who manages the restaurant he also thought it was passable a few of us picked up a faint flavor of portgrine but if you were not really looking for it you would not notice it was there one of the restaurand staff a gining eaten van burian had the simplest clearest explanation e i think that when youslighe something up within te debriedits in at is something its ben deprat if if a plateful the bung came out how many people do you think wuld would even do you think youd notice if you were in that satin i sa topsinario is somebody says this calumary tastes funny and keups seit and as for bryan o bryan bryan was realing a bit trying to figure out just what this was ge a mean for him im i i'm sure it been fulld of the past i'm just sure f it wet uo you are thinking that you bing places in the passin a mat bun i just imagine seeing a plate that looks it it this food that looks this on it sitting with my family growing up but we detfually have eaten something a tasted this and just thought it was calumary for sure not only was not he sure if heat every calumari again he did not want to eat the calumary on the plate in front of him calumary i guaranteed him was real just to repeat one last time i have no proof that anyone anywhere has ever tried to pass off pork bung as calumari in a restaurant all i know is if you wanted to do it it would be easy and i'm choosing to believe that it is happening somewhere because that' some point in working on this story i stopped identifying with bryan and any one who might feel redoff grow stout by getting imitation instead of the real thing now i identify with the bung and i'd to think that somewhere out there right now under a heat lamp a plater is sitting it is warm and it is full of promise an transformation and redemption that is the world that i'll choose to live in for me for you for the bung for the bung in all of us bancahan is one of the produces of y program that is n event before you o swear off calumar for ever please please notice the band is always thangat iis possible that this is happening that he did not find actuall documented proof that pig bung is being substituted for calumari a broad or especially here in the united states coming out cooking chicken for dinner right in front of the chicken who is your pat do you live with who watches you do it that is an a minute ricago bublogredio when our program continues it is smare from li from our glass to day's program turkey and a face mask for the holiday season this unusual covet thanksgiving wit many things about the holiday a di frend we put together a show with stories about food that we have done over the years we have arrived at at two of our programme ac too still life with chicken sor jonthan gold was a kind of legendary food writer invented this way of writing about restaurants the treeted hole in the well places and street food with the same seriousness that other restaurant critics had always written about fancy places this led to a whole jonra of food writing and tevy shows anthony bordan and before he died in twenty eighteen jonathan was on our show a couple f times and this interview that went to play you now it is rethis conversations that just it hinded in a very different place then it began as you hear it ended with him talking about iido exect le wou to call but the nature of eating but it began with jonathan explaining to me how he ended up living with a chicken he explained that that happened by accident when he was in his twenties he was not living the kind of life one usually associates with chickens this was during the period when i considered myself to be a performance artist of sort in naked performance artist to be specific he was putting together a performance he had a pia system which could put out the requisite amount of annoying feedback sound at high deciples he had the two full bottles of glade american beauty air of freshener which he would spry in their entirety in the performan space and he had a live chicken which he bought the day before the performance one of thos chinese poultry markets in mosangelis and comes to day of the shell and audiances gathereng in a darkened warehouse in west dela i do notnow if ou've been to a lot of performance art but this was sort of really tipical of the stuff that was going on of the period and i showed up aend i was naked and i was carrying machetting d i was blind and i stood in the middle of this pile of supermarket chickens ou knof the the broilers you by andthe chicken that ih bougt was tethered to a three foot rope around me ands i hack up and down blindly with the machetty toward the chicken or just in general wel wis blindfold eside enough was towards the chicken or non and i had fully intended that fact i would kill the chicken miss o efor but chicken's art that stupid and this chicken wanted no part of the machetthe stated the end of is rope the entire time apparently and after ten minutes when as completely exhausted i fell to a heat and everybody left and the performance was over i do not now if you have stuck around after an our performance but the few minutes after an aur performance are the some of the most doppressing in the world howsa ah you have you have done your wad you have done yer sort of bit for art which has see the worker hausad but you are sitting there you are covered with chicken to flubian my case it stinks to high hell everybody's gone and you have got a clean up and your naken its really not a pretty tell jonathan cleaned up and when he was done he had a chicken and he did not feelike he could kill the chicken destiny had brought them together he felt he could not turn his back he says it was the same as if a kicken chows up on your back door scratching lonely needy we took the chicken home and in doing that he stumbled across that tenin line that separates food itams on the one hand from pats on the other that devised the animals we eat from the animals we lov i get home and i i have the chicken and i do not know what to do with it i spread out some newspaper on the top of my refrigerator and i put the chicken up there iget a can of a green giant bread niblets from under the counter and i i opened it d i put in a little bowl for th chicken and i give the chicken a little water and the chickens on top of my refrigerator cause youcause you think chickens eat coin you had read that or something and those that was the available coin thowas the available corner i i wish i had thought better of the niblet us idea why becus in fact if you are buying three or four cands of nibblet to day which is whath the chicken aid and your existing on almost nothing which i was then your nibblet bill turns out to be some two figure per cent e of er total icomin choky i rear you could imagine living on fifty dollars a week if but ten dollars of a ghost for niblyou s just hard to justify an expense that though at the remove of fifteen years i think i can probably safely admicking now it one of the reasons that i stock with nibblets is i saying the word nibblet much and then this gave me the the excuse to use to words niblet in general conversation several times a day yusually just does not come op and the chicken stayed there on top of my refrigurator for long time months six months i i is it it is a wondron apartment e two rpabraet i had a kicken and a bedroom i did not have to look at the chicken when i was sleepy though i did not have to look at it hen i was cooking did you eve a cook chicken course i cook chicken did not you feel intensely a disloyal no i felt no particular loyal to this chicken i don' know if you have ever had chickens but it is not you ommi you do not pet chickens chickens not really you to pet them and you do not hold them there is really no love that you feel for a chicken in your life i do not thing but yet you kept the chicken i kept the chicken because i could not beare to do whatything else and it is not i could have carried it out on to pecka bll of ardon said be free little chicken be free did you give the chicken a name i never name the chicken i when i referre to the chicken public i was called it the hand how did you not name it it was t it was usa creature in your han us the chicken always seem temperar it never i curred to me that i might have the chickens long a chicks month itthe chicken always seemd something that i would have for just a comp of days and then what did you tink was got o hadi guess i thought e i thought about the chicken expiring be i have to admit thit there was a possibility that some day i would actually cook the chicken i went through a lot of chicken recipes hundred hundred the chicken recipe but thinking maybe this will be the best befor my niblet fed chicken exactly possibly i have to say the most delicious chicken that you could ever e because of this niblet you cannot bind niblet fed chicken for love for money i nomething i'm not sure thet a rist be existed that would have lived up to the fact of the chicken this animal who you have come to no on fairly intimate terms and who youave raisd and you have put a certain amount of emotion in tem i chicken if i might say who has seen you naked the chicken did see me naked damn it the fact is we need food to be just food and it' soon as to becomes a living thing especially if we are city people whan i used to the conversion of living things in to our food it is it is hard it is tried to handle without thinking it has to be bigger than food without wanting to make it mitualized or something bigger than food exactly ci tell you a short a small store yet of course onm a few weeks ago i was in this crean restaurant ing creatown n loss hanteless it was this place called the living fish center that i'd always wanted to go because the name of it was splendid in a living fish center i imagine some sort of vast vivarian word flipper was jumping through hoops and stuff and i go in there and of course it is just a primy cre in restaurant i mean it is it is not that clean and i do not know thar tanks and stuffd i do not o what to order i order a fish soup cause it looks they have a small fish soup specialty on the manu and it comes in its just really strong smelling not that gran and i try squid fried with being sauce and onions which was it was not that happening and i'm about to give up and pay the chack can go home with the avast table filled with i need not stuff and i suddenly cursed me with the special to the restauran is and e my way the watress over and i tell her that i'd a prawn and sheust puzzles she did not expect me to ask for a pran but i repeat my questions and she shrugs and goes and tells the sushy shef and he goes to one side of the restaurant he climbs on this chair this ordinary folding chair and he reaches into this long tank this running just below the ceiling and he wiggles his fingers in the water when he wiggles t fingers the pranse just become enraged and they start now nipping it his fingers and they start attacking him and he picks out a couple of the liveliest one and brings them back to his counter and without washing his hands mon you just makes a few motions over it and a couplesackond slide o the watress comes over with the prne on this huge down of ice what he done is you taken off the eggs ess gellan heat essentially the head was intack and that little part of the tail the is always on prawne is l there but the middle part is naked a grub and i picked up the pron with my chopsticks and it was not dead this prawnt it was extremely alive and it was wiggling it is legs and was wiggling its intenis and its eyes were swiveling madly on its eyestocks d i was looking back at me seeing me as actually the preditor f thi the creature that was gon to eat it and that was a really freakish moment because is much as as much stuff as i eat and is low low as i eat on the food chain and as many pranss i have dis pacshed to my life i have never before killed the living being with my teeth nd he the prawn kneu whatd i was going to do and he did not it and i was not quite sure what to do but if i put it down the promta died any waymens not to live without a chell nce on yelsewould have eat in a blablablass i bit into it i bid his body off wich my teeth and the pronh just relaxed in this way that was really earie and the taste of the crawn the taste of the meat of it was extraordinary youameas swet was it was life coursing throut it was the most live thing i've ever eaten you obviously literally but again it was freakou was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption which is killing a living creature with your teeth when you when you bit into the pron did you actually bite off its head its living head and and have its head in its eyes in your mouth no i bit off its body and i held the and i held the head in my hands se said you see you held the head and cun one hand in the tail in the othe n you bit the center run nd i thought that i i thought that i killed it but in fact when i put it down it was still had much life in it that it grabbed a pieces of samon's ashee and would not that go of it and i do not think i ever want to do that again did you feik there was something of about the experience that made it more this word is a little cornier than i intend but senwar that can think of that made it more sacred that took it out of the mundanenes of the way that we eat we true moste of us is eating without actually tasting and experience ting and thinking about what were eating and what on the earth it is that were killing to survive do you think in some way that it is that it is more it acceptable to eat an animal if you are more a wayk to the fact that it is an animal and what is happened to it but do you think e really does not matter i i think it matters a great deal i mean one of the uno greatest metaphors and question civilization t is that of christ to gave his life that others my live and i do not want to be sacrilegious and i do not want to dyou knon't be little thatmenth in anyway but a tik his giving its life that we might chickenist giving is life tit we might and i think the least that we could do is to think about that chicken to think about that caf that were eating not necessarily to be sat for it but to celebrate to dbeware of the being that it was that it was not just to bit of buyo engineerd protin somehow managed to find its wan to our places jonthin gold the curius bat his writing thi secllection of is columns called counter intelligence ie much time with the king of catchup i undershud it ay with the stray of a man who has a very simple mission in life to give a little special treatment to goo people if contribution to society is often overlooked the men and women of the food service industrate who when they meet this guy

to the guan ic too but that means nothing tells the tale how ar chacklits and i have been friends since were kids and i can say with great authority that almost every day for the past ten years how are chacklits ays either dined out or ordered ain at least w one of his meals sometimes when howard is and sure what he is in the mood for he will lift an empty hand up to his mouth and pretend that he is eating he stare straight ahead trying to figure out if he likes the taste of the imaginary food he is shoving into his mouth sometimes his hand is holding a hammerger sometimes a fork rapped in spegetty and other times he is double fisting either end of an invisible pork rib howards always loved restaurants he was raised in a jewish eastern european household were the very idea of a restaurant was ae ridiculous piece of decadens something for cossacks in cocane attics who enjoyed flushing their money down the toilet restaurants had a transgressive allure and as soon as howard was old enough he started sneaking away to them after school or sometimes on weekands while the whole family was still asleep in fact howard was the very first person i've ever dined out with alone without any family we were twelve years old and we ate at a tomic speets a rea a place just down the street from us it was owned by a crotchety old greek man named costa who served ridiculously large portions of food we would get a playt o fries the size of a dead shetlan pony but right alongside of it costa would place one measly packet of catchup when we asked for more he looked at us we had just asked from more blood from his mothers still beating heart were as i learned to rashion eating four tor five hundred french fries with a bottle capsized dallap howard learned had a talk to costa how to win him over how to make him see that giving us more catchup was just the right thing to do along the way howard learned haw to say in greek thank you kind sir bless you for the catchup as well as the excellent crony a por lavataw cetchup sas heis many years to your catchup ever since way back then howard has had a very special re por with the men and women of the food service industry and he has worked very hard over the years to cultivate this relationship dis not li eybi ye i've been every singa restaurans they reli settrle times tha i ci can call it it every restaua a couple of weeks ago howard took me on a walking tour of the best places to eat in his neighborhood i've walked into bakeries with howard were the young girls an old man alike who worked there have dropped their doghnut tongs to cry out with joy howard i've watched him get moved to the front of the line outside restaurant in china town when he is relating to a waiter or a delivery man all that howard sees is one person giving another person food he talks to them as though they are friends brothers even his servers are able to sense his purity of vision and they bestow on him in every exchange some little bit of special treatment te e leas show your ghost here on the quarter there is a place called muser they's tbe called a the de fe which is the challage iv thot's ely great place they clot tat they move red across the stree they had gollit that he lents be getting meal i'd go to every day t've gout a lot of fred but i got it got to the plate wher wita cu mi as a shield to serv myself that is a's of cos o go we going they gree me be wevant get up i wud go d po myself coffee n is ach ou dache serve other people coffee at's he wat coffee sid at firs it the olty be le a ba eus to be as you it get if fay thing its tyou what tot yo me b le l elic let me mad toastin thot vestoi mix of my fouats ae yestery in fact howard is such a beloved figure in the neighbourhood that whenever our friend tacker goes in to get take out from saras a local middlleastern restaurant he will tell whoever is serving him that in fact the food was not for him but that he was picking it up for howard this serned im portions that were almost twice as large as what he would normally gad howard he is the best man his se rver would say as he piled food on to his plade you are lucky to have a friend howard indeed he was but the funny thing is is that howard is doted upon when he eats ind restaurants that sometimes it makes it difficult forent to just sit back and enjoy his meal he feels he has to bounds things out and he dots right bat because of that it could be hard to carry on a conversation with him his eyes will nervously scan the restaurant for any way he could be haf help to the waiting stat howard's ears can detect the mauted clink of cutlery falling to the carpet from clear across the room and when he does he will do a kind of concern jim coat trot over to the mishandled piece of silverware and pluck it up off the floor as much as howard loves restaurants when he really wants to relax he will get home delivery and since hi was nearing lunch time rather than step into one of the many restaurants we were passing howard ushered us back in the direction of his house to dia out for our grub had his place he pulled open his top kitchen drawer and i saw the many choices thet lay before us there is about four hundred menus in that yor i was there is four hundred about the count it ti say yisyis handfuls but ten ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seven as much as restaurant owners ind waiters love howard it is delivery man who really really love him i mean who among us even knows our delivery man's name howard knows their names in the names of their wives and children when they come to his door he invites them in and offers them water and in return thel lactually call howard later ont to see if his meal was to his liking that it was warm enoug that there was enough catch up to ninety two hundres vaberasi to ten to twenty to thirty but toiched fifty menusin here there are some bobbles for shire or or even li you lake motwill copies but only restsofm all te time we decide to order from howard's favorite restaurant is lacky place called the greek village i me thinking omber ten that a tre yottl peet up and i think that is it that is homelethi i while we wait for the food hward waves me over and opens his kitchen cupboard to reveal physical proof of his good standing with the service industry e reos to all bags of catch up thoughts o he sawus this is all from take out yet i you to big bags full of nothing but catch up ather's some soy sauce tho gone ot the days where you had to wheedle out a single packet out of a costas a hands tree fryour french rise it is true that i have much now i've somely packets here but i i no better ham how many packet's i best it will never ctch up to what i misstesste child catch up then with vadville timing howard delivery arrives e me howard greets the delivery man an old friend he has not seen at quite some time the is somebos that your friendy's a beautyful men is toht's a nice men ou't telling it gi your touble to i it is gostolodin lancs yell i have a hit is di ot he give me opple he give me a youth he give me everything when i order in most people i figure these guyes one out of my house as badly as a bird that is accidentally flown in down the chimmney and i assist them in their passage usually having the exact change with a tip already for them at the door but at howard's house delivery men stay a long time they seem to want to sr gat offer ou something te'll thank you thank you thank you hes milins not working anywore lo because he di io koke it there thinks at tha thu bat hat i call it to askothys am mery well we no we get agan hedn ha i o but it dont after about ten minutes of this i just want to eat i find myself eyeing the bag of whoe lackey lying on the floor a camp ground beer i realize then that i'm just not made of the same stop as howard and i never will not be berer te when we finally sit down to eat i cannot even get howard to admit that he is doing anything special with guies shim meer we go back and forth on this yet because i mean most people will not go to the extent et you do it is why you have gisa word to telephone coming by year has to meet you that probaby does not happen at wy we believe i do not leave yoeting im i nii mean just impurically you have to see at this point that you are getting respondito differently then most people there must be something different thouh youn somethngol comes my door mor them a you times the only face wer se how are you i mich uchhing the person a te human being in most people i thenk are probably rue to them wek most people that i know give livim in a buck i think that they would do a hardthey have a harted job than a waiter a waitrust because he is a guyy e takes your food gess into a carb ishis life goes in to traffic com get a second risk his life i know he is driving to carry e howards work all kinds of food service jobs himself as a waiter a buss boy a short order cook and he says that as a result he absolutely loathes the feeling of being serve theres something that just feels embarrassing and unnatural about it but it even goes further than that in his interactions with the service in the stry he is looking for a particular feeling a kind of cosy moment where he can palpably senss that the waiter has forgotten that he is a waiter and that they are both simply relating as human beings and then once he knows this once he knows there both getting along and everyone is happy he can move on he is not looking for anything else from them his motives are pure that way but these kinds of special moments do not come without strings attached and sometimes howard gets into trouble earlier in the day during our walking to her there was one place we did not stop in to a little convenient store around the corner howard became on characteristically somber and quiet as we walked by the store front window the owners a greek woman in her sixty's named vula and her older sister used to be pretty friendly with him sometimes vula would not charge in the taxs on his tronclabar and on occasion she would have him sit behind the counter with her on a plastic milk crate it was not much but it was still more than what the other customers got and hit made howard feel special but then at a certain point thinks started to get more intense there would been several hold ups there by nife point gun point and i see th fible bat for them iht se them to be shook up a th cat tough ladies but the nother alone and is told myself he know if if you have an anything is any trouble or somethinghi strun to corny con me a call and i really meants it him in inces of emergency or heav just that there somebo thy can call wi some co community some hi've effort a communityta but she started she recall every day she would call him for all kinds of reasons to have him come by and fix things or to run errands for her and he would try his best to be accommodating she would even call him just a chat even though all of this was more than howard could shoulder he was reluctant to put an end to it it was only after the calls got later into the night at one in two in the morning that howard's friends started insisting he tell her that enough was enough and against his better judgment he did howard wonders if it was right to give her his number in the first place i meed that offer assuming that that it would be understood that there is a cut off point but to another person that offers it is a real genuine offer if i need help i mn t o call you and she did and and maybe she is h one it is rate it is ironic that eu know just ulike being nice to some one i she had the advers effects the opposite effect an and it in is being likea disaster and nont you people are not even friendly with each other there have been other disasters for howard disasters were he was the one who went a little too far there is the time he became consumed with helping this neighbourhood chinese restaurant that without being asked he took it upon himself to draw pamphlets for the place the owner accepted howard's fliers but never circulated them later the owner picked a screaming fight with howard over an order and howard never went back and then there was the time he brought in beautiful framed photoes of lebinon to his favourite lebonyese restaurant they could be reminded of home but the photoes were never hung up nor were they ever refer to again but for howard those things do not matter and i know that he probably even do them all again there are many other moments that make his good intentions feel repaid in full some of his favorites are when delivery men he knows pass him by in their cars as he is walking down the street it shocks him out of his revery when they hunk their horns in a quick affection at burst for brief moment it feels a reassuring slap on the back howard thinks to himself that they are the best and it fills him with much gratitude that if he had a pair or peach in his coat pocket he would wave them over and give it to them down then godstayin is the hoset of the pod guest heavy weight we just finished its fifth season i hardily recommended great

i know the past few days have been really hard to watch i know the show has been really difficult to watch and to listen to ontine a moment to explain why i'm showing you all this vidio and plangale the audio and showin youall the pictures of the atrocities that the terros ru comas has taken and released wh i'm showing you the abduction of raped women the connapping of families and the murder and burning of children s there is a reason i'm doing this because there is an intellectual self centredness the predominates among a lot of us in the west we think everybody things us we see somebody do something truly evil we thing tours of weat that is terrible but the only reason i would do something that is of something truly awful happen to me after all people are generally reasonable generally peaceable generally decent everyone i know is what awful circumstance could force someone into such terrible evil behavior we think while if only someone had just made a few concessions dismantled a few settlements offered a little more land after a we all want the same thing right well no no we do not that is the point we can all tell ourselves these comforting little lives before you see the pictures of what true evil does but you cannot tell those liest yourself after you see the pictures after you see the vidios after you listen to the audyo because here is the thing nothing anyone has ever done tru you or quhatever do to you would cause you to do these things no territorial dispute would cause you to butcher babies no squabble over territory would cause you to rape and abduct women no socalled occupation would cause you to kidnap entire families or burn them alive in their homes the only type of person who would do something that is a person who is not you a person who thinks differently then you do a person who does not value life or children or decency the same way that you do a person who might proclaim for example that they love death you love life is comas leader mahammed deef to day you is reallyes our fighting those who love death for alla you love life and who compead among themselves fror martyrdom you flee from death a person who might say we love martyrdem omas leader is malhonia we love death our enemies love life we love martyrdom the wan which camas leaders died the kind of person who might call for killing their own children to wipe out the jews a commasi spoke person from the also larca tribing gos of the palcinian peopla shall never elinguish the right of return hthe palsinion people shall liberate its land with blood with martyrs with women with children s iw shage hurnis liberators on our heads are high and carring the banner of there is no god but alla and mohammed is his messenger see contrary to the peculiar narsysm of many westerners they are lots of people around the world who do not think we do who do not actually care about their children the way we do which is why they hide rocket launchers behind their own kids who will willingly murder jewish babies just because they are jewish babies whe have been indoctrinated calt since youth in a system of cancerous hatred strong they arewiling to commit the worst atrocities since the notsies and then post them on line and celebrate them commas is not you those who celebrate comas are not you and here is the thing they exploit that fact they murder your children and they hide behind their own they are lie on your cultural marcisism to make you believe the death of the kids they are hiding behind to somehow your fault you see if they care about their kids way you do hiy must be your fault when theyr children die in eir strikes they provoke well hiding behind their own children they expect you to care more about their kids than they do themselves but what is more importanc they expect you to believe that they care about their own children when they manifestly care more about other things about destroying the tate of israel about murdering every do in their bed they cannot be reason with and they cannot be negotiated with not listen all this is awkward for those who believe in a supposed universal human liberalism in which we all seek the same thing we all seek freedom we all seek a decent way of life here is the thing not all human beings think the same way we do not i know this is hard to believe about any human beings but it happens to be true even if it is a seriously hideous truth perhaps temost hideous truth commas does not think you we do not all seek the same thing we do not share the same values nay kno i know we do not not just because camas says it and proclaims it because of what they do and then what tey broadcast and celebrate doing the not sees that weas try to hide their genis i'd com moss cheers it they hand up candies two children to celebrate the murder of babies and the rape of women i've seen the pictures and i've seen the vigurs nd i've watched the tapes that tapes they release that tapes they celebrates you have seen them too on the show the mith that every one is westerner underneath has to end or the west is going to end because nar sosystem is the preserve of the safe and the fat and they happy but reality comes with shocking and brual violence unless we wake up and the only thing that wakes us up the only thing is looking the ugly reality of evil directly in its evil face and thas wh i'm showing you this ugly reality that hideous reality i do not want to do it but we have to do it because we have to wake up because we do not the west we will sleep walk our way right in to our own extermination i'm a sow you more stuff to day that is going to shake up your sleep i'm sure you more stuff to day that is can remind you of the people that the west faces down the people that is railies are facing down right now in the gosips trip i'm show you more of what they do what they say what they celebrate i'm to show you more of that because this peculiar suto sophisticated idea about forein policy well it is all just about negotiations that you can negotiate your way into magic with people who wish to murder you and your children that is not just foolishness it is it is dangerous foolishess truly dangerous foolishness i've been combing through all of the vidio and audio it is flowing out in extraordinary rate from komas vidiofs posted on various websides from people on the ground first responders ho are taking pictures of what is happening these are pictures of the entrance to kuiboots berery that is one of the sights where over a hundred jews were found murdered o tese are civilians who are tempting to drive out of quiboots berry hams stop them and then burned them alive i'm and i these are holicos levelumages r just that that is what it is these are pictures of klar aza kar aza is the sit o and thi'm sure many people of hurd by now apparently forty babies were murdered there and some where beheaded according to media sources klar aza is also where the hadad family was burned alive youn see in these pictures that the house is burned down they set the house on fire and then you had two choices to stay in the house and be burnd alive or droun out an be shot onsite by hamas terris a they foun grenades foun burning wreckage ansaw you can see in those pictures a of the charred skeleton you can see another charred skeleton outside fof truck an see the the burned bodies o vum of jews murdered by murdered by the hamas terrists you can see people burned alive in this is this is a picture of a child's blood soaked bed in another quiboots karum shalom that is a child's bad that is the sizes of the bed of my of my three year old and that is a blood soaked bad tham seeng morons ontwitters saying a stage staged conspiracy theories where 'd the kids go then where are they where are the women where are the elderly did they just magically disappear what happened to them whyse their blood on this bed is that grapejus the unbelievable willingness of people to believe nearly anything continues to inspire awe the ab again bit theres vidio that is now emurged of people in one of these villages who are a coming through the village after after dark theyre they are theyre come after dark after all this is ended and finding the burned bodies of their friends this is a unwatchable again all of our shows last few days are shows that are not appropriate for any one who is not n adult they are not appropriate for adults either but there is something indults need to watch his is a is rally stumbling on the fren we'v blurred out the genitals of this particular young woman i she is obviously been murdered she is been burned in this this is the kind of stuff the she she was just in a village that is all she was shooses living and that is and that is that is that is what we are saying here can hear her friends crying out in hebrew im can see baby seats baby seats covered in blood baby seats covered an blood they came to murder every one children thes there these are your child's carces in my child's carseats my children's carceets you see there they are covered in no in blood is that all mythical wet would wod cause you to do something that tot to murder a baby is there anything thik ccasian murder a baby if your answer is no that is because you think look a westerner it is because you think a decent person but there are people who do not think that there are people who believe the thay have done the world he service by murdering jewish babies there there is no shame for these folks it is not as though they are em it is not as though their hiding the fact agan they took a lot of these vidios themselves people were burned alive their trucks with bodies in them of people burned alive and see the charrd remain yearsome it is been blurred out tyos have hadod by the way who is the source of some of this material i is not israelly aram who who is been covering some of this from israel according to build which is the german newspaper one of the terrats had a two year old child with him beat him and throwm on the porch the child cried i want my daddy the boy tried to run away i was afraid that thy would shoot him and prevent him from running wayst bolksto the child come stay with us i said this according to one witness other cupit is residents were brought to the sight by the terrace including in eight year old child and wounded mother shed gun shot whon in her stomac whos having trouble breathing her hound was swollen she said she was shot she told me her husband had been shot an her baby was dead and i asked her are you sure the baby is dead she said yes they shot him in the head this is em is what they do the seean an has confirmed the atrocities in far oza again lot of pathetic rumor mongering around yesterday because israel ushered in the forn press into some of thse areas that coun see the sight before the before itwas cleared people can see the atrocities that had taken place and multiple members the press con firm forty babies dead in this in this village then that is not particular shock because israels an incredibly young country with a lot of children israel values its children no country on earth truly the secular people in israel have three kins piece i it is it is the only countryin lest i've discussed many times i that actually has not above replacement rate demography people love kids in in israel ithey butcherlem if theyare if they are members commoss and em and it was can from my multiile new sources forty babies ded some beheaded i her a sean an wht

these are people who thing just you and and negotiation should take place and probably seasfire should e declared obviously am te avidios that ave amergedn of families being held captive we now know that in this particular vido the daughters are missing pictures of them have been found in gaza this is the family being held captive this is vitio those put out by hamas whwo a ama is ind we are in at nahalos is a facebook live stream the comas group as heree can see the terrace in he background this is a a father and mother and they have to very young daughters here we are here at the girls have son as well terrified helpless and intred that is their saying by the end of the city of their forcing the son who a appears to be a mid midtean ager to go to other house is in the area and try and a and tryin force people out of their homes try to drop you all their homes to rommascan kill them ther dong in a gunpoint obviously agannis is camas produce the dios not is rally truvitio is comas producevidio the girls are still missing at this qir er gain at gunpoint he're forcing this boy to draw other people out the streaming stopped it at ten ofclock in the morning y those those kids their pictures of them that have now emerged from gaza apparently what is happening to the people in gasa wale we know that their missing children not six com six month old babies not month old babies this a compandium of pictures of the small children who have been stolen and taken to the gassipstrep by comas monsters and now what is happening to them while we now have vidio that has emerged of one of the comas terris who is captured alive being interrogated by israli authorities i and admitting what it is the day re are doing to these women and children who theyare who theyre who they are taking back to the gossa strip here is avidy of that interrogation un de read you the translation i no what d they want to do with them the ters is to have their way with them as what as that mean have your way with them is they do not want to talk they say talk he siys what they want to do with them dirty them to rape them and thenhe said about what about the kids he said to rape them that is what ta that is what come os does they said to dirty them of course to sully them that is thit is the idea now theyr lot people out there who are then calling for for some sort of sympathy for what is going on in gossa now we can all be sympathetic to the civilians who are stuck in gossa obviously we should also remember that the only people who seem to give any shok at all about palisinian life in gossa in this conflict are these raily troops those ar the only people who seem to be perturbed at all about the civilian casualties in fact palsinian civilians have told and be s that israel is telling them to evacuate in terms of howisrael goes about reduceing civilian casualty is they say that they use very precise intelligence before they strike any specific location i've been inside gaza when is ral has been babang and you mee palistinians who say that their phonrang and on the other end of the lin was an as raily military officer telling them an arabec we are going to strike your apartment building because there is hamasen for struck surea but were want you to go door by door firsts and make sure that there is nobody inside the bildang before we strike and by the way there is been substantiate on every score israel it was putting out publicly mediate yesterday in arabic telling civilians we are to evacuate from and where to evacuate two here is some of that ar translated for e translations been provided by an arabic speaker my the at then one of the mot the be tos bisisin his rael colingers eking arabic the operations of terrist organizations force the ideabig to act aganst them in your place of residens may piece be upon you residents of the shirk area all shoi a neighborhood specifically these go to the shelter or to the center of gods a city and then there is a map showing where yoe need to evacuate from and we eu need to evacuate too we are talking about these instructions for your purpose protection and ascistens in distinguition between terrorist organizations and citizensen the citizens in order to help us in this you must follow our preparations i othing tha hat is s re literally providing mas twos civilians on the other side of the border tmy at the an ideaf commander yesterday when i te the explaining how they are working to miimize civilian casualties here he was a here he was yesterday what we ave been doin from the er o the laorsato the entireday o striking hams targens wich great power and severity we have been striking all the different trgets the miditar taes belonging to hamas thow you may have seen for this on te ver semedia and yo may see a building sandin an then flasses and then the building classes that you sat your set well that looks very much ase toviliandindy what i want to tell you is that now that is not they sevilinabuility it is ay degtimate military target and wyse that because hamas uses all pu locates all of their offices headquarters the reseth an development and all their other military ascets if it is about ground they lokat themselves in sevilian buildings and hamas be the cowards that they are they never cut sins of their building say welcome to the hamas head quarters for et plany tares thetivitheinisro welcome to the resech in development enter for droans and projectiles you will never see that because hamas once to disguise itself as tevilians and they use sevilian buildins formilitary purposes wich makes it a degitinate military torget and those are the togets that we are striking with tremendous force over the last this and that those are the images that you see coming out of gos israels attempting to pnomise thes vilan casualties on the hamas side on coma side of the wine what is comasdoing they'r literally telling their own people not to evacuathe're telling the citizens that they are not rember they are the legitimate government of gosa they are legun mac goverment they were elected into thasan sex they enjoy broad popular support inside the gasastrip a poll from june fifteenth twenty twenty one found that three quarters three quarters of palistinians of viewed the aslomic miltons is victors in the last battle against israel a scientific bl by the palisinians sentere fresur policy an survey research found fifty three percent of all palisinians believed commas was the most deserving of representing and leading the palistinian people fifty three per cent thas in two thousand and twenty one ay tisrael is trying to save the civilians and meanwhile palisinian is lonty hot and hamas have put out audio telling people not to leave t message an air becan heres what it sas quote we will renew the call to the citizens not to deal with the recorded voice messages that the occupation ranaly sens that through the citizens vones asking them to leave their home which aims to paus panic to caus panic and fear as part of the psychological warfare accompanying the occupations aggression against our people he othward stay and be murdered for the cameras stay and be killed for the camers that is what we want you to do murdered by us because we are telling you to stay there is a reason there is a reason they put there their head quarters underneath a hospital there is a reason that they load kate there armaments in a yuniversity there is a reason they yuse schools in order to shield terror activity this is what they do these again they are playing on your sense of cultural marcism you would not do that why would we accuse them of doing that because they do they know what you are thinking they know how you think but you do not know how they thing that is why we show the atrocities again a thing to hiding the ball yus to be wilfully blind at this pointed bor antismetic or just ju hating y youdo not care about the truth in order to not see what is going on here here is a flash actisi a couple of years ago this is tape of the idea telling a hamos person to get people out of a building this an idea phone call to goza to evacuate building with civilians before bombing this sis a couple of years ago and here is hw the conversation went e i cannot get all if peo plod i need at least two hours cep mount y and the is rally says it listen er on the building you want to bon bom what ever you once is no brother we needs to everything we can son weu do not die onn s we want to die and the jew says but you have responsibility for children's lives n ommossoper says if the children need to dive them they will die and the juw says god forbid god forbid what you want a tisis this is how we reveal your cruelty bet reveal your cruelty is we refuse to move our children from bobbing sights after a hiding munitions in the sights to those that are those people who a who think you s again much of wess is builds around this presupposition that you can negotiate magically can diplomacy or way out of a clash of civilizations which is what this really is is typipoint of spear for a serious clash of civilizations and dom and toy can see it just witten in how the media covere the sort of stuff because if there is one group of people on planet earth for culturally narcicistic it is members of the legacy media in the west they truly believe i reaty things them they think don everything from pronouns to taxes and they certainly think that when it comes to international conflict get to more on that just one secon i have been reading adds during the show but there is one organization that advertises with the show that totally deserves your support that of course is the international fellowship of christians and jews their on the ground right now the providing critical essentials food medicine and other emergency supplies for vulnerable jews who need immediate help obviously the need is massive i'm getting calls every day from people asking how they can help this i one way you can help to donate please go to i f c ch dot or give as generously as you can writeit down this i f c j dot org and all the durnations are going right now to critical essentials food and medicine and other emergency supplies in preparation for more conflict to do not a go to i f c j dot org an the suter sophisticates in the west refuse to see the truth or they simply do not want to to see the truth sot some honesty some of this is just astonishing the o m the level of support that is that that is enjoyed by comass is very real this is a mass of rally last night in eurborn michigan for comss forkmassko the size of this rally for comass an on re re we tell you the atrocities enshoing it alwy leav the size o the trat lic all these people waving palistinian flags and cmass flags is in deurborn michigan again this right here in the united states we have out rewarters already lamenting the death told in gaza we all ought to lament the death oon gaza and every ounce of blood that is spilled in gaza every ounce of blood spilled in gaza is the result of homass every single ounte every ounte but there is going to be an attempt tic gn arty see at sarring the mediat its moral equivalent you see when people break into your home and murrer your children in front of view and then you go and you attempt to kill the people who did that and they hide behind their children that is that that is moral equivalent you attempting toprotect your children and them killing your children and then hiding behind their own to protect themselves moral equivalence that is th direction this is going you can hear howon some is ralies are rather unsympathetic to this point of view in is raly man whose kins were taken by homass was that was pressed on this by by andria michell and i got to say this is this is just astonishing sort of stuff from emisan be sek what are you feelings about the the the attacks against gaza rigt now a how ca not te say en le or hu loo intes in for sthe metricgal situation and on mos say it is not am if you redailing when a a war who is between two contries contris don take children hostiges i'm thorit is thin gans the lors of war it is against the tumanity is against anything that we all believin every time we hav mesous a sho at ous i is to sayto my children an theshent be sympathetic to wards the children is goze because they tefer o orthan pa you am not sure i believing now and i mot say the ony worry i have now fo e the bominings in goze is the fact o me children a ten anis to to be in o gany more i cal me sinpathetic to and a more human bein wele they are not really human bes wo caninto my house tro everything stall everything to my childrei from tedatins and to ton to the gastric is yo never donbats and will never do there is nosingu i'm sorry but but they want the cymmetry the media want people on left particularly are looking for the cymmetry because again all cultures are created equal this is this is the premis of much lef wing thought ah a a full skile moral idiot hasson piker i he is an emissary of this yesterday whe as ranting and raving on his twitch stream about this and suggesting of course why would you that the only reason the only reason that you might murderer yoish baby is because obviously years o victimization that that is clearly the problem israel it israel skirt wass tou short you see that is why you walk into a village and you rape women and and drag them back to the gosastrip that is why you do this here is a moral moral exem plar hasson piker they did not deserve it you idiot mygall is solutions your goll is the continuation of violets you want way more than two ordered an sixty people dive you want every single palistinian to be executed ruthlessly of the streets that you can build another thin park an goza you bang pig you belot o thirsthy violent pig gog suck mi how do you think this happens you tink it happened that i've nowhere you think ese people are just all we are violet becaue we want to be violent yu think ga'swor violence calminates from or do you think it is because you have in trap them you have bulliat them you have subjugated them you have humiliated these people tou milian people live inside of goza i've they are not even people and the ies of israc that is that is presumalae going hason piker why you would murder baby tht's why you that is why you would murder baby and burn entire families in their homes in peaceful villages that is why you that is why you would do that i'm now i'm going to attribute this to again the peculiar narcisism of people hason piker believe that everybody thinks they do and i i i would ask people hason pike ar o kay if that is the case if you really believe the victimization is what causes people to murder babies in their beds for the crime of being jewish and breathing then what would cause you to do something that isthere any level of victimisation you could undergo that ould cause you to o something that becase i i do not i do not think ashly i think highly enough even of of people li think are are intellectual cretons got hasson piker that i do not actually think that that he thinks that there is nothing tht can make him do something thati'll give him at least that much credit but the peculiar narsisos tem hat drives you to believe that everybody thinks you do and then two immediately jump to israel is i attempting to wipe out thet israel has not had a presents in the gosstripts in two thousand and five since two thousand and five the last thing israel wants to do is send its own sons and daughters into the streets of goza that is the last thing they want to do i know many of the people who are going to be going into goza i know some the people one dow who weo will die and goza trying to protect their brothers and sisters in israel you thi'k they want to be there they tryd to hand the entire gossipstript to egypt you non't egypt seid helno we on't want any piece of it this believed it that israel is land hungry for goza is the most bizar piece of propagantistic trash and ignorance i've ever heard it is its bizar and s range that is what this is really all about according toand again i can i can stribue to one or two things either either they are only two possile reasons ignorants are hatejus thos the only to possible reasm soall a tribute to ignorance speaking of ignorance and hating jews crossing streams black live's matter which up i member a lot o people were were strangely perturbed when black lve's matter in its earliest itterations had much of statements on it is website in support of the palistinians and against israel nik what 's that af to d with black live's maer the answer is the intersectional anti western coalition that suggests that freedoms and liberties our essentially a tool of of white supremisist patriarchy they cross streams they cross streams in taking on institutions and values of the west black le's matopatographic esterdates thaid i stand with palestine and it is a picture of a person in a hanglider bith a palisinian flag on top now our palsinian tans for teir hangglaiting is that a cultural thing a just big on hanggliting ore is the reason tere usin the hangglider in this in this graphic because palestinian terroris comasterroris took hanggliders twean edium festival and murdered to hundred sixty people gun them down murdered them in col blood and bealemon supports that that is what that graphic is they literally put on the graphic a terrorist an a hangglider andthey said i stand with palestines first of all for all the people who ar claming that the palistinians do not support this sort of stuff i feel you think they do i mean that is it if why woutd standing with paliestine in tail standing with commoss i'm just confused i only it has to but i've noticed an enormous number of cross streams here from you gis then they put out a statement perfectly agreed just as usual for black live's matter and for all you fools who gave the money under the auspecies of you are trying to help you are just trying tohelp because you'r ignorant and stupid you gave them money and you marched with them believing that they were on your side on the side of broader human rights and liberalism and it turns out their just intersectional trash the black live's matter organization they put out a statement black live's mater grasserd stands in salidari with our palestonian family whare currently resisting fifty seven years of settler colonialism and a partide whell i just would to point out this point the fifty seven years of t settler colonlialism anda a partide supposedly which includes twenty per cent again of israel is arab out just point out this porlicanat number fifty seven the state of israel is not fifty seven years old the umber fifty seven is related to the ineteen sixty seven war where these villages were not inside juday an sumaria the called occupied territories they were outside there but's allisan don does matter as black people continue to fight to und militorisem an massin carceration our own communities let us understand te resistince in paliestine as an attempt to tear open the gates of the world's largest open oir prison as ratical black organization grounds an abolitionist ideals we see clear parallels between black and palisinian people man america betr hope that is not true a that that is om astonishing stuff there we two understand what it means to be surveil des umanized propery sees family separate our people criminalized and slaughter with im punity locked up and droves when we resist they call us terroris we two dream of a world where our people may live freely on d colonized lane zwitze colonization means by waymans murdering babies in the in there in their homes means riping women an means burning entire families alive and then filming in puttingin onlon that is what de colonization means they say it not me they say it they say it either again this is ignorance hor are you asking to be lumped in with the people who ouare lumping yourself in with because if that says some things that is at some pretty awful and terrible things o ti this this s on the left a lot of this boils down to thi sort of bizar de colonization narrative where by murdering jews is fine because jews are white people and because jews are white people by the way most jus anisrael are not thachall groun ther'e saviry but put that aside because the jews are supposedly white people this means that it is en act of co d colonial resistance to murder jews wherever they are in the state of israel that seems to be the the line from from many people on the left these days the elected tudent president of the enwhi you los chal bar association sent out a message for example refusing to condemn commasses masslaughter and sure leading it quote israel teres full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life this reshume of state sanction violents creates the conditions that made resistance necessary i'l you see tal territorials beut got it is all territorials eefvonly israel had just conceided the gosstrippind gotten out in two thousand five which they did if only they done that clearly piece woul hav been on the horizon it is all the israily's fault that dom that jews were murdered by most vicious antisamites of our europ i will say that a there is a great irony to this this person who is the anwhy you los school bar sosation president lost her her job at ta shofs going to come out and and work at a big waffer sor for big corporation the corporal affer and a they peremptively fired her a yem i'm not a fan of cancil culture generally but i've said before that there isnan overton window it seems to me that when you openly support ed terrori scri bmurdering babies and ripping women at that point i feel a i feel at that point is though you throbably do not have to be hired by waffer call it call colme crazy call it duk calld what ever you ant once you start supporting the murder of of babies i feel at that point fair game fore gou t loose your job that seems that one is pretty obvious meanwhile campasses are plotting a day of resistance insport o comasses to be the students for justice and palestine theyare not for justice manyof them are not students and a palestine as as a state does not exist specifically because bhe palestonian leadership the p a is lomicyhot and commass have rejected every single piec steal ever offer to them in the history in the history of this entire conflict they are putting out a m presents on college camps across the country by eway ii'm noticing that all the micro gression folks all the folks ore saying really's offensive and micral gression for you would use the wrong pronoun that is a microgression for ver for yeu to to say things i'm color bline all the some people are peculiarly silent when it comes to mass rallies across te united states on co lege campasses insupport of a terrist group suddenly they look all the microgression heather silant just quiet very weird very weird our people chose resistance over negotiated cages on our home land the group states in a day of resistance toolket fearlessly our people struggle for complete liberation and return quote national liberation is near glory to our resistance to ar martes an toarsteadfast people is according to students for justice in palestine we have an unchakable responsibility join the cll fror masmoblizationmedlith is nothing new i mean when i was a you see ala thereis there is a student newspaper thoses put up by the muslinstunisociation s called all taleeb an just before the issue before nine eleven they literally joked about changing the name of the magazine to all taliban and they tempted to put out publications that acted as fundrasers for terro groups this is nothing new meanwhile left wingers who are undoubtedly be thrown from buildings where the actualy livig in the gosistrupim but one one my favorite te elements of the left is the intersectional coalition that calls calls themselvesons queers for palistine wich u quick quick note of irony if you are a queer person in palestine you are dead that is how that works they throw you off a fong building but i but no but i'm i'm glad that i'm glad tha you gots have your intersectional coalition of of tu terra support a labor union champion by burniystanders and represent f alexander cosic or tas and other liberals express solidarity with commosterrists according to the washington fre beacon starbock workers unified and if filiot of the service hat ploisons for national union expressd solidarity with palistine into leaded social medioposts union chapters an iwi chicago an boston promoted rallies in support of palestinian attacks including a long live palistonian resistance rally to be held in boston on monday that sarbock union represents nine palison breest does and join t other american liberal groups in siding with palistonians over there is raily targets the d ssay the democratic socialist of america which counts sixthalstimocrats o members held rallies in several american cities calling for support for the palistinians the original organizer of the union chas a brisack has praised at palstonian terrase rasma oda is a freedom fighter and has chanceat from the river to the sea palestine shall be free and the middle of this tweeted quote there is no two sides to a partide free palestine meanwhile one individual union member cio of the starbok's workers united freeing palistine was never going to be flowers and baby animals what the falt did you expect that is a that is what the vislat t the leftings is wat the left tings and then thera the seudosophisticates on the rights let me first say right up fronts america does not have coincident interest with israel always theyre two separate countries theire soverign countries tisral sometimes wants to do things that are not an america's interest andamerica frequently wants to do things that are not in israel's interests for example cut deals with erannian terrasts terragines that is sor estough happens all the time because soverign countries are sovereign also werth noting you can be a realist on form palisy without being immoral there is a sigment of the republican party that has basically desi ted that if the if the bad idea in form policy for years was there is a moral conflict lets jump in then the reverse of that ad what we need is there is a moral conflict let us but out take no sides down play now there is a happy medium the happy medium is sometimes it actually is an america's interest to back people whare fighting oukno monstrous terras to behad babies sometimes that is an america's interest actually not always therre times where you can make the case that america shuld not sacrifice blood and treasure even for a moral good o you make that case but being realist does not mean being a foolhardy isolationist who is somehow morally puzzled by all of this and this is some of the stuff that i'm seeing on the right let me make clear israel has not called on the united states to attackaron no one wants a full skall warth ron including israel is you not many jews would die in fullskale worth run alot no one wants that aron has used comoss is a proxy here and even then israel's not striking oron you mayhve notice noris israel calling on the united states to strike aron and yet there is been this attempt by some on the sudosophis to get right to say while no blood and treasure what who is called for bood an treasure exactly who i'm si'm i'm wondering dissuading cusballah from attacking the north of israel is an attempt to prevent regional and then global warfare that is what it is if cusballagets and lem explain this to you in small short sentences you understand cusbalize a terogroup cusblize back by aron cusbalah has one hundred and fifty thousand rockets pointed at the north of israel if csballa tacs israel with those rockets israel will be stretched tto the breaking point if israel stretct to the breaking point it is not woing to worry about the niceties of war it is going to evicerate the entire southern border of lebanon if israel eviserates the entirate southern border of lebanon and also has to then hit all the supply chain roads into the southernborder of lebanon syrio will get involved if syria gets involved israell have to hipt basis in syria if base in syria get hit aron will get involved and ronwill drag in its clot its prits its client state or its orts its sponsor state russia remember aronasa is it is a state that is joined with russia russia basically run syria at this point and russias already signalling support for all of this if you wish to prevent this cascating israel war int which the united states nevertall be drawn ou no be good some threats no be good arming israel to the teeth they can act ion prevent this from escalating into a broader regional war if if the idea in the warnou crane is that most of the gles been achieve you crane has been protected keeve is not going to fall but the engal's not clear the engal is pretty on clear right now for israel topose come os control the violence in the goses trip that is the engall that is the only engall providing support necessary to do that seems pretty containd and pretty duable and yet you are seeing this can af need turc antim morality on the part of some on the right es ef to stroke your chin and pretend that it' sophisticated prerspective to take up a sort of morally ambiguous view ab all this i'm sing thes from some people who i people whose work i've enjoyed in the past and thiy got to say it is either ignorance about foreim policy or cowardice or something darker and worse to take an example of just morally moral embiyou wity for no reason an all jason whitlock for some odd reason who again i jason i know jason i lot of his work jason has decided that it is importanto sound off to me generally and say well what you have to understand why people are why people are are not exercised about about babies being killed in their bage in the room i mean after all ther're been a lot of ther'rebe a lot conspiracy theories out there ye i know what is the conspiracy theory to which you are referring right now the people should give credens what is it shere is he loexpell it out for me i yoursblle out what isthe conspiracy theory there leads people to somehow draw a ammorally ambiguous line here explain it to me in short words weve been fate much bad information about historic events that we have a what what the thime of to day is were conspiracy weory were conspiracy leory weyeyou got the thing i thought about watching ben superal get up set with antrutate and others as i've wats beens twitterfet and he seem he is very outrased and justifiably but he seems very of set that everybody does it have the same level of outrate the same level of emotion about this event that he does i've seen a lot of this were people are policing other people's thoughts any motions about what is going on in israel between israel and homas israel and i ran israel and palistinians people are po this is how you should feel and were getting all these images of the atrocities tha happen in israel and everybody's comment and how canyo not the outrase and this is the face of evil and and there is a lot of stomping of feet of this is it this is the indall be all and and everybody must feel the exact same way that i do about this situanyou notis tempting to say hre ou cause there ouen'nough to feel the exactin way that i do but i would recommend that you at least acknowledge that this is in fact the face of evil that seems a pretty base line decent thing to do is he lat preat pretty base line he reference is there a bit of a twitter spat that i got into with with andrew tate andrew tate ofm he treated out in the middle of all this there is no there is but one certainty in this mess there is no god but allach and mohomed is the messenger o the li is that really the the one sure certainty on that that is that is an interesting certainty maig that comes out literally he treated that in the middle of all this while the while the invasion was going on and a and then he says the freethinkers on the american right are scrimming for jgenicide without giving questions as to hol masade could fail on such monumental level of fraction of thought ushered into another siof they will cooked for covy just the same ussy it must have bee tha israel brought on it self an actually wanted this tohappen that is that is really that is ruay what this says cay he responded to at tweat that ison in the middle of all f this the you and special reportor for human rights in palestin said we are horrified by what is happening and we call for truce af they called for a truce by the way the day after the massacre which is absurd it is absurd and s oi tweeted they can fal right off because that is exactly right it turns out that when people murder your kids you have no obligation to call fors invactuofe moral obligation not to callitruse this drove and retate who is a who is a a very important person because he fluxes his muscles a lot and does not wear shirts and does a lot of curls the hight of human moral and a intellectual achievement is of course that you used to punch people on the face you do curls now and om and you openly bragged about trafficing women on webcams that is that that is we ought take you incredibly seriously as as tufgey because of that theyre very tough heu wrote mister tufky let me assure you as some one who does his own fighting i suppose to excitedly incurging others to do it for him while sitting at home on a comfy chair piece is always worth a conversation and i wrote back to him let me assure you as someon who is not pimped women in bragged about it the morality requires that those who rape women and cannapchildren must be eradicated not negotiated with gan tes tistutosophisticate bull nonsense i'm sorry this it what else would you call it when you have terrace murder kids in their beds for gods sake and your immediate response is whal pieces always for the conversation i gain either your ignorant or you do not give a chaw thos are the only two there is no third option and do not give includes you do not juws that is what is in that conversation and sad to say but that this can of sudo sophisticate point of view has alsove been mirror by tucker craws an tucker sets up strawmen and then burns them to the ground sa plateclip of nickey haley nickey was talking presidential can nicgaley she wis talking bout israel has every duty to evicerate commoss she is not called for an invasion ovron she is called for removing six billion dollars in funding that america has cleared for ron she is called for more sanctions on eron she is not cald fra ground invasion or american troops to be used againsteron but watch as tucker spins this into while the only reasonable point of view is to basically go hands off on this whole thing even morally yetsurt's bad but is it is it as bad as things happening in the united states here here is a tucker find me morally ambiguous line here somehow tit is not just an attack on israel thit is is an attack on americ becaus they hate us just as much and what we have to understand it thits ti therethin that we have to unite around making sor our enemy do not hur our frend america can never bea to erigat ta think we do not ne frends just we needed m on on eleven that is why you cry na ta on rush tis doin ta that is why its ron't na tawhyn hamothan oronor doin ta and i'll fit as tha t ave pronas turn at now o finish that finish that hamathen tes you knoaron behind at finish that they should have hel ta pay for what theye just that this wasn an attack on america she says when in fact it was not and for that reason we must quote finish aron a nation of nearly ninety million people what are we nowhowsho wot this is not to caraphrase a wrong paraphraeis a child and this is the tantrum of a child ignorant cockshire blood thirsty yet no one in washington splundersler nicgahaly in fact they aped her hysteria they a teristit is hysteria now all she said is that nit is in ya who should finish of commass and he calls that bloodthirsty prop agandistic nonsense here from tocker he is better than this and and it is pathetic that he that he engage in this or nonsense truly truly he is a smart person and either he thinks youare stupid or he is engaging in stupidity i do notknow which it is it tucker by the way then continued along these lines he did not interview wit the vak romisuamy and he likened what just happened in israel the the kidnapping of women and the're ray by me hes showing vidio of this happening as he is talking about this he compared that to drug over dhose defts in the united states now i i believe we should fully care about the hundred dousan drug lover os deaths that happening theunite says heitheare to completely to frnissues to to go this firefield to link the issues you' the only res onuyour doing this because you wished to down play the atrocity tha just happene in israel you are not up playing the atrocity f what is happening on america streets those are too different types of atrocities people who are dicted to fentinel sticking needles in their arms and overdosing is a is a is a moral blight it is a moral atrocity and a moral evil for people to kidnap women rape them and drag them back to the gosoborder the're not the same thing and tucker knows that but his a cheap way of of telling you not to look do not look stop carrying but es after all what is it matter what isthe matter now again i dont know who thinks that tisophisticget poin of vew specially when nobody is calling for america to go to war with rond the entire purpose having an aircraft carryin mediterraneas sutes is to avoid that but here it hear is tucker playing i onyo know the gamesplane is just a dum it is a dumb game but you do not have to look far in the nited states for moral outrages also on vidio wen there is not a city in this country unct the big cities but cities of ten thousand people was an one yesterday thet does not have some constellation of drug adic tod young people living outside we call in the homeless their drugatics and they are eddicted to drugs that were imported across an what does that helt ith alout ps somting in china i do not understand more than a hundred thousand a year now you can call it genicide you call whatever you want but it is the death of over a hundred thousand americans a year and the living death of illing we cannot call it john i sin to notchon iside i do not undersire tin who are dicted to drogs and living on tide his ral and again i want to add my voice to that cas i'm human being blo shered of the sseriary outrage among republican presidential canidates was much more in town whon took to a burn an star yelling about it i get it but no one would think to do that about the hundred thousand american young people murdered every year and the comes who are you yelling at for young aut first whall people are on bullhoran tyelling about drug overdose says and the open border all the time all the time what is even talking about what he hetempting to his minimize what happened in israel he is not thing co matmos what hapen in the united states he is attempted to minimize as o america cannot walk and to gum ut morally speaking at the same time which is absurd am those who things are nothing alike i'm siry that is not alike it is not alike for drug smugglers to smuggle drugs over the board which some one then takes and shoves into their arm and n they dive in overdos that is not the same thing i promise you it is not the same thing as a terrerist breaking into your home and murdering your shosering in their beds in frunt to of view and dragging your wife off to be raped in gaza that is not the same thing pretending that it is is i moral it is a moral blike it is idiocy it is just moral stupidity at the highest level of course we should care about what happens with ventinel of course we should care about all we should close our border have i been on clear about this op course america shave closed borders when it comes to the sort of stuff i'm on the samesidt is tucker on that i s do not understand why he is not on my side when it comes to come osas to be wiped off the face ofthe earth what exactly is the counter argument it in any case that this sort of moral sophistication i's predicated on on only one of a few possible hypotheses the most dark and and terrible is the possibility people just do not give a damn when jews get killed by terras i'm not accusing tucker of that i'm not acusing whitlock of that in fact i'm not even accusing the ao sees the world of that althoghi think she is closer to the border concerning the only tweet she has sent in this entire ridiculous situation is a tweet finding one jew in new york saying a bad thing that the is really government does not even carry forth that is the deon thing she sin to tweet about as i'm the i'm not accusing all the people of that what i am accusing them of is a moral blindness that must be caused by a complete flattening of the cultural landscape a flato in which everybody thinks the same way that they that we do and that every problem can be solved in the same waye anda and that it is it is of no consequence whether evil walks the earth because all probles are base that is what realism truly is that that is not realistic thats stupid thes er not the same thing it yoe one comes to policy questions about what be done in th middle east that is a question of prudence it is question of pragmatism it is question of american interest which again are not always identical with his really interest when it comes to comparing the the the holopost level evil we just saw in kfar aza with people overdosing on the streets of philadelphia i'm i have some i have some moral questions i do ow as i set earlier on the show if you are interested in helping out people who are in a massive need in israel i recommend the check out the nternational fellowship of christians and jews teare on the goun right now providing critical essentials food medicsine and other emergencyes supplies for vulnerable jewse who need a meed it help the need is massiv an urgent this organization eat your helpwright now to do not it please head on over to i av see jadot or give is generously as you can write it down that is i f c j dot org go and give money andm and give whatever help you feel is is morally appropriate a case rare rare turn of events jobidon he is been sending a few mic signals the white house yesterday put out o statement suggesting that that israel these to engage proportionally with commoss and ot surn a proportion is what would we talk about a hundred to one ten to one one what how many sdead deat comoss terrace account for one dead dead jewish baby i'man ju just wondering how that works proportionality is a mush word that means nothing in internationa relations it is stupid in fact if you ont frmen further conflict what you want is dis proportionality hou knowis rather dis proportionate what is rather dis proportion is when allkida took out three thousan americans on not eleven and we took down two countries you knowis cont i dis proportionate pro harbar killed several thous an americans and we wanched eiht et two front world war against japan i germany just proportionate bad no no it turns out the th best way to deal with people wheare murdering you is to a just proportionately white them off the face the earth that is that is actually the the best thing to do with people o comas terrace well that was a stupid note put out by a jobine yesterday but jobidon then gave a press conference and he gave a speech now he is got in some flack on thi speech from some people on the right because he did not mention aron in the speech now i actually understantactically speaking why he is not mentioning aron te reason presumably there there is good reason an batteriesan the batderiason is because this ad ministration continues to idiotically support a deal with the ron which i impossible eron his run by the same kinds of people as commoss they they they continued to sponser and subsidize them to ten billions dogs that is one reason why the'renot mentioning aroun the other reason is because if you mention aron in this contect then presumably you are creating an intensive ferrontascalad i kind to hear that but the speech that biden gave yesterday was in a rare shocking exactly honestly ou shocke by this he speech that actually had some moral clarity to it a lot of moral clarity actually here was jobidon yesterday talking about the atrocities in israel moiis lie es te pure on do eovl islas is m people of is e theo wan is o t speakin blodys the tertersisnmas gro pho stateed purpose tor be kill gus son i to sheer evil he continued along these lines he points out the history of the jewish people in the state of israel tack i brouht to te servis painful memrs scars tet by mlanymani semitism ges ide gu people this moroon we must be crystal clear we stand with israel we stand with israel we will make sure ou has wat needs to take care of its citizens defend it respondious attack he then distinguishes the commase cause from the palstinian cause which again is perfectly fine andlege admet and then he says that ome the that israel basically has free rain to take the gloves ouf do what it needs to do to stop the terrorism i here he was talking about this is clipped for make every nation theworld is e has th rigt t respond indeed has a duty to respon hes visios attacks es cet off the fom te fer con't pimiso an ow i toldim do non state experiences experienc in our response to be swift desiteomen overwhelmin am well that is exactly correct and then he did i think the most important thin in the speecure was actually a policy apolicy thing you points out that america has strengthened its defense poster in the idaliast which is important bes again if youdo not want a regional war you dou have to threaten one you dou ave to say to or ronlisson if you gos get in is not conglo how you think it scan about because people take advantage of situations and here is bide a gan credit t the president for saying this i state is also in hanced our military force fosturin the reation tostrenthen harde turns thepartmenn fance is move you assas tall our for tary striker heson metitrain in bolsted our fighter air cack presens we stand ready to move in additionala sits as needed atmy say gain any country any organization any one thinking of taking vangis situation i one word do not do not thats dome that is right that is not interventionist by the way that is the hat that is the opposite interventionous to be going ito striking aron right now that is not what he is talking about he is saying tguys stay out is it contain conflict let a remain a contained conflict that israel has to win eccestentialy by way israel does have to win this conflict if if does not then the the sense of military superiority that has alowed a tiny state of nine million people seven million jewes to survive in the most hostile region on earth historically that preception military superiority is israel's asset that is been punctured by what just happen with commass is do host restore that and taf's restort in spades right now by destroying commossole sale wel unfortunately the democratic party is is also plagued by i am a bunch of commoss caucus members rociditaly bleeding among them here is vhat you oversionitsly gesterdations asked about ti shemny comment on com osses human atrocities including the beheading of babies and i she literally just keeps onwalking because why would not shap by vay the easiest thing to do in the world here is say come oss committed acts of evil therre cause not the palsinou closs easiest thing in the worl ish will not say that she will not say that i wonder why ter t a er m ali war ral iand note ay es eroo osin ery unwalking ot e just ten seperal times just keeps onwalking whagain the s this thing for to do right there is to say that last question is the easiest one for her she just as i do not back wi comossta bry back the palstinian self determination it she cann' say that which leads to some questions what exactly is it that she backs well the a the white house for the first time actually came out and condemned el hin omar and rechutitsly yesterday correen jhan pierre who musthaveben shocked to the message coming down from the top from top lubble here theye rifed into omar and to leave for their lack of morality here what is the e mate se mar e caers i thin to be me loss cere c whe an the wa rs we a byis raelhere is a thing and wich which which congressional members er er maes caers he ha cal her the fire an the not ot a firs ain be trs caler carers rael to i think some of those statements this week gan and we are ging a continue to be very clear we believe theyare wrong we believe theyre repugnant and we belie they are disgraceful are er condemnation belong squarely with terrors who have brudally murdered raped cinnapped hundreds hundreds of israles there can be no equivocation about that there are not two sides here there are not two sides i'm that done goo good for them for saying that now u maybeyou ought to think about whether those people och men remen members yourcaucas there is a a lot of talk all the time about re publicans expelling certain members f the caucas seems you publishin promote them is the squad and then have them on the cover of magazines with a with nancy plose seems that might be a good start and meanwhile it is one't concluded few stories from from israel here because i'm getting up dates as i say by the minute from friends in in israel or living there seeing with no dozens people a day from a whide variety of perspectives in israel but there is extraordinary unity in the state of israel this just one example one of the people who is murdered at this a electronictans music festival a was a brazilian is r aily woman hen a call went out she was there by herself a call went out fore people to come to her funeral they are trying get ten men because in jewishlaw ten men allows you to pray with u alled minon an se certain special prayers her only family in israel was fror mominer sister they called for ten men to show up and here is what showed up thousands of people thousands of people showed up the same thing happend thre's a lone soldier meaning e a jewish american who ad gone and en join these rally military and a and who was killed in israel lines miles long formed to get to to the funeral this is a a pretty extrordinary tyo of bedouin is her moslem i give soldiers who are members of the israily army fighting for israel singing in arabic as they approach the front lines they by the way have to our masks and on of the reasons they have to our mass some the other is rally soldiers i is because i if they are identified by by commas and their allies i then they will be treated even worse than isrally jews would be if they were captured or or a or trappd by by comassmembers because they are seen as traitors for defending the state of israel i got a note that i wont to conclude with here from mam a friend mine in jerusalem her husband is a rabbi in jerusalem she wrote me this did i tell you about the wedding my husband formed on sunday remember the attacks were still on going as of saturday night sunday evening we travelled up north on relatively empty roads passing many road blocks police cars and army trucks along the way my husband could perform a wedding for a couple who is supposed to get married a few days later the catan that is the groom called up and he told them who 's supposed to have a wedding in two days the commander gave him another day a could not give im more they wants get married before he left for war they called my husband he immediately agreed friends o the family heard the wedding had to be moved ups they kindly opend their home to alow the couple to get married on the roof who is a small intimate ceremony just family in close friends superbitter suite very moving there are men who are being called up right now from their families remember the front lines in israel are essentially where people live i mean tha there is that there is no distance it is not the united states where people get called up thin to get shipped off to some foreign country in israel when you get called u you are serving a couple miles from where you live you are leaving your family at home knowing full well that they are morevolnorl becauseyou are not home and yor they are going to servan and people are are people are coming together in extraordinary ways in the state of israel because that is what social fabric is all about the west needs to come together in that same way america came together that wafter non eleven for very brief moment in time but america came to a for brief momen in time because we are very very secure in the united states thank god america is the most secure blesst by god in extraordinary ride of ways including our geography we are boarded on the north by canadians the south by mexicans andthey exersize by ocean as that tit is an extraordinarily lucky geography pluss wer an enormous country and we'e very very lucky but that very luck allows us to be morally foolheardy it allows us not to look evil in the face and to pretend that everybody thinks the way we do because the consequence of that sort of thought rarely arrive at our front door that is not the case with many of our allies and many people living around the world and as the forces of evil gains strength and co ordinate it is incumbent on any person who has any shred of moral decency to at least recognize the the evil that they are staring down and to recognize on broad policy level that negotiation with evil is not a strategy its surrender

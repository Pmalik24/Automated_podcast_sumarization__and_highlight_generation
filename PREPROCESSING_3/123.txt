donald trump gets his picture taken by the state of georgia after turning hiself in for a rest pulls are in on the republican tobate and we examine the results and jobidon's do j target's elon musks spacacks i'm benshpar of the cistventhparo show the shofs pucerback spressvi pian it is time to stand up against big tack protect your data express vepians at com slashmen well will be the most traffic photo in the history of planat earth because social media is ubiquitous president donal jy trump yesterday he went to the fulton county jail house where he was arrested is finger printed they took his picture the mugshot is now out it is destin to be th most famous mug shot certainly in the history of humanity i it say i'm i will say that it is a wind for trump to have his mugshot taken i know it was supposed tobe some sort of big wind for the left they finally got him the fight ot that the frog marching in th hat here is the thing about trump and imagestics trump is amem heis a walking living breathing mem everything he does is memable he is made fortevy his made for the internet he is changed our age because of that and donald trump also happens to be a person who is been consistently on camer since the time wheas about twenty years old he is currently almost eighty sixty long years of being in the public eye and of having your picturetook means that you knows how to tak a picture and he mug shot of trump again it is such a big i have tais e giant immagestic wind for him because we know that hewas oin be arested it is not as though no one knew he was arrested it is not as though it was a shock dawning on the american people of donal trump is under inditement for separate juristictions we have known about all this for monts what the mug shot does especially this particular mug shot as it gives trump the appearance of somebody who is bravely standing up to forces that are going after him and again his image here actually conveys all of that because donal trump is phenominal ugcam and whatever else he can say about the got the dudas tv star for it decades and i promise you he knows what he looks on camera there is zero chance that before he did thes mu shot he did not sit with his team in say oca what expression should i use in the mugshot sinc it is can be e most traffic photo of me ever what expression sould i use because thisis a pitch perfect thing am mags trump a theatrical perspective the mug shot of donald trump four trump's purposes is pitch perfect he does not look as though he is afraid or concerned or anxious he does not even look i outstat angry he loks determined ramy that that is the goal here is to look as though he is the the face of doom coming for his enemies and that is what looks him if you flash that back up there that is exactly what donal trump looks in this mug shot and this is the this is what he is going to convey for the rest of the campaign is i'm coming for my enemies and your enemies are my enemies that is it there there is a reason why he is already trotting it out on the mugs is 'a right reason why he is already trotting it out on the tea shirts in that the cash machines at the trump headquarters ore going to are going to just begoing non stop to day and when it comes to the jor rgo indictment as we have discussed fanny willis is actually spinning up something that does not make a whole holvalot legal sens she could have charged donald trump for conspiracy to commit some sort of crime right that is an actual crime in george ef you have a conspiracy to go rob bank the conspiracy to rob the bank is not actual crime the problem is she cannot actually identify the crime that the conspiracy invalve ae conspiracy to challenge election results i's not a conspiracy tocomit ta crime beaue you are allowed to challenge election results she coont charge him wit that she decided instead that shofse gin to go for a rego charge now e reco charge means an on going criminal organization dedicated to a variety of criminal activities the problem is what are the variety of crimnal activities that the organization was dedicated too normally when you have some sort of moffyo organization there dedicated two things prostitution or pro hibition yourug alcohol running or drogs or you any other variety of protection money i that that is what the criminal organization is dedicated too and then you wrap everybody up in mac ball and then prosecute everybody together because yu one make shure t the leaders are held responsible for t thei'r lower downs are doing bun this particular case was there to actual criminal organization surrounding trump dedicated to criming what were what criming what what of the crimes they were dedicated to and she is stuck in the in between shdoes not what trump did ther re people on low level who may have committed actual crimes but there is no clear evidence that trump actually told them to do those things an there is novidence that trump himself committed a crime and what you have here is her basically living in the space between conspiracy and reko and she is trying to basically bridge that gap with ir about january sex that is sensue of this indictment comes down to it let us talk about how this whole thing went down yesterday soid trump again he is very good a drama this is why he was the president he aybe the president again he he released a personal note just before he showed up in georgia for the arrest and said this today i wil be going to the notoriously violent jail in fulton county georgia wire where i will be arrested de spite having comitted no crime is not it interesting thati want my entire life without gave ever gtting arrested but suddenly out of nowhere once i decide as run for president as a political outsider and fight for theforgotten citizens of our country i get arrested forg times oth the svan of five months not only that a judgeis rule that to day spectacle may be televize for te entire world to see the american people know it is going on ther' a punishment handed down from the deep state for daring to challege the statasqualla and give a voice to the silent majority the left wonce to intimidate you out of voting for political outsider who puts te american people first but today i'm walking into the lines done with one simple message on behalf of ourntirmoment i will never surrender our mission to save america when i walk into the jail to get wrongfully arrested i will not cower i will not sulk i will standtall an remain resolute in our mission to save america and that that is again dude is great at pictures that picture is the resolute face for for trump right and if you see me on to the during my shamress just remember you are the source of my courage my hope in my resolve to save our country if you are doing poorly due to the sinister people in control of our country at now do not even think about donating but if you can pleas make contribution to save america during the star chapter in our na tion's history that is brilliant marketing it is really really smark i is it is again ou moti it is emotive it is empathetic meanin even to very endry drops if you cannot affor it because you are suffering under jobiton do notp give to my campaign but if you can than give to my campaign and there is something to the baseline idea obviously that jude was not arrested for his entire career and then the manute he walks out of the office and just before the election suddenly ave four inditments ring down on him as thoughes in themiddle of a summer storm in south florida that that is a very that is a very strong pitch from president trump and ironically that pitch was actually exascerbated by jobidon everybody knew the donald trump was supposed to show up for the arrest at seven thirty piama last night eastern time it is pot trumpid in fuldtin countyn court house to be arrested at exactly that time at exactly that time at exactly that time seven thirty p ama last night jobididn treated out a perpole of nothing i think to day's a great day to give to my campaign those are real bad optics those are truly bad optics the entire the entire case here is that the democratic party in for structure is going afrdonal trump to make jobidon president the exact time that trump is showing up to be arrested you tweat out come support my campagn you on to say this is not tha political prosecution and the you are tweting out as the arrest is happening not is a sad day for our country the rule of law must be ain you are not treating that out you are treating out a campaign lingk mean guys youre tain the quiet part out loud here you are sain it really really really loudly now there is another side to that which is the jobidon pretty clearly wants donal trump to be the nomina because he thinks he can be donal trump becuse he would be donal trump in twenty twenty he thinks that donal trump his performance in twenty twenty plus for indictments means he loses now bide maybe wrong about that it certainly could be but it is pretty obvious that that bidon wud both donal trump to be indited multiple times in order to degrade his candidi and also he certainly does not mind if donald trump is the nominte because the pole's cho that donald trump is om is not running amazingly well against a deeply un popular president of the united states right down donal rumps own approval ratings are lower than jobidon's approvalrating biding both wants trump indited and also wancts i elevated in the republican primaries but that tweat is gross that is a disgusting tweat really your political opponents getting arrested by people quar of your political party uncharges that are basically spurious and you are tweating out aperopole of nothing i think to day's a great day to give to my campaign the sort of blithe o yah by the way thes all political ununreal stuff ill get to more on this in just one second first a central banks in country's china indya ostrul the un transitioning ithdiginal currency the thudereserveis now contemplating the same for the united states this is pretty dangerous stuff becaue the government if we all just went didgo currency can

day and get started asked lall your questions get all your answers and then di verse fy at least a littlebit in sigold with my friends over at birch gold ookafine the folks at se anen that they are pretty giddy over yesterday because the spectacle of person the absolutely dospise showing up at the fulton county jail house to turn himself in is one of their favorites fulton county jail is not a pleasant place to be you do not want to be there it is not a court house we have been in form by one of our own producers whose name rimes with savy that time she spend some time at the fulton county jail house at one point i'm because of her deep and a biding criminal histery we hear to daily wire we would try to reach out to the the under privilege to ave had a rest records which his whi s havy yorkship but ta savy had to spend some time at the fultn county jail and for further recognize she was there basically by mistake she ended up having her her arrestic sponge whos ot was also in a spot but she described the place and apparently it just to garba shep seannand described the place also they also say that it is a garbagshe but they are real excited because that means to donal trump has to walk into a garba shape mister trump will be bout tat the faulton county jail it is a jail known for rather deplorible conditions including in a defts and excessive force and a prison population that is more than double the amount it was design to hold four people have lost their lines there in just the past few weeks anybody condected to the criminale justice system in the utland area knows that if you are ever told you got to go down to rice street brace yourself because it is gon to be horrible i we can give you some details on this place now fulton county jails the formal name it is known as rice street because of this a grass it opened in nineteen eighty nine but almost immediately affer open it was over crowded had deplor had conmissions and with just the ot just a horrible place to be just last month the just i nerison someone excited t out intthiplace terrible i'll get jail houses safe unsanitary living conditions excessive force and vilt somebon y get that dou to paper bag cause he is really really excited he is easily many people died at fulton county jail hous and trum shruwng up there may you tech now the medial real gan i do not think that this is going to go for them exactly as they wish it you go rachel mat i'll also covered the arrest and again tried to the more more in sorro than an angerootine but it did not it did not succeed officially as a now dolal chop is under arrest and the state of chara i we had confirmation arlier that he had enterned the jail and as o right now former presenat chop is in costody he has teen rest landmark moment andit as a set before a for all the worse trisents h it is just i do not believe you rachel i just do not you you seem very upset you seem supersupersuper upset he is booked on thirteen counts stemming from the efforts to reverse the georgia twenty twenty election at certification he was wearing a dark blue suit and a red tot he arrived at the footon county gail round seven thirty p m and tot jail records listed him this part their actual betding markets on what ho as can be listed affor his waight but that was assuming his ectiong om be waighed a here is one thing that is not true he was listed at sixfoot three inch istall and wiing two hundred and fifteen pounds im donal trump is not two hundred fifteen pounds donald trump during his last phisical an office clocked in it two forty heis significantly heavier than he was when he when he left office six three two fifteen heushu be plaing tight end for the baltimor ravens i that is not that that that but botom line is he was released on two hundred thousand dollars bail and then he a stroll dout to the cameras and did what he does best the dute is great un camera he really is and he knows how to play it here we go ely i the very sayv tha o e te i ti ever happen you challenge tin electon to taee challengo electo oe electo e o re telectoe toin elect and io av every re too ae o av any i othe o ti lecto oerthe a o te i

set fort and tom and he went on along these lines from of twenty seconds than he walked away again for fore donald trump this this may be the best day of his campaign onesto got yesterday today these urgnam the best days of his campaign because it is obviously political in georgia and is obviously political mugshop kin first place again georgial state wads is not require a mu shot if you are a well known figure who has taken a recent photo george state lawrequises i rigget imu shot unlest we have a recent photo of you well i may i feel we have some recent potoes of donald shay trum i feel that is the case they were being vindictive in going after him with the mugshot and he completely reversted on them wit what is going to be an iconic photo of him imminiis is an iconic photo on that they are few iconi sort of mug shots in american history i got the very famous franks an otrot mug shot y in in sort of pop political trmy of them martn lit te king mug shot in in hollywood terms yoof multillins youlo hand mugshots and and then you have obviously donal trumsmug sh and as i say just on a a pure theatrical level that mug shot is grat for him it is a great image for him ain just one

next year and a half in various courthouses right now his proposed to trial on georgia election interference is supposed to be an october twenty third they want to start it fourthwith one ifs other co defendants as aredy been charge and will tart his trial october twenty third presume ly trumple try to push that into the middle of next year at the very least when it comes to the marloggo classfied documents case that is already slated to start may twentieth of next year just befor the conventions at the tail und o the primaries his manhattan d a case the one about stormy daniels that one is slated to gin march twenty fifth which is literally the day before super tuesday all this is pretty obviously ut when he does delection interference i mean yah it it pretty clearly is any one comes to the january sixth case that was fil in washington d s we are still awaiting some 's more in formation as to when that case's actually going to begin as farge the thirteen charges that donal trump is facing he is facing one charge violation of eorg to reco three charges of solicitation o violation of oth by a public officer whit should presumably be him asking people to put there names on some sort of alternative elector slate which i'm not sure why that is illegal actually he has one charge of conspiracy to impersonate a public officer which is a very weird charge two charges of conspiracy commit forgery in the first degree two charges of conspiracy comit falsestatements an writings one charge of conspiracy commit filing docet filing false to documents and a couple of charge on false statements ind writings and filing false documents that that that is wheare the georgia case stans ga what is this mean for the election well obviously republicans me included anybody who his conservative who looks at this and looks at what is happening in georgeow or looks what is happening on the genuor sexth case in d'o see wit who at's happening in manhaton noll but lost on the case in florida where it is pretty obvious the donal trum violated the law the best case that you can make right there is that toto tillrto clinton and thi's a political prosecucion because of t double standard which agan sort of agree with it is pretty obvious to every one that there is a lot of sympathy for trump on this and there should be a lot of sympthy for trump on this that he is being politically target it now he could not made it a lot harder for his political opponents tou target him in the class vi documents case particularly but that ouln't ave stop the other three cases which are all jind up he that being the case there is am mour lot of sympathy for the idea that if you nominate him there has to be a grounds well because you feel it right i feel it everybody who watches this on the right side of the ey feels the sympathy for trump they yeulik well this cannot stand somebody has to be punish right as trump himself says this is entire campan nou i am your vengeance right i am your revenge this is going to be my vengeance campagn against the deep state i'm n to take them out the is what trum himself is saying in his statement the problem is that because we live in variasilos an echo chambers it is easy to forget t there are other voting populations that do not agree with you and do not feel the same things that you do democrat's get caugh up in this regularly there is why democrats run down weird rabbit holds with regard to trancing of the children that they will take things well where i live everybody feels the same way how could anyone else feel differently an a turns out a vast majority the country feels differently then they do well it is this lites important to look at the actual data on how americans feel about trump and how they feel about the indictements and how they fel bo voting for trump because i understand the people want it everytime thre's a pule confirmation bice is a very strung drug whenever there is a pule that confirms your suspicions youre likely to cite it whenever this a pull it does not confirm your suspicions youare unlikely to citit one thins i try to do here on the show is give you poles that both confirm my suspicions and also do not confirm my suspicions im me ove you all the data i do not think that zero data is a substitute for some data even if that some data is not perfect ata becauser's no such thing as perfect ata son a second i'm to get into what the pules actually say about weather additional trump indictments wether mog shots witho u any of this actually is going to leed trump to victory in general lection against jobidon which is the thing that i care about i can use you things at once sympathize with donal trumps legal plight promot the legal funds of his of of people are being charged tos co conspears with gen a ellis which a've done on the show and i'm line wen do all that and also recognize that is he the best guy to be jobiton come next fall i well get to that momentarily first we have a dog his his name is happy and happy is a very cute haven hese dog very sweet to make heads also turns out he is a protector of the virtuous the other the other day happy woking up six twenty in who is barking swhat holl miess tog wiggin up it six twenty embarking and it turns out if whe is staring out are back wend out and he saw an intire road game of rack hoons in the back yard there a'll tadet ut where mother jackets re to go and happy as i will take all of them i'll take all four of these giant flortor acoons well that that is our happy and happy must be protected which is why we use rough greens for him rough greens boose happyes food back's life that can do the same for your dog as well yourenouh to goan bi new dog food jous sprinkle some rough greens on their food every single day contains the necessary vetements minerals your dog's not getting from their regular dog food rough green's the only supplement your dog will asked for by name

trawl baglor rough green stok comslash ben that roufh greens bring your dog's food back's life that is are you f f reens dot comslash ben to day or call eight threy three my dog thirty thre that is a't threy three my dog thirty thre ofl case let us look at the actual data with regard to present in trump's favorability unfavorability ratings according to the latest your go polling available which you three afor dasgo his currnt favorable ratings ar stup he is under water by seventeen points a according to the ipsos pole bout the same time abe sem is ipsos un favorable ratings twenty four points under water thirty one per cent favorable rating in fact there are zero poles that i can identify that have donald trum and you are closhes to even parody with regard to his favorability or un favorability rating now you compare that two jobidon who is puerson her'd be runng agains and jobdon also has terrible favorable un favorable ratings for sore they are very similar atually a jobidons favorability ratings are in the forty two to forty four per cent range some times he may reach forty five per cent trumps average right now rit right now the five thirty eiht average for favorabilit ratigs on bidin he is about twelve point three points under water donald trumps favorability ratings are about seventeen points under water het he is more un popular just on average then jobidon is bu what is more important is who is gon o come home right one the big questions in the selection that there really two questions turn out for your sit wilfrey turn out for your side turn ut for the other side and what is people middll do jobidon believes that turn out for jobiden is triven almost entirele by the presence of donald trump on the ticket read that that demal crats do not car but yor by that jo bidin they fin thing e they think he stinks at best he is a mediocrity hes he is at he is a person who just can a standing there if he can even stand but they really hate donald trump now in ord understand thsyou have to ave lived in both a blue area and right area during the twenty sixteen and twenty twenty leshions i lived in california and let me explain to people who ave never lived in a blue area the level of hatred for donald trump in places california is deeper than the level of hatrede that peeple in californ a have for isis it is it is it is deep and it is viceral the despises donal trump despise him which meens thet dey will walk across broken glass to voteagains donald trump in that that really is the reality and that is particularly true after twenty sixteen when he was definitely not's post to win s they will not willing to walk across brokin glass to vot against onal trump in twenty sixteen cause howas cen in unknown they' kno quite what e was and there is a widespred asumption that hille riclint was gin a win an's heir li gannow maybe meall gly really have to get ot about him and hillerys clanol on o win and then trump one and theire level of panic went high that every single one of them voted the change the voting rules obviously with the mal an ballas in everything else jobidon's precsupposition and this has ben shown by the way by prety much every subsequent election twenty eighteen twenty twenty twen twenty one tweny twenty two rad all the subsequent elections show that when trump is perceived even to be on the ballat every single percon who is a democrat shows up to vote against him not cas tey love the democrat because they hate donald trump hate him with the fiery passion of a thousand burning sons and meanwhile in the epublican areas people really really love trump and they show up and they vote for trump in really high numbers however there is a quart of people iton the ten to be ignored but the never trump folks who say they will not vote for trump under any circumstances is not a minord it is not a tiny position it is not a uge position but's not a tiny position either the number of people in the democrati crat who say they one hundrer cent will not show up for jobidon is a sentully non existen thereis no never bitin crew among the jobidons soif you'r looking it who ise gin't come home in the democratic party the likely answer is virtually everybody in the re publican party the answer is likely ninety two per cens that eight per cent makes a difference in a very very tightelection and then you look at nd and beyond that there can be some re publicans quire just not enthused with the idea of a trump bid an election again and the me you whell i i lke trump and i wont be president but it is raining to day and jobidon is mad ar jobid does not get into one animated trump gets people on the right animated and he gets people on the left animated on on trump turns outvote fr his side and he turns outpots for the other side but the third factor's the people inthe middle the people in the middle by pulling data they breake for bidon there broke rdon in twenty twenty there is very little evidence the gn a s swich back to trump now the case for trump is very easy actually the case for trump is it was better when trump was president than when bidon is president the problem is that if all youre in to get next year is not trump prosecuting case against jobidon and his economy and his ecompitence and how bad a present he is the case youre gin to get is it is really un jost that i'm being jailed by fanny will is or by the man hant da alvan brag or by jack smith that is a bank shot because you basically have to say that all of these people are working for jobidon and therefore it is unfair that jobidon is musing all of thse people go after me and it is not is not quite the easiest argument actually fort for trump to make which presumably is why what the poles show according to the most recent pulling dad to asking the question there is a pull trump a p annoar c this is sirca bat a week ago we can havago more than half of american say there is zero chance of them voting for donald donald trumptor truns the white house ind twenty twenty four fifty three per cent of americans told the a p anoarcey cents for survey they would definitely not support him next november another another eleven per cent thy they would probably not pull the lever for the fortif of presiden which means only thirty six per cents say they would probably or definitely support trump n his third consecutive bid for the white house it is this this connect betwen republican voters who think that other every thing's them and the rest of the country that is leading two trumps increase in the poles now do i think that thes sigan to weare well for trump at overtime it tends not to at overtime what tends to have there is an opening here here is an opening for another candidate in the republican party to make the very simple in convincing case donal trump should have all of our sympathy for the legal travails he is undergoing and also he is very unlikely to be trubide that is actuallyu the case that is the only case that you can make if your republican at this point and hope to win primaries against donall trump which raises the question of have that is to bate go we now have some data ofn the debate fall out 's i gave you my take yesterday and my take as i suggested it is different fom the take of some of the lanes inside the republican party and it is also counter for wat 's worth which is one persons opinion i'm to give you the data that we now have from some the poles first of all important to note a wat of people watch the debate not twenty sixteyn numbers but twelve point eight million total viewers watched the debates according to the nealson ratings the first abates on twenty fifteen did twice that because trump was on the stage but thirteen million people is not bad there another one point seven million people are who watched on fox business at asshe look fourteen million people probably who watch the debates that is leaving aside everybody who watched on rumble or watched it another places an that that that is a fairly solid number and tat's goin to be a large percentage and not an insignificant per senteng tor people who actually vote in the republican primaries turns out that that sto bate may indeed have mattered a little bit ow i'm people say well yen trumps interview it tucker carlson did two hundred and thirty million vidio views and and all the rest of it that again the metricks for a vidio view on twitter are not the same as the metric for a vidio view on nealson not even remotely the same nelson ratings requiry to watch several minutes of a thing an or if you be counted a viewer a twitter view counts as the post is in your screen more than fifty per cent in your screen for more than two seconds for two seconds or more you can be sqralling andyou just art looking at the treet below it and it is playing above and that counts is o view also if you reload because your connection one away which i did right is ias watching the trump tucker thing i had to reload that sucker sous on a plane i'd o reload that sucker probably fifteen twenty times and's that each one of those is a view the actual percentage of people who actually watched a significant portion of the trump tucker interview is not even remotely two hundred thirty million it is by some metrics as lol as a couple of million because again is it was not broad cast anywherer it was not it was not particularly illuminating that interview you realy at's a really love trump an order really find that that stu illuminatings i talked about yesterday on the sho bit the trump tucker interview who is asked no serious questions an ye gave no serious answers ind whis entertaining but it really dn't illuminate anything gay that means that maybe thedebate mattered a little bit we now have some poling data with regard to who one anda and who lost the debates the washington post five thirty aghtt nipsos all conducted a ple before and after last night's debate according to the washington post with potenthal re pubplican primary cocks voters including those who watchd the debate according to those voters not a going to ma corng the voters the twenty nine per cent who watched said that te santis have the bestnihte the vake rumasuammy came in to twenty six per cent now again my generalise takeis that everybody basically accomplishd what they wanted to accomplish in the debate te santis wanted to escape fire and look percententhal vagrumasuammy wanted a tention which he got inspates nickey hayley ontti walk down that traditional geo pee lan get to momentum there pens wane to sharp as legacy christy want to throw cuple o punches an shrp the ever trump vote it is pretty much everybody got what they wanted from thedebate but what the sats actully show is that te santis according to this pole twenty nine per cent say that he perform best which is a far cry from a lot ofthepeople who are big trump fan saying that hehe was terrable is awfule is all that is really nout with people who watched the debate said twenty six per cent said that vake performed the best what is more important actually is what per centage of people say they are considering voting for each of the candidates s again this is just for geo pe debate watchers for that for the people lacually watched the geo pee debate which ou now again is twelve fourteen million people it is not the forty or fifty million people who presume lull vote in re publican primary hibu among the debate watchers sixty seven per cent of people say they are considering rondto santus for president of te united states that is an up tick of about four five per centage points from where it was that actually is the number one in the field number to in the fiel is trump sixty one per cent say they are considering voting for him nickey haley had by fare the iggest bump shoin from twenty nine percents of people in the dethe gopey debate watchers saying they were considering voting for her to forty six per cent saying they are voting for her or would consider voting for her vevak move from forty to forty six per cents we picked up sume ground but not a ton he is now tied with nickey hayleans from of people who ould consider voting for him in a primary that is followed by tem scot at forty three percent my pence at twenty three chris cristy at twenty two and the innimitable and electric dug bergham at twelve per cent nowt when you tike a look at gop primary voters just over all go pe primary voters notchis people who watched the debates what you fine is that fifty one per cent say they are considering dosantus sixty four per cent say they are considering tfrum and nobody else is even within remote spitting distance nickey haley's at twenty four vakes at twenty three simce gottus at twenty five twenty six are at pence fourteen persty four per cent the inimitable and electric dug bergham what is that mean well means that actually te santis got a little bit of a bump from this actually what is actually even more in persting is how the favorables and un favorables when for everybody in the field the the favorab ble rating for ty santus basicaly increase slightly and is un favorables went down slightly seventy two percent favorable twenty five per cent un favorable which makes him the highest in the re publican field donald trump is among the jope to bate watchers among jobe o bate watchers fifty nine per cent said that theyre favorable to trum thirty five per cent un favorable she is pluss twenty four the santus heis my mouth is corrector y mental mather he is some his curently plus forty seven that those are big numbers nicky hayleys favorables went out prettyse ramatically she is up to sixty five per cen favorable twenty seven per cent unfavorable weardly the vague because nobody had heard of him up until last few weeks actually ve vacs favorable raitings went from fifty to sixty but is an his unfavorable ratings when from thirteen to thirty two he actually on net lost favorability ratings over the course of dhebate there is more people said they loved him bu ther're lotlor people who said they did not him after watching that to bay which agin make cens very polerizing performance they say for one crowd itwa ton ay and for one crowd was dee te santus at least gave himself a little bit of a boozt from this which is again cin of surprising and he maintained he maintained the biggest mover was hayley it what is what is that mean for the primaries i mean hou may mean very little for the primaries depending on whether any one can capitalize off the back of that and and move forward but the the notion that the resithat that the santis got is clock clean the campaign is over which is something that that don trump junior for example as trying push that obviously itis not true here is a fox news focuscrupt directly after the bakers what they had to say e wen at last night a open mind at man in aloi te santus hado to fal why think a te tanti taatly the wat te let a fit in my mind omthank tha e ta the a licin i tin to morrow because i don se thin we have a to larn an a lito hear i was willy in pra wi thin i caly i tose came a thin i she of a archin she ta to boudi tin a way that i thin can neutralife some of the nekative o ca caa sa to you came in likehing te santus and dink you whit to her a ya i i think that something bout the santus that he is tvery much towing is background and and what is ta compsente forita ah yeshuld a ca saw lot of people talk a e ho yo once theya once they gin to orhus the santo sht ap don a and florid and i'll doing or national level to me someone who has the complishent there it really resonates with man that was eqlip that involved a couple of people who were who were previously protosantus but there are bunch people had focus crup whoe're actually more protrump or or more provovague and the also said they thought to sant sid bl again there is not standing for tosantus he could turn into nothing rend it could be just another kind of moment it which it seems he is going to burst out of the scene and the nothing happens or it could be the beginning of bildmomentum what happens next i's going to i said the yesterday what happens next is going to define what the dbate means for everybody else as always can only see inflection points in retrospect something' the leg the're gong to be in flecthion point an they turn out to be nothing something look they they could be in flechon ponts an thy turn ut to be something were about to find out and just

heads comela harris tries to reshape her public image ahead of twenty twenty four and a political interview the vice president to dress how she views the growing scrutinishes under as republicans use her as a bogy man in twenty twenty fo all she is a victim again all is she sucks un er job she is up victim again that is all this crap works thayn't pretend that she is the eir apparent to a to a a m an old man who e i sgagis jobinis s in such fragile health thet some of the stuff that we do here at daily wire involves me cutting vidios a couple o weeks in advance s that we can addit them properly and we actively con siderd thngs if i make this vidio what is the turn around time on it if the turn round time is several months and's about jobidan i'm not sure we can do it it might not be relevant he is her active considerations that people make in the political world based on jo bidon's frailty and ailing health that of course they are trying to prop up comea harrsgan back stage if she prepares for a not intimate fireside chad about gunsafety in fron of hundreds people hundreds of people the vice prent hundreds of people allemet leme explain something i can draw hundreds of people shes the vice presiden she be a anywat comela hrris is unscripted and seemingly at ease no notes or tell a prompter insightwall slow clap for the ty who does not ned a teleprompter for talking toraborter back stage wow no notes even o och the i cupoints just flow out of her water from moses's rock she is comfortable offering can knowence as in counsils to those whoave lost love ones to gun violencs we streemen wearing gredshirts and blazin with moms demandactur studens tomandaction she holds their hands and looks into their eyes we speak their names she whispers to one woman that one prolla looks round what she why she whispering what t she gently reassures a man clearly anxious about where to stand in the photoline all eyes are on her but that is been true of hiris for a while now and the view has not often been kind yes yes she is a victim she is a victim of the fact that she as such a dramatic failure throught her and tire political career that she keeps failing up if she keeps being his bad at her job now af she has benthrogout her career eventually she will become empress she ist every time she fails tolic what ive we give her a higher slipe it she will be better eve she is the michael moles of politics sake the worse she does at her job the morroli what ve we juse promotor more her ten yearis jobitons number two has not been known for relacxed in worne moments those in chicago instead herris is turm has largely been marked by still to performance is a public events at odds with the uninhimited in terot interrogator she was known as in the senate they field lispers abut whether she will be a drag on the reelec ticket as twenty twenty four heats up now her political future and quite possibly the success of the democratic ticket hinges on a simple question is it possible for comea hairs to make a second impression do you mt byk by second o you mean two thousand impression for harris is to question that fundamentally misunderstands the point in her mind she is the same person she was when the prevailing narrative her was that of star proscutor a send in political towents even the future of the democratic partie you could ave followed me around an iwa had of twenty twenty heiri said youwould have seen the same thing for years ago it is always sho i've been i cannot get into be other peoples hads about why they characterized things as being one weye another it is not as thoughi've just found myself i've always been here i never went away and then the entiracle s about how that is not true anhow really she is beet it' it is others around her who have failed the great leader but but really she is actually umpempathetic an sympathetic and one dress guys if this is the best you got you better pray the republicans jog democratic turn out becaus comela harris is a disaster area and when i say that jobiton is being a bad president im emmean he is really a quite terrible presidend the migrant crises continues to mounts and i know that we all forget about it interment light by ta it it is still a problem according two seebes news officihals in new york are sembling tent cities for thos who cannot by place in a shelter system of more than two hundred hotels and other facilities already housing sixty thousand migrans mand more than fifty thousand home as presidents in chicago housing over seven thousand migrans police stations and parks ave been converted into makeshift shelters planstouse asylum seekers and macant schools have generateod fervent local backlash in citys sacramento and denver migrans have found themselves on the brink of homelessness in boston the arrival of thousands of families and pregnant women seeking asylum prompted the states governor to t e clar in emergency a perfect storm they gan the cecibes news reporting has brought the historic migrasian crises a long ys maxcal borer to some of america's largest cities the citys strugglesthouse tens of thousands of destitute migrants and they are growing calls for federal action have also placed mounting pressureon the bidn ad ministration to intervene local leaders have implored the ad ministration for funs and to low migrants to work legally s of they can be self sufficient cities have spent hundreds millions buk serving migrants housing themin hotels church o schools park's polece stations even a national guard bas the mine admnistration as set aside seven hundred seventy million bucks from new york chicago don for bowton another cities the administration recent ly ask congress for another six hundred million dollars but the administration has refrained from taking other actions re quested by local leaders such as grantsing migrants temporary legal status thy can apply for work perments more quickly now what is hount hilario that nobody at these cities we will say we might do as yost closed the border we could do that they will not do that obviously thy'd be the would be superbad cannot cannot do that instead there is stuck in the unenviable position ofve allowing board remain wide open and migran s beship y the tens of thousands their cities and and then complaining they on't havenough money to deal with it here is cathy hocal the failing governor of new york but new york has sholder this tirden for far too long since the first vigrants began arriving at the port authority bus terminal last year city an state of for tremendous fons billions to dollars and energy into helping them the city is help band helping by the state to managis and partnership with our state legislatur and in our budgeit wealicated over one billion dollars now upwards of one point five million dollars for providing shelter national gard public health transit case management and legal service as toa silm seekers especially of the housing that is an addition to the over one two hundred shelthers at hotels that are stood up by the city of ew york with the financial support from the state y they are darin the mazing job but now they have to now they have to beg the federal government for more money or they could actively talk about the fact that their stupid policies have generated this promment in the first place of can meanwhile seeing of jobidons failures hisdyogeis such e massed it is such a massimien to try between tranks cut sweet hartdeals with hunter bidon and then getting exposed for it and that blowing up in their face and going after donald trum on non criming but to between those two things now they have added to that that they are filing a lawsuit against space acts the only truly successful space company in america the lawsuit leges thete from at least september twenty eighteen to make twenty twenty two space ex routinely discouraged asileese and refugs from a pline and refuse to hire a consider them tbecause of their citizens citizenshipstatus in violation of the emigration nationality acts space exs apparently wrongly claimed that under federal regulations known as export control laws space ex could only hire oua citizens and lawful prminent residents greencard holders but asilys in refue shes permission to live in work in the united states does not expire they stand on equal footing with youa citizens and lawful promit residents under export control laws theyare now soing they are now soing space acts for the great crime of discouraging people who have claimed asylum and refue e from applying for open position because they havenan actiol been given a green card do not worrak ise thern' they are not encouraging people to falsely claim asylum and refuge by suing companies spacexs which biblay has national security contracts what the federal govermenies now doing is they want people who ave claimed asylum or refuge and whose cases our it sounds you ther pending or being a judicated they want those people hired by companies that do national security business this is a nutty nutty wawsuit but its designed for purpose it is they you must you must hire more refugees if you are spacacts apparently they this is that that is wild that that 's a wild wasuit and of course the real reason the'r doing that is bcause he land muskes of political enemy nd you are not allowed to be youon mus get's bad you knowmany you knomny companies are going ou of their way to higher people who do not have green cards becase ou not's really hard to check whether somebody has lejet refuge or asylum stat lot harde check he green card or a citizenships status are not but apparently you kow they are lot o companies i'm sure that do this spasecs as the one of course that comes up musk said i think people are very confused about this during it two thousand sixteen speece s un fortunately there is not up to us if you are working on rockets acnowledgy that is consider an advanced weapon sicnology even a normal work fees is not sufficient unless y get special permission from the secretaryof defense this is not out of some desire of spasexs to just hirer peoplewith green cards because we are not allowed to do anything else i think this is not a wise policy for thyou us there is many towns o people all aroun the world we' love thy've work at the company unless they can some out get a green car were legually preventsed from hiring some one musk added the export lowst do not apply to tesslaw and that about twenty five to thirto persen of the engineering staff of tesslaw was from outside the country i'm jonithan gro ton mgration a turny he says that spacexs is not bard from hiring for nationals at all but companies do have to seek certain veses for foreig nationals or obtain government approval when a comes to i c a our restrictions spasacs is within its rits to not pursue that path but he said thet refugees should not be affected by it i t a our restrictiont what if they just got it wrong i mean what at what if they just got it wrong but they have a business insensive to avoid in accidental i t or violation and be conservative but acparently now they have now bits been disntsent vi if they make a mistake then you are move their goverment contracts on and destroy their security clearance and if they and if they do not hire enough of the migrants tht yu want them t hiher than you sue them in federal court amazing stuff from the bidn deo jape ok can meanwhile we should comments on the fact that there are am many grave mistakes made with regard to russia first on list of is of course invading russia during the winter time second on the list is leading a coo against the russian leader failing and then flying a private jats near russian air space that is a very very bad mistake as predicted the wogner mercenary group chief you have getnyn pregosion he m he is thad according to the walsterturnal shortly after sixpy am moscow

bidin special prosecutor jack smith blaunches another four charges that tonal trump over misshandling of classified information as two more cases against trump loom the collapsing hunter bit an plead eals spells volnerability for joe and house re publicans reveal how the bidon whitehouse push censorship on face book i'm been shpare les is the venthparo show the benchvar shosponterback spressvepian i do not let them every single show why havn't got nove pianiet get express we pian right nout if pressy pandi calm flashmen well another day another set of charges against the former preceden to of the united states that r bunch of charges looming in separate cases from the classified documents case we have the fanny willis case in georgia that presumably will be about january sixth and electoral pressure there is the jack smith case looming about january sixth and electoral pressure but there are new charges that were filed yesterday by jacksmith these new charges are in the classified document's case and they really carry two major revelations that the first major revolution lation that is carried by by the actual filing is that the prosecutors know full well that the famous tape now of donal trump waving around a document and sang to people here is a classified document at could of deed glassified this document bat is had did not ed he classified th document it is very glassified e trump had claed that his classified docment was in fact maps of a golf course or something andapparently agoing the prosecutors they know full well it was not maps of golf horse it was actually a tack plans with regard to oron and we now know that what the prosecutors know and presumably that will be the sensorpiece of their case when he have the person on tape admitting to the criming usually is a very bad indicator for them legally speaking that is number one piece of information is that the tape where trump his chalking he made various excuses about it it appears that the prosecutiont is ready to blow up those excuses the second piece of revolatory information here is that donal trump apparently told one of his aids decamp a a maintenance worker at trumps south florida resort nand carlos de olo vierra apparently he told this fellow two whipe the security tape accordig tothe walzterjournal trump an his ages sauts have surevailance footed from his marliv club to leaded t could not be turned over to a grand jury according to jacksmith in these new charges the newinvictment charges carlos to ole vierra he mare notnance worker as well making him the third defendet in the cases wire member the second offended in the case was waltmouta who is another trump ade whois apparently task of moving boxes around and then told the prosecution had not move boxes around the additional charges brought the indictment brought by a florta gran jury in june a leging the form presedent held on to sensitive military secretshe knew he should neve rtain acess too sherd the with others ind directed his staff to help him vade authorities efforts to get them back they commas trumpbraces for separate federal trarges of rafer sun do his twenty twenty election lost now as i've said all long thereare two separate issues here one is is trump guilty of the crimes for which he is charged and the second is should the charges be brought even if trump is guilty of the charges facially speaking with regard to the first question whether trump his actually guilty of some of these charges and gen the evidence seems pretty clear the trump violated the law here in well get to the sang las ion i just a second which is going to obviate the first question but the first question which is wether trum violated the low if jacksmith has actual testimony that the document that trump was waving around on that tape or he is talking about how he couldnave de classified the document but he did not te classified te documents but still technically classified but here it is and he showing itso people who do not have any sort of classification status if that is what happen and if jacksment can prove that if he has the evidence to prove it beyond the actual tape then presumably that will be in element of gilt when it comes to evidence that this maintenance worker was actively wiping security footage in order to prevends donald trump trum being indited on precisely the sorts of charges wipe the evidence of for example donald trump moving the documents around now here is the thing about thi shole case all this was easily avoidable the reason be angry at trump here is not really his behavior much as it is the insanity of knowing tat e's got the world's biggest targanon's back he is likely to run for reelection again and dom and he desides that he is going to do all of this under the assumption that known is goin to come after him the the assumption of impunity here is just foolish again as as a person whos prominent poitici over pay my taxes because the last thing that i want is be put under the scrutiny of jo bidons o ioras wil donald trump is way more of a target than i am personally why in the world would he be cariless and and clumsy as to do all of these things then do them on tape also that that is why h shuld be upset at trump rithat the crimes themselves tha messing with the classified documents not turning them back in he was not turing them over to russia as i said from the very beginning the entire case is donald trump likes things and then he keeps them donald trumps here is a thing it is really nice thing it is a good it is bod thing i won it it is bine n they caa thingits a thing that that is donald trumps he he does this all the time he literally just had to hive a bunch of antiquities back to the is really consolate because he would kept the antiquities and thy e was lives lay a munch of two thousand your old artifact and trump had beedn handed them at the white house and then he su said he was gin keep em why wasi was he going to handlos over to the russians as spimenter a lo he likes things he keeps them he is can of a horder the notion that he was actively sertain sort spy for chino or russiar that the is classified document who is keeping them on hands who could do something ne verious and terrible them that is not true and sell what you ent up with is he miss handald classified documents because donald trump is clumsy and does not care about the ramifications legally but also is not somebody whof seeking to disseminate the newcleer codes to the russians or the chinese or something an with all that in mind this brings us to the second question which is whether donald trump shouldhav ben charged on the stuff at all because this is the most perilous political prosecution in american history you have the current precedents of the united states his deojean mane na mistakeit is still his deoje his deoje prosecuting the guy he just ran against and his probable future opponent in the twenty twenty four race that is kind of astonishing stuff and again put aside for just one moment the actual elements of the crime because when he actually read the charges here when you read what trump did i think that it is fairly t clear that trump did many of the things that he is accused of but that is not really the question the question is why he is being charged with it at all again i'm looking at the at the actual charges here and dom and the charges openly discuss what exactly he was doing with the documents how he was sort of messing around with the documents toll corting two this actual documen is the invictmen documen quot on june third twenty twenty two when ff agients where at marlago to collecthe documents with classification markings trum trumpet trurny one and trump atenty three the agens observed the re several surveillance cameras located near the storage room on june twenty second twenty twenty two the do j emald in a turney for trumps business organization a draft gran tery sopeno

dolliver took trumpemploy forts with small room known as an audio closet and then they had an exchange in which dulvera asked how many days the servel retain footage dilliver then trump told trump em ploy for the boss wanted the server to lead it and then dulvera texted nouta are you working today and they are gone back an forth and finally apparently the footage ends up essentially being arace there is an attempt to race the footage ge that is what the actual indictmen segjact now second question should trump be indicted for this stuff at all well let us ook at t time line literally yesterday the hunterbide and pleedio collapses and a collapse is because the hunter bidin pleet deal is garbage and the deogan knows it is garbage and th deoja's lying to the jodge about a being garbage and th judge discovers that and then she blows up to deol and one day later the special council jacksmith tha dumps a bunch of additional charges on donald trump does that seem suspicious to you it shuld seem particularly suspicious given once again that hillery clinton is the standard by which all this must be judge hiller clintin to the exact same thing as donall trump in this case she was not prosecuted jims commy went outofhis way not to proscutor clin despite the fact that she too violated the obvious letter of the law and the spirit of law by the way and shoose let off to hook

it appears that yaming bithevalble evidence if jacksmith's got the good ofs got t e goods but that is a separate question from weather the prosecution of donal trump should move forward because i remind you jim's comy let hillery clinton off te hook for the same exact stuff the same exact stuff flash back sho thousand sixteen november six paul sperry reports for then yor post that hillery

in other words clinton's defende to all this as we told them on to go they shuld to lead it and then the gestdidn' do it on tim but the plat river employ you knew about it what you think that he actually was wie ouno now that i havenan f b request for the in formation and i made a booble probi should violate the lawn to lead all the emales youre call tat hillery clinton was then asked about this and she famously joked about wiping in emale server without with a cloth here we go now all i can tell you is in ranthrospect if i use it government account and i had said eou know let us release everything let us plet everybody in americ to see what i did for four years we would have the same arguments that that is all i can say i i'm i'm noe kow i do not i havet no idea that is why we turned

with bleach bit ere yoe wipe the servers she was not prosecuted if she does the same stuff itsonl tromp and she does not get prosecuted and it is explicitly let off the hook coul she is unning for president and don'l frump is being prosecutor for all that that does look the double standard of justice that donall trump is complaining about and does not stop there injst a second one can get to more in ditements looming over president trump which ironically help him in the primaries and hurt him in the general first it is time far mead of it questions poncerd by good ranchers where we get to

triminal charge facing trump down apparently yesterday according to the nertaly news barriers ratually erected outside a fulton counpty quaurt house in anticipation of possible indictments involving interference in the twenty twenty presidential election fulton county district to turny fanning willis once to make an ame for herself plans to charge twice ins i did former presidents onal trump with crimes including witness tampering according to the uchegardian willis asked a george's superior cort chief jorge in may to keep the corthouse free at the start of august leading a speculation trump and his surrygets might be charged in connection with attempts to overturn the electoral lose he still refuses to accept trumper's recorded in january twenty twenty one preshering george o secretary of state brad raffin'sburgo to find enough votes to keep him in the white house following his defeat if that is all they have that is not going to be sufficient becase you have to show in ten to actually j traudulently create votes or throw out votes trump saying i know that there is enough votes for me to in and ayev to do its find me the vots that i know gest that goes to intent as i've said a thousand times the gar tod trump intent is a real ptroblem in proving crimes against onal trump because he is uniquely capable of convincing himself of things a he he does this all the time and what donal trump thinks in the moent is precisely with tonnl trump things in te moment thes the thing people love about him it is alls thing people hate about him trump is fully authentic the thing he thinks right now is exactly the thing he things five seconds later it may change but in the moment he may actually believe tht he won the election and it is impossible to say hees he knew he lost the election and therefore who is tring to fraudulently fine votes he cannot do that because he may very well have thought he won the election the votes existed and who just encouraging people i know it is there i know my carkees are somewhere in the house just find the carkees and that is not the same thingas i know the carkees are not anywhere in the house and know i'm making you search for the carkees traudulently until he steal the eighbor's ckarkies not quite the same thing the gran jury was sworn in on jely eleventh to pure evidenceagainsts trump and his allies they my've also included other communications with state officials and the selection of fik electors trummer turning re julilany confessed in a quart filing this week he lied about george atelection workers he would accuse of trying to savatage trumps at re elect efforts but the question is did julione lie bout that to trump also if julione admits now i knew the election was lost i was lying when i accused ex wion z of doing these things if julion he said that if he lied to trump also then trum would have been under th misimpression that stuff was true son trump repeated that then presumably trump would not have the intent requisite toectully charge him with a crime we still have that case looming over trump and then we also have a second case looming over trump that looming case is the january sixt intitements thet jack smith is likely to bring this would make for on going federal cases and one stake it while three on going federal cases in one staycase against donal trump the state case would be the ridiculous manhatin d alvan bragg bringig tae case against trump for campagn finance violations in new york which is absolute garbageon seriously trumped up the second is the classfied docments case where trump may very well have comitted the crime but t's very clear that herolid clinton was not charge for the exactin cru im the third case would be the fanny willis casin georgo where again it iscan be very dipfle to prove the intent necessary to can vict trump of a crime unless they can actually show some sort of obstruction of justice threats to witnesses or something that and fourth would be the january sixth case the jacksmith presumably is about to bring against on a trump well get tol all of that an just one second but first the best place to hirs with ziprocuter a hirin

potential indictment over the former presenetszefforts to overturn the results of the twenty twenty election trum himself confirmed the meeting in a post on his truth social network righting quote my atturnys had a productive meting with the deogay this morning explaining in detail i did nothing long was advised by many wawyers and that an indictmen of me wold only further to stray our country he added no indication of notice was given during the meeting s there is a lot of talk this week that here would be an indictment of trump on january sixth charges coming down it may well be the lot of that in formation was about the new charges they were actually brought by jack smith an the class fit document's case that the january sixth indictment is actually not right around the corner here it was not immediately cler what was discuss of the meeting thogh similar sit down with loyers occurred in the ays before trump was indicted last month on the classfiget at document's case thirsday's meeting included trump atturning john lara said the person familiar with the case wo spoke to the a p on the condition of aninimity to describe a private gathering louro said in a fox telvishen inter view this week dis cline had done at nothing wrong the status of that secretife granjery proceedig wht remained un cleard as by building speculation the criminal case could be near soi is un clear when that is going to come down it is also in clear what exactly the charges are going to be they ben talking bat using a fraud charge which seems really really weak to me i do not see ow legally they charge him with defrauding the government usually when that is done it is it is becaue you faked boats or becaue you stool votes or something not because you made a bad legal request for the overturning of state scertified boates that thot'd presumely fall under free speech as much is is untrue theoraticaly they coud go of for him for obstruction wit that actually ave tor show the depressure witnesses which gan is pretty hibar and then they'v been using civil war ere a civil rights violations i do not see how any of these appliits can be a very very big stratch if that is all jacksmith has to charge on two sum op of the fo r cases only one of them appears to have serious legal merit at this point again we doft knowabout the georgi case because the indictment has come down yets we cannot actually adjuticate what they have got or what they are charging him with but just from the speculateso we have two that not yet ben file that we hav two that been file of the to that en file the manhantantiese case is absolute crap the case that has been filed an jor in florida with regard to classified documents it appears that they they have trump maybe ded to wrihts evidentiarily speaking but politically speaking which may make a ifference with th jury hillery did the exact same thing mean much the donald trump in that case apparently told his lawyers he loved what hilleries lawyers did and he love to do it also again if the ideaters the dojate dis not char tillery but tey definitely charged trump that double standard of justice maybe a jury nollification play particularly in the state of floor where trump remains very very popular there is that which his led to speculation that jacksmith will file very similar charges in new jersey bor trumpill get a much less favorable jery but ollitake is one jer jerst actually say no to basily scuttle the case that is the one with merit but the one with merit becomes non meritorious once you hadn hilery clin to th mext then you have the georgia case that george case can be very hard to prove we hven't seen the charges and fannuwills appears to be a very politicaly motive ito prosecutor and finall you have the january sixh case the jack smith is thinking of charging apparently we do not know what the charges are there but those apear to be a stretch as well how doesthis preat down politicaly while obviously it benefits trump in the republican primaries because right now the argument against trump would be that these indictments hurt him against jobidon but jobidon is running super juper weak right now ironically the greatest enemy of rondissancis campaign is jobidonsweet polling numbers the ase the fact is that the chief appeal of rondisantis that he runs better against bidon in the swing states then trump does by every vailable pole but if bidon is running at forty percend well that un matter to much mean right now the spread on the bidin trump race it has them both in the low forties mean right now i'mean looking at the latest arsey pee pulling average has biding up point nine percentage points on trump and last four poles are trump pluss five bidin pluss tu trump pluss four bidin pluss for everything is within margin of error meanwhile the real cler poltics pulling average on bidin verse to sancis has biden up one point nine points in other words he is not running all that much ahead of trump in the general elect efforts right now because bidin is running low wht that means s that a lot re publicans are likely to think that trump can beat jobide does not actualy hurting him witht republican voters these indictments also it is hadd ing fuel to the firer because the fact is that prety much all re publicans included think that donald trump is being targeted onfairly over a lot of these cases that put aside his bad behaviors very obviou there is a double standard of justice here that is obviously being aplied and because of that it is likely to boost im in the primaries which is the reason he has incredibly durable numbers everbeady wright now is focasing in on rondissantisand to sanc is under per formance in the republican primaries thus far in the re publican primary pulling but the reality is that the story is not the sanc is under per for ming the story is trumps absolute dur ability in this pullin trump has not dropped in any significant way below a ten point lead for months and mnths and monts and right now his current lead on the rest of the field because remember to sandsainet te only competitor hehis lead on the rest ofthe field is thorty four points he is locked and loaded i mean tat duties just cruising to the nomination right now unless something changes and that thing is not going to be the invictments ironically the indictments help trump in the primaries now well e yet convicted i mean it is pretty obvious he could be mean shure he is got a man hattan gery in the alven brag case the flora case as i say before is pretty legally eiritite but there is double standard now in's up in the air we do not no its can happen is trump actually gin to be even ins i did not george if he is does that does that trial take place in fulton county jeorgia an atlanta 's i be very bad for him obviously is here ma another case on new jersey that we do not know what the actual out come of all of this is going to be wit that said is it likely to hurt trum politically inside their publican party really the answer is now because a lot of re publicans right now would rather basically used trump as thei're instrument of revenge and trump knows this again trump has in an errant skill ini this is his true instinctive skill trump has not an errant skill of knowing heas i get a really emotionally victeral connection to his base hehe knows that his people want him to be the revenge in in twenty sixteen he is a pulsating middle finger watl right now he he says i am your revenge i am your vengeance au now there may be bunch people in the country cur i dn't want be anybody's vengeance i got or not i do not i't want vengeance but i really wanted his good governends and you now may be some good policies but a increasingly in the united state i that that is a minority of people or at least it is a it is a silent majority and the silence makes a rather large difference in meanwhile again the double stander of justice is being very obviously applied because at the same it is that time that all of this pressure is been brought to bear own trump hunter bidon the deoca went out of its way mean truly went out of its way to try to cut a sweetheart teol with hunter there is just no question about this a mean much that as we discussed yesterdown the program hunter's plea bargain was lenient that the judgiin the case was are you ges youg willing to publicly say the plea bargain this way are oven in the geogers noh that is really what happen what apparently ha happend as i said yesterday is that prosecutors tried to hide they are blanket immunity claus in a crazy and on precedented tactic but they were exposed by the judge i did the bidin deoje tried to let hunter off the hook but they tried to do quietly in the actual publicly available plea bargain it said nothing about immunizing bidon hunter from all of these charges for an agent's registration ac violations or investigations into foreign forn cashing of chacks an allall f that kind of stuff was not included the plea bargain it was included in the agreement for diversion on the gun charge the idea was it said in the diversion agreement that tat's part of the diversion agreement he is imunized from the gun charges and anything else that was in vestigated in this plea bargain over here on the tax charges n na en the tas strargeges it did not say anything about that it just said he is a mun from the tax charges sat the judgers ll i i cannot i cannot do thatlic you repur to you do not even havenan agreement publicly on what it is that he is imunized from andth deojoes while this is kind of embarrassing we cannot be publicly exposed to be handing hunter biden goodies while his father is president of the united states ridgscan blow up the pleabargan and at that point hunter bidons attornees basically pulled out that that is the actual story here but be case this plea bargan was blown up by the judge now this gon to reopen a bunch of cans of worms for the bidon administration the bie white house a cerni star bedford investigate report for the washington examiner for example hunter bidon worked closely with multipl people who disclosed their lobbying for foreign compani's under the former agents registration act raising questions about whether he broke the law by not registering himself for doing the same work he lobbied youus officials alongs had many others who did not register under fara for that for workd tat clearly involved advocacy that would trigger far requirements the focus on hunter bdons the foreign lobbying grew more intents this week when a judgean delaware press prosecutors about whether they were still investigating the present and sun for a legeod faraviolations a dayin cort that ws supposed to mark the and of hunter bions legal troubles may have been the start of even more becase the judge rejected that plea and now the federal proskurs yat we may look into fara some of the individuals were actually working with but with hunter an advocating for berizma where a hunters being paid eighty three grand amonth to do nothing except have t e last n amd bidn ing call his daddi on the phone some times they registered their work hunder fara after protding from the justice department many ofthe people working directly with hunter and lobbeing on behalf a berizma were forced to register under the fara act one of the forein agents registration act and om the deoge force them todo that hunter to not an that that is kind of amazing an tat's pretty obviously a faravilation by hunter bidon bluestar strategies apparently was a a forment thots associated with berrizma twas underinvestigation by the deogeg why they were permited to file foreign lobbying disclogures years after the work took place rather than faces ponelties for their future their failure to do remains on clear sally painter and kern from ontono the bluestar strategies consultans whos

but the fardocmens painter an trom ontom tod inventually files to suggests specific meetings in contact in which hunter bidon was involved mat the deojases definition of foreign lobbying it is very obvious that presumably hunder should f registort is of for an agent and he did not and now he is exposed because again that do ja had to kill the steal it may very well be that there is more to drop

the media the white house there treating the hunter stuff it is not only nobig geol but they are offended if you aske questions about it to yesterday carrenson per world's worst white house pre secretary i she suggest tht hunter's or privateis and why are you ar why concerned with hunter a means how dary hunter is not a private citizen he is at the white house he is squired along on every trip by jobiden and again he has tacs to his own daughter talking about paying is dad he is bills come on come on how stupid do they think you are agan the answer is really really stupid here is creen jump here si this perportend is the personal matter this isan hunter ban as you knowis a private citizen and and this was done in an independent wave ti investigation is an being len crompapointed prosecutor u well i mean that that is that the clearly here is nothing to see here the whitehuse was asked about pardoning hunter an that i no no no you never do that no here is a thing whenever the white house onize are going to do a thing her's a seventy five percent shot tat venture f the lone op doing it the no las chance en yesteman a orsonal matter bo from presidenti r prospector is tere any possibility tat president wuld and a ar man i thum ner wi are not just then now i give an thed o case sho just answered there is it the no possibility oman is a little possibility is there not they thing a pledeal is gan hn at worked is is what this really means and meanwhile the media doing their best to make sure that no serious questions are sso ab s news enb s news they they are very worried about the geope folks on hunter again much re publican pouncing that is always the story the story is not the possible deepen abiding years long corrups ion between hunter and joe wiljofs vise pressident out the story here is much re publican pouncing they are purring in teir pouncing the color kittens over here it is a moment that is the colmination of a years long federal investigation a painful reminder of a dark chapter in the bidin family and the latest scene in a lorin national scandal the republicans promis is pal presidend bydand is continuing to therand by his sin he has repeatedly said that he his proud of an eventhang that e has tan nothing wrong republicands are making a clear they are not satisfied they are calling on the judge to block bat pladeal insisting they will continue on with their investigations intte claims that the prisid end has he us his political career to personally banefit and rich and protact his family republicans not ready to move on they are still aggressively pursuing and not vestigation into the younger bydis business practiceis the're not raht why cannot they just move on why cannot they move on well maybe because he is getting sweethart deals from his daddies deo jay after presumably fundling millians of dollars to the benefit of his dat may maybe it is that maybes that and besees andramichal to the same thing shefshy apologized to jobidons campaign coa chair criscoons for a mentioning hunter and tonal trumpin same sentens no we could never do that let us just be clear a what is about the condect of a former president ging office and the o ther a is about a private citizen the sot of the carrent president there is he star difference wen you as they correct and icho ata analatas thers ta things together in in my haste there is no question thatheyr very very different proportions they's no comparisot there is no comparison none therei's no coparison between donal trump post presidency misusing classified documents and tim just lhe killor clintonted by the way whill she secretary of state and t'm t n none n no similarity between that and hunter bidon years long corruption scheme with his daddy no similarity according to media just let it go y meanwhile again the republicans are trying to figure out who they need to run against jobito n right out donal trump is fareinaway the front runner but i have to say the the sume of the attacks on disantis at this point are truly srullis most scurrilous attack that were seeing right now is thi absurd and ridiculous attack on the florda educational standards hir's notion promelgate by comela harris on the rest of liers in the media that the florida educational standards talk about the wonders and greatness of slavery which they lie it is not true you will recall that the original criticism is that the florida state corriculem include standards that teach quote how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied for thei personal benefit which meant as is true that slaves tbeing incredibly risiliant and being very often people had to undergo severe harchily always severe hardchip that the use that opportunity to developed skills that could benefit them personally that is not a in upholding of the virtue of slaverats the opposite ca but comela haris then went out and lied about to my gouch there the're talking bout the magical benefits of slavery thereis only one problem here is what the a p african american studies official course framework says this year quote in addition to agricultural work in slaves people learn specialized trades and worked as painters carpenters tailors musicians and healers in the north and solf once for you african amaricans used these skills to provided for themselves and others that is the exact same thing the associate presses the exact same thing as the guide lines for the state of florida and yet rondistanscan ripped up and down over all this heres tesantis response to a reporter who try to come after him on this particular issue were there beneficial afects the slavery s not with the crriculents that what are you going with the corrict now it thes now it is not in the crrilem its very clear you hav i di't find to hundred a e gis of all kinds is no that you cannot read that av you rat it what you are an you read it what is you earn't ri avin europ in which you have it read its i'm just jus makin that clear that makes it very clear about the in just this sis tho slay re in thiy tid thetail any one that actually read that an then lis is the comalla wil now its hes line and that particular patation about the skills that wis ans pit otslay be not be has that the ad p course this mad that tay poi other course is that mad that tha poin nobody said any thiy i'm about that and dacor owin has people will say lut this is what wis use howst tolom when hes tos re doing stot that was very very clear and i would just say you no people cin can read it of course this sansis exactly red that is not stopping the lies from being promulgated this is why the congressional black hawk is is now pushing the whitehouse according to the ap if pushing white house the justice parment and the d o e to adopt an aggressive legal strategy to scrutinize recent changes to floortis black histry corriculem it is an absurdity at the very least you would expect that the same republicans were defensive of donald trump and his em and his classfi documents mis handling the mit be defensive of disantis when mee a lie about them the very least republicans should defend each other when they are being lied about by the media thi's wym very disappointmen tim scot today tim scott was to aske about this and he promptly sided with comela harris and he sided with the the congressional black hawk as heure is tim scot as wi tot yer don hwa en e in a ei ee e in oa es e tos ofe linean we e en il ieeeiin eo e e e eee e a e ene on e i iery o e ine o e i a oe i eins i i elin e o in eoo en e ein o aee ee e ee e rese ae iav tatings eee ee e en e e asstiin ane where by the lusi cas yor dikulis hm in that scoping disingenuous because he fully wol those what the st the story is with with floridas education greculam understand its presidentialrice but done it would it would be hoof republicans to actually at some point defend people were not actually doing the wrong thing mean it is particularly true the republicans should not by back in attacks onothe republicans on the basis of false racial nonsense especialy because agan democrats are doing that nog corry bush yesterday deside to shout at house majority whip steve scaleese suggesting openly yelling on the floor the stevescoleses bills are race is that it is such a joke i mean that the democrats plaing the race cind o literally every element is pathetic it is really bad if both sides will not we still will do that wore and are wit you old one more time to the gentalline be in order ti mean ridiculous stuffd there from corry bush but that is who she is meanwhile ohanomar an other member of the excrabl squad shecially whenc on a algzera to explain that americans should be afraid of white men the sh shs shes a member of the tolerant diver squad is is this terrible human being i would say our contrytions be more feful o of whiteman acros our contry because they are excelly t colthing mo of th thats within this country man she should be paying royalties to to vocal grined erythin in any case illhanomar doing this routine that we should be very fearful of whitemen amagine of the races reverse you would not have to exactly whoud happen sticistically speaking of course if she is talking about violent crime what she saing is not true but it is matter whether it is true or not she is very diverse person ansh speaking on algzeer which of course tis a place filled with diversity and and wonder and meanwhile we know have breaking news over from th face book files tho jim jordan has now revealed a bunch of documents that that've been discovered by congress about the whitehouse's activities vso v facebook according to the walstry journal facebook removed contents related to kpoa nineteen in response to pressure from the bide administration including post claiming the virus was man made according to internal comm company communications dewed by the walstr journal the emales show facebook executive discussed how they manage users posts about the origins of pandemic the administration was seeking to control nic clag company's president of globel affairs wrote quote can some one quickly remind me why we were removing rather than to moding or labeling claims the codi's man made and a he says we are under pressure from the aministration and others to do more the a facebook v p in charge of content policy we should not have done it that is in july twenty twenty one clag saying we sholdn't ave removed this content and another v p going yat we should not hove but the bine whitehouse wanted us to that emale and number of other such internal company communications were obtained by the judiciary committee which has been investigating what gio people'l makeer say is the bide administrations and proper efforts to censor american speech on social media about cove andother topics whitehouse says its discussions were aimed at promoting the adoption vaxines and other public helf goals whitehouse pressercts are comrechon pierra thans had we believe that social media companies have a critical responsibility to take accounts of the effects of their platform ye i know the sensorship i proxy that is exactly what this was the emales viewed by the walstry journal which had not ben previously reported thates of the spring an summer of twenty twenty one when thewhitehouse was putting explicit pressure on americans not only thetvaccinated but not to disseminate in formationthe whitehouse disagreed with apparently after jobidon said that facebook was killing people because of the quotincled false information they saw on face book the tongu lashion cause facebook to reevaluate its policies about covenineteen contents discussions then volved high level company officials including nic clag tand then seo osherrel sanber following the president's killing people comment the facebook v p circulated amemmo assessing the difference between facebook's content policies and the bid admnistrations demands the face book v pece e quot there is a likely gap between what the white house would us remove in wht we are comfortable removing as one example the executive listed the white houses desire the company take action against humorous or satirical content that suggested the vaxines are save the vice present wrote quote the white house has previously indicated it thinks humor should be removed if it is premised on the vaxine having side effects soe expect it would similarly wants e humor about vacing hasitanse removed clag then wrote i cancey markin a million years being comfortable with removing that i would not re commend it that is amazings the white house was literally writing to face but can be stop the jokes about tof actin no jokes joking will be forbidden ther'l be no joking about the regine amazing amazing amazing tupit again this is in fact a first men in violation when the government uses private companies as proxies to perform censership that is not that is a violation of the first menment pretty damned clearly ok time for a quick thing i and then some things that i hate sop things that i to day sthere is a good series on appletyv it is called highjack stars indres alba hofs excellent levetrssall been premuch eveything and a the entire series is about the high jacking of a passenger air craft a from the middle east to london and indersolv a place sort of a negotiator he sorter is the leed passenger on board whose attempting to to figure out what exactly is going on it is little more complex than it seems because and o spoil anything but dom ths some the high jackers have all turior motives which are not clear from the beginning it is well filmed it is very tents it it is pretty clever definitely an enjoyable series that that is worth watching if you have the time hig jack on apple t v worth the watch ok one more thing that i sop i hate it for the employese but i it for the fact that there has to be pushback and pushback has consequences apparently an his a bushes announce heu'd be laying off three hndred fifty corporit im ploes on thorst after months uppore sailes fueled by conservetors boy cotting budlight the firm said the layse toud effect less thn two per cent ot eighteen thouson im ploese would not effect blue coller workers warehouse staff and drivers in a statemen is medii reporting se yo bren and whitworth ex plain the companies leadership wuold never take these decisions lightly they are also resolve to insure our organization continues to be set for future long termi success all this has been driven by the fact that they decideed over budlight that a great way of markening to a bunch of blue coller white men was to markit a man pretending to be a woman during the enty doubli turnament sales have fallen thirty per cent twenty twenty three compared to the year before well done you right you the consumer good for you for demonstrating the havesome muscele and tht you will not be insulted this way really god stuff in fact if you are dulin malvania this plain you probably star threatening other companies that you might just spontaneously inorse the product breyway to shake down companies sin a secret check to dulin malvanies the dulimlvany does not in dorser product because if dolomulvanian dorses your prodoct you may get your products clockd by thirty per cents of its entire grow sales solid stuff there and again good jop for consert yu got pick examples got polorasa make examples of them this is sallinsky tact tic the lefts his musing literally for decades and if they refuse to stop using it than we also have to use at i mean the eally is no other choice ook ca time for a couple of quick things that i hate things that i hate to day just in amazing amazing seequens of events when be ninety year old senator dian finestein started launching into an unprompted speech who is called upon to boat it was a voice vote and dom she

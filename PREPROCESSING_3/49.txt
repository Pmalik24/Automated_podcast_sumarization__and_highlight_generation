the showsponser bexpressvepiansimd to stand up against mictak protect or day that express vepianticams lashmen there are two major problems with the notion of diversity equity and inclusion or d e i the first is the inherent descrimination in the consept the belief that all aspects of success are due to exploitation and discrimination this means that when applied to groups statistically under performing groups are to be considered victimized whether or not they are victims and to be treated with special privileges those who are members of statistically over achieving groups whether or not they are victimized are to be treated as villains the only possible exception to this hierarchi is white men whe are always to be treated as villains whether their group is under performing or over performing in any given situation this philosophy is how you get a holiday party for electeds of color thrown by ation boston mayor masshell woo apparently the selecteds of color party has been a thing for a decade in boston here was woo defending it members of the bostons tote concil receive an emale in the fison to what is call the gathering of electens of color not all members of the cocil fit that description i think we have we have had individual conversations with everyone people understand that it with truly just the an onithmithstake that when out in intyping the emal feeld and av i look for d to celebrating with everyon at the holiday partys that we will have teside to spineas while tho a it is my intension that we cand agand a be acity that lives our values and create space for all kinds of community for come together living your values requires segregated parties this th obviously discriminatory and wrong if there are white electeds only party of course that would be violativ of federal discrimination law but d i insist the you cannot be wrong long ys youre a member of the victim hood hierarchy that is the first problem tof t i its races then there is the second problem not disconnected with the first mediocrity if success is to be treated as sinful and failure as virtuous because victimhood is virtue then mediocrity is the happy mindle were ye can avoid being completely terrible af things but also escape censure for being actually good at them it is in academia where racially divers mediocrity is preferable to non raspased meretocratic achievement see for example harvard where president pliding gay despite apparently being both a serial platurist and a softon antisemitons leader is still in her job or see chicago where may or bransin johnson the even worse successor to lory lightfoot announced his plans this week to kill chicagoes high achieving selective in roman schools since they ware not racially tiverse enough chicago public schools see o pedromartinas has put forth a resolution seeking quot a transition away from privatization and admistions in roman policies and approaches that further stratification and inequity in c pis and drive student in roman away from neighborhood schools better that high achieving students be trapped nthe crappy local school then they be able to go to a better school mediocrity for every one and it is that the white house to where equity prevails above all now when the biton white house promise that equity would be at the hart of al they do they meant it which presumably is why doctor chil biden the greatest of all mediocrities he doc but sheis a doccardized the most doctoris doctor whoeverdoctor she invited the dorans dance company to perform a version of the nutcracker ballet at the whitehouse now ther's nothing wrong with the concepts here the nutcracker written by chakovsky is a famous christmas time at piece of culture an tap danse is a historically black american artform with a long and storyed how e would history many of not most of the greatest tapartis in history ave ben black americans from the nicholas brothers to bill bojangles robinson to greggory hinds in fact here is some tape of what truly amazing tap looks is the nicholas brothers from stormy weather in nineteen forty three r i go goint i ol opert e a bot itis the good stuff right here right o gate now of course most of the amazing stuff in america tap has been adopted by people of all cultures that is how you end up with gen cally and fretistair two of the great american artist of all time there is plenty of history and quality for he bidin white house to choose from in picking their christmas tap rootine well what the white house presented was not good tap was not terrible it was just can o weird and meh here is the tape the se canse and a weirdly attired om lady dancing down the halls of the hungry games white house there and then a meird guy won i lot o weird people dress in weird costins and everace kennin walking down the hlls and nothing's happening and a previ facas i no win anserious dancing you cainsee their feet liwhat nowhy this is but it is diverse of there is that an it is hovs an ot gled these people i'm sure a great dancer why cannot we actually see them dance taby good o gate why was doran sdancse picked to do this much mockrtin i'm not the only one who thoght it was met presumably it had something to do with the politics o the group mischelldorans founder of the group has dedicated the group to quotenquot anti racism here is what she wrote on her webside quote it is our job to tell the history of taptans as a celebration of black culture and also the never ending struggle against systematic racism and white supremacy in this country the origin story of appropriation in american culture in twenty twenty says michell dowrens i'm part of the way the story place out i'm a whites tap danswered with black cultural ancestors in a society that privileges white people in whiteness i am easy for white audiences wanting to access an experience elements of black culture to swallow as the americans or supremely opposed to black tapdansers which om no dorrence says the tapdant is quote both a tradition born up soversion revolution and protest and a powerful vehicle for social and political change and adds that is a beneficiary of white privilege i invite you to join me in life long anti braceis more understanding how deeply in bended white supremacy racesism and colonialism is in our culture is paramount to understanding ar roll as white people in perpetuating it and embracing our job to dismantl it or you culd just dance an dulic a good dance routine because here is the reality of a free country quality improves every one and everything all the black tap artis i mention before did more foratial comedy and black americans tan mashell dorrans ever will because they demonstrated to any one who would even idiotically think that race ought toto find somebody that incredible artistry spans raes transcends it but here is the thing when d e i is your goal mediocrity all too often is the result in just one second we will get to a

message who fox in his digital cacity confirmed he tore down the satanic display gwhich was erected last week by the satanic temple of iwa to represent the groups right to religious freedom casiy said is this extremely anti christian casity a previously run and un successful campaign for congress in twenty twenty two hed in elaborat and white twere the tatue dow bat e posted a bible v rus on thursday night to acts after being charged we sober be vigilan because you'r adversary the devil as t o roring lieand walkith about seeking whom heu may devour in a fasebook post the satanic templ of i will wrote that the display was cont beyond re pair the grouper we ask that for safety tvisitoris travel together and use the seven tenits as reminder for empathy and the knowledge that justice is being pursued the correct way through legal means hopy holidays hail satan the i a re publican governor can renalds condemnd th dis playce presence but yhou said it shuld be counter with more speech that many ilands i find the satanic temples display in the capisal capital absolutely objectionable in if free society the best response to objectionable speech is more speech i encourage all those of faith to join me today in praying over the capital and recognizing the ne tivity scene hey'l beyond display the true reason for the season the co founder of the satanic temple person in lucian graves had previously told local media that the displayed be up for two weeks quote were going a really relish the opportunity to pe represented in a public for him we do not have a church on ever street corner my feeling is if people do not our tisplayin public for a the n't hve to engage with them thereon't have to view them o case less talk about this first of all fur the guy who a who knock the head off the statue this actually is the wy you do public protest by the way is if you are actrigan o do this you then accept the consequence is for that thing ryt heu knock to ad off the statue than he turned himself ins the police unlike all tese morons you see who are blocking the freeway where than very very upset that they aregetting arrested but when it comes to civil disobedience which is what this is when you prt tus patan civil disobedience you then turn yourself in and that that is the way that it works as there is that then there is the question of whether he did anything cuonn what morally wrong in knocking down the statue now this is only mildly questionable the answer is the answeris no he dn't do anything morally wrong in knocking down the statue of ha satanic group i'm sorry he did not on a moral level you have no moral right to promote a non religion that is specifically directed at hatrid of christians that is exactly what this is now you may have a legal right to do that that is not the same thing is a moral right to do ithse are two different types of right we have all sorts of legal rights to do things tat are immoral in american societyes yo have to separate those two things off tbecause very often when we were talking about rights we ten to con plate them we ten to think somethng is legal there for its moral or it is moral therefor its legal not that is not the same thing it is legal to use the enward for example it is immoral to do you should not similarly it is not immoral two knock down a satanic statue it may be illegal to do because the law is supposed to protect private property can but that raises the question as to why the law does that you see cemrenalds there say that this protected speech that puting up a satanic display at the state tcapital sponsor by the state presumably is some form of freedom of speech and thow that really does require us to ask a specific question a question tht we have not asked in a long time this country which is what is a legitimate religion not all religions are actually religion satanism is a perfect example of a non religion is an ideology maskarating as a religion and if you view the satanic websihte they openly saye things we do not worship action we do not believe thre is a thing called satan is linguashin worshipping a godlike being known is that we do not believe in god it it really is is just a political agenda pretending that it is a religious agendus and pretend that this is religious speech is obviously not true in fact if you go back to the founding there is no way that the founding fathers under the ruberic of freedom of religion woul ave included any one who calls themselves a religion in fact the irest us this all the time thereare certain cult groups that tryd to declare themselves religion the iressle gling now you are not a religion do not believe you which means you do not have freedom of religion rights in the same way that say anativity scene at a capital building wood or conicamnora at a capital bilding wood again legally speaking this cen of bis our libertarian notion that is been picked up on by a lot of re publicans that is just an aspect of freedom of religin to were by satanic display at a state capital there is really not a lot of legal backing to support that idea asa good peace by lernang franktdiveto over the american conservative a few months back an which you talk specivically about this he has currently an atturny serving as council to napa legal institute and he writes about this he says tere is an uproar last week when a school district in mynec ofthe woud ave proved in after school satan club after proper casts in sued the school district ed the right thing and re considered deciding they should not approve a club for children sponsor by the satanic temple after all american conservatives have been shape by libertarian argument for absolute personal freedom the point has come where they wonder whether satanism is part of the tradition protected by the you as constitution something must be dones take back this obvious ground an he points out tht thereis very little case law on the specific issue of whether satanism is a protected religion what we do have is little bejumple but the point is that since the constitution is not to find religion the court then turns to case law for guidance but the early supreme court to find religion in traditionally theistic terms an other words believing in god not an atheistic antie christian non religion pretending to be a religion for purpos ays of puttng up a satanic display tnext toan ativity seene which is the purpose of what the satanic temple is doing here that is exactly the purpose of what the satnic temple is doing here the founders never would have considered this in aspect of reedom f religion not remotely in fact it was only in twenty nineteen that the iress even de clared that the satanic temple was a taxing tempt church tous under donall trunt by theway a point that rontoe santist was making we get to more on this in just at one secon first from antaining control of your assets to easing the burden on your loved ones in a

points out here it is not merely that the founders would never have considered a religion of satanism to be protected by the first amendment freedom of re ligion is notchost that it turns out that as pointed out an article at harvard lawe of you few years back the black letter rule in american law was clear constitutional liberty intailed to right tarticulate views on religion but e not even a right commit blasphemy the offenseive maliciously reviling god which encompass profane ridicule of christ those were com laws this were compatible with the free exercise religion they wer completely upheld as this lawyer points out troughout the nations history even into the twentieth century the federal courts have consistently upheld state anti blasphemy laws as constitutional there is no bining precenen stating that anti blasphemy laws un violate the first amendment and this is where what you claim is religion nactually matters exein if youlook t the church of satan websihte or the wiccapedia page it is not just the date reviole and ridicule crises they do not even beit it is not a religion it is not there is nothing there that says religion it is an anti christ political program that it mascerating as religion tagain we talked better on the sho before when you look at the satanic temple website they do not actually believe in satan i mean it because that would be to to believe in god in order to believe in in satan presume we have to belie in a supernatural they do not actually believe in any of that they say with unfortunate regularity the satanic temple is confused with an earli organization the church of satan the church of satan expresses vehement oppositions o the campaigns an activities of the satanic temple but what they actually say is that they they do not actually believe again in satan itshelf here is what these satanic temple itselfsizeson is pamphlic quote the satanic temple practices non theistic satanism we believe that religion can and should be divorced from superstition as such we do not believe in either god or the devil as supernatural forces we bow to no gods or gods or and celebrate our outsider status to embrace the name satan is to embrace rational inquiry remove from supernaturalism and archaic tradition ba superstitions the satanits should actively work to home critical thinking and exercise reasonable inquiry in all things our beliefs must be maliable tothe best current scientific under standings of the material world never the reverse what exactly is satan to the satanic temple quote satan is symbolic of the eternal rebel in opposition to arbitrary authority feder defending personal sovereignty even in the fate of in surmountable odd satan is in icon for the unbowed will of the relentless inquibrer the heretic who questions sacred laws and rejects all turannical impositions thes metaphorical construct provides as for the framework by which we live he is a symbol of defiance satanism does not suggest a supernatural solution to the trials of existence rather it serves as an affirmation of that which is demonstrabl be true ours is the historical satan of western literary traditions expressed in tax john milton's paradise lost first all thits complete mistry ust at tha supordi admissery to paradise lost john milton dos not satan yef to be a more on o believe this buton it os matter the bottomline is this ovis they not a church is non a religion is jus much secular ast wo are all what if we just slap a symbol on top of this thingand thn we put it up next to the ativity scenes that we can laugh t o jesus that is what this is all about and again it was not until twenty nineteen when the satanictemple is actually designated a church by the iras the group is now listed in an irastatobas for taxics and t organization what exactly was this satani statubehead in doing well i' mean obviously wis ween a historic piece of art it iswas not the taliban blowing up some giant buddhist statue from a mallennium ago it liku a statue they put together and then they put in the iyla statapital and ortomach people s the gynocker down and ow presumbly he is going to be put on trial and i assume that he will appeal on the basis of this i seem he is going to a peal onthe base of the is not actually a religion see can say that i owe them damages for property damage or some thing ad i'm willing to pay it and i can raise the money to pay for it but to pretend that this is it ectually i religious freedom display is to demean what it means to be religious which just precisely the purpos of this thing it is to demean what wlike they say we want it up next to the tivisin why why they wanted up next to the tivity sene sover jews we we do the connukia right we have te minora o the connicaminora we' bee displaying that since before christianity was even around on planet earth and we would be displaying that whether or not christians were displaying an ativity scene i's li gar all my gosh we ned a connkeea right up next to that i've never caerd whether my conukia is even in te remote proximity of nativity scene but the entire point of the satanictemple is to put their thing right nex to the nativity scene in order to moch christianity that is what it is all about inthe first place hopefully this thing gets to ju to get out love to see the supreme court actually take on a petty foreigng and interesting question as to weather it counts is a religion if you just creed n t anti christian thing and then call it a religion what exactly is satanism again the entire thing is oriented against christianity that is what is oriented against and they ake this very clear cosmopolitan just a month ago put forth a an insogrampost that is totally discussing a mean vile how does they satanic abortion ceremony even work they ask and's a picture of a woman staring into a shart of glass that is a mirror and here is what cosmopolton says is what is it t have a satanic abortion for jessica a thirty sevnural mother of three who received abortion medication the esamuel aledofs mam satanic clinic again the whole purpose of satanism is to simply insult religious people and apparently supremecort justices the experience was just very supportive whil she is not a satanist jussica decided to in corporate a few ceremonially a ceremonial elements into her lowabortion experience why not she thought the over all messaging just clicked with her read more about it at the link in the bio here is what it' has quot patience of all fates are welcome it samuel aledofs mom satanic abortion plynic an now mexico welon with medical council t s t offers free ceremonial upport to every one abortion ceremonies are totally optional and customizable here is a simple one t s t recommends es t is the satanic temple which is the same grup that put up this a satanic statue at the iowa state capital zo this entire post every single one of these postfreminstragram has an inverted cross ot the top it is a cross thit is upside down and the entire purpos here is to moch christianity the entire purpose that is not a religion that is just mockery of christianity now i can say it is free speech that 's not freedom of religion is not the same things are too different things freedom of practice of religion would require that the state capital include different religions in the tate capital according to current supreme cort law but this is not a religion it is just mockery inverted cross is as first find a quietspase bring a mirror if you can just before taking the medication gaz at your reflection in focus on your personhood home in on your intent your responsibility to you forsulshoud ponan on thsecondale youre responsibility you you are god your godtess in this scenario according to the satnic church ra gate forcus focs on your not the personhood of the baby growing inti do for you'r killing focus on your own personhood is you are the only person who matters next slide in verted cross take a few deep relaxing breaths when you are ready read the following tenet alowed one's body is inviolable subject to one's own will alone take the medication and immediately afterward reci quot beleefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world one should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs next slide upside down cross again later ones the procedure is complete ah that euphamism phrisecer is complete return to your reflection my god the self obsession here is totally wild but i gess this is what the religion of satanism is all about worship of self thet micents focus again on your personhood your power in making this decision complete the ritual by reciting a personal anformation and of course this is a mocery of catholic catechism by my body my blood by my will it is done am that is pretty i mea could it could possibly be more mocking of christianity i maint that that is obviously what it is that they are just mocking the eucharist right even i but a humble ignorant you understand tha i's mockery of the eucharist but that that that is precisely what it is this not a religion is just mockery quote mirrors or montras or not t s tes point is that your abortion should focus on your autonomy in making this decision patients can include as many loved ones as they or light candles or even dress up whatever makes them feel empowered this isin cosmopolitan magazine yet now is tis the church this even remotely resembling a church of course not as nothing to do with church zero zip zilch nata all it is is a bunch of sepuale secular left wing anti christian propaganda crammed in to a fake phony religion and thn youre pretendeto religion see can stick your garbage statue up next to an ativity scene it is obvious the christianity is a religion and satanism is not and the founding father s wit have felt the same way and he fact that many people have gone libertarian that they have given up theyre brain space for the stuff is ridiculous not all things that cleam to be religions are in fact religions not all behaviors are forms of speech the strong case you made tat burning a flag is not a form of speech if you want to say things you can say them that is alled speech burning things is conduct it aain failures to make any of these distinctions all of that has has led to this kan a mushy libertarianism in which we are all supposed to pretend that immorality is somehow morality it is led to the conflation also between a legal right as they said t the yey'r beginning and a moral right thos are not the same thing not the same thing whatsoever can just one second we will get to the latest on israel where it turns out that terrasts they really killing people who are

that com said that they want to kill people all over the world ayet it turns out that that is true it turns out that inter national terr organizations they are really bad and theyr lke killing people all over the world and tey to do number one becaus they are ideology temands that they spread the califit may comas has been very clear about this they do not just whish to kill jews for example inside israel they wish to killed yous outside of israel as well they are engoll would be a in as lomic califit no different then then what isis would want comas is not just have territorial claims their latest attempt to rerights they are charter for public facing distribution is obviously a back fil they do thisinbout twenty seventeen and now by the wy they are attempting hilariously enough to push themselves ins that palistine liberation organization as to quotuc moderate themselves by pretending that they are willing to accept the existence of the state of israel which of course they are not that is the reason why that is slaughtered people in the gaza envelope which as been part of the stae of israel since inception in any case they yesterday were uncovered commass terrer apparatus was discovered in europe german authorities on thirs they detain four alledged members of comas suspected of planning to attack tuitio institutions in the region the first suggestion the gosic conflict might be spilling over beyond the madleast what was that the first indication really because i notice the gossic conflict spilling over beyon themadeleast when hundreds of thousands of supporters of comas were marching in the streets of london that is that is what i noticed at first actually to be fair germany's federal prosecutors had one of the men acting under orders from comass leaders and weabonon had in the spring begun searching for a cash of weapons the organization had plandestinally assembled in the pass the weapons were to be brought to berlin until they could be used in a possible attack against juisih institutions in europe security official say the roup has long been active in europe but far they say it is been you aw mostly legistical basin source of financing rather than apossible terra target an october man identified as a lebonese born a ob delchomed al a and two accomplices an egyptian national and idutch national began traveling frumberland across the region to gather weapons assisted by a third man identified as a lebonese born terrast according to the germanant prosecutor the for a long standing cmass members but already participated in for an operations for the group sive a question why eren the in jail already it is get to wander round europe raising money for terror attacks as long as there israel in enjus an israel pretty amazing stuff meanwhile apparently at least seven terra suspects have actually been arrested in europes ane got the four that were rested by germany but danish agencies also exposed commass in for structure on european soil least three people were rested in denmark and one in the netherlands on suspicion of plotting to carry out in act of terror an that of course would not be a surprise the goal of these terro groups is to push the west to abandon its interest in themiddle east with terror ttax has been true since the araq warits been true before that sintrue really since the nineteen sixtyes nineteen seventys terris in the region used whatever leavers of power they have in order to try to intimidate the west into going hands off in this particular region of the world despite the fact that the west has tremendously hav the economic interest in this particular region of the world and also some moral interests in you no defending the only diverse democracy in the entire region meanwhile even as comass is is pushing terror attacks abroad the white house continues to send bizar signals to the israeilies let us be clear about this these rales are not going to stop until comass is completely defenistrated in the gasi strip it will end with israel having to station thirty forty thousand troups in the gosa strip in perpetuity an order policea that is what is going to happen and the reason tat's going to happen is gets coms is not just a terro group they have networks of terrasimtizers through out the gasistrip comass currently injoys a fifty seven fifty seven fifty two per cent approval approval rating in gaza which has been completely wrecktd because of comass and in fact the approval rating for comas in the west bank which is the place that supposed to be govern by the paliconian authority riht the vaunted p a the bidin white house wants to se in charge ofth gosistrip no one likes the p in the west bank in fact palistinians in thewes bank oure highly support of a omass the tune of eighty pluss per cent by every available bole ss notion that israel is s m how going to acquiesce to a quotinqual two state solution with the very people who perpetrated october seventh andtheir sympathizers that is insane not's even more insane is the idea that israel is going to hurry up in order to slow down israel is currently hurrying up operations in an attempt to comply with white house dictots which means more as rally soldiers are getng killed the number of his railly soldiers were gtting kille day on day is rising specifically because the white house is telling these railies to hurry up that is why israls having to rush its operations as opposed to going slower and meanwhile the stuff they could be doing to minamize their own deaths they have not been doing because again they do not want the bad headlines coming out of the gazas trip instead they are sending their own men and women into harms way going house by house in tunnell by tunnel as suppose to using their complete air superiority an areas that already should been clear of civilians two months ago none the less jake sullivan apparently told israel that their war needs to quote transicion to the next lower intensity face in a matter of weeks not monts hl i'm sure if he has a plan israels willing to hear it if he is got a magic lazer up in the sky maybe he could lend it to the jews mathat this kind of stupidity about war weree got jake sullivan dictating military time tables in the middle of an operation is totally crazy it is stupid it by the way it is dumb when american politicions do it o our own military we's to doin a rock an afgannistan regularly ut haberakomama sitting the top the american government doing things sure will surgean afgannistan but then theive an arbitrary dudline by which we have to pull back to searchan will announce it at the time meanwhile the military official what thuf how is this guna work it is truly incredible how many civilian officials seem to think that they can dictate magical time lines to a military that is on the ground fighting thas particularly tre when you'r talking about im military that is not under american control israel has that to own rather powerful military according to axioes national security adviser sullivan made clear in all meetings the high intensity conneticcampaign meeted to transition to the next lower intensity face in a matter of weeks not months this not a deadline we understand the campaign must and will con tinue but in thay lower intensity anotherwords what they want is less spectacular headlines by how many people are done tht's what they want lus for yit absolute learer israels kin to kill as many terrorists and people who remembers that terrin out work as they need to in order to insure teir future period and of story is ras no interest in killing civilians they are not interested in doing that commoss is hiding behind o in fact not only as commass hiding pinesvillions just to show what commases commoss apparently is literally taking dolls baby dolls and they are connecting them to taperquarters with recorded cries of children tand then connecting those to i e deeds when his rally soldiers go to try and save the doll they blow up is somethng the commoss is doing literally right now curby says it has to take as long meanwhile john curby over the national security advisery he said that sullivan asked hard questions about what the next face gen a look and he said it has to take as long as they feel in needs in order to eliminate this threat well want thes to be over a soon as possible the last thing we wanted to is telegraph to commass what the're gono face the next weeks and month wile that is a again kurby has been way better on this than jakesullevan an obama hold over with tremendously stupid ideas about how the middle east actually works meanwhile israel is gon to have to move up north ever bee noseing nav to move up north they are going to have to take on cas ballat in the north because the balla agan has two hundred thousand rockets pointed not only at the north o israel but all over israel israel has already move thirty thousand citizens off the borer they ben out of their homes for folon two months at this point what is truly amazing is to see the propagandists at work against israel with regard to the called two state solution let us be clear about this i mean itstruly mas they are people who very often i think to fine on cable to you do a decent joh on kabito be tey'll say things i wish israeld and the blockade n occupation of gosip israel ended the occupation of gosa in two thousand five the only reason they left a blockade in place is because camas took over and if they had not had a blockade commas wo had been shipping in nothing but weapon rea from turkey israel tried the whole two state solution thing by basically handing over the gossestrip two a terro group and they got october seventh and rocket attacks every five minutes their people in israel who left to live underground flike weeks at a time because of the rocket attacks meanwhile in the westbank israel tried for thirty years to hand over the westbanke tothe palsonian authority they had pieasteals that rejected in ninety four or two thousand two thousand one two thousand eight all of the piesteals walked away from by the palisonian authority an mewi of people who keep mouthing thse platitudes about the two state solution with whom with whom yesterday the israelli ambassador to the uca sippy hotutherly sho s asked by r por about the two state solution shes no by the way a proval for a cpuorncul two state slution ow among is releas seven per cent why doyou think that is why do yu think that is israillies have been tasiperatly attempting to hand control over palisonian arab areas two palisinan arab leadersiop for for deckades at this point and no one will take them no one the tordanians will not take them the egyptions will not take them palsonian leadership will not take them becaue they ould prefer to continue to promote the idead that they are going to destroy tell of yeven take it who exactly i'm consistently amaze by the idea that the media know what the af their talking about they do not they saye things two state solution is tot self manifestingly if you say it enough times beedle jusappears if you say two state solution often enough a moderate arab leader onwar allsot ought appears and magically makes pece or alternatively the palistonians are extremely pro terror by every available pole the thetworks of terror runnig incredibly deep the educational system in bot the westbank and the gosestrip promotes the murder of jews and does since the time the palisonian youngsters are incredibly young but if you say twostate solution apparently this makes you magically immune from criticism and it makes you moral person and if you say no two state solution because itso absolutely irrelevant and stupid to talk about a two state solution when when one of the parties to the quonical solution does not exist then of course you are bad this the ridiculous gameing see being played by the mediu yesterday on skinews here was the israilly e mbassador to the uka teis tele chan trotes ti i i think it is the ta tonfor t oll to relite the allsno poa da fail ten th tethen to october and we need to buill the new o i in order to nee ea ne one included the palestinians living in ta state of therein think that would innactated the biggest question is what type of pitethinians i dote thit it is what isra a reda they have evt tay ten the onte its obtonetely noon i'll tell you wy wo then the i teae nome no o te onsisen the reason there is no israel is because the pte tote with it without offering wat as that to palestine how an the bea piece isra knows to day an the woll should know now the wavin the oslaw corts fell is because the pote thingans never wanted to have a state next to israel they one cot te tate from the river toto the tu te connetion is then why are you upthest wet the formeo that never work that creat that thi's rotical people in the other thit why youfeft wit tha think about it this thot nomo to carry o wit the te notion the never war thin e pot the pte thing is kept on deny and now it is will create another tera state is wot is tot in totei of course she is correct of course she is correct by way jordan was in control of th west pank from nineteen forty eight to nineteen sixty seven and not once did they discuss the possibility of an independent palestonian state in the westbank egypt was in control of the gosistrip from nineteen forty eighto nineen sixty seven and no point did they discuss the possibility of an independent palestonian state why why is it there is no call for the arabs to do it why and the answer is cause everyone knew it would be a terror state immediately every one knew this where else in the world honest to god wellse in the world is there an open actual call for the creation of a state every one der whose would be a terror state it is totally insane it is totally nsane october seventh happens twelve hundred juser slaughter another two hundred forty are taken prisoner captive into te gossistrip and the world is what sort of concessions can you offer what te tis likes honesto god it is saing after nine eleven to the united states should not you help set up in all kitostate in in afganniston a mean after all they havesome grievances should not you help set up and all kit ostate not just ta talaban state nal kitastate wike specifically four those people should't you d that what what sort of concessions can you offer them only israels demanded this sort of nonsense the twustate solution was idio sye from the time it was initiated by osloe it was stupidity it was put forth by people shimmon paras whos completely delusionold about the way the world actually works he was actully believer at the time that borders would disappear in the theleast he was a believer in theidea t thre would be a giant confederation of jews and arabs in the middle east that would be completely peaceful because economics would overtake everything else yet that worked how is great again it mauthing delusional notion about how the world works does not manifest the delusional notions it just gets people killd thats what israel found out between oslo and october seventh and now they are done what that and they should be done with that and people continued its sade dum crap two state solution without any leadership on the others israel would give he westbank to jordan to day and then wold e up to jordan to crate palisinian state you think jornwould do it jornwenyman take it gorn mont take it israel has offered the gosistrip to the egyptians over and over the egyptians will not take it now just think about that for a second think nout crazy that is the egyptians could take it and then they could set up a palistinian state they do not want it because they would not allow a palistinian state to be set up there there'ld be presumably engaging in exactly the same activities that israels engaging an right now in fact there is reason why egypt wont to low anybody from the gosistrip through their border it is not because they want the historic land claims of the palistinians in the gosis strip to be maintained is reles inen care whether palistinians live there there is no actual jewish claim to te goi strip in any serious measure he go act to biblical times the gosistrip was never considered a part o biblical israel even there is never been a massive settling movement for example in the gozistrip there is som in the north of of the gosistrip and that was about it the guchkatif that is it the guch kati fregion there were some people living there but it was never as though the gosis strip was ever conterlicis very fundamental part of the biblical land of israel hebit the bottom bottom line is israel evacuated it a if egypt if israel handed over to egypt and eagop wanto cret apalstinans that it happen nothing the reason th egyptians while at thepalisinians in to the sign i desert is not because they are deeply worried about palistinian rights in gibalia it is because they are worried about palistinian people who are raticalized inside teir own borers they do not want them nain just one second we will get to the latest from campus whereagain antisematism a continues to be a major issue first for most home oners window replacement is

saven one of the people i know pretty well over there is at rabbit herschy's arke he is the cabad rabbi over at at harvard i known rabbit is arka for as i say ni on twenty years at this point a is arke is not a particularly political actor at all he tries to stay strenuously a political that is what cabad by the way tends to do wherever they are because cabadsan tirgoal is simply to bring jews into more religious practice which is why you will be walking round city street an you will see cabod rabbi with par ofs fillin with flactories offering to jews telp them wrapped fillling that is what they do but hershy's arke here rain from a cloudin gay he says the thing he points out that at harvard when they put up their gimanora and again tht's wha cabad does prety much everywhody and go to

pulling in seven keyswing states boats poorly for preside en by an indicating he trails donall trumpet every single one and with scoson he is down four two trump forty five forty one in georgia he is down six in michingan he is down four in pennsylvany he is down two in nevata he is down three in north carolina he is down nine these are terrable numbers for jobidon in arizona he is down for very very bad numbers for jobide because again all of the focus right now is on jobite now the bind administration is hoping that the federal reserve is going t save yobide that by bringing down the inflation rate they are gong o be able to basically bring down the interest rates several times next year loosening up the economy and leading to a feeling of prosperity in the united states curren schon pierre shous tat yesterday saying that by nomics his working because the stock market is at record hives look at it relieve te binomic the present icus tanowt at the top of the briefing he is gonaco of the walking he is gon to talk about by nema by nomic tan estting in america what what by nomic has done but the american people coming out of the pandemin w cannot preget what happen when the present walk an we saw a bittily on the econnomy at a tails ben and the data shows as you just mention in your question inplation is moderating in you see a jobs created at more than porteen million jobs on employment is tat under for per cent all of those things is pite is arte by nomic and you will certainly hear the present talk more about that it well the president can talk about it however much he wans the bottom line is that consumers right now are still spending because again they have that inflated money in their pocket they realized that the inflation is cooked into the books i takes ale while for people to realized the inflation has actually moderated e specially when inflation is still running at three pluss per cent as oppose to two per cent which was the fads tar get rate the real problem here is that when you look at things the stock market corporat earnings are not actually keeping up with the stock market ray now people are invested in the stock market very hirates because the currency is inflated when the currency is in flated you stop investign bonds n yeu start investing in stocks whell now it appears that the bon prices are going up tbecause were not can be raising interest rates any time in the near future sobon prices are going up this has also created feeling of economic helth in the stock market people pouring money into te stock market the problem is then the stock market the p e ratios are really really high those be the price equity ratia the price earning's ratios those price earning's ratioes are really really highso benjamin ground the famed in vestor who is sort of the inslectual god father of worn buffet he sought price buarning's ratioes around fifteen tine that the price of the company should be a multipole of its earningis by about fifteen but no higher than that well right now the called magnificent seven which are the companyes tht aure basically driving all of the growth in the stock market are a huge per centage of the growth in the stock market these would be companyis nevidia apple amazon alphabet meta microsof testla those companies are up around seventy per cent year t date if you took them out of the escipy five hundred the index would be up round six per cent as oppose to the i popping gains that your seeing in the broader stock market indicease the essen't pe five hundred is ot more than twenty one per cent far this year if you took out those seven companies it is up six per cent and the p ratioes on those companies is fifty five zuro at's not sustainable in the long run p eratios of fifty that is betting very heavily those companies ere can beable to ramp up their earnings obviously ves are ot able to ramp up the zearnings than the pricing mechanism is way out of wack the suggestion would be theoretically that when the inflation stops that the stock market will continue iitl hold stable the moneyofll be worth more people will ascentially hold stable their stocks there not goings divas because wliges taken money out of a a stock market that is done pretty well but stocks are over price is the reason my warn buffet is selling stocks right now and again in flation is not totally been conquered but the real problem here is going t be economic stagnation i've time out gross output as a statistic for quite a while her gross output does not just measurer spending at the last layer of the economy which includes in enormous mount a government spending incluses business start up in vestment and that is down the first couple quarters of twenty twenty three has been down nine per cent grosse gross outwet yer i we heventeen a cue three stat yet on that i cannot imagine is can be very strong business starts i mean if yit it is you are in business you feel it also i now if you arein business this is not a boom time nobody really thinks this is a boomtime outside of a few quar companies meanwhile now as jobidon continues to fade in the poles the really bad news for the bidad

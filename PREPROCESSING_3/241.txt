a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in to day's episode of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our website this american life doutowork coupble years ago michael wrote a book about miryl street then it did fine good reviews it the best seller less for couple weeks and mi cold did something that i gess is a normal thing to do if you' worked on anything for a year and a half cluding a book i what occasionally check it is raitings on amazon but occasionally i mean all the tine and i would say most of them were reat the lot of people really liked the book a right now has almost three hundred customer raidings on amazon i let just look at up a young entronet than yes i have two hundred ninety five customer raidings forty six per cent of them are five star radings twenty three per cent are four star ratings that is two thirds of people who raited it loved it right that is nice but wich thos other people the eight per cent who gave h one star the nine per cent who gave him two stars those wore the people he found himself getting stuck on i have to say i i'm not proud of any of this im not proud of talking bout thas i wish i was the kind of person who just floated in a cloud above my amazon raitdings but i'm not i means some of that some of the things that people of an amazon just kind of cut to the bone in this way is some mouch just as boring a book a book critic is not going to say boring but if an average customer goes on amazon says this book is boring boring boring one star i think is worse than as csor smart book critic explaining why something dinterdid not work boring lant hated it no thereis one that just at no and it just makes you feel terrible i would i would check my amazons were an unhealthy number of times a and sometimes before i went to bed which is really bad idea is then you would just drift off to sleep arguing with these people in your head but then michael stumbled on to this strategy something he could do to deal with those feelings this just happened i was just spending too much time thinking about who these people were and at some point i just clicked on one of their names it onet of people who who hated your book ye and that brought me to everything else they had reviewed on amazon and i realize that when you do that you see what they liked and once i saw what some of these people loved on amazon it completely neutralized them i lit tho though some of the one that you saw o cathy gave me two stars she says disappointing too much detail about people other than maril street and not enough about maryl herself what did cathy a a cupcake stand that comes in lavender with pocadots five stars and she just writes perfect what is to sav you that she has a that she has enough cupcakes that she needs to arrange them on a cupcake stand in pocadots and that makes her happy you kdo not my book cannot speak to that sort of u i let me let each other perfection to cathy is this cupcake stand filled with cucakes from pocadots and my book did not give her that same feeling and that is socet th reader had given one star a said about his book a lat o words but not interesting give five stayes to bright rad yarn the person whor gave him the on word review ouno gave five stars and a rave too a tin cazoo e person who said boring boring boring and also the author is consumed with his lofty vocabulary that the reader falls asleep give a ravery view to a book predicting the end of the world by twenty fifteen woman ame wendy give one star telling potential readers to move on what did she love ok as te windy gave five stars two an amazon dot com e gift card which struck me as not why is anyone rating amazon gift cards on amazon it is to saying yes this twenty dollar bill iis worth twenty dollars why rate this thing this thing could not possibly be good or bad a ah a o o a eve you done the flip side of this have you looked up the people who loved your book to see what else they love no i do not want to know anything more about them their angels will we have done that let me read some of them to you ah this is woman who gave you five out o five stars interesting she says this book was well written in very interesting maryl's life has been full of interesting people in experiences and i enjeri learning more about her she also loved five out five stars the game of nomes garden nome throne for the throne room cracks me up every time i look at it as in my bathroom where my throne is and here is a picture of the gnome ye thatis that is nome ye she puss us in her bathroom it is in my bathrom her mith she keeps this nome in her bathroom and she gave it five oud ef five stars and she also loved my book i see whith you are saying it it does not it is not grat if you do it the other way around oqet one more this person five out o five stars se chronicles hor relationships on stagean off giving us a cleer unique portrait of a professional a also bought not one not two but three amazon gift cards yes tha wishe rate the she rated on five out of five stars do not tell me this she is one of the amazon gift cared people just by something by something that you a cup cake stand anything get a real thing and rate that i'm starge why the way michael sees it the fact that every single thing on amazon every gift card gardenome every ligt bol ben you as bee corrd and mop i's measured against every book every classic film against every bit of journalism an fiction against the bible in the coran and the bogovod gdeta all on the same five point scale it is perverse those things are different and of course these kinds of re views are everywhere i mean the way the world is now there is just constant feet back about everything when you take an uber your ask to rate the uberdriver meane were just constantly leaving stars for thing is leaving custome reviews that there is yelp every one is constantly assessing everything that is true everything here for example is a review of the great wall of china one star too crowded too much climbing miss the greatness of it threat was a lot of steep climbing time the parthanot one star it us the big bunch of colums that lack artistic tace the statue of liberty one star imagine a combination of prison and the worst irrport security if you want a feel embarrassed to be in american then you can find it here the aushwits concentration camp in pollen one star total disgrace therre no places to rest in reflect fon peace surely a sight the widness one of the largest mass murders in history deserves some space for reflection fallwing apar and not well maintain a fo bybe easy chicago it se this american life from our glass today in our programme in this world were now every one is a critic we visit places where reviews really should not be happening and the story of somebody who very much does not want o wever review and someone else igots to say no to all the reviewers and heaters of the most hated and worst reviewed thing made this past year and what that is tay with us i gin their eyes were not watching god for some things it jus reels wrong when they reviewed and i now just read you a bunch that but on her one more i know i do i get this whene is wor the national park at gettysburg one o the pivital battle grounds in the civil war one from my ammy give three stars and wrote quote i guess it is a little moving when you think about freedom andall that stuff but really it is a field self i nother think it feel strange to review or read reviews of churches one of our contributors b a parker or in this recently i had not been to church any church and over a year and i'd lost myself i was miserable a career was struggling relationships restrained little by little i could see myself fading and going to new church felt a last resort one of my room mate suggested a church that she ha been casually attending down the street first corrent the an baptistchurch the first sunday i went i noticed the line half a block long mostly of wlike people and cargo shorts waiting patiently behind a rot olde black man with church fliers in his hand could see i was confused he waved me to ward the front door and greeted me as if he were god's bouncer it is a big place an old movin theatr bout two thousand seats marble floors ushers chandeliers i walked down the crowded isles and interdupt sitting next to an elderly woman dressed in her sunday bast with this broad brimmed regal had she mined me of my great ant louise when i slid into the pew she hugged me i then realized how much i needed that hug until my eyes stared to cheer up sis s its the service began with guided meditation and ended with communion and the choiers singing franky bevelyan mazes happy feels seveny's arm b with the blood of christ i thought secular music losks of young black people ia paster and genes i found my owns there was only one problem above me and the far back of the balcony were toros the white people in line from outside hundreds of them snapping selties and gocking hovering gaggle of anthopologis studying black baptists in the natural hapitet every expression of worship every teer i shed every hug i gave every arm i outstretched to god i felt thik i was on display for them i felt expose they were baptisms some of the devout being baptized a overcome great odds whot in particular got the holy spirit and sopped in the pool something unnamed and sacred had led them to that moment and all i could think about with the white people upstairs taking pictures of some one's life altering spiritual journey they could cheer them over brunch is really messing with my worship white toris vis itting black churches is a thing especially at harland showing up for free music it was my first time hearing about it but i had never experienced it before sure there were some white congregants sprinkle throughout downstairs but they are members for lacktabeter phrase they are vited to the cook out the chorst in the balcony it jus want a song i kept going to the church every sunday but i thouht i was unwillingly partiscipating and ther gospel concert i struggled to focus somewhat matter to me most my own relationship with the big eye upstairs i was navigating all that my learned about the reviews thorest critique the church wene line it mi views on websides yell band trip adviser some were fine seem i love the experience and thanked the church for welcoming outsiders others were not nice qote the music was loud repetitive and vacuas churchis to elevate us to god dnot bring him to human levelng two stars from france this is a scam the children singing our circus animals one star from italy do not choose this place if you are expecting the gospel style of sister at one star and this one tis meant to be a compliment that i bristle from spain i will definitely repeat this experience if i go back to new york do not be afraid to go to harland win your own the lot of white people lived there four stars our worship was being grated on a gentrified curves i got angry i do not the torist but i do love the church it has the familiarity and the warmth that i grew up with but none of the conservative and tolerant baggage the kind that is hesitant to let women on deacon boardds and had strict dress coats my old church was more insolar more of an old school black back to space bik if you saw a white person during service tat required a whole quizzical discussion in the car wried home were they lost they some ones special friend f c b c had none of that and i found it liberatings kept going to the church as gon to make the best of it but it was not easy h one reacent sunday at church engrossed in a fiftemente oredition of the blood will never lose its power i swaye to the song it meditatively mout the words with te chir over and over again i was losing myself and feeling god's presence but out of the corner of my eye i noticed it the glowing of phones in the dark the old european man with tha selthy stic the back pack leadin torist sstepping out before the sermon three or four at a time wewe we nwo iiiii wo y an o iwo o o behug the visitors as the church instructs us to do during the welcome and immediately afterwards over forty five tours up and walked out before the sermon had even begun all i could think was the audacity ruined listen to the sermons i felt torn and distracted by the torrist at have to be there at all why do i care much i asked thog the congragance of having te tourist there ever made them feel uncomfortable if they thought it was a bit odd they ever got self conscious if it was only me one thought the tourist for fabulous i nother said they did not think about it when woman said mi not wanting them there was blasphenes yet seems it was only me it was confusing yes i do not want the tourist there but what kind of christian a i to behaving when people doring a church curvise went to thehad of the church my pastor pastor mike walren to ask why these tourist here why we likng tis happen and how mi suppose to deal with it and see passed it why do you want the torist it i doft know s anything bot wanting torist we welcome everyone i do not i do not nes say whi want this these people her i want those people wherever comes i selebrate and we open i know that church is that an say did they when allow toris or when they do make the toris pay it once on money the come in they will take the money riht but for us i think every one hereis a tourist and lit i sel you i know the power the word and how the word can spread and how people can take what they here here and it gos places your words well go to places it she will never go and thats always look at it it is a opportunity to spread this word an to get the message olby the doing and expand and brougden our reage and sometimes of people who expan and brought our reage happene t be tourist pas to mike also said my sensitivity about the tourist though he understands it its generationally different than the older black congragants who perceive the otects of having essentially a section for white people and a more i rodic way that i do the see ot touris wo dount le white in abaltcony caule they kno histrn nop to know it us different cause historipy was flipped whatl that was the practise country for years after americans has sitten baltcny coand not worship with white people because after americans relegated abalcony ad could not engage worse your experience he knows the tourist or not what everyone ants but what paske to mike wants me to know that the tourist are't just in the balcony and there are not just white e says the balcony is for large groups of visitors and it just happene to be european he insists the largest number of tourists in the church are not white they are black they blenden sitting down the mainfloor with all of us they puts i back to me is my problem with tourist or with white torist it is white tourist he tells me do not be prejudise it is wrong and we start looking at people and to our spaces of worship and because tis stranges treating them and because the obviously stranges because of the racial dimension then we undemy ourselves as followers of the teacings of jesus and as people call ourselves christiane and i know that but i cannot stop feeling expose it looks the way it looks white people staring down on us praising god the obtects are all wrong is ti guess cause i feel i certain protectiveness because of the shared experience that we have as black people i to protectiveness o you we are intoxicated by perceptions an image and obtects and obtects communicate no substance the question is not what appears questions do i cere i question quite answers no i cannot be consume with people's perceptions of our space because they not be trying at could tell we do to to respond of people's perceptions i that is not who we call to be i cannot the obtects of it me nothing to me pastto mi k knows what hit looks making white people sit in ha sectioned off aria he knows is provocketed he is fine with it is not intended to be punishment but that does not answer my question how do i black them out when i worship mi worship i engage god i could car whoas a one person what two thousand i do not care whose present is about me in that moment's sacreds space i doing the presen others wo as celebrated god but that is the sacred moment for me and my sacred moment can not be intruded pon my any body tors on not eras ter mikes words helped a little i'm aspiring to a new level of clarity in my worship well his but i'm still working on myself i'm not there yet i slittle on people there staring at us were all some source of entertainment for them but going forward i what a try to do what i can to get the tourists out of my mind and out of my way starting with this review of f c b c from me parker from baltimor whit' f c b c on sunday and then kept coming back hoply when i really needed it and if you re a torist reading this and wonder what the black congregants thinkin hou taking photos during baptisms and baby christenings after one do not love it please stop hi'll make a great church better five stars be a parker in new york if you go go the first crinthian baptist church itt'll take hou to the websighte f c b c and why c with their vidios of sermons a ge speakers and alsorts of other stuff think we are not going to gi ve their address mi i n i i i i i n coming up a story bat somebody who is studiously trying not to give a review think it is not too much to say that his very freedom depends on that that is an a minute from cicago pubigradio when er program continues tis maricin life myra glass tadspergram everyone is a critic tals from a world where everything gets rated and reviewed we'varrived dedact to of our show at two mister chan goes to woohon sotcs next ter is but somebody whos studiously trying not to be a critic cause of where he lives and what he is doing is name his chan shows sure and he gives in china i's been going around that country to the most controversio places he places that or the most sensitive as far as the chine's government is concerned including the city ot the center of the crone of iris epidemic chen shows up looks around gathers in formation and post vidios on line with the truth of what he is found which is risky because china of course is in authoritarian country with tiht grip on in formation an total control over the medio government's version of realities which reported in newspapers on t v and o wine inside china's hard to get fareign new sources which is why when chen does all this he tries very hard not to be a critic not to venture an opinion reported chy young fan has been watching is vidios with fascination for a while now i've been writing about china for years i'm from there i neve never seen anyone chen thisca was not a professional reporter or political activis as far as i know he was just a guyde from the mainland who read about the hon con protests an the state papers a wondered is that the whole story what is really happening and went to see for himself we shall ce at i cento tutyfi shuchi i shi cu unein the sh shal in this idea shot on the water front and hon con hes saying i want to see with my naked eye with happening on the ground i want a bar witness to the stories of the people on the ground chens a talent to talker a thirdy something gid with very expressive eyebrows hes running all ver the city in a yellow pressfast he bought after he saw on line that reporters wore them at protest he is a lawyer who was into public speaking a couple yoars back he was in a reality tethese speech competition kind of the voice for nerves that was his first brush with being a public person his vidio sort of feel an extension of fas speech competition hestead of talking and explaining things on a stage he is doling it out in the world a a i o o i o e o hi o i i a e in honcong chens coverage is painstakingly neutral he goes to a prodemocracy protest and also to a probating grally at both he tries to estimate the crowd size and the age of th artisipence he spends one vidiou explaining subtle differences becween factions of the movement hei no point tis he hint in his own political stanse in fact he emphasizes that he will not take asde which al locsy the peniety in the fonsa he bic he yelldar donle the tiple that ple that was a condoly tip se' saying i will try my best to put my prejudice aside and stay neutral about what i see this neutrality thing is im portant because a cross china most people support where at least go along with the party theres scepticle of people who defy the government those people are seen as trouble mak cers in discidence thee regarded with suspicion and their ideas are easily dismissed chen did not want to be dismissed but what is more he did not act a disstant he coes a state new spaper as in spiration for his trip and declares his loyalty to china watching him he seemed genuinely curious about the thiengs he was witnessing and completely sincere you dre gentural li on eawi yeg it cesinin hoin shan comecolin the word his vidios from hong con reached hundreds of thousands of people on waybor the chinese fersion of toer as soon as i saw them i wanted to talk to hi though i was not sure how hard he would be to reach hecause his last vity hin that he might be in trouble an that by our our abou a che englol with a salloty cope lot noty without it is not from the air part in it he says the chinese far association the public security bureau and the ministry of justice have all called him telling him to come back and stoppd his nonsense at one point he holds up his law license saying he knows he may very well lose it after these three days in hon cong once he got home all his social mediae ccounts were deleded and his vidios were purched from the chinese internete but he was not hard to reach when i got his number picked up right away he was little fluster he explained he was in the middle of a family situation heis mom found out about his reporting adventure from a cousin's classmade freekd out and travelled hundreds of miles to restorsetact and moved in with him he was funny abaut i ont tat dot put a i i in way a a o aa not alo parkin ta even tivin the other tur ofer

would lose the very will to live ye i helli in ye you oone wi yoe ythe hardest thing to deal with and itis the effects and my family an enough once that is what pulled cham back from hs trippd hon kon not because he was worried for himself btut because of the risk of a complicating other people's lives chenne was safe he told me but he would been let go from his law firm and he had been interrogated repeatedly on the day he arrived back from hon on he would been grilled for eight hours straight he had to run through every deetail of where he was in sfay o wa then they took me to reeducation on policies of the commonest party the government has a certain prespect on a hong con i they said because i was a lawyer i should support the commin is party inis decisions and a chan go against him chin go to certain places and and on then the tried another takco then they took gon a a very parental ton a they said we are doing this because we care about you o o owiaa aw your young geye with the breatcincer had a veuyou fonce omly speech in th bat prizes when you were young you'v appeardan some netevy shows you have posted such great content and vitious social mea we think youre

you are over thirty and you have not married yet your parents must be anxious people ly to prioritized families you need to start a family and have kids that is the only way to have a normal life it do not let your parents worry you need to hurry up and get that stray now ai sofor a full day from nine in the morning to fiv mo mon who war juspeek be that they were using different tactics that to trying to tell me why going to honkong was wrong te the but chen was in that troubled by the questioning he would been scrupulously neutrol when he was in hong kong and he believed that would protect him and things would not get worse than this yet yo e at waitme eed a wa a oa yo yo i yet i think it is beas i work hard to be neutrol and to not support or lean towards one side of the other that that i was able to stay say hall yet a wic much fo do you will sean a fom that about to a fons yet i asked him the question tha had been on my mind all this kive why did he do it wil he i it it is just a passion an sometimes he pill say o thos brave if you you for much in the pursuit of truth i hat that this has nothing to do with bravery yeiits it is just a hobby i mean you have guyes out there who watches you have gies who to fix up the cars we to highcer to skee wa this is my hobby my hobby is engaging lith in pursuing the news it is just something i'm interested in har an i can almost see him troggin on other side of the line chenches himself as a curious guy collecting facts he is not out to issue any countryview he is not trying to provoke or antagonise the way he talks about his vidios it is there an intellectual exercise more than anything else i'm surprised by how blasay he is about the project hiven the cost to his recular life i wonder if there is more to it if is composure is a kind of armor the wond thing he can control n yealar yousor since i shul yar by a santer by no shindle wats at hig highold o a a few months later and late canuaary i do a double take

is happened to him i suspect what would pancin the most i's the sigde of his mother looking xausted and afraid on vidio pleading for his return taong fan she is staffri wit atree must love cats in anaway it was comforting that in these dark and device of times there was one thing that a fractioned america could agree on this past year the movy cats bast on the enderloyd we wer musical what everybody agreed was that was trash friedy called it quote i haf digested haraball of amoty quiter said it quote always feels its two seconds away from turning into a fure orgy and a dumbster one of the producers on our programme wenin besee ses foud one of the very few people who felt differently than every living review are everywhere somebody love the film which actually can became a problem in her house uslon one of the many problems with cats it does not really have a plot but do e g dicson it all makes perfect sense a bunch of cats known as jelical cats are auditioning to be the cats selected in sort of this cultic ritual a to ascend to the heavy side layer and be reborn and thie show is just cats auditioning one after the other to be the one selected they adition to die am is basically what they do everything about the film that alienated people the werd s g i the clumsy writing the bazaar cuoriography jason to ruleau none of it alienates eh ay which honestly does not surprise me i've no nee da for years she is reporter at rolling stone she is always struck me as doged some one who perpetually bears witness to the things other people do not really want o take seriously things that are widely misunderstood or ar re understood differently i always want a know what is the other story here with cats it was very obvious from a second that i saw it this is goen o be everybodys in a call us the wirsom the ever made but it is also just this very earnest this this sort of very simple earnest story about the importance of inclusion ripe the cats learet a lesson about inclusion left that out do you think you are being a contrarian now i'm telling you it is the same reason why musicals in general because it is a way for made a sort of access the parts of myself that are in sort of coted and cynicism and z are an automatically sceptical of everything in questioning everything gum it is just it is one of the ways that i can sort of experience the most earnest parts of myself i guess and when she saw cats that is how she responded to it earnestly she could not get it out of her hat the day after i saw cats my iye my husband was taking a shower and i wen n and i was i just need to talk to you about this sory wile he is in the shoer you going to the bather mister tagma cats yes i mean i was just talking at ham about cats i was just and then visit with as e d i lookd and heare is what old ronomyes id an old my god they had they had even mc callon lacking up milk and i the end judy denc breaks the fourth wall and she says that cats is not a dog and i just need to tell you tust because i do not know how to make sensiv it how often were you talking about it constantly constantly how often wis she talking about it every day alot of the time this is eahda's has band alec he looks grad caneer and the moves regracanearis the good guy also he looks really tired but he is kind we we after the first day or to it just it became clear that this was in new obsession and it was here to say an honded but make you feel i sorry for myself what are the kinds of things that she talks to about when she talks about wit this movy things about the producers that i can even remember how much money andrew lord weber madan how much more wealthy is the palmacartny which conof astounded me is thit the kind thing wer you in medilyg you do not care about any of this yes yes but was there apperiod of time where you were humoring her elfrshir it would definitely try to change the topic play any other music that i could think of play other music because eday started playing the film sound track for the only other member of the family their son solomon the three year old and solomon love deat loved in immediately and how often do you guys listen to it almost every day alec basitly went from living a life blissfully free of cats to living in in all cats house hold all the time he will just come up to me an say dand i want jelical cats

partner she went somewhere else she announce then you plan in a tweet welt my husband could not listen to me talking about it any more i'm doing a pod cats about the movy musical cats it is called pod cats are you blind when you areborn can you see in the dark which ichico hoses it with her friendman can you say of your bife that it is porst in your bark if you were and you are with a targed audience for pot cats wore its pretty yet it is ckind of deeple embarrassing that people wite i gan a listen to the pod cats an be who is this woman when you say pod casteeming this american life both i primarily pod cats pod cats the pod cats we are also going to answer all of your burning questions about including but not limited to what is a jelical catwhat a jelical cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats ctis it true that you told each day that cats as ruining your life bui've probably said that we gets little time to ourselves now we have a three year old and we both work crazy hours this is the way that you choose to spend your free time bu going to see cats and in making a pog cast abut it ike how can you make that your free time alex as he wont to talk to his wife about thi thing that she leves which i gat except for one thing he is passsing all this judgment but he is never actually seen the movy i set it up for all three of us to go see cats at the one theatre within two hundred and thirty four miles that still playing it i silent we get to the theatre just after nine and takes three seats in the back e ja and alex next to each other i'm next to alex i figure the theatre would be empty it was not all three of us take turns remarking on the surprisingly good turn out which including us totals nine it the on s ledl the nohother wul in front of us are four tee aters slatched in their seats theyr laughing throughout the previous which makes me thinks they are probably stoned e ja noticeism tail ipeople ar or here for the film opens with a burlap sack tossed in an alley way which obviously is full of alley cats dozens of themcircle th disposed sack his saying also doing peraats and just to be clear by cats i mean human adults with fur digitily attached to their skin one of them rips open the still moving bag allowing whateveris inside of it to break free and what it is inside of this bag also a cat oh nan t the cannot drag n look i'm nock an upper ten cats isnn't a train rack alex covers his mouth with his hand when he is hiding his abject horror but then about fifteen minutes into the movy wen rebel wilson start singing and dancing with the parade of cock roaches i realize something e ja and alex are onorally at date for most of the movy they hold hands alex kisses ejae's palm three times which coinsides with the number of times she calls something the best part of the movy e cospasthe i think what makes us a good date has noething to do with with their doing that instead with the fact f their doing it together when duty dench his old uteronomy shows ap who by the way is for some reason wearing a fur coat a top her little coat of fur alex hums along with the rest of the cats who are there to welcome her because of course he knows the music it is been playing in his house non stop for months the movy ends just before midnight ej says they need to get halm back to their sun and citer we split a cab and i ask alex how he this movy that to quote hin has ruined his life i likes it alo more than i thought i would and why i liked whit to sa muging the railway cap impl shaneble thinks ske mus its killeit something you told me before we went in is that part of he really does think that i'm e js contris being contrarian an liking his movy and i'm wondering if you sill youa at wihe do you sti feel that way no i i do not unfeelin iithink i akind of heaven understin i can just i can see how despite o bege horrible movy you can genuinely appreciateit it just can o feels good this kind of joyous better and i'm kind os ye a'm meager to unpactice with ye mod i think yoonliy n a feel that wif for a limited periodo dag that is probably true when movy's end the lights are still dim the credits for all there is this moment it is just before people star genning up or every one's quiet it is waking up from a dream and then suddenly he check back into the reality of your own life i figure that is the moment i'm catching alex and the lights have not totally gone back up yet this is not how he really feels but then a week later i get a tecks from each a she says that last night while she and her son were listening to

the benshpirosho sponserbaks pressvypien protectour online pravsy today at expresvypianta cam flash men this weekend marked armistis day in great britain and veterans day in the united states both are sombre days typically marked by honor and respect for symbols of the country and for the men and women who have sacrificed much for the country this weekend instead both london and n w york city featured terrorst supporters marching on mass through the centers of the west proclaiming their sovereignty marks's philosopher shon pull sartra once blustered that the west was guilty for its colonization the best path would be colonization in reverse quote it is our turn to tread the path step by step which leads down to native level but to become natives are altogether our soil must be occupied by a formelly colonized people and we must starve of hunger this will not happend said sartra sartra was wrong he along with his minded and soft headed collegues helped to discredit the west thoroughly that the west spend decades importing millions of people who despise it and london this weekend saw radical muslims threatening the open annihilation of jews e a e tat la ta i dath to all the jews rang the middle of mall and dum talking how macell of hiller i the wes e t foty wat they fti fies why do te te ba mase timini why de te go te te ta ba cade an ba oco pason ta that toin do wa

and they chanted ciba cabrayhood which of courses reference to the coronic incidant in which mohammed slaughtered in entire to his village this weekend saw home grown or imported radicals wearing the head gear of terrorist group commass these are literally protestors with comass head bands on them wich is a crime in britain and it saw these procomas protestors attempting to mob the corrent seprotary of state for housing michael gov as see shying crowd of procomas protestors where following a member of the government the police are trying to spirit this member of government away at least one hundred and fifty people were arrested but there were three hundred thousand marching in solidarity with an actual terrorist group there is one banner in particular that stood out it reads youre either on the whites or the right side of history where is has white this manner it shows four flags these really flag the american flagd uca flag and the french flag where it says right it chose a bunch of arab flags itcshas much of african flags again white or right this in a nutshell is the philosophy of those who march with comoss and against the west the west is powerful the west has exploited the west is white therefore the west is powerful because the west is white and exploitative the right thing to do is to side with fronz panon's wretched of the earth the flags here by the way are apparently the flags of congo sudan the palstinians and the weager flag none of those places are particularly free or well governed and there are much the unifies them other than they are not white and yet the wrong side of histories apparently israel the uask uk and france that is same philosophy extends to this side of the water here is a flier that is been making the rounds at the university of chicago as you can see if you can watch this the anti sematism on this flier is directly linked with anti whiteness this flier says ending white privilege stars with ending jewish privilege the idea is that the jews are ultimately white people the are unduly successful and therefore they must be stopped the poster shows a pyramid and it chose the one per cent is it is the one per cent straight white men or is the one per cent jewish says this flier handed out of the university of chicago this notion is fully coincident with anti americanism america after all is largely great because of the promise that any one of any background can get ahead jewish americans are one of the great success stories in american history by that standard give the fact that they arrived mostly in the early twentieth century in the united states dirt poor and quickly became highly educated in economically successful the current antisymatic movement is linked directly to hatred for this country and its meritocratic promise that is why prochomos protestors spent this weekend in the united states ripping down american flags this was in new york city we can see a man climbing up the flagpone ind east forty third street and tearing im down american flags leaving palstinian flags up their tearing down those american flags got to make sure that those t do not stay up and people cheering wildly where the police no one knows drest a terrace by the way across the world those who have not acheev are uniting against the west they blame the west for their lack of success while living off the wests largess that is why ober pampered ober celebrated dullerd complete more on gretat twinburg spent hurweek en lincoln climate change with support for comass as those lamaterrists

gossess strip this obnoxious idiot child who is no longer a childs wo can make fun of her now she has been fetted she has been treasured by the west for years to be a completely destructive moronic force the west has a choice it can be colonized in sarcros fastion or it can refuse that colonization in the uke that battle is taking place largely over the verbiage of swell a braverman she as the former home secretaril get to that nemoment she as been stalwartly calling for an end to the police and the governments coddling of procomas ralliers over the weeken she twe to quote our brave police officers deserve the thanks a every decent citizen for their professionalism inthe face of violence and aggression from protesters and counter protestors in london yesterday that multiple officers were injured doing their duty is an outrage she continued the sick in flamatory and in some cases clearly criminal chance plakards and paraphernalia openly on displayed the march marka new lot antisematism and other forms of races an together wuth the valorizeing of terrors m on sutcha scale is deeply troubling this cannot go on week bi week the strets of london are being polluted by hate violence in antisematism members f the public are being mobbed and intimitated jewish people in particular feel threaton further action is necessary now braverman is not white she is indian extraction but that of course does not matter she does not imbibe from the well of pseudo victimhood and thus she is an enemy to be destroyed and because braverman made the unfortunate mistake of telling the truth she has now been sumarily fired from her job noticing the pretations of those who love comas is a dismissable offence in the uke in the words of neel basu a former had of counter terrors and policing in the uce quote you have a chance of in flaming both sides when you make such devisive remarks yes it was the remarks that were devisive not the hundreds of thousands of people calling for the destruction of israel and thewest from the heart of london and both sides that might be inflem those very very dangerous jews in londed who might be inflamed must not defend braverman's alster brought back to power former prime minister david cameron is foreign secretary in amazing change of events she has a foreign policy squitsch who stood against braxet and had resign from office when he lost cammeran is shown himself perfectly willing to speak words of appeasemen to muslem radicals into thesnt ten he labeled gasa aquote prison camp welling turkey which his a is lomic tatatorship and suggested that israel had to open up gases borers well comas was in charge criticizing israel for stopping a shipmen of weapons from turkey to the gasestrip after all fabtey for taterists an all that in the united states that battle is taking place of the universities where enemies of the contry are ushered in and offered scholarships at or top institutions of higher learning the latest eterition comes courtesy of amite where ratical students violated the universityes rules by occupying public places they were not allwed to occupy jews were then told by the university not to enter through main areas do to safety concerns now these procomastudens are foreigners you the university could have easily suspended them they did not in violation of their own rules why not well it would violate their scruples about the necessity of importing people into th united states who hate the united states the university precident openly state to quote because we later herd serious concerns about collateral consequences for the students such as e sa issues we have decieted as an instrumaction that the students remained after the dead line we will be suspended from non academic campis activities the students remain en rolle it am i tee and we will be able to attend academic classes and laps see it turns out that if these people were suspended and they hate the united states than theoretically they w'uld be eligible for deportation and we would want terror supporters deported that might open a slaugted a mi tee to in agient american or something the amitee student come out supporters they celebrated as you wouldexpect giant rally yesterday if ad use an un international shame an theirturing that they have one they did not end of suspended because the university decided the united states must have foreigners who hate the country here must it has to happen these people know that the weakness of the west means living off the fat of the land while seeking to undermine the very society that humors their garbage the reality is that the west has created wildly disproportionate prosperity and freedom over the courte of its history compared with other civilizations thet does not excuse the west sins it does me that tearing down the west in favor of supposed alternatives is disgusting and repulsiv if the west is an aging lion those who seek to tear it down are scavengers relying on that lion for their livelihood and the r well being but seething with envy and hatred either of the western line will roar again where the scavengers will tear it to pieces that is the choice we face

violations of human rights that have happened in the gossis strip are somehow the result of his raly policy as oppose to the results of commoss tyrrorism they are a a wide variety of narratives that are now being trotted out by soft headed moreons in the west in order to try and protect commoss or to pretend tha moral equivalencs that allows them to go back to slee and pretend tat the problems that exist in the streets of london do not nactuallates os see the thing is if you can pretend a moral equivalence ten israel and its enemies then that allows you to go back to your isolationists view of foreign policy in which things that happen very far away are not happening at home but you will motice the lot those things are happening at home intends to wake you up to foreign policy when you got threeu hundred thousand people chancing for commass on the streets of london or when they have tens of thousands of them in the united states or when you have american campses honeycombe with people who lov comas attends to open your eyes to the consequence is of morally relative the stic policy when it comes to foreign policy and better to go back to sly and that are bunch of members the media ore desperately attempting to do this routine the bb s more than any one else because the problem is really really big in london much bigger than it is in the united states te united states as a problem of s lomocraticals living here but as a per centage of the general population is lomograticals are not a huge percentage of the american population n the fact is that the number of muslems in the united states is approximately three and a alf million obviously ot all those people are radicals seere talking bout o very small percentage however when you talking about muslems in the uqa youare talking about seven per cent of the contry in england and whales not fifteen per cent of london when you hung myt muslems and a huge percentage of those by polingtata are not only anti israel they are wildly antismatic and obviously by the numbers very much pro protecting commoss an that you can do a look that in the face ordican deny that it is problem at all and the easiest thing to do is to fires swell a braver men and pertend that is not a problem at all now in order to establish that its not a probem what you have to do eefter preten tht israels tho rell prob in the milliyes the b b caso between thes nonstop the b b c is basically just an arabist outlet on behalf of proterrorism forces in the middleast that is what they are that is what they become ther pathetic perfect example yesterday the b b c did not interview with alon laby who is the israelly government spokesman and this interview is perfectlyion sane because alen lvy points out and when civillians are dying in goza its because commas is hiding behind tovillions that israel is targoning military targets and commasses deliberately attempting to massively increase the cevilling casualty numbers in orderstr they can go to the moore an to the b b c an claim that israel ought to pursue a cease fire this b b c anchor response to that clam by saying it is convenient for israel somehow that is convenient for israel to make the argument the deboming military targets now again let me shur mind everybody israel has complete military superiority in this eria is rofs complete air superiority commassosn'nt have than got andy assectines israel could if it wanted to turn the entire place to rubble itcould turn the entire place to glass it could kill millions of people instead israel is purposully targonin not only that willshowy evidence in just a second an theyare attempting to take care of palistonians villions in away the commass actively is attempting to stop but here is the b b c lime is is what they do it is a convenient responsis in it that every time there is not is ready strike on some sort of facility in siht gasi you just tellis the hamassis a pricing thar an that is why your fiting bat we understand is to o no asly i was saying that its facility the you had incenacially recognize body the u and says that it is facility in gosit was a tamt by your forcees evenit and this morning reporting a significant number of deaths the poines as that is on conta anstion o an a actioall time an attair in lo and p man an somewhere that a safe to go if youare telling them to evacuate from the north of gaza i have to push back because the insinuation in your question is that israel takes cetet taking poncho tat civilian facilities that no won 'm saying i'm to saying ht at for response yo make to my suggestion that you are tagating people when they are trying to find some wy safe to go is yon nar my ha mass is operating that is citinmeland facilyto us then homas a spend the lost sixteen years inbending itself under the civilian areas in goza building its headquarters under the hospital exploiting ambulences putting its own no our troups of just discoffered rocketd lunches and wepon silos inside schools inside costrooms next to children's bendroom sa tha musdefis not tacking those tagets even ther there are as we have seen this morning babies in the hospital we have seen that innocent sof anians are in the uan facilities and we are doing everything we can going above and beyond our obligations under intenational lo to get civilians out of tom's way look at the medio lot lookin to b by see ther look the b c what alen laby there is saying is it one hundred percentrue clearly one hundred perspent true when he says that the ou and facilities have been uws for a very long time by com ass a staging grounds for their terrors om and a storage points for their weaponry then the besy as whl is not it convenience then the troll attacking those youan facilities as severe ins tat they are not civilian targets then military targets the liberally placed among civilians which makes the military targets and these that what is not that convenienc since you do will not obviously us an we do not want kills of thensing but do not you really because you will jews you jews in your killing of the civilians we coadn't see what sho doing you did ty nosty jews you an it is just disgusting it is vil and thes sort of moral equivlencs comes in softer form as well was i'm friendly with pers morgan and some appears is coverage on this conflict has bee good and some some other parts of his coverd to ben purely babicas e tends to fall into this moral equivalents nonsense there was a picture their mergs from all shif a hospital of small babies whyr having trouble the reason thate hving trouble is because babies should not be at all shiff a hospital israel has offered to get the babies out of allshif a hospital i'll shif a hospital is i front for terrorism it has the held quarters of the militry under it has for ten years has been report by the your times the washing to bost amnesty international hay they keep thet they put vulnerable children literally on top of their militar headquarters in order to protect them and pere's morgans we s hout this is heart breaking dozens of new born babies detach from their incubators at i'll shiff a gaza hospital do to power oxygen running out israel must do more to get them to safety and medical trep and asap israel has offered whatever it can do to get those babies out in fact yesterday here was israel openly offering is their military spokesmer person offering openly to fa scilitate the exet of those children commas tos not want the kids to leave commas wants the dead babies to imply that it is israel that has the responsibility for the babies the comoss is almost literally strappings their own bodies is insane here is israel's military spokes person explaining this yesterday we speaking directly and regularly wi the hospital stu the thoff of the shi fo hospital is request tit that to morrow we will help the babies in the pidiatric depopment to get to a sa fo hospital we will provide the sistence needit en the something that the world mus not forgt and we will not let the world forget it commas has been holding hospites to hundred and thirty nine men wemen children elderly and babies do not forget babies for thirty six tas this is a crime against humanity and we will not let the world forget it it of course that is true but then in stop the media from trying to crate this false moral cuvlens why because that way they canpertoen they can appear sweet as the reverse colonization from places that hate america and hate the wast happen that is the goll we to morea this in just

western governments it is nin fact a li there is much tape that is fully available of com oss violating human rights and of israel attempting to honestly overcom a commoses attempt to violating rites is totally crazy for example when israel has ben complaining that when they ship eigd in coma steals all of it it is begaus come osteals all f it for example yesterday a bunch of aid was shipped into the gosistrip and comeos immediately started unloading te atd in stealing it ou cen see people in this particular vidio attempting to get to the foodad they want the foodat their hungry and you can see in this vidio gian crowd people attempting ats the truck and comas is beating them off the truck ou seed in the background far back in he background you see comas literally smacking people and trying to get them out of theirs that they can steal all of the aid this is what they do in there there is no secret about this com os's been openly doing this for literally years they took every dollar that came in an they built it into terror tunnelson rockets and meanwhile there is beenall this fuss about i'llshiva hospital be's again come os deliberately planted theyre military headquarts beneath a hospital that haslak a place for eeling babies yesterday israel presented fuel twall sheifa specifically to the hospital ministers at alshiva in facture is vidio of israelies carcarry is the iddle of a war hvou'vere herd of anything us eve neveryn remotely heard of anything this i geve soldiers literally an millmal war knowing is to military target droped off canisters of fuel four hospital authorities in orders that they could use it to maintain power supply for people who need it in the hospital they drop off these these tanks oun see there is aeriel footage here they are their dropping them off you see all of it and then cm os's prevented the gas from getting to the hospital com as stoped it hereis a senior goss in helth official nd he says thre's a problem at shifa because israels tran gof us fuel and comos is preventing it and then there ismorso israel mostumal lisn'n i peers but i rwont the heliest walking about what exactly are they suppose to do air drop the fuel at s theye magic powers i do not na when israel's military was granted the magical ability to do anything that is it the impossible israel can magically snap is fingers and every terrorstvis an every civilian is preserve israel can magically snap its fingers and the fuel goes intalshifa but does not get into the hands of commass there is a senior gossen help official acknowledging the commass is stealing the fuel and or preventing it from getting to the hospitl in the first place dis a call between coordination leazon officer and it senior official ind the health system in gaza n me the gods knol f icsus as there is a problem only at chifanow a bear with me ass what is the sory ibill reach the rectr general of the ommas health ministry does not want this amount of fuel or trying to convince him he does not want that fuel in there the ewyorc times by the way confirms this story the commoss is blocking fuel from entering allshifa wy thet can show picture is that peere's morgan can tweeted out and people the media can say israel must to morl to protect civilians this is the entire game is the entire game and this combines with a secondary narrative the secondary narrative is this idea that somehow israel is violating the waws of war that is an absurdity there is no country on earth that has pursue the kinds of measures that israel is currently pursuing in order to preserve the civilian population of that was governed by an enemy certainly the united states has not done that theunitestates did not do tis an aroc that thunitestates did not do thi snafganiston no country has have pr this far as i am aware as much as me sean and military analists say that that is what crazy and yet there is a new yorc times opinion article to day by a person named doctor walter ad horn a professor of defense stunnies at the royal military college of canada in kingston on terio and he says that this war that israel is waging ans commas violates just war thery now you said yourself house hateven possible how is it possible that if a a government of of an enemy tattacks your population hills twelve hundred people obducts another to un or fority and then u go in to root them out how does that violye just wortheory we let this professor this verywise professor explained he says the standard elements in assussing whether adjust a war is just are just cause right intent legitimate authority that benefit or likelihod of success last resord proportionality of means and knon combatant distinction idealya state siould met all of the criteria but the case for a just work can still be made even if the few of the bench marks are wek israel easily has just cause and constitutes a legitimate ofuthority bu its case is far weaker re garding the other five criteria in addition the fact that commasas violated these principles does not obsolve israel from n obligationsto live up to highor moral santatheradas and israel israel has to live up to morelstandars that literally nor the country on earth would pursue because this moron professor from canadasesso he sys to determine just how unjust or jas israel's current actions are let us examine each criterian be easton the approachin my scholarship on the first messure just cause israel dseemed have plenty of that right intends the second criterian means that fore should be used to help establish peace in the long term rather than in pursuie of a short term or politically self servin gain or in an act o vengeance he says those some might argue israel is figeting to establish peace in gaza from a position of strength and tominants israel's actions can easily be question why what because benjamin intin yaho he is two right wing what the by by way oul's point out here yet yearela peed who is a central left opponents on nton gah beny gants they are all behind nintinyahoness nut there is no disunity in israel is not left right issue at all in israel israel has never been more unified from left all the wai to right bu accoring this professor an canada probably there is a in ulterior motive what the hel wof the ulterior motive be israel is eager to hands off gaza to komss that they literally ignored every single sign tha commasswes preparing this military attack for twenty years becaue they did not want to be in there and this dult is out there saying things well and when it comes to one comes to wright intent they might not have right intent they really might want to build beach houses in gaza ahah sure sure he says theisraely govrnment does satisfy the criterian of having legitimate authority cause it was democratially elected the criterian of net benefit weighing the gain against the harm woult include the potential gain of removing ckomas from power or at least neutralizing its capacity to attack israel in the short term the war might also provide new opportunities for the palson an authority or some other transitional ad ministration to govern gaza and eventually free and fairelections isrel might also be able to rescue hossages held by kamas however te enormous loss of hau sinian lives will most likely create inter generational righ yourit thre has not been inter generational rage ever since nineteen forty eight everybodyes meen perfectly happy until now until israel has goin in wamp komas nailed it further there is great risk of a wide or war with fire already being exchange over israel's wars lemonon and seria ya that the best thing for israel to dowould be nothing apparently he says the downside of israel's war outweighs any benefits ahah and the he says the criterian of last resort is key to all just war con siderations fore should only be used when all other means hafe failed or be clearly in effective israel se's no other way to neutralized komasan rescue the hostages but it has force swarns rect negotiations out of hand and is not considering a peace process for gaza oh according to this professor israel should negotiate with kommas this is this insany by the way under the kiscritera there has literally never been a just war rage by a western power ever in history ever literally ever worldwares who is not justified because after all the united states was it realy necessary for us to attack japan after they attack us tercom negotiated with them was really necessary for the united states to involve itself in literally any war any by this crit of course the answer is know which means that is a it is a lie and this kind knows its a libity's promoting it anyway by the way we now have a pece from the washington post that has serious evidents whelkomas was attempting to do and the answerers there were tempting to start au vast conflagration osconol exstend all the way to juda juday an tomarya the west bank and start a three front war against israel at the same time by the way in the middle of this pece bearin this s washington postpies is in admission that commoss not only rape people but actually had a commander of rape they appointed a person who isin charge of delegating people for rape they issued orders to their terres that said in arabic trans literated peoprew it said on their orders orders to women to take off their pans they culd rape them and that' that' s in the washington postaricle or all the denialis who are suggesting that no rape took place a mea it literally says in the middle of this of this article quote some of the most brutal attacks occured in bery were militans cut op in the belly of a pregnant women drag fer phetis on tothe ground in other town survivers told the parens beng murdered in front of their children and children murder in front of their parents other survivers described witning witnessing sexual assaults including rape apparently and then they admitted that there were lots of non comoss palisting in to join the rate not only that it turns out that there were gosan workers who had supplied them wit the information quote to obtain detailed intelligence come oss to ply cheep surveillancestrones to generate maps of these railly towns and military insullations within a few miles of the one billian dolarbariar sistem israel built to wall off goza the group alicited additional information from gosand day laborers who are permitted to enter israel for work israel literally let in and paid the people who then spied on it to create this war and then you have more on suggesting that the war is not just somehow it is just it is absolutely incredible it is absl in credible by the way that last part is kind of important that gosan civilians were involved in the planning of teattack and infact in the carrying out of the attack why not because it justifies in anyway the targeting of civilians e targan military targets and civilians are there you then have to assess the cost of benefits of each military strike point out a this point israel had hit as of last friday twelve thousand military targets in the gzistrip theyd dropped over twenty five thousand bombs in the gozaistrip and they would killed by the gosand half authority estments ac are totally wrong i'm sure they would killed bout ten thousand people et that is not the way that a carpet bombing campagn wih look in terms of casualty numbers that is not a carpet that that is the targeted military campaign ey but put that aside what is that really say what it says is whatever comes nack is not going to be easian its not going to be quick this notion that israel can simply hand off the goscistript to the self governments of people who literally participated in the attack or who supported the attack er who cheered the attack is totally crazy again it is part of the west'sself deception i'm palstan intev it this grandmother recently apirnau pausan intiv and here is what she had to say bmata mdai says quote witm those who not have martyrs in their family have no home land those who have no prisoner in their family have no honor we have to

obviously this is why get what you are watching froms iddleastern policy has ramifications for america has ramifications for briton has ramifications for the west because the entire m o of the west for literally decates has been you sleep you go to sleep on the actual belief systems of bilians of people across the planet sas to give yourself this wonderful you topian dream of a world where everybodys things you and therefore you can just import everybody to your shores can welcome im at my te cn welcome into the centeres of london ye can fire anybody who says watisican these people not only do not think us they wish to destroy our civilization their ramifications for not understanding the way the world works and yet much foreign policy is predicated on all this is not real polity her there is an aspect of real polity where even american allies get forced into positions that they do not want to be in because it is in quat quat americis interests bt tat is not whats happening here what is currently happening here is that israel is seeking to annihilate in actual terror group and then replace that with a secure situation for itself and meanwhile you of the west saying noner know what you really need o dos you need to hand over control of that situation two a bunch people who will then repeat this afterward for example jaksalvan who ise the actural and esay adviser he says therere ther cannot be any re occupation of gassall get what is alternative seriously i i want no the alternive is the altern of to handed over to the palsinan authority you have multible proms oth that probnumber one palcinan authority is a group of lyars the had of the palcinan authority machmidabas is an actual honesto got hal costonir his actual government by wa paze people who murder jews that is t there are just a difference in degree not a difference in kind from comas two the palcina authorty has no internal ability to control they are not in control of judea and smary the palstonian authority you have lyons then which is a terrogrup hichs been doing enormous amounts of harm in westbank is lomacy hot incredibly act io nthe westbank commases go by the way when invaded when it invaded tried to get all the way to the westbank sus to start a conflagration in the westbank in which the palcinian authority would be overturned the reason threhas been no election injuda an samaria in the palcinan arias judan somaria for literally fifteen years of this point is is machmudabas in the p are deeply afraid that if an election were halcomasedwin turning this territory over to the tender mercies of the p is absurd is not going to happen and it is unrealistic what are the other alternative cannot tern over to the uan because the uan is a garba chep of extraordinary proportions the uan let us forget lest we forget was supposed to gueranty peace on israel's northern border in southern lebanon after the two thalsan six israel war insouthern lebanon israel turned over that borer area to unifil the uan promptly loud casballa to come in and armne inhire border with two hundred thalsan rockets the uan or w a has not only facilitated they have advanced the cause of hislomic extremism in the gasistrip andjudaan smaria the uan cannot be trusted at is not a trusted sorce cant be the uan nda cannot be the p who the hlwou o be egypt does not want it isral mih eoble to trust egypt to run the gasistript theyve offered ats them a thousand times what abdellphatalicicy the leader of egypt said the dictator of egypt said hofs asked by israel will you take the god a will natace one palisinian zero and thei'reasked why and he said because i know these people i'm not taking them the same thing in jordan whor queen queenrania is crying salty tears oh she is sad ofer what is happening in the gasistrip ido not see jordan alfering to take anybody there is a reason for that queenraniais bi being a palisinian arab herself is perfectly happy to mary inso the hashmi dynasty a colonial outpost left over from the british mantate and she is happened go to five star hotels she is happy to live in palaces while her people live on forty one hundred bucks a year and meanwhile she sits there and she complains which not longtaken any palcin you refugies why because s the fraid she will be overthrown that is why everybody knows this there is no one who is willing to do this which means the only alternative realistically speaking is for in is raily military presence to guaranty is raily security coson an israel's orter catso nittan ya who said this the therday and take oldoners no thre will be no reoccupation ulk cifine you we'le wait wrawliers sere's li near every one everyone left all years got some solutionsles hear them i the isral will foran te government birit will have doyouroll oh security responsibility because we have seein what happens when we do not have what what is you what sur take on that i meas is also later said they do not seek the govern gossa but that sounds in this raally occupation of gossa his is is that is that where this is goin that is not our understanding of the israily governments position and i think primister and ya who has clerified his comments is yu as you just eluded to the american position on this a straightforward secretary blankan lated out this past week no reoccupation of gossa no reduction in the territory of goin no forcible this placemen of palistinians and goza should never be allowed to be used tos a base for terrice to tacx against israel or anyone else casso obviously it is gon have to be it is gon at have to be is really security control and all this happy talk about it not being is ridiculous onest face nellison an one make atim as though the comoss supporters or winning everywhere the're not men the fact is there are lots and lots people across the west who support israel in is in its attempt to take comss off the off the gamepord that they are tons people yesterday and very encouraging sho there avre a hndred thousand people who marched in paris you will notice i'm i'm seeing i'm a very different demographic profile for the people who are marching against comosfor people are marching procomass that does not have to do with race that have to do with contry of origin and ideology attached there too in any case here is what some of that march looks alike in france the up by the way the far left grouped in participate every other grup in frant every other political body joined this march not the far left the far left said we will not a hundred thousand people re joining in this march agains antisematism now by the way if you would actually to fight antisematism that means you neun to let israel fight the new noties war comoss you have to points out that it is not just commossisesso his belo a turns out that that fighting antisemiism is more than ust a fou petty words but we should at least we should least provide the the optimistic news that there ar people across the world to support israel in their battle against commasa that is good meanwhile it is sen it turns out that some rich people oure star and get the news about how terrible the university system is which is presumably wy one thousand six hundred jewish harvard alom our threatening to withdraw their donations over concerns about antisemitism according to sianen members of the harvard college dushalumni association we are letter to the presedetento the collegi and we ever thought that at harvard we would have to argue the point that terrorism against civilians deman's immediate and unequivocal condemnation we never thought we woud have to argue for recognition of our own humanity when glad to see the people are waking up i'm glad to see that ta there is some people on the left of the jewish community wive finally realized that it turns out the far left and their introsectional colition they are not your friends at all at all o cane n just one second we'l get to

senter from south carolina who had failure to launch right from the outside ofhis campaign barynice guy no reason ou is running for present he has now bowed out here whe was yesterday announcing it on fox news but wi go back to i w they will not be ave the presidental i candidat im suspending my campain ni think the voters ih who ot the most remarkable people on the puietet ave then really clear that ther telling me not now tel i do not make the sang tray no bu do you thi ther sang go now it some win respect the voters an im wit a hold on a cu workin we are re what for tooo to he he is out he 'dn't have lot in the polling he was about seven per cent an iowa which is interesting because that supportes can go somewhere nationally speaking he was in sixth place behind christ christy him dropping out is not a big note is yoit means some of his doners when i can put the money behind im any more because he ad originally sucke up a lot of cash thet meas there only five people woare left in te race this point trump whos way out in the lead ronto santis in solid second nickey haley who is drawng up behind to santis the vag romasuammy whos sticking around for the ploutets and the beleeves in the giggles and chriscristy who is out there as some sort of revenge tactic that no one really understands because he is one of the angries people in american posic one of the questions here is which way tim scotts support actually goes again timscott is trum south carolina you have to imagine that him being out is can o help nickey hayley in south carolina particularly himbing out an iwa not clear which way scott support is going to go if you added it to to santis than to santis now in the mid twenties if he' split between to santus an haley than ta santisis twenty twenty one per cent hayloob it may be seventeen per cent in iwa can ot th the smart money suggest that most of scott support is goin to go to hailey because he was very much minded with her on a lot of various issues and also because again he is trum south carolina he is seen a sort of the nice gy in the campaign which is more the preserve of nickey hailey than it is of ron to santis we have not realy seen a lot of new polling out of iwa since the governor viwa can renalds announced hersupport for ronto santis where tht's can move the the needle at all in that stay basically the only way that this race heu can gets interesting is if to santis wind's iwave to santis lose iwa trumpis over if trumplin's iwa i means pollyover anyway but if trump win's iwa he is going to run the table if he loses iwa then there is the possibility that you could see to santis strength ind in new hampshire and haley's strengthened in new hampshire here is the theoretical possibilif youredical possibility jo santuswin's iwa heluan's new hampshire and then heu move down to south carolina and now that scott is out who is eating up a lot of h voat and hayley's the former governor is there a lot of that support thaen swivels over to haley and it turns into sort of a three person race from there on ow now by the polling data that does not seem the most plausible at this point if oulook a tapoleon iwa the real cler potic's polling average has trump up at forty seven per cent to santis hayley scott combined were it thirty nine per cent s they warn't actually up at trum slu but it is caukustate if he lik a new hampshire trump has a wide lead over the resto the field he is at forty seven per cent haley's at fifteen the santan aleven cristy is at nine if crist ye were to drop out that might make the race a little but more intersting over there there is no polling fire as i'm aware trum south carolina any time in the recent past we do not actually know how that would look in the primaries but hif yelds had a consolidate at least for there to be a chance that somebody could take on trump and a the field is consolidating ou do not good for tim scott for stepping out when this was no longer a campaign worth running i'm waiting for chris cristy and vavak romasuammy to realize the sand because again there is no reason for them being the race meanwhile a donald trump is making the rounds his campaign to the point has basically featured him going to sportig evens and you ef see fights and getting cheers and some boos andand then himoranting bettcourt cases and honestly if that is hat the campaign is all right i'meu no kat as long as the focus remains on jobidon in him being a very bad presedent i think that that trump has a very solid chot and winning the presidency right now the big troblem is that again that shoul bou ere the focuses his the the amount i think that people should understand the amount of hatred that trump draws he is entirely cump concominent with the amount of love that he draws listn lot people love trump foreshore also in enormous number of people hate trump this was made perfectly apparent the other night he showed up at yuef see fight he was flanked by a tucker crarson to tucker souod up with him spurring all sorts of rumors about the possibility that tucker was goingt run as his bp i think that is very unlikely i won think that is a job the tucker even won sbut it' spurt a lot of tose sorts of rumors especialy cause trump had been asked boun hes maybey thattr trum trumps is maybe to lot of things in any case they both showed up here is what o look likewhn they walked in is ran nextrom as well madbe cirop ill will run from emunionn never now at that cold be possibi sovis the crowd loves it this is it is trumps cort crowd lot lot o matcho in the room lot lot of lotif tudes in the room the this is this is where trump is very popular well he was very popular except for one human it turns out that bill burr thecomedian who has a new move you he was also at the uefsee fight and he was there with his wife his wife is sort of a black live's matter activist and dum and here is what it look when she flipped him off on the big screen tankin here behind him she she flips a double bird at trump i as i as he moves into his row now this spurred all sorts of conversations on line that there couple points to major one is that again there n't lot ofpeople who really hate downl trump it is not just tha they are a lote peoplle love donl trump there are ther're also lot peoplwho really hate down trump is a very very polorizing figure this is why by poling did a genaric republican beats the pans off jobidon and donl trump is running ridty even with jobidon in most of th pulling if you look at the real cre politics betting averages right now trump is up slightly on bidon in the bettiyg averages if you ook at the real crepolitics general election match up average it shows that trump is up very very slightly on jobidon within martin of air of forty five point six percent o forty four point five per cent an other words pretending is a foregorn conclusion that trumps can be bidon that is not troe now trump could be bidn for shore but is at a foregong conclusion not clear if we get a year of donnal trump ranting about his courtcases and the meda swivel as the undoubtedly will to cover trump as to avoid covering bidin thas's con be a problem the more trumpets in the havlines the worse it is for him the more trobidness in the headlines the better it is four donnel trums up again point number one is that when you see this lady flipping off toneltrum lot of us on theridlice what up what a horseis asked lic really he' sai you have sea fight seriously really and i'm thererea lot ofpeople who are meanwhile are cheering her second point here is that man bill berr i got a say personal point on bilber bill bur one i favor commedians really funny if yev watched any of his specials ther're hilarias one ofthe best working commedians out there i went to a showed billber did down here in florida last week he' don wat the hardrock af at at the hardrock asino seven thousand seets and bill berr i think that he realizes that a lot of his crowd are people who are center centor right and i think he is un comfortable it that an he is deeply un comfortable it that i think partially it is because again he is married to somebotdy who is very much on the left and he decided that he was goin to come to florida and extremely red state and not only insult the audience is munch of hick racis but he was then going to make just a series of jokes about how a merica is dominated by white supremasy and man i he died on stage am hu'se a angry at the audience he he was e was up there he' done the same routine i assume in he lands elike the ight before somethng and every joke he told just fell absolutely flat and he was relegateds can ofe telling old dirty stories this is what happens when you are captured by your idea logical crew is a real prom for lock camedians lot o comedians particularly ones who have some sort of sor of center sent tor right crowd jim gaffagans another example this at a certain point they realize aft thererea lot of people who might not vilt they do and they get really unf comfortable with it and they start to actively virtue signal athbothose are not my people oun't those people can play that game but it turns out lawis feeling be very turned off ther'rea lot of people who trump and voted for trump and probably vole for trump again if he is tenominy who saw billber's wife flipp off the camera and there gin a hill here bilber's latest routines which are all about the inherent evil of the united states mens that is litterally whathewas talking about theother night and are ging to turn off that is a career risk for people and i know that for people who live in elley and want to be they want their friend group to respect them the thing it is necessary to do this it really really is not it really is not and entertainders are making very large skill error when they do this sort of stuff o cae to anywhit trum trows up that is a big cheere again this what trump is great at he is greated drying us a spotlight he is great it at being a celebrity it is tha thing he is best ap when it comes to campaigning he is very distractable easily distractable the dogin up distractable wit downal trump whill be tung about jub an to tar te breadsit ga bret and then out in the background pops a thaught and the thought isabat lic le tissa james or the thought is about christ christy in take squire squire in just tirts chasing after the squirrel the dog from up em here he was campagning th other night and he just decides that he is going to go off on chris cristy forn in why is there a point to this chris christy is he is gathering he is gathering mould in this campaign heyet he has no voters wlose said that who said that and by the way thers somebody else says something le said this man said he should not say i wol it e he said chris christy is a that pig you you cn that say that sir you can please please tak that that please tak that that no no no non said chris christes of that big you cannot do that a it o calig really i getan then just tad just tat the tha imem wh's bast m me vreing lof tor chris christy sometimes trumps insult commety shick the trime the insult commedy dog sometimes that chick is great iouremember a few weeks ago he is going after how bidon waki he look take ye luts in tuthics and it is true line now you everydime as he bike walcoic trump is right it does look he is walking on toothbic it is weird but christy being a fat pagling eh then trump deside he is going to talk about being a proud election denire which again if we run on this if a publicans round this in twenty twenty twour s can to go precisely the same way it is twenty twenty one twenty twenty one twenty twenty two annd twenty twenty three is no can ga amazing soagain dos not the imatery tht you want if you are if you are the president form present ni sates running again is you double screened with michaelin dull the my pillow guy next to you got a next to you who is ake lost a lot of his fortune pursuing your specious claims about election election stealing a here is donal trump i tens aminions of people within anation o proud and strong elect you nomb o very proud election denyer o case om is that soming one around also on veterans day he tweated out we pledged you t we will root out the commeuust marks is fashous and radical left dugs that live veryman within the con fines of our country that li and stealin sheet on elections they will do anything whether legally or illegally to destroy america and to dis troy the american dream an now i'm perfectly fine with him qonn ar rooting out comminus marks is fashos and radical left dugs the promise when he uses the language live vermin again i thin we shuld aport an enormous number of people whose support terrowism i think there a lot of people or lingthes country ofre not citizens who should go back to their countries of origin the language of vermin is not particularly smart political language but again ye i is theckon purt trumpit an you real wa onings on hurt trump it any realway is just at another distraction again these storis should be here that yobidin is very bad at the presidencyng and then on top of that i's o i will ay there was one on fair hit on trump mediahed on trump yesterday and that was that trump was speaking and he mixed up who the president was e another trying to n out creetit a narrative where donal trumps is see now is jobidin by to that that dogin can hunt you does'n have crime an ag uis af the prober at the having an other countries who amidions of people wo alot oin but they were interviewing im two weeks ago unless said an what would you advise president of bamma the whole world seems to be exploding and imbloding and he siis very simple he should immediately resign and they should re place him with president tr who ca the world s h a ha h h h i gay sow am becaue yeu said o bama rather than biden i'm sorry that that is not rem the meanuant nuts over this he is again yoy're now trying to undo the thing the thing is the running in eight year old guy who clearly is not functional trump mixing up abama and biden i've done that before on the show because frankly they have the exact same staff ando bamm's last democratic president before this that is really silly it trot trying to suggested this is because trump is losing it or something is purely ridiculous already gots the rest of the show is continuing right now he're not gone o one to miss it we will be getting into a breaking story in which secret service agents actually had to open

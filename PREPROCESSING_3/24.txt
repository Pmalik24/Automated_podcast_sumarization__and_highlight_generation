well folks elmo did it he opened the can of worms elmo you may know as the red furry mupp it from sesime street h made a big boobo yesterday he went on the ax he went on twitters ax space and he and he promptly treated elm is just checking in how is everybody doing oh no the world unweished it is hell fir on with users from all a cross the political spectrom immediately unloading on elmo to tell him how disappointed upset and depressd they were one use o replied elmo i'm suffering from ecistential dread over here another replied every mornin i cannot wait to go back to sleep every monday i cannot wait for friday to come every single day and every single week for life rachel zegler who recalls the actress from sno white made to reshoot it because she made ob noxious comments about how terrible snow i was she tweated that she was quote resisting the urge to tell elmo that i am kind to staffit a it was really funny right this was the thing that was going on all over axts yesterday and it tae funny joke it is a funny joke because up at asking how everybody is and then everybody responding that they are experiencing existential ongst and upset is really funny elmo then replied quo wau elmo is glad he asked elm learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing elm will check again soon friends elmo loves you hashchaggy motional well being kewo oka that is that is kind of u funny kind of not joke any more and then jobidon comes in from the wings with a chan saw to massacre of the jo jobidon to eatell quote i know how hard it is some days to sweep the clouds away and gets a sunnier days our friend elmo is right we have to be there for each other all for our help to a neighboring eadan above all ask for help when we need it even though it is hard you are never alone here is my question today what they will happened our sense of humor why cannot we just laugh at this it is really funny why cannot we just laugh when elmo asks twitter how everyone is doing and people are answering with their suicidal thoughts that is funny oka it is just funny it is o kay for us to laugh at things but it seems as though in the country it is not o kay to laugh at pretty much anything any more comedy i believe really died during the abama administracion when prety much all of our commedic leaders decided the day were actually politicians and barokobams actually a celebrity the complete murger of celebrity and politics that occurred when barokobama became president totally eat comedy becaus comedians decided that they were going to a fectively becomes spokes people for barokobmam's administration youwill recall chris rock suggesting that barokobamo was his father these a a father figure to all of us youl recall ththere ware commedians we are suggesting that it was impossible to make fun of barokobama because he just there wias nothing funny about t man which of course is in an of itself pretty funny barokobama was a highly mackable character he thought that he was a transformatof figure when in fact who just con of a corrupt chicago politician with delusions of grandeur it butt because comedy decided that it could not stay separate from politics what that did is it totally under mine one of the common spaces tat we have as a society comedy is a is a space that we used to share as a society ant no matter where you were politically funny was funny and thow is the basic idea for deccades in american life it did not mater where you were on th political spectfrom richard prior was funny it did not matter where you were on the political spect rom george carlin was funny johnny carson was funny jailenno was funny and then it turns out that as the social fabric breaks down it is very difficult to laugh laughter becomes inccredibly difficult because if you believe that the person who is making the joke is laughing at you you are no longer laughing along and if you believe that the person who is making the joke is ac she not joking that underneath that joke is is ier and rage and raugh that is non funny either sadness te pression and ger these are not emotions that can co exist with laughing at things and we as the society were having come a mental break down an that that that is actu is happening right here becaue we should all beable to laugh at this thing this and and this is one of the things that i've found can of holarious about the rap song that tomc donalds and i release which is now number one world wide on the ieting trartes the number one song on the planet that is holarious i mean that is that is the best cultural troll of all time i i do not mean to explain the joke gueyes but i'm look at me i am not a rapper i have now ambitions to be a rapper in fact if two weeks ago you had done a pull of people who knew even my name and askd what is the thing benthcro as least likely to do it would probly be that is on that is why it is funny and yet you are already starting to see people fofre getting angry at the song people who cannot laugh at the very idea li it is ut it is a joke it is a jit is funny yent i'm na chalked tat up to the fact that social fabric is breaking down and that is having some really diliterious effects on all sides of the political lale lak a cross the political ile for example the the weird cultural break down that we are having now over tailor swift what the hell ok a tailor swift and travis celsy theire romance basically being a a plant by the an a fell or by her stage mantures whatever is a funny idea it is funny at's a joke we can all laugh at that because tailor swift to spent per entire life in music two wing songs about how she has a horrible history of men an breaking up with very famous people and what if she really is in a sincere romance ot the splenden we all wish the best for her n that is fine and by the way if tailor swift actually does marry travis kelcy and then' op having babies there will be a tailor swift baby bobes tat's how stupitter culture is an we all take pop culture to seriously s tere'l be a bunch of thirty year old women who suddenly tocide that is oke to put their feminous boneifieties on the shelf and get married to a man and then have babies if tailor swift to sides that it is okade to do and she stops acting seventeen year old girl in a thirty four your old woman's body in any case the whole stick is really funny thre's whi been making jokes about i madn jokes aba ditans the aniffell started showing her up in the scy box an chuse le go mi got i lov football about and it is just all ridiculous it is supercilly but the joke can never jut stay the joe because people hate each other too much and you cannot even joke about tailor swift and the politicisation of tailor swift and travis celse is a mens i'll ake a joke about tailor swift and travis celsy or you will or some one else on the right wel unless woll cause you hate them right ase you hate them and think t no because there celebrities and celebrities are funny and the whole thing seems really stagy and maybe it is real and again if it is good for them but i'm allow to make a joke about roger god ell asassinating em our jaction to make sure that travis celse gets into the superable something at really high ritings as he proposes two tailor swift on wondy and then sho rejects in right to break up song that is that is o ka we get's more on this in just one secand first if you are me there is not a day that goes by you do not call or tect om one you careabout my friends a pure talk are making it easier and

tailor swift because there suggesting that tailor swift is a plans the see i e twenty years ago its orgnamac tailor swift o star ay knowhat else were gin to orgama craft an entire an entire football will ead and then we are going to from youth breed an incredibly talented tight en and then we are going to fix up these two in perfect alinement just in time to reelect a dotering old man roumbuf that is what we are going to do what they why lhik can we is let us just laugh it is o ka it is o ajust laugh everything is funny eh yes politics and life in general is tragic comedy i politics is hysterically funny when viewed from on one lends and then deeply tragic when viewed from another tbecause politics can have such an impact on all of our lives but if you will lose the comedy that really is not because this is not funny stuff you are losing the comedy because you do not the people hoar around you you dn't the country you'r in you do not the people wo are existing this may be the funniest time in the history of american politics just on a raw level this thing is fricken hysterical i'm star jst a gomen o it is all very seriou whn weng me get the seriousissies in moment but i'd to say that its okey for every to lighten up and laugh a little bit oqe ave donald trump who is a real estate magnate whose president of the united states once and is a stands up insult comic running against a vegetable and in the iddle of this we have projected all of this on to a football star dading a pop star in the middle of the anafell playoffs and pretending this has world historical importance which is does not the neaor times by the way jumping all over this the fulmanation surrounding the world's biggest pop icon and girl frend of traus celsy the chiefs stars iden reach the stratus phere after canti city made it to the superboll for the fourth time in five years and the first time since miss swift joined the teems ontrage the conspiracy theories coming out of the make america gratagan contingent were already legion thand the swift is a secret agents of the pentagon that shofs bullstering per fan basin preparation for indorsement a president bidns reelac or the chin mister celsiara contrived couple essembled to boostana fell or coli vactines or demo crats or whatever gav that last rone account of that that might be right that the contrived couple part becaus again tailor swirts that sort of a history with this stuff apparently this has now taken the form the ther again yout he always have to doubt these sort of anonymous reports especially from rolling stone wich is not a credible source but again for the humor effective at i'miscunery to because it is it is kind of hysterially funny according to three people familiar with matter trump loyalists working on or close to the formor presedent's campaign long time trump atlies an writ we media and an array of outside advisers to the ex president have long taken it as a given that swift willeventually ndorse bidon but apparently members of magalan's upper crust are plotting to declare a holy war on the pop magastar especially sians up publicly backing the emocrats in the twenty twenty four election behind the scenes trump has reacted to the possibility a biding in swift teeming up against him this yeur not with alarm both an instant projection of ego in recent weeks the former president has told people in his orbit that no amount of ailess celebrity indorsements will save bidon that of course is true trump has also privately claim tees more popular s swift get that part mih be true and if that is really buny that is lix superfunny again guis maybe the predicut to us rebuilding a social fabric in this country is to be able to laugh at funny things but here is the thing nobody's laughing and that by the way is one of the reasons why jobidon is down in dums as the social fabric breaks down jobidon doing the trust me routine when it comes to politics no longer helps in no longer helps comedy requires trust and dos political success and jobidon is not have trust right now comedy is in and by the way archobidons twenty twenty four prospects are is a tough new swing state pole out for jobidon from business insider or a bloomber business rather and morning at consult that shows in the swing states donal trump is now up forty eight to forty two forty eight t forty two that is a biglee the precentage of voter saying that emigration is their top issue went up in six of the seven state sixty one per cent a voters o blame jobidon for the borter crisis only thirty eight percents he re publicans in congress these are bad numbers for jobidon truly bad numbers that same pole again the is a swing state polees to the states the matter because who cares what people in california think that states artya foregone conclusion who cares what alabama thinks already aforegone conclusionts the swing states thet matter basically the selection is gon to come down sai three states as het usually does those three states was tonson michigan pennsylvania that is wat it can to come down to donald trump is going towen aerizona donals from is going towin georgia the other states michigan wright now he is in the lead pennsylvania he is trailing wisconsin it is at ad dize thes gin be a very tightalection anybody things thay can be a blow outright now the evidence just not there for it but the fact that its stite is almost solely due to the fact that jobidon is a deep lan popular precident who has reached trust with americans welget to more on this in just one

of the folling places is going in the right direction or in the wrong drection or city or town right direction fifty two per cent wrong track forty eight per cents what is that mean an means that people kind of arolcay wit thair local governents but they are really unhappy with the national governments jobidon's favorability rating in this pole in the swing states is currntly at thirty eight per cent that is not a reelect number that is not even remotely in reelect number donald trum by the way is curently at a forty six per cent approval rating ed which is hir on jobidon in the swing states jobidon has lot of probens and he is exasperbating those probems with bad governments which of course is why the border continues to matter jobidon continues to trit out there in suggest that the border crisis which continues to to simmer that border crisis is about him not being givenough power which of course not true because that borcrisis did not exist whle donal trumpess president then jobidon came en as we have explain many times and as we explain an our new border documentary available of or daily wirepluss jobidon has the executive authority tobasically prevent the border from collapsing the way that it has but jobtdon is still trying to blame it on republicans as though he needs to be given legislative power in order to do things by the way tha thit is an amazing statement coming from the same presient who has declared the unal latteral executive ability to releve student lons at and force you to get a axine those are all things that jobidon says he can do with presidential power but the one thing he cannot do apparently is close the border which is a specifically delegated power that he already has legal authority nay legal obligation to fulfill here is jobidon telling a wi o gare not that that is not true he has the power he coul o it literally right now but he is not and everyone knows it which is why his border numbers are absolutely horrifying now democrats oure trying to make the claim that is republicans oare wholthing up more border power for jobitdon and i's not working particularly well the'r something to blamed on al trump for ithe'r trying to say that trump is scuttling what would be an amazing bordelna heres the thing i cannot analyze the borderdeal beausihave not seen the border deal have you you have not corract because no one has how do you expect me to say whether the border deal is good or bad it coun be worse than the statust quall if jobidon wich jist an force the lall but perhaps the proper republican play in the face of a bad deal is to walk away from the table and say that jo bid needs to enforce the laws that are currently on the books that seems to be the current republican play democrats are trying to claim that that is a trump thing that is not a trump thing if the border bill that is on the table is bad then its bad and you cannot expect thet their bunch of senators who frankly a kind of a that senator haven'n cramer of north to coda for example good senator senterton's lank for voklohoma good senator on many issues they keep saying things whele we need this bordeal i do not know whether we need it until i see it i cant again trust has been violated trust has been broken i have no clue whether the border deal that you want jobidon to sign is good or whether it is bad republicans out there trying to stump for a bordeal that no one has seen that is on conto make a lot of headway which is why presumably speaker myght johnson is sanglasson were not stopping the borderdeal to help trump i have a majority in the house of three seats a that that that republican majority's extremely slim nenks as i'm not going to bring a bill up that is going to get immediately rejective e are proposed when i's called h ar to it is good bill jus pass it here is the speaker of th house make johnson she isn morshus cordoan tenin by commen co usten can an ans fol tan co tan colsor and o se tfyn coes toholanon campin no mono that is absurd we have a responsibility here to do our duty our duty is to do right by the americant people to protect the people the first at most'tbor job the fetal government is protected citizens we areout doing that under president biden weare it we have only a tiny as razor then actually a one vote majority raht now in the house our our majority is small we only have it in one chamber but we are trying ot to use every outs of leverits that we have to make sure that this a issue is address i have talk to to e farm president trump about this issue at length and om and he understands that he understands that we have a responsibility to do here the president of course present trump wants to secure the country cand the polls are against jobidinhere which is wire notsing republicans give ground to jobidn and the shunit give ground to gou by meanwhile democrats are busy in the house trying to fin alhandro maorcas the secretary of homeland security who keeps te claring and the border is in fact securee and is not in fact open when in reality the catching releas policypers a by this administration means that the borders effectively open se republicans have been pursuing in impeachmen of alhandro mericas here is representive mark green saying that mercas has no respectv for the law now does that amount to a high crime or misdemeanor meaning there no crime is really allege my general view of impeahment is that you should allege a crime however democrats didnitpeachtonal trump twice without actively alleging a crime there is that for just coning use inpeachmen is of political toolitsgood for the oose s good for the gander and alehandro maorcas is absolutely not forfilling his constitutional oath to uphold the waw to day is a grave day we have not approach this day or this process lightly secretary mericasis actions have forced our hand we cannot allow this bordercrisis to continue we cannot allow fentinal to flood across toour border or criminals to waltz in undetur awe cannot allow a cabinet secretary with no regard for the separation of powers i the rule of law to remain in office that is why to day we present this committee with the articles of impeachment against secretary alehandrof my arcas meanwhile of represent dangolman whos first and foremost on the trump impeachmen tranmens o this ky actively participated in the trump in peachment both of them actually and tat he says it is demeaning to the institution to im peach marcas i'm sarry i think were well beyond the demeaning of congress what you are upset about is that secretary my orchasts recended prior executive orders that were working and you have a right to be uset about that and yu have a right to talk about that and you have a right to express your dissatisfaction in any way you choose and you have a right to make that case to the american people that they vote secretary my orchasts and this and this president out of office in november if that is ultimately w hat the people believe but you do not have a righde to de mean this institution to bastardize the impeachment claus of the constitution to belittle the standard of constitutional impeachment to such a degree that you cannot even produce a legal membo in support of your articles of impeachment that do not existint history and do not exist in the law ok again you invoking the law when you literally did not even a ledge crimes against onnal trump before im peachingham twice is e pretty astonishing display of hypocrisy i the borderissues cunning against jobide bottom line we

to be really bad that there've bena hundredand sixty five attacks on american troops between october seventeenth and january twenty nine ranging from seria to a roch to jordan to the red se obviously and jobiden really has no plans to do anything about now you ontomace the case of wo do not need forwar deployment of all f these troops in these places that is fine i'm opens that argumet i'm open to the itea that we do not actually need as many bases as we have currently in for example seria if we do not need as many bases we currently have in in eroch but if you are going to have trops on the ground you defend the troops that you have on the ground that is the way that it works and then the other half that a quation is you allow america's allies to do the work that you are not capable of doing because you do not have the oots on the ground the intelligence gathering the terrorist fighting you allow souty to go after the hoothies in yemon you allow israel to go after his bella youill you take the chains off of all of your allies and allow them to do the dirty work that you yourself do not want to do that would be a a rational form policy jobidon has decided to do the oposit of both of those rein a for toploy bunch troops but not defend them and we are oing to ham string our allies in their pursuit of terrorism that that is that is apparently jobidn's plan now he just keeps over and over and over cand of telegraphing exactly what he says heis going to do yesterday he said i've decided what i'mn to do what whyning just do it i'n understandlike is it is get points for calling your shot this a big ruth at the world series aah i'm no an arm in i do now good for you dude maybe you should just do it an not to any o i'v thr any more punches that you love to telegraph apparently he told the press that yeu holds aron responsible in the sentence that they are supplying the weapons to the people who did it i'l get thank you for that vague formulation president biding hearing up oall righty well i'm i'm just going to point out right out that to your sense of responsibility has mounted to nothing far all youhave done is exascerbated the probise of the run they continued get morgressin becaue you'e doing nothing senter o tom cotton of course yo come a member of he military markinso he says tha the way you ashually do detorrents is through you note detring people i knowed super complicated i've laid out the cenarios which option to rechoose bill you laid out for options for how we could retaliat againsteron at that a fifth which is all of the above ther's to be devastating military taliation for the targeting of american troops in jordin a friendly nation to cross international borders leaving three dead americans and more than three doesan wounded and some of those bill or are in grave critical condition as well this is not an anomaly for aron this is what they have been doing for forty five years but they have amped it up under jobidan beforeham brocoboma because there the obomabinn forein policy has been one of a pecement and conciliation we have to totally reverse that policy starting with retaliatory strike strike nail and continuing beyond that to insure that we are no longer trying to brive ty tollus with dilings of dollars wer not looking the other way wheneve they cheat on sanction and we are certainly not in a tolerate even the slihtest provocation aganst our troops in an itteleast anything thell else will simply in vite more tac and by the way i agree and is tom cotton with donal trum dons froms policy was that after a you as arbasin rock was attack by ronian proxy forceis in late twenty nineteen early twenty twenty down from killed costom solymoney he top goods force aronian terror official he kill himalis an rock and aron vout massof retaliation into nothing heus a turns out you noderon does not likening punch directly in the face they do not it at all as i'v ben taying for quite a while here it turns out tha deterents requires you to detern meanwhile jobidon is resting his campaign on the supposed evils of nonald trump and a lot of that is predicated n the legal charges an honestly the more the headlines appear about donal trumps legal charges the less effect they are going to have they willas fasing for cases with ninety one charges that looks political prosecution i'm sorry that is what it looks an looks particularlke political prosecution when several of these cases are clearly trumped up or falling apart the januar sixth case in washington d c is a stretch of the law every which way the fanny willist case in georga is in attension seeking ploy by fanny willis in a in a legal stretch of reeko that does not even really a ledge the underlying organization to do the criming which is what you require for rego charge not only that fanny willis is now caught up in her owns candal because it turns out that she hired as a prosecuteor personal no prosecutorial experience whis she happens to be slipping right now that that that turns out to be randent paid hem bunch tax paredollars wont on cruised with them s that happens to be really awkward ill get to more on this in just

down in florida an that case donum crum can just pointed hely clent and politically speaking all this looks political persecute not only that it looks thoroughly this doc is a political tool of the bied administration the most obvious and insane case of this is the charging of prolife demonstrators over theyare blocking of an entry twa tennessee abortion facility in twenty twenty one here is film of what it looked when these supposedly evil violent terrible people where outside an abortion facility in tennessee in twenty twenty one they are being charge with charges that would give them up to aleving years in prison they were accuse by the pritmanof justice o violating the called face act and zivil rites conspiracy violation people civil rights for a protest that tok place in a hallway outside of a mount juliet abortion provideor march fifth twenty twenty one as you will see this group of demonstrars gathered on a second floor of an office building in the hallway outside the carifan health center clinnic the grup prade and sang hyms and urged women shrung up to the linnic not to get abortions here is what that look a man ro an wow frightening terrifying stuffhere absolutely terrifying the verdict was delivered on the fifth day of the trialge took place in nashal one ofthe government s ku witnesses was caroline davis woman who is arrested with the group at cariffam during her testimony dav is claims had a change of hart about attending the protest and that her rational side was in the toilet at the time for participation she said that you changed her mind over time that being indicted by the federal government terrified her apparently some people talked to the police one of ieo showed one parts has been telling another to speak in love to a man with his girl friend who shown up and thattomon's baby was a gift from god and tum now these people ore gongto face eleven years in prison for all of this for this for the brutal violent terrible activity seeve cramptin whos thomas more society senior council and turning for one of the people trartza quote or discipline withthe outcom this tu peaceful demonstration by entirely peaceable citizens filed with prayer hem singing and worship oriented toward persuading expecting mothers not to aboart their babies unfortunately the biding to partmen of justice decided to characterize these peaceful actions as a fellany conspiracy against rights to intiminate and punish the people charged and other prolife people and people of fate crampton suggested the bidans deojases pattern of arresting and proscuting peaceful prolife advocates is disturbing and of course that is true remember this s the same administration that basically decided not to charge huge numbers of people whowere involved in the black live's matter riots that did two billion dollars and damage in twenty twenty this the same administration tat is basically decided to facilitates shutting down of highways in democratic party has as absolutely in major city facilitated to shut down of airports to shut down of highways by protesters who been sometimes assault the police but these antia worshin protestors sitting in a hallway and singing that is the violent stuff that is the truly threatening horrifying terrible stuff you wonder why somany re publicans and many people general y are this bi in doja if they'e inditing trump o ka are resposed to take that superseriously this deoje the same teoja that says tha this sort of activity i e standing outside n abortion clinic and non violently singing hymns that deserves eleven years in prison or if you are grammam and you walked through the capital building on ganuorsic on not wone the people is violent now won people assalting th police officer you are just granmam and youare stupidly walking through th capital building on genuor six we will track you down and we will put you in jail and well puyon jail for as long as humanly possible because

the commass squad now that the the radicals in congress we are talking bout all the best people the people h media love the beople thay put on the cover of rollingstone magazine with nancy blozy turns

that you should pay for your security if your quorry bush i'm she then claims obviously that it is because republicans a rasis that she is being targeded the beautiful thing about being member of the

representatives we deserve when i said before that that politics is high comedy it really really is now that is only one member of the squad having a really bad week another member of he squat having a superbad week is illhan omar illhan omar apparently was giving a speech at some sort of even for local somallies and during the speech she said some things and play little b of the clippits in somalli i do not speak somalli obviously she claims that the transcription of the speech the translation here in the clippe to when viral was off we here at daily wire we actually went too a translation service and paid ourselves to have it translated and i'm in a read you the transcript of the relevant portion of what she said because it is absolutely wild and pretty certainly violates hor oath of office here is illhan omar the worst person in the american congress i'm an the anhiasamalia ham walamamaaliinaan liklda maohami ha lit the su thelala o ca sin read you our transcript that we got from in actural translation service because again i want make her tha were accurate in our representation of what illhan almar actually said here here is the full translation of the sagments of the clip tat as been going vi ral on acts quote we are somemalis we are people who love each other we might talk behind each other's back to times but we are people who counts on each other as brothers or sisters and know that they are muslems and samalis we are people who help each other an others as well and take sides with each other a few days ago we heard the news about some people claiming to be samali's getting into an agreement with thetheopia hera she is talking about a breakway portion of samalia that is called samali land it is effectively been for last thirty years af self governing entedy becausesamalia is a disastr's own and samali land is actually pretty pro western samali land happens to be democratic its and a free market oriented andthere isben a lot of talk for a long time about samali land actually declaring independence and being given breakaway status thou us government far has not done that there is strong case to be made at that actually should happen she of course opposes because as we will see she describes her own legions to somalia she says i am embracing the fact that mahamidnoor knows more samali than i do i got calls from lot of people saying illhand you need to talk to hou us government what is the government of ou us doing my answerts their question was that the you us government will do what we tell them to do about it umwhat now the you us govrnmen wil do what we tell them to do that would be the plural we of what she as our describeing this to her words right samalis a muslems that uus government will do what we tell them to do about it and leke whatever conspiratorial nightmarebat she has put out there about jews she obviously engages in exactly that same kind of language with regard to her areas of orientation and s says all the jews are our hard cortgrup ut people control the american government also we control the american government oka lady she says we need to be confident in ourselves we live in this country it is the country we pay tax to it is the country that one of your daughters is in as long as i am in thou us congress know on will take a way in the samalisy or water and i will not support thou us government in supporting other people who rob us and in the first person plural heres pretty wild right who raa the us government as opposed to a rob us now she is not a she she she is a naturalized citizen of the unitisation a member of congress r she she is not a member of the samali political regine but she talks she is she says the lady you sent o congress knows about you and she feels our interests you all do to presen hasanche we are happy about you and the good job you have done thank you mister presid end foreminding every one that even if samalia is in crisis we are people of talens who know their country and whos country cannot be put in danger i want to congratulate the smali's in men sota and smali s everywhere and how you are all united and how you supported our president who needs our support the presidentin th united states is jobidon just cn point that out as ha republican the presient of the united states is in fact jobiden he is my presidents because he is the president of th united states and i'm an american i get's that is an amazing statement from illhan omar to bule of talked about denaturalizing departingandall the rest ashoupretty hard thing to do in the united states there is h glot ofree speech writes the detached to being in american citizen even for sang buchto nonsense in bad baggarbic however the oath of office does in fact require you to solemnly swar to support and defend the constitution of the united states to bear true faith and allegions to the stame to take the obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evation mean tis violate the oath of officing s at pretty strong cases this violates the oath of offics bad week for illhan omar who continues to be just the worst person in congress as on the end of the tory by the way there is more from the squad in the bad week for the coma squad continues germal boman who as a man intelligent he wants mistook a fire alarm for adoor opening apparatus apparently way back when he was promoting conspiracy theories about nine eleven notstrock conspiratorialism on the left and on the right has been growing in recing years at plenty conspirisy therison congress unfortunately on tuesday the daily beast published report about a blog the bomen maintain during his days and education is where he was a principl of nactural public middle school he publishd poems and brief essays there on personal political and petagogical concerns through twenty fourteen they found a mad twenty eleven post titled recapitulate it is a one hundred and thirty seven line free verst poems coms terrible which starts his recollection of world events por transitioning heavily into mededtations on various nine eleven conspiracy theories generally focused on claiming that they were not terrors tetached rather planned by some of their entities to to precipitate the war on terror boman is now made a statement he says wellover decato go as i was debating diving into a doctoral degree i explort wide range of books films and articles across a wide swath of the political spectrumen peand process mythougs in a personal blog that few people eve red here is a some of what he what he suggested he said two thousand one planes used his missils target the twin towers thirty menutes lator both buildings collapsed on to themselves later in the day building seven also collapsed multible explosions heard before in during the collapsed allegidlate two other planes the pensagon pensylvania high jack by terrors minimal damaged on minimald refound watch loose change and zitguis then share your thoughts we blamed osama wen to warnarock captured s and om killed him been laden his affganst we went to war there to well that is some amazing amazing deep thoughts there from gemal boments again the squad having a bad week but again i do blame the squad for their own stupidity ma llisin corruption i blim the people voted for them is their fall that shun a voted for them in the first place and meanwhile in the least shocking news of the day it turns out that harvard's diversity chief is also guilty of platerism remember that time that the harvar president cloudinga was guilty of loss and loss of platrism and then entit up losing her job whill turns out now according to the nearic post harvard university's chief diversity and inclusion officer has been hit with dozens of plagerism alligations tied to her aconemic work including one claimate she fail to properly site her husband's studhef just plager hasn yourwn husband ur mu the iviley school is handed in an onimous complan on monday listing at least forty examples of alleged plagerism by sherry an charleston dating back to two thousand nine according to the washington free beacon according to the beacon charleston allegedly quoted or paraphrase a dozen scholars without attribution in her two thousand nine distritation af the university of michigan and actually took credit for a study that her husband wrote in two thousand and twelve well done to harvard which again ifyou are making the case the diversity is our strength you nito actually higherd people do not platerize that would tha would be the first the first barrier to overcome he diversity is not our strength argmen ould be highed people who are competent and non platerist that would be the place that

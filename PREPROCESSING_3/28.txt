yesterday afternoon governor graggo abbot of texas issued a letter basically announcing t of the state of texas was going to start enforcing the border they ben doing this for a while they put a bunch of thencing in the iddle of the reo grond barriers the mill the rail ground to brend people from crossing the bord of the federal government has objected to that they have used raisor wire in state parks that are on the national border and the federal govrnment has objected to all of that well yesterday gregg abbot looking at the crisis that has been created by jobiden on the southern border issued what is a rather historic letter or can go through it in its details because what we are watching is now a constitutional crisis that is created entireally by joe biden and his evil activities on theboar and they are i amsorriits it is an evil thing not to enforce the border of your country to purposefully say that you are going to leave the border wide open which is what jobden has done i been down to the border it is wide open to facilitate dabt to basically incentivizes the drug cartells to poor millions of people into the united states is a bad thing it is jobidon abandoning his constitutional duties it is jobidon abdicating the presidency of the united states it is an evil for the president of te united states to do those things thou be the equivalent of a mayor of a large city simply announcing that they are not going to police crime any more the fundamental duty of the federal goernment is to protect the people of the united states o america and to protect the borders of the united states o america that is why it is a federally mandated duty for the for the government of the united states to do that that is whites a federal issue and not a state issue and jobidon has nononly signally failed he has done the opposites of good he is facilitated all of this in the estimates on the umber of ou legal emigran to ave entered the country it ranges from a low the low would be six million people have entered the country illegally under jobiden therere certain estimates that put that upwards of ten million there is no real way to know because of course thei're munch people who ran across the border and godawayand tose are unknown godaways they are known godaways and unknown godaways but jobidon has facilitated all this with terrible border policy it is wrong it should be against the law again the federl government has one job and one job only in the in the end and that is to protect you to protect your rights there are already laws on the books that prevent illegal emigration those laws have been in place for decades in the united states it is up to the president of the united states to enforce those laws and again it is worth noting here that leaving the border wide open is not just incentivizing the mexican drug cartells to move millions people across the southern border it is insentivizing the mexican drug car tells to move tons of fhentinel across the southern border which is being used to it kill effectively a hundred thousand americans a year depending on the numbers that re using when it comes to drug over dos those drugs are pouring over the border gan this is all facilitated by jobiden's policy this was not a problem during the latter years ofthe trump administration just was not and it is under jobinan it is a manufactured cri sis ecaus jobidon has decided just legally speaking that whos can get rid of remain in mexico heis going to suggest that if you arrive on america southern border throw up their hands and say i am here becas i feare to go my home country then we have to proscess you and release you into the interior of the united states then seventy two hours that is basically how jobidon's border policies work and he has staffed ninetee per scent of bore patrol on bussing and administrative duty leving the rest of the boare wide open for the mexican drug cartells he is turn boare patrone to a ferry service for illegal emigration can ask members o boardpetrol they will openly tell you that that is what they are now it use to be that it was their job to track down people who are legally crossing the border said they could be detained and then to ported and now it is their job to basically act as ti facilitation service for he legal entry into the country why is jobidon doing this and tht there must be ration out because he is committed to open borders that he is scuttling his own desire for you crane aid for israel aid for tiwuan aid in order to keep those borers open re publicans hav proposed fixes on the border that would for example most im portant fix would be not only the reinforcement of reman in meicohch rs a trump irapolicy that jobidon refuses to in force which would simply say that if you are plying for asylum yef to wait in mexico while that asylum request is process which would mean that most of those people are geting in the country as posed to now they arrive and then again we detend them for five seconds andthen release them and they cuonc whal weit in the interior in the never show up again is not just that jobidon's asylum policies they nee to be fixed in order to claim asylum in the united states you should have to show the burden proves on you to show that you actually require asylum right now you on' lou have to make a colorable argument that you require asylum you just claim that you do and then release you to te interor gh ar too which is the republican bill that would shore up all this jobidon is rejecting all aspects of that even if it means scuttling the aid that you crane actually needs in order to maintain its war against russian invasion why would he be doing that there only a couple poss wile reasons one is obviously political that jobidon and alotof democrats believe that many of the llegal emigrants are crossing the border are going to eventually become democratic voters and for all the people horsanguell you note they they cannot vote caus their legal imogrants you do not need the ellelimigrants to vote all you need to do is for them to get married they have a bunch of young single men who are crossing the border all they have to do his maryan american citizen and theyare now sponserd for citizenship they cannot get their green card which moves them toward citizen plas there is the bet that de democrats are making that eventually somewhdy's getting amnesty all these folks and they will become american citizens at which point theyre gin a vote for democrats and why would doe mocress not think that given the fact that many of the people whare crossing the bore right now are chancing jobidon's name i men there is vidio of it wore may be it is because jobidon is ideologically captured by his ratical left flank a radical left flaink the believes that america is in fact a guilty country on the world stagian therefore has some sort of moral duty to open its borders wide to anybodyd who wants to come into the country whatever the reason jobidon has abandoned his duty as president and all of this is the predict to bors also the brigtoabla result is that the state of texas is looking at this theirs and we are getting smac in the fates by illegal imigration weare being told that we have to basically swallow it when the federal government decides not to enforce the law and this raise the buncher really deep legal and constitutional issues but we have to lead with the moral because here s the reholity gobiton could solve this to morrow by simply enforcing the border and by the way the american people should solvice by not reelecting jobidon that would solve the stoo we at to warn this in just one second but first foks twenty twenty four is going to be a wild ride we have of course already seen the impact of inflation the gaspomp an the grocery store the dollar is losing its purchasing power and has lost a lot of purchasing power over the past few years whe mask you a question how are you

too tex pend to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eighte to protect your savings and claim your eligibility for a free sign copy of the authoritarian moment to day yesterday grag abbot governor of texas put out as statement heres what its at quote the federal governmen has broken the compact between te united states in thestates the executive branch of the united states is a constitutional dut to enforce federal laws protecting states including emigration laws on the books right now president biton has refused to inforce those laws and he is even violated them wthe result is that he as smashed records for a legal imigration despite having been put on notice in a series of letters one of which i delivered him by hand president biton as ignored texas is demand that he perform his constitutional duties president biton says gragg abbot has violated his oath to faithfully execute emmigration laws enacted by congress instead of prosecuting immigrants for the federal crime of a legal entry president bito has sent his lawyers into federal courts to sue texas for taking action to secure the border president biton has instructed his agencies to ignor federal statutes that man take the detention of e legal imigrants the effect is to a legally allow that onmasperoll into the united states he is right about that that is the called catchin release program instead of detaining people until they actually have thei'r asylum hearing instead they have an initial hearing and then they are released on their own recognizans into the interior of the united states and again it is no more than a week i mean that that the the average right nougpri seventy two hours what i've been told by people at borter patrol gregg abbottes by wasting tax par dolars to tear open texa's border security in for structure president biton has enticed illegal imigrants away from the twenty eigt legal entry points along this states southern border bridges were nobody drounds and into the dangerous waders of the real grond which of course is true one of the thing drug cartells are doing right now is they do not actually want illegal imigrants procest at these stations they want to flood certain border points with th illegal immigrans as to draw the border patrol to those areas where it is their duty to care for the illegal i migrants are entering the country and claiming asylum and then what is that tdo wealth you take all the people who are spaced along the border and there are tamminy bord patrolegents heve then spaced along the border trying to maintain is on miles of the border and then you centralized them at this point right here which is where all the illegalemigrants are rushing across not at border patrol station well what is that d lease the rest of the border wide open and that is when you get illegal emigrants quif infact or drug smugglers being shifted across the border by the drug cartells greg abot sas under presidetei bidans lawless border policies more than six million y legalemigrnts have crossed our southern border in just three years this is more than te population of thirty three different states in this contry the illegal refusal to protecto states has inflicted on president at harm on the people all across the united states he continues james madisand allexander hamilton and the other visionaries wrote the os constitution forsaw that states should not be left to the mercy of a lawless president who does nothing to stop external threats artells smuggling millions of e leglemigrans across the border that is why the framers included both article for section for which promises the federal government shol protect each state against invasion an article one section ten cluss three whith which acknowledges the states sovereign interest in protecting their borders the failure of the bi dan dministration to fulfill the duties in posed by article for setion for his triggerd article one section ten cluss three which reserves to the state the rght of self defence for these reasons i have already declared an invasion under article one section ten clus three to invoke texas's constitutional authority to defend in protect itself that authority is the supreme law f the land an superseedesto any federal stactiots to the contrary the texas national guard the texas to partment o polic safety another tecas personel our acting on that authority as well as state law to secure the texas border o ca one big questions here is what dos that means lets start with the very legal basics here gregg abbot has done nothing to violate the law thus far nothing heis not violated federals federal law not violated state law people whoare accusing him of having done thus far by having texas state troopers qut out raizor wire ind state parks they do not not their talking about the supreme corder rules recently that the federal government has the capacity to withdraw the razor wire but they said nothing about whether the state of texas is allowed to put up the razor wire thesubrimgord did not rule that it was i legal for the state of texas to for example put barriers in the real ground they jus rule that the federal government is allowed to remove those barriers they removed an injunction against the federal government right there it did not say what texas was doing wat the legal in anywayso anybody whos selling you different the media to day that texas is doing something illegally that is not true now f texas were tu prevent he federal government from actually dismancelling the razor wire for example then you start to get into some diceet legal issues let us get to exactly what jobidon is doing here that is facilitating all of this first of all he is exploiting in the law for his own agenda rght he he is e's exploiting it now he is folloing barockobo is example in doing this he is been using executive action to stop prosecution of called dreamers right thits the same thing that that brakobomited a daka that ifer to action for child to rivals program that is been ticking around the legal system since twenty ten and some people have ruled tht a legal and others have ruled ed not e egal in twenty twenty the suprem cort rule that the trump administration could' even resind dack at least not the way they did it which was a ridiculous ruling thy said that that brocamama could actually issue daka which effectively legalize millions of eallyliegrans but donal trump culdn't reverse that policy by executive action it said that he would fail to go through the administrative proceed your's act is a much a mumbo jumbo but is really rally silly ce but it is certainly a very weird legal motion that the presideten just has the simple ability to not enforce the law that is a very weir legal idea in fact in nineteen seventy five for example there was a federal case in which the president of the united states refused to actually spend money that had been alicated by congress for prarticular purpose and the supreme cort found that he could not do that that if the that if the congress said you must spend ex dollars the president could not spend half of those dollars he had to spend ex dollars if the executive branch is charged with executing the laws then why in the world with the executive branch ofe the power to not execute the laws that the can clam that they need more resources but that is not what yobidan is really claming right now he says he wants more resources in order to facilitate mor illegal migration not anor to actually in force americas southern border causen't want more policing power on the southern borde in any real way that is wy re publicans are objecting well gets a more in this in just one second first let' say that you re climbing up te empire stake

save that is policy genius dot coms lash apuro that brings us to a deeper issue and it is it is sort of a little bat down the road from whre we are right now because we have not actually got in their yabutit is the one that sort of in everybody's mind and that is whether the state of texas can unal laderally in force emmigration law even if the federal government wants them not to the best compeere is from two thousand ten that you are the state of arizona pa asto law called espe ten seventy you may remember this the airizon governor at the time was woman af jan brewer and that law contain for provisions the arizonal law the first provision was that it created a state law crime for being unlawfully present in the united states as yous the federal crime four the you legal emigrans to be in the united states that would be proscued by the federal government than you be deported woud be a state law crimes arizon could jail you for being unlawfully present in the united states second if created a state la crime for working or seeking to work whel you are not authorized to do it is a federal crime for people to use tha falle social security number for example t o worky legally in the united states thes created at a comparative state law crime based on that third it required state and local lawficers to verify the citizenship or alien status of any one who is lawfully arrecetor detains sos an anti sanctuarycity policy is the arizona esby ten seventy law that ar not going to thesuprim court as ar talking about it a thaderal quired that if you are cob and you pull somebody over you have to check whether they are legally here or not and then fourth the law authorized warrntless arrests of aliens believed to be removable from the united states you coul just arrest people and then presumably you would urn them over tothe federal govrment the question on the tables the the abominadministration suito erizona to stop them from putting this law in place in the same way that currently the by administrations tryung to stop texas from enforcing bortal law the question on the table was whether federal pcreemption prevented those laws from taking effect sthe federal preemption is the doctrine that under the supremacy claws of the constitution which says that the constitution is the supreme law of the land en a state law comes into conflict of te federal law the state law loses let say that the federal law says for example that it is criminal to to commit some sort of crime the state law cannot then exempt that sort of crime from prosecution by the federal government you cannot you cant just no the federal law and federal preemption actually lo but brought and that says that a federal law actually takes up a certain portion of the law if it occupies that portion of law the state laws cannot come into conflict with it the court in the arizona case found five three that items one to and four were in violation of the constitution those would be the state created laws than enforce the federal constitution the court did find for example that you could get rid of sanctuary status in in the state of arizona that you could force your state law in forcemen official to check a migration statisen or prot to ice but the court found that the federal laws on emigration prevented state laws that created crimes based on federal status which seems a weir decision a really wear decision because a fectively speaking what you are now saying is that be states cannot call the blaw of the federal government by enforcing laws that are already on the federal books if the federl govrnment says it is criminal to cross the lorder and you should be deported and the the state pas the law that says it is criminal to cross the borter using the federal definition and you will be deported or criminalize or il go tostate prison that that somehow in conflict with th federal law justice callea disagreed and this is the descent that is referred to in the letter from greg abbit and here is what he stated indesent to day's opinion approving virtually all of the ninth circuits injunction against enforcement of the for challenged provisions verizonal law te prive states of what most would consider the defining caristrt characteristic of sovereignty the power to exclude from the sovereigns territory people who have no right to be there the naturalization power was given to congress not to abrogate states power to exclude those they did not want but to vindicated sononthers what he is saying is that originally the reasontemigration wall was given to the federal government is because everybody at the beginnig of the republic was very much afraid of what is happen in the e ou where sate italy has open emigration policies and your hungary and you say i do not want all the semigrins coming to my country but th use says no no you must if one of these countries is wide open than you have to be wide open the federal government took control of this as to make homogenists emigration law round the united states there would be freedom of travel and freedom of residency inside the united states but nor for that o that bargan to be upheld the federal govrment actually does hae to police the border nd tha's particularly true enough laws on the books saying tht the border must be police it is one thing if the federal government has passed laws saying we have basically open imigration at this tine because presumbly those federal laws our part of a constitution thots signed on to by the states it is another thing for the federal government to have laws on the books saying you must police the border and remove illegal imigrants and the federal government these ecoutdaom ranches says no where not gon to do it beas now you have abrogated the compact meanscolea said in that case in the descents said the reason the entire issue was federalized mas prevent open migration to one state from affecting all the states and that is basically whut greg abbit is arguing in this letter and he is right now that does not mean that the suprimcorts can o vindicate him beause after all the suprimcorvoted the other way in that arizona case we have no idea what the uprimcort will do here because the constituency of the supreme cart has changed since two thousand ten now that is argument number one is that basically the federal government has abrogated its constitutional duty and they must be forced to actually enforce the law but then he makes an a kind of unique constitutional argument and this one gets into just on a legal side some fascinating and controversal territory sprt that wit we get's more on this in just one second first here is a great new yars resolution you

decade at this point you should to genu sell dog com slash of puro to day that g and u c e l dot com slash shipiro to get started to day abbot asshu makes conv unique constitutional argumen here here is what he says he says that under articl one section ten closthery the state can invoke its constitutional authority to defend id citizens from invasion now bac could be as they say convat difficult controversial legal argument here is the actual text of artical one sextion ten clos three quote no state shell without the contents of congress lay any duty ofs hunage keep troops or ships of war in times of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with e foreign power or engageiin war unless actually invaded or in such iminent danger as will not admit of delay what was that meant to do what what is an invasion mean in that contect presumably atment the british show up in massachusetts with their gun bots and the massachousas militia has no time to respond thatif to getsogon i ment to do something righ'sit because what that what that is doing it saying the foreign policy of te united states is a federal question it is not a state question unless it is basically in exigent circumstance right's an urgent dangerous circumstance in which woe hve an actual foreign body that is encroaching over the border for example an attacking taxas for example the mexican cartells just aside one day tha uring walk over the bord with a ca forty sevens s cantexas defend itself of course texas does not have to call the federal government at least not unti afterward and they can shoot the exican drug cartolc members who constitute an invading army ca but what what actually abbot is doing is he is claiming that the massive illegal migration wave does not constitute an invasion in sort of a collokuheel sense why theway the uni say invasion meaning a a vast wave of people being facilitated in entry he is actually trying to site the waw under the constitution of invasion in order to apply to illegal migration which is again i think legally dicating the springports can have a tough time with that argument for example texas for example i think has a pretty good argument that they can to shoot down mexican cartoldrones rif the mexican cartells have drones over the border for example that is a military incursion into the united states texas should not have to call up the chain to shoute down the rones however can they just start capturing i legal emigrants and treating them as peo ws as you would during an invasion reat im if if if a mexican army cross the border and tex had to defend itself t would shoot people and take them pio ws is that realle the situation here very dificult to say that that is the situasion here see's not let us be real abothers it is not being treated as an invasion the are being treat as an invasion then prismalyolopula gettng shot on the border which is not exactly whats happening sagaon the better argument here that abbot is making is effectively that the federal government has abrogated its duty to protect the border and they shuld be forced by lawght to do that if they will not do it then worgan to do it the the argument that he gets to invoke invasion power in order to sort of defend the state against invasion i thing that to a litle but more legally dicy but here as i say this entire thing could be solved to morrow by joabidin enforcing border that is all and the stuff becomes absolutely inevitable it become absolatly inevitable if you do not protect the people of this country becase yuhave ade a political decision not to enforce the law people are can get mad andtherne to try to find ways to actually enforce the law and protect themselves you cannot leave people on protected what we are seing on the southern border rit large is what you are seeing in thew york subway system writ small which is if you re move the cops from the subway system and then you have criminals ore attacking people you argon to have people danuel penny who defend the people in the subway car from crazy people whor attacking them and if you leave the border wide open you are going to start having state authority stake guies if you are nonly we have to defend our citizens they are our citizens too they are not just federal citizens theyr state citizens it is our shop to protect them the way thas get solved is by jobie natunally enforcing the border o case they are couple a sort of historic precedens for what happens whn we hve a state federal stand off and and were not in that position quiht yet because again the state of taxas is not telling for example the federal government they cannot cut the razor wire it grag abbit has not prevented the entry of c b p on to state lands to cut the rasor wire there is directing new rasor wire which is totally legal the federal government has not deployed troops to wopen the southern border and the state government has deployed the tecta srangers to shoot at them or something can but how do these sorts of stand offs historically get sall because we have had stand off statefors of the federal government much more severe than this in the past wllget amore on this in just one second first yo ave a car your investing in but yo on't atuonally use well what you do instead with it is give it to cars for kids cars for kids hr's the people it the jingle

what exactly you waiting for call or vis it cars for kds dot org slashbend and get the ball rolling that is cars with a kay and the number for at cars for kids dot or slashmen he will take god carry you and your car basically theire two pabs one as the federal goermnt us to overruns the states which historically has happened a couple of times it happend obviously during the civil war an that it also happen during the civil rights movement both too good a fact by the way and the civil war wit is basicaly the states to arguing that the federal government did not have the power to inforce laws within their states regarding for example the fugitive slave act or rovision of the fugitive slave act they were afraid that the bas aly the federal govrnment was going to start freeing slaves in the south they said that violates the state compact a violates the state theory and the federl govrnment tad nnnot we have the power to do that becauseyou are violating the basic rights of human beings and we can we can we have to preserve the union and that is the fight o this ova orn federal government winds that fight obviously which is a good thing and then during the civil rights movement the had the same sort of thing and the aftermath of the passage of brown verses board by the supreme court ye had in segration of southern universities for example and people forget just how violent and stand offich a got the most famous examples in nineteen sixty two witht university of mississippi which is known also as old miss that there there wis eight there is a blackson named jarson's meredith who is the first black student whois admitted two ol mes and the governor of the state of mississippi tried to obstruct meritith from a tending and the federal goernment under jaff ka actualy achad to activate first the national guard and then they eventually had t actuvate thirty one thousand troops thirty one thousand troops to make sure of the campus state open the federal government refuse to compromise as they should of because again jim's meredith had a federal civil right to go to the university are not now again that is the federal government attempting to enforce law not the federal government attempting to ignore holaws that is a bitof a different thing can the only other example that we have that as ended a different way is the called nullification crisis of eighteen twenty eight in eighteen twenty eight the federal government passis a teriff it is a teriff that is designed against foreign goods that r manufactured because the idea was en protect the infant industries of the northes new manufacturing firms and tergin a pass a teriff that basely jacks up the cost of foreign goods ther are manufactured to make room for manufacturing in the north adthe southerns tates this is crapt we did not sign on to the constitution to be barred from importing manufactured goods and then have foreign countries retaliate against non manufactured goods from the united states which were typically southern product to the teriffs distproportionatey hat the south and typit disproportionately benefit on the north vice present and john sea calhoun twas a vicious race thas and the later make very similar arguments of regard to slavery but hery made an interesting constitutional argument he argued that the states had what he called the right of nullification what this meant is that if the state decided that the federal law had gone beyond the remet of the constitution states could simplly say no and refuse to in force it and not only re fuse to en force it could resist it now that action was not such an unusual position neighteen twenty eight that position had been taken for example by thomas jefferson who wrote in a a in a series of missives that became resolutions that are passed by states the kentucky in virginia in the laht eighteen century kebrot regarding the alien in sedition acts quote where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nollification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact cassus non foderas to nollifyht of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they' be under the dominion absolute and en limited of what is of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them another words if the federal govrnment decided the tomorrows can just violate that the constitutional pat in birst its boundaries that states could have right to resist that jims madison action made a similar suggestion at the time he is the father ofthe constitution hes to quote the constitution of the united states was formed by the sanction of the states given by each in it sovereign capacity it adds to the stability and dignity as well as to the authority of the constitution that it rests on this solid foundation the states then being parties to the constitutional compact and in teir sovereign capacity and follows of necessity there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated and an consequently as parties to it they must themselves decide in the last resort such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to required their interposition ant to fancy way of saying that states should be able to interpret whether the federal constitution is being violated in the federal government is breaking its bonds with the states and states can then resis now you can see how this exact logic was then used by the south with regard to slavery the south madethe argument a ladread scot that the constitution did not mandate the end of slavery or give the federal govrnment the power to abolish slavery or to curb slavery and that therefore they have the right to resist that now abrham lincon made the argumen that that was a wild misinterpretation of the constitution and the declaration of independence that was basically the argument atn again t this argument has early shades in this terrifight calhoun his vice president under andrja under a andr jackson at thes time gims of actually resignig the vice presidency in order to become a senator meanwhile jim's madison by this point had actualy reverse his position he said that to establish a positive and permanent rule giving such a power such a minority over such a majority would overturn the first principle of free government and i practice necessarily overturn the governmentitself you can see madisons were arguing against himself there at the earlier madison is saying well if the states cannot nullify federal law what stops the federal government from overunnin its foundaries and later madison is saying yes but if a state cannulify federal law what is the purpose the federal government is sir andrew jackson at this point as the presient nd he is a southerner he took the same position as madison which shocked everybody because he was of the south people thought he was going to take the calhoun position and an event honoring his own birthday jackson raised to toast to our federal union sand quote it must be preserved this can of shocking to everybody of the time and than i desember of eighteen thirty two he made his position even clearer with a very famous peace of writing called the nulification proclamation wher he said quote i consider then thet power to a no a law of the united states as sune by one state incompatible wat the exsistence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution on authorized by it spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded destructive of the great object for which it was form disunion by armed force is treason again now it is worth while to paus here and and take stock for second because the is a contrast between what jackson is saying about the enforcement of law here first of the boarder jackson was saying that because he was president he had to inforce with the legislature said which means the state had to listen to him he was not arguent that he could ignore federal law at the expence of the states that if a federal law was passed and th and the white house jus decided to ignore that federal law af the states wof then have to listen to it in any case things starts to really heat up in eighteen thirty three the governor of south carolina actually began organizing armed resistens and then congress pass somethingcalled the fore sbill which allowed the feds to send armed troops to en force teriff collections chectually ended up with an on almost preeceml war sifl warmos in the end what edned up happenings that the feds in t state both backdown an agreement was reach which eddned op being a compromise teriff basically the states used their power to leverage federal change those of the two examples what happens when states in the feds sort faced off one is the fedsst overun the states ad the other is they come to some sort of agreement in this particular case it is jopi hos refusing to enforce the law he is refusing two enforce the law it is that simple this is a political crisis created by teng not billial crisis it should not be a constitutional crisis in force the law in force the law protect american citizens these laws are all ready on the books the sort of stuff has can become more and more common more more inevitable when the white house

there a topish who for a lot of americans and it is amazing to me that yobidon thinks the trump it weak o he can just continu to run on all of these bad policies all the and he is banking on the economy somehow recovering enough for people not to feel terrible about it and thre's an economic report that came out in the last couple of hours suggesting that wages are now outpasing in flatin wic hould be very good thing for the united states but it does not mean that the inflation has been baked into the cake over the last several years has not had a massif impact on your price is tat the grocery sourcer for wagesare only now starting to out pases inflation he still lost money over the course of last several years under jobiden but he is thoping th economy's gon recovere to a certain extent he is also hoping that all of his foreign policy snaffoos our going somehow iron themselves out which is not going to happen plus jobiden happens to again be not particularly with it he is a very weak candidate a jobidn yesterday was endorsed by the ou a double which of course is not a great shok because the greatest scam in american life is the combined power of the ua double you and jobiden union power and the democrats are the single most corrupt scheme in american politic theyhave been for a long time tis particularly true of public sector unions you ad uble you of course not public sector unionst private sector uniont but they have help bankrupt america's car company's multiple times at this point of course the're indorsing jobidon whose basically suggested that the labor fhury of value ought to be mandated by law here is at the head of th a in dorsing i jobine yesterday i would put it this this simple the majority of our members voter for present bite and do you think the endorseman is it is a big reasen furtheout without the endorsement i mi they have more of them gone to trunp get about the demographicsancsuch i do not think ime i think an ko even going forward when you look at voth candidates a it is very clear whit is one supports working class people on which one does not a an bi one want two seple senteces jobidn that on the american worker and oll trun blamethe american worker im how exactly has jobidon help the american worker a jobiden has made everything more expensive for the american worker an again there is this sort of a tempt to to suggest that unions are the reason for american prosperity is completely a historical the economicdated to back that up are extremely scandy in any case the u a doubl ou indorse bind bind is basically figuring if i get the base on board i can be as bad as i'm wont to be as a president me he he is he is still campagning on by nomic yesterday who is out the campaning he said he is fundamentally changing the economy of this country yow we noticed it is not grate fundamenally c conomys country an everybody's get word abo lamena yes everybody's etting a little worried about it because it turns out that the greatness of america is that america is the world's first commercial republic and a tha's why we kick ass an literally visiday foreign country and you realized an america is the country of business for a recent america is awsome our free market economy is the envy of the world and should be is the driver of virtually all global growth i gisnan amazing place ou fundamentally changing it is not a good thing i will say jobidon did make a rather large buboo the other day he he he thoughthe was saying something i think jokingly and he actually ens up undercutting many of the arguments he himself is made he says that donald trumps thf threats o democracy because he is denying elections and then he went to virginia and suggested that terry mac colliff was the real governor of virginia which is weird since literally no one believes the terramicall iff did not lose to glen young kin o virginia no govner germc go the real governor termicallif he is not he is not the real governor he lost elections anialism it is fine if youre a democrat an jobidon again he also has troubles with his base is maybe one of the reasons he ratical on i migration he is trying to buy back sthe fact that members of his far left base really kina conos yesterday jobidn was speaking in he was protested about comosnex look res don jo none again he is done jumpi knowing how h says that we rok etre los as i o a o li i takes e parter ein the news jabbering about abortion but you knear the protestors there then the bet administration cannot doso disdessociated self from these wild left win protestors here is john kurby the actual presidential spokes person because creen john pars off letter job a saying that every one has feelings which is in exciting piece of news rothe fen no ir rembiner soncea very early going in this cokict we have been urgin ares really carparts to be careful precise we have talked about this goin casuallies and how we do not want to see any more we have urge them to takeit e different actions and they have responded to that adviseen and counsil he understands that there are strong feelings here on all sides a as yeu would expect he inhen o the strong feelings e again habut this hav a dump your wild left wingers and campain toward th iddle but yobidin again refuses to do that which is one of the reasons why he has a problem on his hands now he thinks that probem is solvable by donal trump that don trump is donal trump then donal trumple lose te election he is not ban gun win we election any more he is been gunton trom losing the election when he is really banking on is don trumping extremely polorizin particular with women in adindependent voters and there is some evidence for this new hampshire rather nickey haly per form decently rydamin sheshe performed strong against an incumbent president which is effectively how re publicans aur treating donal trumpet she performed strong with indepenitent democrats when you lok at the new hampstir primary results is we observed yesterday those those primary results are largely the effact of independence and democrats swiveling heavy for nickee haley and showing up and re publicans voting heavily for donal trump and whalf that gap emerges in the general lection it is a real problem for donald trumper he eus to win in dependence and he needs to win democrats he does need to do that in order to defeat jobidon and in order for that to happen donald trump needs to just point at joe bidon that is all he hases to do he an bidner plang a game of hold my beer it really is a mazin oh donal trump has to do is goingdus to tega he is daraba he is a bad brasident that is at and meanwhile jo bi natually is a bad president and ye saying dom stuff and doing dem stuff but meanwhile all jobidon thinks he has to do is point at donald trump and go whovso that is what this election i's probably going to be and then the question is which which canded is more likely to avoid jumping on the rake for bidin what that means is get out their less look a litle bit lessy nile look alitle bit let us crazy stop being quite sobratical moderate if your gn to run for this election pcychl successfully and if you are donald trump what that means is stop acting socrazy stop acting to wetlic ive you ack crazy you are going to alienate all these people with your personality whoare attracted by our policies gain in order for donald frum twin the election she only mes tos u point at jobidon but he he has to stop acting crazy i understand their lot republicans who when donald trump acts really aggressive and a little but crazy because they think ok ki will that hes just go hog wild on his opponent in the democratic on the democratside the iwle in the election cychl or gan go hog wild on on the enemies in order for that to work ye have to win nor if that is work ye have to win eh again he will go hogwild on jobidon the problem is that if he appears to be unstable in the process that is not going to help him and i got to say the wiy that e's attacking nickee haleyright now is not smart it is just not donald trump this primary's over of ket justatistically speaking the primery's done donald trump is the nomin he wont iwa he wont no hampshir going away he is gon a win south carolina going away this primary is over what should he do wit nickee haley he shuld icnornicke haley he shous starve focussing in on jobidon because everybody knows what this general election is and instead he is a doing the worst of donald trump he is attacking nickee haley not ybreally even based on policy but just because she has the temerity to stay in the race now listen do i think that it is a waste of time and money for her to stay in the race kind of i'mein she has the right to do it everybody is t riht to staying the race as long as they want by ron could t stayed in but they coo to stayed in nicke could state that is fine trumps the nominy he butt this this sort of wild at tack on haley as though this is something productive and useful is bizar to my hes diaman attacking her on policy beause again realistically speaking en here is the i've a dirty little secret free folks here is the dirty little secret donald trump on policy an ikyalian policy are supersimilar i know everyboy's i o no but she is a neeo conan he and he is a he is an anti war it she was his un ambassador he was hawkish on foreign policy when hewas the president of the united states from you oh my godwel she is she is soft on demo crafts when it comes to domestic put donal trump is softer than she is when it comes to abortion and spending a gon policy there is a solid case we made the donald trump is to her left now that does not mean that in terms of affect and in terms of militance the donald trump is to helefty's not ready's much more militans in his affect but agan donal trump is not making policy attacks on nickee haley he is basically making hannabal lector let me rip off her face attacks on nickey haley and the problem with that is not abat nickey haley the problet that i if you wish to win independent voters and suburban moms it you do not want a look a person who ranomly rips people's faces off at the super market that is not really the look thatyou are going for again donald trump nees to go run toabidns basement campagn from twenty twenty until he president again gav the reason i bring this up is because the last fortyeight hours have ben all media coveradge of donal trums treatmen of nicke haly this exactly widre in fact there ther're members of jobidon's campaign who have said this is the gui we want run against not trump tgenerally the guy who appeared at the press conference after after defeating nickey haley in the new hampshire primaries just to take a couple of examples after the nu hampshire rimary donald trump stands up and behind him is tim scott timscott has endorsed him now the reason'tim's got indorsed him is because dona trumps can be the nominy and timscott is thinking ookay maybe i'll be vpe or maybe'll get a cabinet pek or whatever man a lot of people of indorsed donald trumpet this point and you are yeu haven' endorsed him you' hie you on' indorsed people generally speaking he is goin to be the nomina what is donald trump do he immediately not only a tack nickey haley he just takes he takes tim scott's face and just mashes it into pe but there is a pie on the table he takes tim timscottin goes wam and just smacks his face directly into the pie caus he cannot resist the thing donald trump when it comes to his opponents is joffry he is king joffery from game of thrones he always has been if you bend the knee to trump ye you might have docaue you have nother choice but he will chop off your head regdy he will reduce you to chris christy going go christy got gu get on the payn chris gat an the nay bi that is who you be cum and that is why these sorts of they are not good for trump for get about what i think of them on a moral level and by theway i do not thnk it is great to humiliate people politically for no reason especially when the have indorsed you i jous do not think i do not understand the morality of the politics of it but on a political level i's this the imit lyc just take yourself out yourself for a second lis not iunderstandal o my audience loves trumpan will votefor om i'm an avote for trump agains yorbide right i agre with you also if you take i just analyzed analyzed the state of american politics raght now you are suburban mom living in michigan in a swing state and you have jobiden is very bat a policy and but you do not polow policy all that closely because let us be real at you are busy n have out a time when you mostly see is an old man dottering around and walking to walls the shangillis room but and then you see donald trump and donal trump is on your teethee just rippin people's faces off and you are oka if i've a trace between seenile and whild may be all choos you again that is not the twist you should make because the case that i've made for trump is that basically politics is a coffee filter an be grounds that that the stuff what whatever see you have the the cofee filter right at the coffee in there and then got the liquid they ren a pour in the case that i've made is that the liquid that you are pouring in with jobidon is not only a toxic liquid the toxicity of the liquid is small enough to escape the filter thet wil comes out from the bottomof the filter it is a bunch of actual toxic sludge an's really bad and dangerous the case that i'v made for donal trump is that donal trump yat he he is got the liquid is basicaly not even a a a pure mix the liquid that e's pouring into the coffee machine is basically water and rock and the rocks are bad nd youdo not want them in your coffee good news they arealso getting filterid out by the checks and ballances o american government and by the other people in his administration which is why the stuff action comes out the other ind of the coffee filter is decent coffee despite the rocks 'll kate but if you are a person who just casually watching politics nd hit is a little complex then does this help or herd very simple binery does it help or does a hrt here is donal trump abjectly humiliating tim scot for no reason other than he just enjoys doing it two great senators which is hard i mean to yeve athink that sheactually appointed you to him and think of it theppointed and you'r the senator of hi state and she endorsed me you must really hateher no it is se it is ashame thit is i s oh i just love you not a is a grat ilit this a what why what is the purpose of that wher i't you say i'm thankful that timscott for indorsing me even over the person who actually pickes him for the senate that is how much he really thinks that i'll be a great president same point without humiliating the person who is now actually e surry get for your campaign and then he was ripping on nickey haley's dress an all elictwho you trying to win a rying whin election or is a just trollery again i can i can appreciate the humor of it it is troll in it is funny is itgit ta help you whin a generallection every question from here to the election should be based on is just this question will this help you or not help you win a general election against jobidon here was attacking make a hailey's ress i felt i should do this because i find in life you cannot let people get away with both all o c i whant i watch ter in the fence e dress the trop uply watsin fancy com up i said what is he doing we wan thenc she did the same thing last wig but he is much more angry about it than i was is o get up there you let him know really ink seriously o kay i gortacking clothing now sure david axe rod again who wnts the democrats to in he is om e yacht this is not a great exhibition and ta again he he loves this iminsilac david axol rods everything he wants democrats o beople to run against this that is jobidns entire bat he is entirebet is not even the trumps of fashust an he knows tha that that that dog is not n a hunt superwell but the trumps a wild man thing basically you have to i the more people have to overlook in order to vote for trump the hiders can be firm to win winning elections about two things making it hard devote for yopponent ma can easy devote for you an as i've said for literally a decate now about ton trump down trump makes it very hard to vote for his opponent bet he is greated attacking his ponents and he also makes it hard vote for him because the barrier to entry is saying this kind of stuff here is david axel rod going after him an i dare not too that they did that is tey go on out there an act a jack alkin and and go after ni galian really personal sexist ways and humiliate tim ska that was his that was the improvesational trump the childs for s campagnteem is they can do all the blocking and tackling well and they are but they cannot control him that was a really horrible exhibition last nig and it only probably made haily more determine to try and say whether she does i think is an open question but he did not help himself in that project gay axel rod is not wrong o kay he is not wrong when he says that trump is baselyming an harder for people devote for him hort in the middle remember not everyone is you if you listen to a political show understand ifyou listen to a show this one thit is a news politics show understand tht you represent in the united states two to three peresentd the population i got if ye listn to a daily political show in any way sha perform the number of americans who engage with politics daily in a granyellor way he is really low most people have not even

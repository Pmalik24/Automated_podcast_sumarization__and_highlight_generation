welcome to the huberman labponcas a science science pace to fori mandrew huberman and om ou professor of narbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for this standard huberman labpodcast which comes out every monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feets you to apple spotify and elsewhere we also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at stamford and elsewhere wresearch on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health physical health and performance i'm also please to inform you that for every dollar the huberman la premium channel generates for research studies the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance if you to subscribe to the huberman labpodcast premium channel please go to huberman labdac com slash premium it is ten dollars a month to subscribe or you can

those of you that are not hubermn labpodcast premium subscribers you can still here the first twenty minutes of to day is episode and determine whether not becoming a premium subscriber is for you without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about floride and the specific question is why is floride in our water and how much is it harming us okay well that might seem a short question but there is ectually a lot to that question and i want to be very clear by posing the question how much is it harming us it implies that floride is harming us and on be very clear the degree to which floride can harm you or not harm you depends on how much of it happens to be in the water or toothpay store some other thing that you are consuming ok this is very important i do not want the question to seem a leading question to imply that floride is necessarily harming us because as of bout to tell you there are clear benefits of floride for tooth strength and for warding off cavities but if you get too much floride into your system it is dangerous it is a poison at certain levels as you probably heard before t the dose makes the poison let us take this seemingly simple question and dissect it into the first part of the question was why is floride in our water and believe it or not even that is hard to answer directly because here is what is happening right now in twenty twenty four there is a major lawsuit in the state of california to try and get floride removed from the drinking wate the outcome of that case is still yet to be determined but the case was filed by a group of individuals whose strongly believe that floride at any concentration in the drinking water is bad why would they say that and what is their evidence and how strong is that evidence well there is some evidence that if levels of floride in drinking water exceed a certain threshold it can cause problems with firoid hormone function and perhaps even certain aspects of brain function again if the levels exceed a certain threshold in the state of california there is a major lawsuit to try and get floride removed from the drinking water now at the same time meaning right now there is also a major lawsuit in the united states this one taking place in buffalo new york whereby citizens are suing the city because they insist that there is not enough floride in the water and they are suing for damages based on the dental health needs of their children that did not in their opinion get enough floride in the drinking water me telling you about all this because the question again was wise floride in our drinking water and believe it or not therere certain states in the united states certain areas of the united states where the floride levels in the drinking water are lo art zero perhaps that is what the lawsuit in buffalo is about and by the way the city of buffalo may have now corrected the amount of floride in the water taking it from zero to something whether not it was actually zero is still debatable but i think you are trying to get the point that there is a wide wide divergence in terms of how safe people feel about having floride in drinking water some people want it and are suing cities because they feel there was not enough of it in their drinking water and others do not want any floride in their drinking water and theire suing cities because of that no cas this is a really barbed wire topic as i to say it is one that no matter how close you get to it whatever angle you look at it you are likely to get stuck a little bit it is gon to be a little bit painful oke why is floride in some drinking water at all call it set aside the levels in just answer that question well in an upcoming episode of the hubrmlapodcast about oral health i'll get into this in a lot more detail but floride is a really interesting compound with respect to oral health and heres wy your teeth believe it or not are always in a state of either demineralization or remineralization s er tricky words to say gohedan try and sad demineralization remineralization i'm going to refer to them as demen for demineralization and remen for remineralization o kat your teeth are always in one state or the other or one state predominates verses the other now a cavity in your mouth o curs whend bacteria in particular strepticocus mutans sometimes called strep mutans feeds on sugars in your mouth and then as a by product of that feeding creates acids that then erode the enamel and deeper layers of your teeth in other words it demineralizes the tooth now i just told you that your teeth can be in a state of demon or remen at any moment the way that your teeth remen the way they remineralize and can potentually fill in little cavities that have not yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth is through a process that involves the construction of crystals from minerals oh kay that is why it is called remineralization and get this this is really wile these minerals actually stack together in very organize little sequencis colic lego blocks and the critical element within those blocks is something called hydroxy appetite i love that it has the word appetiteas were talking about woral health that is the normal process floride was discovered not because it is avidemen not because its an essential neutrian in fact at hyh concentrations it is actualy a poison i'lltell you story about that in a moment riuse acually poisond by floride at the dentis when i was a kid in large part do to my own error floride it was discovered can actually get inside of those legochain crystals the building of those and form bonds between them that are actually stronger then the hydroxy appetite bonds that would normally form in other words if you consume floridated water or use toothpase with floride especiallyif you do this when youare a kid what ends up happening is that the crystals and the mineralization structure of the teeth becomes ultrastrong meaning superphysiologically strong which then limits the ability for that strep mutans and the acid strep mutans produces when it eats sugar to erode the enamel of your teeth causing what we refer to as cavities ocha i went and asked several dentis and a pereodontis about wise floride in drinking water wise floride in toothpaste and they of course give me the explanation that i just gave you which is a chemical mechanical explanation or rational however most of the things for our health such as the foods we eat the amount of exercise that we do are not naturally put into our environment right but tap water which goes out to everyone who you do not consumes it from the tap is basically a government or local government supplied resource and basically the rational was and i believe this took place first in the nineteen fifties was oca given th potential for floride to make superphysiologically strong teeth what can we do to reduce that cavities and tooth decay that would occur in children and adult populations let us put floride in the drinking water that is what they did they did not do this i was told because it was necessarily the best way to take care of teeth and avoid cavities that turns out they are bunch of other things that you can do even if you consume no floridade water or toothpace there are things that you can do to enhance the mineralization state of your teeth even fillin cavities provided those cavities have not made it into the deeper called dentin layers of the teeth i'll get into all this in that future episode but what the ouess and other governments decided this of course varies across the world to exstent to which ther floride in the drinking water or not was that by putting floride in the drinking water they could pervent a large amownt of tooth decay and cavities that would otherwise occur ok it was a and remains a fairly low cost approach for these cities to introduce floride to the drinking water and that is why floride is in drinking water it is to try and create superphysiologically strong teeth and indeed every single dentis i spoke to including functional dentis i spoke to pary dauntis i spoke to several dentis ranging from leat's call them more traditionally traind dentis to more that is call them alternive dentis all of them agree that at a chemical mechanical level floride creates stronger teeth however every single one of them also acknowledged that the bonds that are created in those mineralization chains as i'm referring to i realize that is not that the technical term is not the normal hydroxy appetite bonds that would form they are stronger than the bonds that would normally form they are structurely different if you look at them down what is called an electron microscope ou'll ee that thei're structurally different and som not all of the dentis i spoke to said yea it would be best to remineralized the teeth to fill in any cavities that initially have formed again not down to the deep layers but that could still be filled in naturally through the building up of those hydroxy appetite natural bonds but they acnowledge that many people perhaps most people do not take adequate care of their mouths and their teeth they understood the rationala putting floride into drinking water and of course that is also y floride is in many not all toothpace o ks i'm hoping that clearly answers for you the question of why there is floride in our drinking water at all at least in most american cities there is floride in the drinking water although this lawsuit in buffalo am i guess soon to be a determined am will probably tell us whether not indeed there was a total lac or a partiallac of floride in the drinking water there i'm presuming that the accusation is true but i do not actually know that to be truos know that there is a los suit that exists if you gouglbide you can see some you to vidios about it there is informationg about this am happening im their bunch of angry parents and i'm sure they are angry parents on the other side and m oun al the kids are saying but a ho flee of nomatter what they are sangin them through healthy teeth okay now the second half of the questiong was how much is the floride in drinking water harming us cam an answer this question very specifically the person ask how much is the floride in our drinking water harming us well i alreay told you ways in which it is helping the strength of your teeth ethat is not debated ay again there might be some dentists that say oh the bonds that are formed by floride are different than the once that are naturally created with no floride and there might be some debate about that but all of them acg knowledge that those bonds and the mineral isation of the teeth is stronger with floride they understand and agree with the rational even if they do not necessarily agree with the practice as the best practice how much is floride in drinking water harming you well the're two things you need to ask one is how much floride are you actually drinking because it turns out there is a tremendous range a floride concentrations in tap water depending on what city you live in now i did not entire episode to the hubrman ladpodcast about water we talked about distilled water vor to spring water we talk about hydrogena water we tal abo alkalon water we talked about all of those things and we did talk about floride and one of the key take aways when youare thinking about floride in drinking water is to know that if floride concentrations in drinking water are too high or and this is a very important or or your consuming a lot of a particular water that contains even low levels of floride well there is the potential and again i want a highlike the word potential here i do not want o cauls alarm that the floride is causing desruptions to thieroide hormone output or on the receptor and in other words destruptions to thiroide hormone metabolism and usage in the wody oca want of be really clear here i do not want people to think oh floride destroys your thiroide harmon it is the dose that makes the poison it depends on how much now the center for disease control have set a recommended level of zero point seven miligrams per leader zero points have in miligrams per leader of floride in drinking water as the level and here inm peraphrasing that can help prevent tooth decay and promote good oral health that they have deemed safe but if you want to know how much floride is in your drinking water whether not it is above at or below that value you need to get your tap water tested now fortunately there are websides that can tell you how much floride is in your drinking water and if you trust the date on those websides you can simply put the city you live in into one of those websides and you will get the information back i'll provide a few links to those different websides in the show no captions for this episode we also provided those links in the shownot captions for the episode on water and then you can see are you adjesting the level of floride in your drinking water that is deemed safe less than that value or more than that value but keep in mind that if you drink a little bit a moterat amount or a lot of floridated drink ing water you are going to be consuming either water or less floride just because there is the concentration that is been deem safe by the centere for disease control does not actually tell you whether i noc if you are drinkn half a gallon of tapwaterday verseas a gallon verses just a couple cops whether or not you are in that safe hizown and of course as is going to very by body weight riht of youre small child those lower levels of floride are gointry queight to a larger total amount of floride as seen by the volume of the body if you think about this ride everythings by body weight bolume this is why drug dosages are most typically calculated as a function of pounds or kilegrams of body weight it not everybody gets the same dose of every of every drug and if you are very large person mayb you can tolerate more floride as i mention before high levels of floride have been shown to destrupt thieroid metabolism it has also been hypothesized again this is still highly debated hypothesise to be nurotoxic under certain conditions that is toxic to neurons that can kill nurons at certain concentrations not necessarily the concentrations present in your drinking water a lot of the evidence that floride is neurotoxic is from called in vitro studies studies done effectively in a dish although there is some invivo evidence that it can cause neurotoxisity ac nuro degeneration i think when it comes to the topic of floride people tend to bin out into not concern and simply want floride to strengthen their teeth mildly concern ou on con keeping an eye on this stuff o ke floride does not sound great for me but you knows lons the concentrations are not too high you knows people say i've been drinking tap water my whole life and i feel great ou kow my teeth or strong and my brain works and my thiewoid seems fine oki and then people who are very very concern about floride at any concentration in their drinking water hence the the law suit in california and other law suits around the country i believe that when we are talking about floride you really need to think about the dosages and you need to ask yourself which one of those three categories you fall into now if you are concerned about floride it does not necessarily mean that you cannot drink tapwater the suggestion simply would be to filter that tapwater and during the episode i did on water i toked about a number of differen filtration approachis a many of those filters will filter out floride and you can simply look up you a water filters that eliminate or reduce floride and then some people have enough disposable income and or or concerned enough about floride an their drinking water that they will purchase or create very extensive very thorough filtration systems completely eliminate floride from their drinking water ci sa you will find different ranges of concern again a side from the data of high floride levels being destruptive to thieroid hormo pathways and possibly neurotoxic i personally am somebody who filters the drinking water i consume out of the tap unless that is i am going to boil water with it for making things loosely your bamate which is one of my favorite i drink that lately i drink this a cold brew matina your mamate which by the ays made with purified water a no floride ah and on and forth but if i'm making rice sir i making posster ar making otmeal and i need to use a tap water i do not worry about removing the floride from that water however if i'm going to drink water if i'm n to mix in on element electrlike packin or just drinks a glass of water or go out on a heide and take some water with me i do use a water filter either o a filter that fills from the top and then seeps down and the once you put in the refrage rador or and i recently purchased a whole house filter for the drinking water taps in my house that it does remove all the floride and remove some other contaminantes as well it is goingto depend on your level of concern and it is going to depend on you are disposable in come and any number of other things and i must say that every once in a while i'll drink a lit abut a tap water out of the tap without any concerne about filtering the floride i'm not somebody who gets hyper concerned about these things but i do understand whi some people do get hyper concerned about these things especially people red up on floride and some of the ealth concerns of consuming too much floride because i also find it very logical and understandable that as people learn more about how a particular substance might be harming their brain or bodily health that they would become more concerned about consuming that substance at just stands to reason what am i suggesting i suggest that you figure out how much floride is in your tap water i suggests that you then make a decision as to weather not to filter that water or not before drinking it and then of course you have to make a decision about what sort of financial investment you are willing to make to filter that water you can find a list of different price ranges of water filters in the show note captions in the water episode ymay also on a watch that episode and go to that time stamp and there is an enormous range there i want to be very clear i do not have a financial relationship to any of those filtration mechanisms again some people have zero dollars to devote to that process of taking the floride out of the water and other contaminants some people have many many tens of thousands of dollar rely just depends on your disposable in come in your level of concern but if you were to ask me i would say i think given that the cost of most of the filters that can remove most of the floride is low and given that there is some health concern of consuming too much floride and why not just remove floride from the drinking water and then if you say well will not that we in my teeth then i would say well watch the episode that sume to come out on a oral health because it is going to explain a lot of approaches including floride containing toothpacte but some other non floride containing toothpace and other things that one can do that the community of professionally traine dentis all agree can really help improve the mineralization state of your teeth and indeed can fill in cavities that begun to florm but have not yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth and on and on now i do have a brief story about floride that i'd be remiss if i did not tell you which essentially shows that floride is designed to strength and teeth but is also indeed a poison when i was a kid i had a lot of dental issues i did not consume much sugar my mother fortunately was good about not i letting us consume to much sugar but for whatever reason my mouth was kind of a mass i'd brush i'd floss i would do all these things but actually had my adult teeth comin behind my baby teeth did not push out my baby teeth not only did i not collect from the toothfairy which i only recently discovered is not real but how would i know cause the tothforry never showed up because all of my adult teeth came in behind my baby teethso i'd have all of my baby teeth pulled on the top i did not have a god relationship to the dentist as a location or a person in fact they had to tell me not to bite the dentist a by the way i have not beeten a dentist in a long time a hofully my dentis if watching this is not i'm too concerned i do get twiceo your cleanings every dentis agrees that is a good thing to do some people may need lass some people may need more but how do you need to go to a dentist to find out back to the story about floride i starto going to the dentist quite a bit because of all these dental issues that i had as a kid and what they used to do i do not knoit they do this any more but wat they use to do as they give you these ole trays which are konlike a mouth guards that you would use for boxing your hokies se your teeth do not get knocked out and theyoud fill those trays with this jelly stuff that contain floride and they fut on a top and on the bottom and the stuff just ah little bits of it would seep unto your tong in your throat and was sours awful and theyd seet me and this little a wicker chair in front of a telivision and turn on cartoons as if that was suppose to make me forget how awful a the whole experience was if anything it proly just created a pavolovian condition response a to hate cartoons which suppose a did not work as i liked cartoons then i do not watch them now truly i do not watch them now sit down this wicker chair i've got the floride in my teeth with these two trays and i'm just hating this whole process and you must ave benabout five or six years old i decide in my infinite wisdom to just just swallow all the floride pace i starc sucking down through these mouth guards can feel t going back into my throat in its and it is souring it stinging its awful ut omething i'm just an elect yon't do thas omin an sit there i mislyganin omn a beat the test and i drink all this floride pace and then of course i got immensely sick within about three minutes i stood up a turned around and puked all over the wicker chair i think that was deliberate as hally looking back it was deliberate a and puke all over the wicker chair my mom comes of running in what happend what you do do im shions very protective of me thanks mom a whatd you do to him and then i i said you'nd i just swallowed the stuff they want to do it again and i stop doing the floride treatment at that point why did i vomit well i've ominated because floride is indeed a poison at high concentrations now do i tell you that story to make you afraid of giving your kids flordaed toothpays tor florida water now by all means do what you think it is best for you and for your children for me however i've made some effort to avoid floride toothpace i do go the dentist as i mention about once a year i confess during the pandamic it probably less as they were busy and was hard it scadual et cetera i've had very very few cavitiese in my adult life hardly any and my gum health is very strong et cetera et cetera largely through taking on protocals that i am going to describe in the oral health episode and that were recommended to me by friends who are both dentis and other friends who are pariadontis because again therere lot of things that we can do to strengthen our teeth in natural ways by building up those hydroxy appitite bonds which are the natural bonds that teeth form and yes believe heare not being able to reverse some early formed cavities as long as they have not made it deep into the tooth alsose things using a soft toothbrush because if you brush too hard anw if you take that approach at your brusher teethrough are get them really really clean yesul scrape off all the bil film you'ill void tartar build up but you can realy cause some tenting of the gum tissue above the teeth and those the recesses back and there are where bacteria get in and theire's now a lot of really strong evidence showing that some of that bacteria can translate into cardiac disease can translate into metabolic disease and maybe even into some neural logic disease it is serious stoff oral health is one of the most important areas of health and it is one of the most overlooked areas of oral health nd i think people generally fall into two categories and i'll use these too categories to frame up the episode on oral health that is coming one category of person seems really bullish on their oral health i keep my teeth white and clean and they floshs and brush twice a day every day and they use tooth whiteners and mouth wash and all those things and the other category is kind of blazae about it ye do not brush wen teeth in the morning that my breath does not kill every person i get into an interaction with and on and forth but in reality both the group of people that are doing an immense number of things to try and keep their teeth white and their breath fresh are yes doing things that are good for their oral health but also no doubt damaging their al health in particular the oral microbium which is absolutely critical and then of course the other category of people that are neglecting their oral hygene and are not taking mouth washes an things that are also damaging their oral health but in different ways during the episode on oral health i'll spell out all the things that you can do most of which by the way are completely zero cost many of them actually will save you money both in the short and long term and can really help you improve your oral microbiom the strength of your teeth and reduce the number of cavities may beven reverse caviies that have begun to form and are not too deep into the tooth yet and in a really nice way all of that independent of your stance on floride thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the huberman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools n ot released anywhere else please go to huberan ladoc calm slash premium just to remind you why we launch the huberman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard huberman labpodcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every monday in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard hubermn labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings whichhn we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocals for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels huberman labpocast and other medium channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that wse kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting featureof the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funds come in through the remium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the hubern lab premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of huberman labpodcast episode's notfound elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical healt and performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to huberman labdot cam slash premium again that huberman labdot calm slash premium and as always thank you for your interestin

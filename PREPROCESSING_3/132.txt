jobdens deoje appoints david wise special council in the hunter bidin investigation and we examine why that' a cover up republican candidates to sends on the iestate fair as nonald trumpe swhoops in for a visit and a blue coller man creates the viral song of the moment i ment far of this is the venchparo sho the benshpio showsponser by expressfe pien protector on mine privecy to da res we pandacams flash men it was only a matter of time until the true cover up of the cover up began in order to understand why the jo bidin do ja just appointed david wise special council in a case he was already investigating you have to understand the time line basically jobiden son hunter bine has been under investigation since twenty nineteen he is been under investigation for wide variety of tax offences he was also nder investigation for gun crimes well just a few weeks ago it turned out that a plea deal had been cut tbhetween david wise as the you ess a turning in charge of prosecuting an investigating the hunter bidin case and hunter bidon's legal team and that plea agreement was a sweetheart deal without a doubt the way the sweet heart deal workd was this essentially he would get no time whatsoever for any of his tax crimes and he would also get no time you' get diversion for his gun crimes but not only did the plea deal do that it also basically immunized him from all further criminal charges with regard to anything tax or funding related which of course is all the hunter biden trobidenstuf that is all of his foreign agent's registration act violations that is him going abroad ping up sax of cash and and questioning whether those crimes involved jobiden all of that would ave just gone away and the deoje tried to bury this in the deal the deoj instead of putting this in the plea agreement with regard to the tax charges when they went to court instead they put it in diversion agreement with regard to te gun charges that i was not actually under the purview of the judge was prosiding over the tax charges but it would be left to the judge to actually en force that plea agreement none the less the judge caught oms o this the judges had hold up a second i do not understand are you guise basically wiping away all of his other crimes with this pleaagremnt or are you not and at that point the doj which was in fact attempting to wipe away and cover up all of hunter bidin to other crimes ot the pleaagreement at that point they got call at their hands in the cookie tries to non kno we were not trying to wipe way all these future crimes d when tey said that hunter bidons legalton was well then we do not have a deal what d you think the sdeal was you thin hea just con a plead out on the tax charges an the gun charges without wiping away all future prosecutions on similar charges the corruption with jobiden or the foreign agents registration act issues you thn we are just con a sign our names on the dotted line for a caquasy sweethart deall no we want the whole thing otherwise were going to court and the deoj said well we were going to give you thewhole thing but then we cannit got caught giving you the whole thing and the entire arrangement blup the judge in that case o that shead never seen any deal remotely that deal and all of this plead simultaneously with i ares whistle blowrgarry shaply testifying before congress that david wise the special the ositorney in this particular case had not been granted special council status now why would that of matter whelif he' been en special council status he would ave bee allowed to prosecute hunder biden basely were ever hunter bidin committed a cron he wold have been givin enough in dependence to go after hunter biden however he believes he needed to go after hunter bidn but according to gerri shaply david wife said that he had actually been denied by jobidins do jay special council status in the investigation of hunter biden in fact here is the irus whistleblower garryshaply testifying in open con grescional testimony that david wife said he was denied special counil status and that is when david wie in he october seventh twenty twenty to tad that the dese rus aturniys office at the will not allow charge there and thanhy added that he would request special cont he request the special council authority and was denied in that mevening i even had him repeat that becaus i knew how important that that wasnt i want to make shr i understood it you were there and you remember cristal clear in your but not only do i remember cristral cristal clear but i documented it the e mal this n exhibit in the houseways means committee cestimony was when i returned home that evening i documented it in in that emal and t and a an exhibit you can look right on there yaso shaply said he was actually preven ted from pursuing any leads that involved jobiden including in infamous twenty seventeen he mout from james gilly ar business associate of hunter bidon which bore the subject mine exspectations an outlined it previsional agreement for equity in the deal ith the chiny s energy company that included the famous phrayes now ten held by h for the big guy shaply says he want to investigate that in who ise prevented from doing by david wifes and by the people were in charge of this investigation who were not given special council status now the do ja then said well we did not give special council status because he never asked for special councilsttus but of course that is not how special council status works yo on't walk in to the do j's office and say i would special council status ye do not walk in a meric arland tofcil staylisson y here by request special counil status youre givin special council status voluntarily by the deo ja becaus they want to establish some form of independens from the actual in vestigationthat is going on this for example is why they give special counil stats to jack smith in the down trump investigations they culd at least clain that it was not meric arland and jobidin doing that they did not bother doing thoth hunter because they clearly wanted their finger still in the py with regard to hunter bide no can while all of this contrversy led up to merrick garland over the over the week and on friday announcing that david wifes would now be appointo the special council now understand the timing here is everything davi wies should aveban account appoint to special council hit they want a special council at the very beginning they yewoud have had the full powers to go after hunter biden but he was not given that special council status he did not have the power to g after hunter biden then david wifes any time during the subsquin period could hae ben given that special council status and than he was not and then the hunder bidon pleadsiol came through it n it blew up and then gerri shaply testified and now it appeared that david wifes was going to be dragged and from congress to explain why he was not given special council status an who is gen a half to actually testify in congress under oth in danger of perjury hes en have to testify whither meric arland and t deoje had basically told him how to handle the case in order to forced all that meric arland in the doje then gave him special counil status and in doing they accomplished a couple of things one they back filled the special council status when it was basicly too late and too they know essentially prevent congress from calling him in for questioning becaue anything he his question about now he can say his part of an on going investigation intil he cannot concer it if he is asked out why he wasn atgain special council status before he can tell li have special council sttus now and i cannot really speak about what was happening before the is that is all part of a case that is now on going this is a cover up of a cover up understand the original crime was hunder bidon an jobidon in doing whatever was they were doing we still do not know all the answers ther bes trethe obvious what was going on and then part too was the cover up which was appointed person who is not a special council to investigate that thing and have that person caut a sweet heardeal with hunter bidon and thn winhthatp blows up you get to cover u of the cover up which is now give that exactine person special council statuses willexplang us a second i probably is not even legal under the special council stat to tactually give davdwi special council status at this point first a central banks in countries china inty and australia by in

overnment special council status this way if we you saying that it is now reached a new stage is an absurdity as homean chankins points out he says this would be the stage where irescollabraters publicly acclue accuse whites and his deoja overseers o violating normal procedures go easier on hunter than they would on any other alleged offender is mister wise the special council now going to investigate mister wist the ordinary us to turney's problematic handling of the case but how is this going to work exactly is mister weise going tost are noticing the accumulating evidence the jobidan activelhe invetted his sons access peddling scheme is egen to follow up on charges by his own ires colleges his actions in th investigation retains hin by favoritism toward hunter the only reason theyr doing this to s he can refuse to test fight in front of the house committe recently this would inconclude on earthing the ellege receept by multiple members of the bidan family of millings abuts from hunters international dealings now this s basily just away of shielding david wises from the investigation of the original cover up by creating a new cover up this is what the head of the house oversi comittee james comerou thangs ays i's about to connect to abidan criminal activity and then they dump this on us we purg more avident an any one a tet e potedly in et tegatin et criminal a

on behalf presumably of the vice president of the united states tit tis insanity here is connally a lot people make a suntions bout people onpon life geving a special deal wik blank ofpen this the opposite that tht the're an agait no a no cortes cut at all there canthathey cannot have the book ton out un because nobody wants to be peceeded as showing faritism an the justice system or in the

would not am dued most mere mortals where crack attics who are addicted to hookers those people do not end up with millions in millins of dollars in their bank account because their last name is not bidon its pretty obvious what is happening here my favourite defender here is dryery dreery thoise constantly talking out the two tracsisom of justice in the united states the systemic racisem of the criminal justice system hell noushe is out their saing hunter is i may acus cant believe how how unfairly hundred is being treated in other words he is that he is being treated differently because he is jo bionsid i what are we thislittle piece here the particular don charge that the fends brouhd against jo bied and this on the daily beast he drug us arin possession of a fire ar is rarely brouht as a standalon crime especially now that roughly offfift of the country is a canobistwith an inevitably significant overlap with the nations estimated eighty million gunowners tas one that think when the fends do bring thes type of caste they come down hard but it is usually a tool they used to take down a tough to arrest criminals a millitent white nationalists is lomest terrorists or an arcal trafficers i think all the evidence that i've seen far in this case is that jo is that hunter bidin he could be terrible ta out n on never mat am is being treated worse then any one else would be were's that amii ive question would yoy read say this about any white republican any what republican any white non jobidin son habout that would youevry to ever say if nything remotely that about a

rnsherstocom use codben for thirty box off any box ared hy and be see legal analist th andy sivalos he has a a similar sort of take he says yet what' to what to maze about this the special council now has independence you mean now he does not un understand why did not he have it before that wouldhave been the question would it not what adted authority does not give to wises in what are the implications for hott abot it himself the primary added authority is really independence the special council no longer will have to be a we over by te by the at torney general the technically special councill does have to report to the attorney general i ad enal way attorney generald or he indicated that david wist ad rout invest to get tory power the real question this what inprence can we draw from david wise's request a to become special count an mean the inference is that he wants to cover up what is going on clearly clearly in to mays even san an chaketapper now lisen i think jake obviously is a left leaning eye but he least attempts to be objected in his analysis it sometimes jake and as some of the others unseen and actually question the special council ofpplaytment rightly yhe es attorney had made the decision to have it disbea diversion program in a mis demeanor i but now it merits o special council t at does he know of stuff that should be in a special council investigation that was not in that pleadali ma maybe he does but then why do that plead the it is all right it is all very sespecial fastin remember we have heard already from david wise about what the process was he has said i have the authority do all the totin paints ar crontraye to af my experience was but now this raise the lot of questions wherever happen on tuesdays a paus alluding to now does make me feel surprised about why now what is happening here remember he is still the best torney in delaware but now the special council allows him to actua to go beyond his own juristiction you can look at either areas as well threeson you have jack smat not happing to confined to one particular jurisitcan go beyond thaan haptings in fougtan flority and happings an washington do see it does now go beyond that but at its core i wonder what the decision really came down to the special council statute sayse you can have this if you first look to thinker out does a matter actually warrant and investigation is it warranted he had concluded it did at your garlmand wh as there a complictat interest tatd play here i mean it is pretty mason when even seanan is guides this is thiis prettyweard meanwhile hunter bidon's attorney abby loell was asked point blank if hunterbidons form business dealings would not anyway connect back you jobidon listen to the wirly language or frmabulol but can you answer the question about whether are not your from what if youre confident that this wont an anyway link back to the president what i know as what the evidence has revealed i mean that is what people should focus on it is not as if the started yesterday or a week it started for five years with many people in the united states including with the power of sepianis as mister weiss has had to look at every transaction that hunter was engaged in in any place in the world in which he was engaged and what did they come up with they came up with the decision that the only two charges to file were two misdemeanors at a gun diverted charge not any of the other things that the magor right wing have been yelling from money laundering to fareign corruption to fareign agent none of that you notice what that was not that was not a full scale full frontal denial of relationship between jo and hunter's business you notice that was not wat they was aid there will not be any evidence that is uncupboard i know the evidence is uncovered that thus far but where is the where is the full throated joe and hunter were not in business together in any way shi perform no money that hunter ever took in from a foreign sorse was used to joe's benefit nor was hunter bidon ever associating joe with the business of his foreign businesses none of that none of it there is the none of it in that particular statement instead there jiscont o play victim in fact yore is tabby loell saying thereben concer announce that trom forces could influence theinvested how could trom forces influence the investigation its joe bidon's deo jay how could that happen in the answer is now there afraid that they got cale wit their hand the cooky jar may be fairiness might look that a little bit when you say forth were y referenting well what a'm referencing is and this is not a surpriseor secret right from the moment this arrangement and agreement has been announce and filed you have every maga right wing fanatical person yelling and screaming and saying it is not right and it is not fair and it is not just you have the former president trying to use hunter bidon as a way to excuse his own conduct tat at some point that could pierce the noise could actually be noisy that it get in the way of the facts in the law well would not that be a tragedy wouln that be a tragedy if it turns out that dome t the giant puble you have created with the help of jobidon's doje actually started to cave in if some manshoul pop that bubble what a tragedy dauoud me can woeld get in just

private christian of fortabal visit g c u dat e d u to i oca president trump has now responded to the picking of david wice i he put out a very weird statemen actries ai david wice was picked by the two democrat senters from delaware under blue slip he would not have been picked by me but i have a great idea why do not they used aranged jack smith he then continued wice has been investigating huntr for four years giving him the sweetheart deal of all sweet har deals but a brillian trudgean delaware saw through it all now i read the geoje wante o new jodge in jurisdiction but to i with far stronger reasons than hunter and crooked jo maga well actually trump formally nominated wise for u s attorney for the district of delaware and i wise was sworn in while trump was president of the united states om that is not the best statement from trum butt sufficed it to say that he is obviously correct that wise is a stuge on behalf of the d o j at this point that all indicator's point to that and the fact that e's now basically escaped any sort of congressional scrutiniy by being a points of special council is pretty obvious corruption well meanwhile president trumps presidential run continues heis fasing down presumably some sort of indictment that is going to come down either this week or next week according to the wallstr geral george s oecome ground zero for exhaustion over the legal drama surrounding tonnel trump and the geo p debate of whether to stick with him in twenty twenty four georgia there are still signs that voters of tired of the twenty twenty election reeplace and of trump himself that kind of trump fatigue is pervasive in georgia according to republican stratajust which s the serious prom for him in general election bright now the possibility of another indictment looming is pretty obvious presiden trump bput out of statement over th we gan going after the fulton county d a fanny willis ha he went after pretty hard obviously he suggested that om sh is corrupt he suggested that sh is a driven by politics of course sh sh is shis a partisan democrat but yow as these case is stack ob it is going to provide a serious challenge to his ability to actively run a campaign according to bright bart da com fanny wills has playing to bring multiple witnesss beforegranjury next sweek as part for investigation into president trump trum grote i hear that rasis to fulton county district attorney fony fatin fanny willis who weekly presides of one of the deadliest communities in the united states with thousands of murders violent criminals and gangmumers roming the street tu long on tried free and oure tree with kinglubs his using a potential indictment of me and other instant people as a campaign and con and funrasin con job all base on a perfect phone call is president challenging election fraud my duty and right this woud be trumps fourth indictment in t past a five months and of course it would bleed into the presidential election trump was asked whether he be taken a pledial in georgu and correctly he said a no way man not a thng that is going to happen i er any tinei eei ia a i ai i ee i i ii a a i ii i e i i ea i ai a i i i a a i a e ai a i ia ii an i e i ii e a aeii i eii a pound he that of course gan be trumpsline al the wy through the election the question is wether that is going to be a winning message in a't general lection at something that republican voters gang a half to daside a tie when some friends over the weekand and we are all agreeing that the reason that republicans many of them love love love trump is because of course he is a hand grenade that was thrown into these sort of ten of vipers that is american politics but the question is what happens if that hand grenade becomes to dodge or what happens is starts to blo up in your hand that something republicans are ging to halfe to decide to they think that trump is still more of a tool against the left that he is capable of victory in a general election or is he a han grenade that is going to blow up in their hand right now the pole suggest the republicans are very much on board with the idea that trump is still the best gy two nominate the real clapolt ex pulling average has trump wrought riding very high at fifty four per cent has rondo santis at fifteen per cent has e vacromasuamy at six pence at five haily at theree everyone below that now the pulling on romasuammy is very weird as i sayeful disclosure i'm i'm frendly with the vake for some friendly with many of these can that it is is the truth but the vakes pulling is superweird because all of the online poles have him at seven eight nine ten eleven and all o the phone poles have ment to which which suggests that the these these may not be the most reliable pulling stitistics four the vake because he is the only one he are seeing picking up support right now other than trump trump is acturally on a bit of a hie right now in terms of his pulling numbers the santis has declinin the real cropolitics pulling average aabout twenty five per cent in april othly downst about fifteen per cent to day the vag in th rol clopolitix pulling average has ficked up about three points it but it is really trump whos sword during that same period trump wone from about forty five per cent in no in the beaning of april two fifty four per cent to day well that dinamic was clearly on display in ibe over the weekend it was the i was stayed fair which this gian huge faire that happens at every four years in iwa i believe it hapens every year nig obit e really you breaks into the open during primary season because everybody goes there hoping to win votes in the iwa caucasis right now the pulling and i wat is significantly narrower than the pulling nationally the pulling and iwa shows that donal trump is still for shore in the lead but his lead over over the santis is significantly smaller the last new yor time santapole hat trumpet forty four and santis at twenty which of course is still a big gap its twenty four point gap ut that twenty four point gapis is not of forty point gout say that is a a fairly significant difference well to santus showed up and i inted in interview with i was governor it can renald to us to shut up at the eyea state fair and thay heres with the santo sad to say i believe if you ave an opportunity a to do good things for your community or your country a that you eve that you ever respotsability to do that an to get that don and that is really i think you do i influence to me all the way up to the president and terms of what im looking to do with running for president i'm not running to be somebody im running to do things on behalf of the countryin for the american people ay now obviously that that is an iceline buthe big probim for to santus is that in terms of who is a more exciting candidate who is the one who is going to suck all the air of the room there is no question the trump is a much more exciting candidate according to the washington post the crowd that ad crane to wash governor to sansus flipp port trops with i was governor suddenly looked toward the skyton trin trumps plan was arriving they clapped in sheer we love trump some of hem had chanceed earlier when trump got to the porttent midday with the sansis camp faraway resting in the shate he did not partaking the actual grilling he brought an ontrage of support of law makers from the sansus home state they posed for self esan passed out magahats to a crowd the clog the fairs gran at concors trump was gon before two pn bac cold actually that that kind f behavior could theoretically harm trum in iwa caucus remember he did not when the iocaucasis the first time round it was actually ted crews who on the iwacawcis trump then did what he has become famous for doing he denied the ted crews had won the iwa caucas he suggested the ted cruws had stolen it frum ben carson the ben carson had dropped out and and and that he not formelly dropped out a te rus telling people he had dropped out that meant that he picked up tben carson's votes and the shoul have going to trump an really trump one eyea and all of the rest trum now theoretically could loose iwap agan bat an here is the footiage of trumps plane arriving and again there is than the the man does have a a political magic to him and trm to real to retell politics he isttu there is a e trump plane hi be amonron now what it would not all this mean well it actually turned into a bit af a a bit of a brawl a bunch of trump fans who ere being extrordinarily rude which again not super shocking we saw some this behavior in the twenty sixteen election as well the shar trying to drown out the interview between kimerenalds and ron to santus a i got a say for lot of republican voters if they look at this they have to wonders this the sort of behavior that actually is going to win in november of twenty twenty four i do not know that it is going to appeal to any people who are going o be swing boters or suburban moms in twenty twenty four than we here was at kimerenalds forss trump fans the ron th out there i doin a ninty nine canty toere i think you may be had of me han what a wht where no what ani nt wr wan na let getbepery bedyappertedity here ar cad eso y that the question is to whether that is going to be an appeal is is an open one for his part te santis went after trump because trump had been going after reynolds he is cam panning well in iwa me nacturally the e sans esteem seems fairly confident that the're oing to win iwa the truth is that in the republican primaries the santis does not just neen to win iywa he us whi iwat and new hampshire nus woen both of those if he loses new hampster after winning iwa then trump is probably going to win in south carolina he really needs to start consolidating the feel very very early in this race but heis doing the hard on the ground work the slogging work that is necessary here is te sansis going after trump for attacking reynolds noteer youre rn o a nother re aller robbi o hr yoin oe ran a r er a a no i a a a a a a a a a r ter nwa o a a aa r ean ar an an a in a youa r ar a a a a a a a a ar e a n a aer than a agra they meant obviously disens his right about all this but this is really one ofthe questions i again to go back to the hand grenade analogy tthe question is is the hand granane effective or is the hand grenae not effective ou if the idea was the trumplican a commin an who is gen a wreck the the waghs thet thing who is got wreck the statust quo the question is what does that mean breakfast at is quot in trms of astual policy becuse the truth is that in terms of up ending democratic policy di sans is tat a helv lot more hnstade of floorer than trumpded as president of the united states but if what we mean is that trump ticks off all the people we to latch ticked off there is no one better in politics probably in history then trump at that the question is whether that actually adds up to a policy win re publican voters ginto have to deside kind of what they want here do they want the best shot at winning independence they want the best shot at winning nationally they went by shobenan in places georgia and wisconsin in the arizona ors they want the guid who is goin a tpiss off the left the bost because if they want thet has can a piss off the left the most you are never going to btter than trump trump ticks off the left better than literally any one in the history of humanity we care not just one second we will get to the latest on the

states is back at abouth beach again he just went on a fourteen dabeach vacation and he came back fy four days and now he went back to the bech because he is no longer with us he is no longer centient and he was asked apparently about the rising detal and hi while he is on the beach and he said no comment and then he headed home s a slow clap for very very carrying deeply compassionate president of the united states meanwhile we now have more stafts about how much familyes or paying than they did two years ago according to see an and business of all places ther' typical american household spent seven hundred and nine more dollars in july than they did two years ago by the same exact goods in services accoring to moodies that is the sive increase mass of increase there is seven hndred dollars a month for the same goods and services te send that over the course of the year in' taing eighty four hundred dollars that your spending more this or than you were two years ago those are huge numbers becaue remember whenever jobidance as well weve has yourne ther're coming down iryo wot but nerno the increase in inflation is coming down every mont excep for last month when it did not but ite was coming down every month but that just means that your adding in flation on top of inflation it is saying tha you spend a thousand dolars last month on your credicard and this month spent nine hundred dollars you brought it down by a hundred dollars i mean that is true but you'lso had a nine hundred dollars to your debt which is what jobitn has ben doing with regard to in pflation marsandy the chief a connmis o moodies set high in flation of th pastrplas years has done a lot of economic damage wmost of that increase in household spending is driven by housing cost which oafd surge he added that families are lso spending more at the grocery store on buying maintaining in insuring vehicles and on recreational services cable pachecks have not grown by nearly as much as the cost of living it is li keep saying that gravity is going to drag the economy back down whilst your journal has an entire piece non america's credit rating according to spencer jake ub at writing for the waster journal investors haf historically paid a steep penalty to hunker down in supersafe short from government securities for example a hundred buts invested in three month treasury bills in nineteen twenty eght gruets only two thousand one hudred forty one boox by the end of last year while became forty six grand invested medium great corperet bonds and awaping six hundred twenty for gran if invested in stocks according to data from and why you finance professor basuaf demerdemer daron espesually the ears following the financial crisis anything short herm in safe paid next to nothing but the federal eserves fighting against in flation is amplified the risk alve an unthinkable fyscal crisis made possible by decates of washington tis function that means that people are actually spending a bunch of money to get into short from government securities which pays you almost nothing that is o freet dout people are cash might be came although they wre called certificates of confiscation the inflationary nineteen seventies longer from treasuries have ben the go to assat in times of crisis the ten years note yield is literally the rist free rae used to value all other securities but the governments pile of debt has now swelled following the war on terror the globill financial crisis amicove ineteen pens emic low intfrestrates and fed bon buying massd the strain interest cost were recently no higher than in the early nineteen nineties but the treasury barely sees the opportunity to lock in those rock bottom rase by issuing more long tur notes and bonds and now it is too lat long from bunch of fore cast say tou ust that held by the public will surpassad g p this fiscal year interest on the that will equal three quarters of discrestionary non defence spending by twenty thirty one it will be as large thas right interest on our national that will be the same as all discressionary non defence spending in the american budgent by twenty thirty one om we are in serious trouble actually that forecast is probably to optimistic the swiling a the swelloing pile of debt means minor changes in assumptions t now have huge consequences about three quarters of treasuries must be rolled over within five years compound interest has a quick has a way of quickly making a bad situation worse what your washing basically is that america's that promise snow balling and it is going to get worse and worse and worse and drvidon has exascurbted that problem what exactly to democras after a li upon here well the caroline their good governments what their gunnerolion is trying to scare the american people into believing the democracy itself is about to collapse is what comella herris is saying is why january sixth as at the center of everything that democrats do here is comla heris over the week gan worlsmost on talents of politicion making her case the democracy is at stake of course what is it tin you have wos your mindgreate atma i on give me rink wvi think everything as it stay righta democracy is intact it is strengthens the people it pre tects and fights for fundamental freedoms individual rights it is a it is a fightfor order against caos its strengthens on the other hand nailes o democracy incredibly fragil it will only be as strong as our roingess to fight r man when you pile on truisms that way man that is bad politic in that from comla she is truly awful of us u truly truly alful of this but she elso does declare herself a ro miles that is excitin a roe modell to dumb people everywhere here is commea harris but the thing about bin a romo people watch what you do to se if it las up with what you say what she does is notthing it is nothing she does nothing for a living but in the end theresall they have the can a trying scare americans about the republican party and the truth is far it is worked in republicans can say that it has not but it absolutely has since twenty sixteen when ontrumpl as lected ever since then the case democrato made is the crazy has to stop and then they point at a bunch of republican candidates range men phersial walker in georgia to blake masteris in arizona to dug masteriano and pennsylvania and vorters go an and they listen to it and it turns out thet republicans should stop banging their head against a brick wall perhaps the best way to run agains somebodyat supremely unpalatable jobidon supremely irritating commelhrris is to run somebody whose actually somewhat palatable because the truth is a republicans cannot get excitete to vote against it jobidon and com hrris i do not know what business republicans have getting into a a boting boot mean just because jobidon is an incredibly boring elderly fellow does not mean you should not be excited to vote against him and get him out of office but i suppose that if i all politics just becomes a battle of personality then n we are in a race to the bottom from here until the end of time probably now dark thoughts here on monday but the reality is that em craser in credibly butable and if jobidon and commlaharis cannot be beat i un i honest to god do not understand what republicans are doing for living remember a couple of years go i spoke at a house republican summit this before twenty twenty two and i said to them if you lest do not take back the house every one of you should be fired because it is a target rich environment this is a target rich environment if republicans cannot actually a chief victory against jobidon and commel harris i do not know what they do for a living or why we should continue to support them in any way she performed i'm sorry but blaming everybody else for losing is not going to putt it mardy time for some things i at then some things that i hate last week i suggested the carrylake would be a bad candidate for senate in arizona and i hope by that because she lost to a wet rag in caty hobs however she did have herself when ce moment and i well over the weken i she was asked about whether threare in factory genters she was milking a cow at the time and a heria response which what av you fon the new ar time tou knother's only two genders riht there is only to genders an they know that nila i challenge the new york times for porter and the washington postrporter to try to milk a cow and then try to milk a bowl and see how that goes of ge i laughed i get other things that i there is a song that as gone completely viral by a virginia country sing oliver anthony who is a former factory worker we's apparently really really down on his lock and he was ask t play song at sort of a local evends and the song that he played is one that he calls rich men north of richmond which of course is reference to the people who occupy wwashington to se and this then this thing has gone unbelievably vy roming millions and millions of views there is whor towns adan o a o workan oe or a o aer an wa aa a o an oooo a a o oa o e e o oo o o oa o ooooo oo o ooe ooeooa oo o a o a an oaa nay this song obviously has hit a nerve with people tbecause it is i think the cry of a lot of people in the united states who are just trying to work a job and make their way in life and feel their too many people who have their hand in their pocket particularly he leats in the federal government who believed that their money should go to other people one of the some of the lurics in the song our lord we got folks in the street and got nothing to eat and the obest milking welfare well god for five foot threeng or three hundred pounds tace ought not pay for bag of udge rounds fair enough far enough sapose ted viyo explainings that things were not good for lot of people in some respects os one of those people and wast a lodnights getting high getting drunk at sorv gon to apointo my wife for even things i did care care about did not mean anything to me any more this is not doctor phillip sobut i found outlet in this music i start uploading a couple of songs he said the universal thing i sees no matter how much effort the working class puts into whatever it is they are doingthey cannot quite get ahead becaus the dollars not worth enough theyr being over tax i wont be a voice for those people and not just them bat humans in general as longs your above the dery got a fighting chance i'm this thing has again gone incredibly viral he says that he is not a wright winger he says that this is pretty much dead center he said because he is more isolationist in terms of foreign policy but that he talks about last part of the song to side rates mental health depression he says there is no reason why tha short af stuff should be happening in this country i'm john rich frinds to the daily wire of course he is offer to produce oliver's albam and i the vidiofs getting all sorts of traction obviously and and it should is it tis atalenty guy i'ok a time for a quick thing that i hate already i do not know why tis' mean keeps to ploying rachel seggler to say things about snow white that are likely to alienate pretty much to anybody who would ever one watchd this movis they are making a live version of of snow white te live action version of snow wite which 's really stupid since the original is of course i fome classic rachels egler who is playing sno diversity because we we cannot do snow white me more because obviously that be races ationa must remain a black prince hass forver but snow white cannot be a white prince hays even if her literal name is snow white because she has skin as white as snow that is literally the lying in the movy imn it i'm sorry i i did not make it up that is just what the very tal is it is it is not called any other color it is called snow white that is literally what it is called in any case rachels eggler also feels the necessity apparently ust crap on the mith and crap on the original movi over the weak end here she was explaining that the prince in snow white is actually thebad guy i mean them the original cartun can by nineteen thirty seven and very evidently theres a big bok e on her lo story im with the gu who liteally stalk therwere were wthough he did not do that with time a o prince are a different kind of we have a diperent aproach to what i'm sure a lot of people will assumis the love story just because me casi guy an the movy ante burn op grat did im it thone of those things that i ben everybone can have therth omsin about what a octe going to be buit is really not about the love story at all which is really really wonderful it is wonderful lovey superbad guyse it is superbat and the prince he is a creepy stalker did that you prolly did not s if yeu watch the movy you will remember snow white literally standing aboe a well and singing a song where she says that she wishes for the one i love to fightin me today that is literallythelyric you may remember it from the original movy but apparently the prince than responding to that by finishing her song whishes what happens that means to creepy stalker now that is that it hm better honesty would not better if he just left her to be dead that'n better romen shoos shos there she is unshed on the buyer rite meslying there with lass over her she is pretty well preserves he should at just left her alone they she would been dead andan ever ronen happy right i mean not happy caus she been dead but but still he is a creepy rate stalker and ou'd been better if she had bitten in the apple and died and then she never oe gotten kiss and then sheu'ld be dead elsewould be dead also sleeping beauty shou'd still be dead in fact there is a bunch of princesses who would still be dead if we just abided by me too because it turns out that even when a woman is in love with a man and even when they want to be together the worst thing that could possibly happen is for him to kiss her well she is dead to wake her up from being dead that is the worst thing you cul do in a mit i mean obviously the best thing probably the prince sheld a come along u to a burieder mean that that that 'd ben the best thing is to bury her alive quasi that woud been tat in the best thing but at least this incan be about love imean honest a god what is tisny doing what are they doing they are high on their own supply it is insane what dor thy think the market for this is quirte the parent orly i'm desperate to bring my child to a movy that i's not about snow white but is in fact about herself empowered woman that is atomic blond but for children lut's do that is geniusis allready well the rest of the show continues it right nighn i

when lucian truscott truss to explaind how he is related thomas jefferson he is as oket he is seventy three he used to visit a great grandmother who used to visit her great grandfather thomas jefferson's grandson there was only when i was grawn up an ul when ithers of my great grandmother was only one dead purse om the tween me and jefferson when lucin was a boy in the early nineteen fifties just six or seven years old when we visit family in charlottesville sometimes they would drop him off with his brother at mona challow jefferson's home lucian says it was before the place had been remade for toriius it is today basically visitors woer pay may be a dollar and walke through the house you on my great ant they treated the place it was still the family hall and we had the run o ther place we used to foll our pockets fol of tables from the walk ways up there and go up on tat second floor and er floor was te crawl out windows on to the paritats an ar upra the top of ona chel and drop tabls n tor o or walking round the house an on yo very a soso behavior yes and an your talking to one of the probably the only person l over talk to yor wifes that is actually jump on ava jeffersons there aman we we would play on the bed we go through that little doorway and up the stairs in to the closet which is above ther there and set u there on the closin one tor campe through the room wu'd stick our faces out o the wend ter u there say woo an scar annwed hide on there ats i you doni knowa dont se provision it all now now the stu pevisions all to ta oom o we went through all e enn and stuff up there and then of course we play down in tha and a basemet rooms and then of course what the call the dependen in which were the slave rooms that run under the two wings that ron o out from on a chel self whobe decates before the slave quarters ar part ofthe mounto chela tor lucian says these ar just empty rooms under the house no furniture ore anything else in them he and his brother would explore and run around and o i no play hiden see or whatever little boys jet it is amazing to me that the degree to which it felt a family home did it feel the way he was a kid get 'l have to tell you that all of this stuff an my family was just taken for gran these days of course nothing about the weggasies of the founding fathers is taken for granted just this week the special committee appointed by the mayor of washington d c caugst for removing relocating or contexturalizing a monch a monuments to slave owning founding fathers incooding' jefferson emorial and the watchin monument which by the way the mayor does not actually have jurisdiction ovehr me mo the president of course has put his arms around this issue and if tory began his reelection campaign he gave his speech at mount rushmore to make war that he does not ont to remove any monuments o rename an h buildings or military basis but this great great great whatever it is direct descendent thomas jefferson lucian truscott he is had a special perspective on this he led the charge to convince all the other white descendants of tchomas jefferson to low the black descendants of thomas jefferson in to the official family association the black fomily members of course trace back to jefferson in slly hemmings on to beople ean slaved lucian thinks that everybody needs to get real about the slave owning passed of some of the founding fathers lik how d you fll about people taking down monuments of thomas jefferson i affect they ought to be taken ther i affect that the great on him at the thomas jefferson is mon a chell and i thak its in a propriate monument because it actually puts jefferson's life in context it puts his slave onlin as part of his life and in contect hi you visit bon a shell to day you get to see were of the slaves live you will be shown wor shelliavinc's broter john yid would work and jefferson's bedroom and study of for slaves gilt that i everear slave belewas when ias drawn up but its talked about to day the history about chol this pointers about half jeffer on history half slave hi stre at si thats apropriate as a memorial it it tells the story of the whole man not just that tha the sort of got cofe jefferson wen walben rase to betterid what a we spest to do with the shameful parts of americs pass is being talked about much to day and back in the arly days of armidiosio and late nineties whene of i contributor ser avout the distory that took that on in this very vivid and complicated way she set out on the road with har sister amy to visit the side of a historic tragedy whone then about part ofthe ron family hundred sixty years before that and we want to replay at this holidy we cant cause the questions that it addresses h things that it is obsessed with ar all much more talked about to day than twenty two years ago when she did that story we o beu theasy chicago its this american life on mour glast we take a road trip into history to day sday with us to serve allenors sister amy wuld born in eastern okohoma what was called indian territory before statehood that is wor a story ans an'sas a word begans the old citizens of the cheriky nation the parents which usuall here is amported to the story here is o the opening line of sery story from nineteen ninety eight being at least the little cherokey in northystern oclahoma is about as rare and remarkable as being a mikhael georgean fan an chicago i mean who is it i guessing d on need to explain that antique nineteen inty a sports reference to any of you but i i do have one note before we play the rest of the story and it is about the word injan sira asked me to point out any one hearing this today that her grandfather was born in indian trritory before statehood and use the word injn has term of affection is never derogatory o a sok picking up ser's parcheriky egoes without saying that my towinsister amy is to except that i have dark eyes and dark hair and che is a blue eyed blind and our grandfather nicknamed me injan and her sweet here is amys take on all this i must point out that while my sister and i do not really look alike we sound almost exactly alike i han't for listening to this story i'm usually the groucy one here is amy i mean ktnows ros were assigned to us indian and a sweet because of the ay we looked but it was also more the things we were told about ourselves and bhe know she was the one who was given me a cheroky language buk on and i was the one who was always told how much alike i was to our sweetish grandmother on and on i think i was probably six or seven or something before i realized that i was cheroky too we are a little franch and scottish and english and seminel too tipical americkin much bhat the cherokey and sweeter sides of the family were the only geniology's any one knew anything about here is what we knew about ourselves ellis island trail of tears and i think to a kid trail of t ears the cherokees forst march from the east to o klahoma where we were born seemed enormously more interesting just as a name even the smallest children know what tears mean and i think in my earliest under standing of where i came from i pictured myself to send ed from a long line of wepers with blood shot ies the trail of tears between eighteen thirty eight and thirty nine the us army wrenched sixteen thous and pey ful from their homes round to them up en sto kads and marched them across the country four thousand died every summer when we were chill dran our parents would drive us to a place about half an hour from where we live called jalag which is the cherokey word for cherokee jollagee is the tribes cultural centr there is a recreated village a museum and this was our favorite part and amphitheatere which stage to dramatic crecreation of the trail of tears every summer we watched chief john ross tri mad to save the cherokey land backeast we saw his hot had riveal st andway ray jof to the civil war we especially love the death of the phoenix a noisy med gen to lit an ter buld of dants and woic the m th bird would die only to rise again we would get these programs ar bro shers and sera was kind of in charge of them and sometimes she would let me look at them she had a whole little file and wou know we would flook through them and a it was i mean i did take it to hart it was tha story that was really tragic i haveat sort of reverence feeling towards it and i think its the tas of this play b pay was serious and and told such a detailed story that e can it took this place of significance it was really important andit really mater here is the measure o how importan the ampathyater show was to amy an me our father and our grand father used to show us photographs of cherokey leaders an books but even now when i imagin stand waty i picture the actor at jala gee all my life i knew i wouldn' exist but for the trail of tears and it struck me as ha little silly that most of the things i knew about it were wace on an ampa theatr drama i have not seen for nearly twenty years at first i thought id read some books about it which i did but then i wanted to see it feel it know how long a treck it was i wanted it to be real i enlisted amy perhaps she would to do all the driving a historical tragedy and five for teen hour days behind the wheel who could pass that up in ie lie from chicago chee from montana and one spring morning we find ourselves in a rental car on our way to north western georgia the home land of the cherokee before they were shuv d out to oklahoma the place the trail of tears

tenese river but in eighteen thirty eight it was one of the starting points for the water rout of the trail of teers i stand on the sand and read to weatherd historical marker stablished about eighteen sixteen by john ross some three hundred seventy yards east of this point it consisted of a ferry warehous and landing cheriky parties left from the landing for the west and eighteen thirty eight the same yer the growing community took the name chatanuga itere o can eck ton at all between those to points at som nice e left for the west baby o why a i have not mention that rosses landing also functions as chatenewgas tourist center up the hill from the river is the jagantic tenisy a quarium and imax theater the place is crawling with tourists a crowd genarican in distinguishable from one another they swirled around us as a single teacher a hundred sixty years ago thousans of cherikees came through this site in the summer they were forston to boats an faceteet exhaustion and a drout that tranded them without water to drink in the fall they headed west by foot the ventually trudging barefoot through blizzards either way they died of starvation disantari diarea and fatigue e quarter of the tribe was gone and here in the shadow of thea quarium the trail of teerses remembered by a series of quotations from disgruntaled nade of americans carbdan to a contcrete plaza one of the citations from a cherikee name to draggin canew is from seventeens seventy sits the white men have almost surounded us leaving us only a little spot o round to stand upon nd it seems to be there intentin to destroy us as in nation good call wrong were moving diagonally across the side wal an andred jackson in eighteen twenty it is high time to do away with the fars of treating with indian tribes as separate nations well step on thaton side wak they are symbalic aba broken promises tnimacking that upnoit sansr i here some of the cabers or crack to symbolized in the broken promises made to the indians most americans have had this experience most of us connangtins or countryis done that we find chanful from the travasties everybody agrees were wrong the japanes and turnmen camps of the late date of slavery's abolition to merkyar partisan arigumens about legalized tabortion or the anola gay world history has been a bloody business from the getgo but the najia were suffering standing on the broken promises at rosses landing is peculiar to a democracy because in a democracy were all responsible for everything our government dus this is the letter from ralph wald o ember sente president martinvanveran in eighteen thirty eight a crime is projected that confounds our under standings by its magnitude a crime that really deprives us as well as the cheriky of a country for how could we call the con spiricy that should crush these poor indians our government or the land that was cursed by their parting and ying inprecations our country any more you sir will bring down the renown chair in which you sit in ti in fo me if your seel is set to this instrument of perfidy and the name of this nation hitherto thi sweet omen of religion and liberty we will stink to the world and the path ends with a quotation from an unknown surviver of the trail of tears who said long time we travel on way to new land people feel bad when they leave old nation women's cry and make sad wails children and many men and all look sad when friends die but they say nothing and jus put heads down and keep on go towards west many days pass and people die very much we bury close by trail that last passage this becially the part about when friends di bring his to tears and we just stand there look ing hock towards the teni see broken hearted meanwhile ther're little kids literally walking over these words playing on them making noise having fun we sare to hate them for a second we ask a teacher whos with a group of far greaters why she is not talking to them about charoky history and she says normally she wood but it is the end of this chool year an this trip is their reward for being good sounds reasonable i ask an if she thinks these kids should share our sadness well i i think it is a sad story it is mean it srta the hollicost just you do not have to be you i to think that that is o dafinately as sad part of history and i thin the trail teers is you kno an meric his version if genside and wen it really t started rit over there yeu looke yere but te hit such ten still i cannot tae my eyes off those children i envy them i wanted join them i'm an imaxd person i had been to an i max theater jus weeks before i wanted to come on this trip to get a feel for this trail that made us but standing here at rossa's landting in his me how crazy that is suddenly the only thing i get out of it is rage why shoull we keep going do not know i do not know why i do not know why were here i seriously do not i know it is an interesting storyin yes we are always in tosted in our past but i do not e somedoms i wonder when good comes on that do not some i do not think it makes me a more cantinto burstin it all infi ti think i feel really haunted by all of this and i feel very cind way down by the pain part of me thinks this hoping is is a mistake and and maybe i feel more knowing about it but i i mean it is not this is a sory where the more the better your feet yoel feel is just the ofpisit the more i learn the worse i feel i' the more hatred i feel towards this country that i still loves and therefore the more conflicted and tit jis the most i just feel all this anger everything in her standinge o thi stupid a quarry an bill the talking to co tard gyds nere dok surroundin now there is a colliape and ii me not i do not know now i just feeli i feel worse i feel worse there are only many hours the human being can stomac unfocusd dread i was tired and confused and to press and i needed the kind to ress but that can only come from focused resentment in the trail of tears sawgit if there is one person youre allowed to hat at antry jackson the arcetect of the indian removal policy and since the trail of tears pass through nasil anyway we stop in his plantation the hermit ge tar tir avol on er sis ter en ter the enemy's bedroom that is in a minute from scockabublegradio went our progrem continues it is a smark con life from our glass to day a progrem about the past and what to make of the past we continue with the story of sir vow an her sister amy who are retracing the path of the trail of tears they have just arrived if remember for the break at the home of the president responsible for the trail somebody they hate and intend to keep hating andrew jackson who insinoey is that when a president trumps favorite presidents a present trun place jackson's portrait in the ovl office he spoke id jackson's home to commemorate the toentred fifty of tanniversary of jackson's birth in that speech you called out jackson as a people's president himself out for the common man somebody who defied the political class of his day it was during the revolution that jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant ileet does that son familiar te i wonder why they keep talking about trumk an jackson jacksonant trum i know the feel egandrew im a point out earlier that to day's progem mas resprocast in nineteen ninety eight in the ur sincere anamy visited jackson's home they have obdated the exhibits the musam there includs exibitsons slaves and or native american removal said jackson an acked there is anot er toward the focusis entirely on the enslave people who live there again from our original story cer ser avol the house and museum are close to the public when we arrived because of astonishing tornado damage pardon me wanted to distroy andry jackson and everythinge representage seeing all those hack to trees made me fee some one had beaten me to the punch i look at it an the trees or darein the wrath of god inside there is no display mentioning indian removal because remarkably there is no display about jackson's president syt caroline bracket showed us suround the house a columed anto bellum mansion that looks across between grace land and tera unfortunately for my spite spree i liked carolin bracket i felt bad forer she would point into the library an say jackson subscribed to a lot of newspapers before his death and i' say was one of them the cherkey phoenix she was not sure she wanted to show off the mansion's painstaking restoration all of e the rains that i have original wall paper all of the paper was conserved and had to be clained with im a i all ri sir the size of a pencil or i sir msoi was quate an undertaking i'm the portrait of jackson was finished nondays before his dath o i thinking he shas o thewere antaer of his life and that portrait i'm the one i that he looks his stick in his ad at a cari you see wa oring om at his herant at caroline guides us pass the flower garden plan tod by jacksons lie rishel and into the family graveyard there are a few pi dly headstones and line graorome an minstrocity with an ovelist rising from the centre moniy gess which when in these graceis jhacsehe actually have this design for richel and left ring for himself and o these for other family members i pull a book out of my back pack a book with the subtitle andrew jackson in the subjugation of the american indian carolin ind andy exchange a worried look well i'm stant i'm standing here on em a'm standing here on andrew jackson's grave an there as part of me as a person of partly cheroky tosent that what it mightnt dancein on it u no thereis am a letter that a jackson jackson wrote in about the this the removal of the southeastern tribes and this is his opinion on the on o the south eastern tribes leaving their land doubtless it will be painful to leave the graves of their fathers but what do they more than our ancesters did northan our children are doing to better their condition in an unknown land our forefathers left all that was dear in earthly objects our children by thousands yearly leave the land of their birth to seek new homes indistant readgons and ten in in am can it be cruel in the government wen by evente which it cannot control the indian is made discontent in his anchant home to purchase his lands give him a new and extensive territory to pay the expense of his removal and sumport him a year in his new abode how many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing to the west on such conditions wen there is something or something seart of nutty about old hickory in this passage just the fack that that im that he just thinks w well took compare that removal of indians from ther land wthty opportunity of his generation to just go at west do you think i mean what do you make of thack can you help me understand that mind sat probably not im aving the interesting thing about that er was that the they really felt that they were preserving im this is haw tit just about it in their own minds i was that they were axtually have been preserve it that this was inevitable im it was sort of early thought of manifest destiny that it was inevitable that this would happen i at the interesting ly to me as i never seemed to think that we were gin a settle but contry all the way to the wast all the way to calornia if thi just kept moving everybody further way that would suddenly gut to a point where there was not into beany settlement which of course did not happen an we drive on into contucky towards hopkins vill when the trail of tears passhrough southern contucky an december of eightteen thirty eight a traveller from main happaned upon a group of cherokey he wrote we found them in the forest by our roadside camped for the night under a sevear fall of rain ac companied by a heavy wind canvas per a shield againc the inclemency of the weather and the called wet ground for resting place after the fatigue of the day they spent the night sederal were then quite ill an an aging man we were then informed was in the last struggles of dect even aged females apparently ready to drop into the grave for travelling with heavy burdens attached to the back and the sometimes rosan ground in the sum times muddy streets with no covering for the feet except for what nature had given them we learned from the inhabitants on the road where the indians path that they bured fourteen or fifteen at every stopping g john ross's wife died in a place this in winter of neumonia she had one blanket to protect erself from the weather and she gave at to a six child during a sleet storm wanthere is more in gets worse i aways knew the cherokey own slaves that they owned them in the east and that they owned the in the west only in the corse of this road trip did it occur to me that the slaves got to indian territory in the same manner as their masters on the trail of teers can you imagin as if being a slave was not bad enough to be a slave to a tortured indian ma to walk halfway across the continent day three hopkin svill we stopped here because it was on the map but pulling into town we sawsiins for a trail of teers memorial park we did not know about en sein a good idea to go there you mark er and if we bother he wa second a w hal me about what tha origin of this place is in wy why thereis a park here and how it came about o the fel was a washoul stop along the way he tray of teers and the cerokey campd ere we were here for we or while they were here totheir chief ta and theyr bury upon the heel sad stark here and walk up to the graybery theyare our thre longs plack on e one of the pose the last were just before you onother gra weare telld you about the to cheets white paythe flassmen the plack nearest the grave says that white path was one of the chrokey who fot under andrew jacson in eighteen fourteen af the battle of horseshue ben jackson even gave white path a walch for his braverie in that battle a cherokey saves jackson's life we chance at the level of jacksons betrayal of the tribe had a cherokee not saved his life then whit path and fli smith might notbe buried here beneath our feet the graves are up on a little hill he can hear the hivway down below but still its serene up an till this momentes all the graves along the trail haed been metaphorical all through tennessee an and i kept saying were driving over graves were driving over graves but even then we just imagined them there under the black top off in the woods but here the skeletan suddenly had faces pacific stories the graves were real i took the cherokey about six munts to walk to oclahoma we are doing it in five days every ten minutes we cover the same amount of ground they covered in a day we drived with the sun in our eyes on back roads through kentucky we dopped into a remote section of down state illinoischicago and spere to trad a plack marks ta spot where thousands of cherokey camped unable to cross the mississippy because of floating ice we cross it an under a minute in know we are going fast but it does not feel fast we plowed through mose of missouri stopping yet another trail of teer state park here is actually a name for what we are doing it is called heritage tuerism we sound grand its get to be one freekin a piffany after another but after a while we just read the sines without even getting out of the car at the end of every day we fall into our motell beds rect day for in the morning we plough through ourkan saw we get to faetvill in the afternoon we have lunch with two old roommates of mine radan lalawnie we take ust to a little trail of teers marcern next to a high school parking loht that looks black o on this siht in the summer of eighteen sthirty nine there camped one thousand cherikees men women and children and rout to there signs facing a and my circular arantiment of bolders any one who is ever been to high school would recon nice it immediately as the place dudents go to sneak cigaretts or get stoned and once again it is striking how the two american tendencies exist side by side to remember our past and to completely ignore it and have fun le get how we treat all our netional holidays do not we morn the dead on memorial day with volybal and sun screen do not we the people commemorate the forth of july by setting meat and bottle rockets on fire wich makes a lot of sense when you remember that a fhrase as weird and wimsical as the pursuit of happiness sits right there in the second sentence of the founding document of the country o a themost happing ess i find on the trip as when we are in the car and i can bwear the chuck bury tate by brought we drive the trail where thousand died and i listen to the musican think what are we supposed to do with the grizzly past i feel a riht o ancer an bitterness about every his storical fact of what the american natian did to the cheriky but at the same time i'm an entirely american creature i'm in love with this song in the country that gave birth to it a o a a oa ha ao aaa a listening to backin ou as afe while driving

west my uncle is one of the boulders at deposited when it stopped he had to work the farm and then came the dustball and then came the war all these historical forces bore down on him but he did not

performed this summer amy and i sit in the chairs where we first learned about the trail of tears and talk about our trip our experiences were different she min ered in native american studies in college she not only owns the copy of blackelk speeks she could quote from it and for her the trip was about empathy i've been pretty close t tear sometimes just thinking about the pain or what ever what the cans ments have been thinkingly when we ere driving i just kept imagin the kidsing where are we going whereare we going what is happening and i guess i've been sart of thinking about what it really must have benen wike i've been thinking about those kids too but the person i identify with most in this history is john ross the principal chief during the trail of tears because he was caught be tween the two nations he believed in the possibilities of the american constitution enough to make char the cherike had one tu he believed in the liberties the declaration of independents promises and the civil rihts the constitution an sers and when the you ass be trayed not only the cherikey but its own creed i would guess that john ross was not only angry not only outrage not only con fuse i would guess that john ross was a little broken hearted ecause that is how i feel i've been experienceing the trail of teers not as the chairiky but as an american john rig one of the siners of the treaty of new a choda once ro besides cherikey blood if not destroyed were wind its courses and beings of fair complexions who will read that their ancestors becane sivilized under the froncs of miss forcan and the causes of their enemies he was talking about people my sister and me the story of the trail of teers the story of america is as conflicated as our cericey sweetish scottish english

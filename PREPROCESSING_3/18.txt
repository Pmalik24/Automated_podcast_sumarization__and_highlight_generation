wellfolks we have now reached the point in american life wor in our racially divided society there is a quick get out of jail free card long as you are a member of an interosectional group if you have done something wrong if you are accused of corruption if you are accused of some sort of malfeasons the get out of jail free card is youre attacking mea because i'm black and this has significant ramifications for american public life because the simple fact of the matter is that in meritocracy we should be able to point out when you are corrupt when you have failed and if every defense to failure is that the system itself is biased against you whell that means that you aregoin to get more failur system why this true everywhere from politics to administration is true everywhere from the business world to the educational world if when cloudy engay gets fired from harvard university the basic idea is that it must be a racesyssystem that got her fired there is no way to whold people accountable if they are of minority race if for example youare a politicion and it turns out that you are deeply corrupt and your first move is to claim that america is racis and that is why you are being targeted and if that is believed then there is no way to get rid of corrupt officials long as they are of minority status and once that standard is cregated once the basic idea is that certain people in our society have that get out of jail free card and others do not then all standards collapse because a double standard is no standard at all th latest at eration of this particular foolish defense tdevisive defense comes curtesy of a personamed tiphany henyard you might not have herd of tiphany henyard but this is a birgoning at story about a small town mayor who is been allege twi engage insignificant corruption i on a vast scaled according to the ucadalymal the first female mayor of a tiny ellinoi village has been slamed for wuat living a royal a tax par expense by taking a three hundred thousand dollar salary and racking up huge expenses glamors tipany henyard was elected leader of i dulted it is a village of twenty thousand people and twenty twenty one she has since come under fire for what many says her access ive spending she regularly engages the services of a professional haron make up tea and stylis before public appearance is in photoshoots for the counties taxpar funded buillboards those often feature her in what some people say is shameless self cormotion she also a tempted to propose a new law there ould cape the next mayor salary at twenty five thousand dollars unless the next mayor is furr in which case she gets to keep her gigantic salary has been deemed illegal by many people that is just the latest scandal to hit her she was slammed for hiring her former campaign worker as the towns at code in forcement officer despite the fact that he is a convicted childs rapis she also raised eyebrows after spending hundreds of thousands of tax dollars on security details including one furnevent with senior citizens and another occation where she pulled coughs cops off the street to perform a protection altfit for her she also racked up a trips lost vagus where she spend some three thousand dollars on air fare and she is now being investigated for all this and here is her defense a defense that has become the all purpose defense for an enormous number of people in our post george of floid society here she was yesterday talking about her a ledged corruption and the reasons why she is being targeted yae be sindo gao ya black yar black ayachen up yo be in a tackano a black ban na an paw yato be sio gyae angain the basic idea heres that even if a black person is asking this particular mayor about her corruption it must be because they are a race trator of some sort again if basic standards of maritocracy and decency are to be put aside in favor of claims that any critique is rooted in race that means there cannot be any maritocracy any more wish of course is the basic idea that social justice can only be established by getting rid of base line standards of competency and again we see this across the board in the united states in a wive ariety of placis just yesterday we platoclip of mayor brandon johnson of chicago being question over his handling of the huge migran crisis that is cit the city of chicago along with the crime crisis along with the issues of economic problems in the city and his answer was i'm a black man with a black wife and black kids how terry go attack me this mentality is actually horrifyingly bad for the country here is brandon johnson just couple days ago i have children who wald ten schools we have socra games a yhou know youra ask in be has i i'm not a parent in this city i get it a mayor i get it but your askin me to give you a day and i have to cort to y honest than that you have not had a mayor me i get that i have a wife i have children they have schenduels and blus wes sto have public safety that we have to address we's to have the on house that we have to address us to have a budget that i have to address and i'm doing all of that with a black wife race in three black children of the west out of slee chicago i am going to the porter hase is possible e what what is the race of his wife and his children have to do ith anything the answer as you cannot critique me because he is siting his race of course he is following the footsteps of lorry likefoot who 's recently asked at his maore of chicago after one short term because she is a harible mayor but shell happn me a black lesbean and therefore she also claim that she would been austed not because she wis terrible at her job but because she was black when aske after the election if she ad lost because of her race in a city elec chicago which is heavily minorty said i'm a black woman in america of course she would said in an interview with thenew york o priors the election what i'm a black woman let us notfroget certain folks frankly do not support us int leadership rolls the same force that in one herald washington to succeed there is still here that is referring to the cityes first black mayor and this sort of excuse making is a way of lowering standards of performance for everyone well it is more on this in just one moment first if you are me there is not a day that goes by

of it a person who apparently hired her lover as a proscutor despite his lack of proscutorial experience and did it using tax pare dollars and then took cruisis wit this guy and now's admitting to being in a sexual relationship of the person she hired with taxbar dollars as a proscuter with no proscutoria background she is doing the same routine all the critiques of her must of course be based on race pureis fanny willis not all that long ago talking the how races was behind all the accusations targeting her we re p and all th on r t we i ti o w t the you s a o l w w an w g n well i mean because the white mail re publican was not falling the guy that would be the answer to that particular question i assume but again the answer to every question but impropriety is now race in america long as you are able to play that card andit is a dangerous card to play it undermines standard of stability and decency and per formance in literally every industry this is why see people ranging from bill acmen to eulon mos going after diversity aquity and inclusion let us be very frank about this a firmerto the action as a practice is a zero som game maritalkcracy is the only form of measurement of performance that is not asero some game because it creates positive externalities externalities are the consequences that a crue to outside people that are not involved in a transaction you and i we myver transaction the transaction presumably benefits both of us but if we live in maritocracy nd i'm goo to my job in your good o your job and then we exchange goods and services then presumably theyre pos it of externalities to people who are not us i'm goo to my job which weens i'm highly productive you are go to your job you are highly productive n now we produce product at a cheaper and better rate for people outside of that particular situation that is the beauty of the maritocracies that it benefits everyone merit helps every one wenethe best people do the best job at the best time fo the best price that its greate for everyone however when you instead are stacking employment for example on the basis of race youre taking people who are less maritorious and youre forcing the public to essentially pay a subsidy to employ that person that is the problem with d not just that its discriminatory but that it costs every one now you can make the argument that since the costs are diffuse meaning that they accrue to a huge variety of citizens and the benefits are incredibly acute meaning they accrue to one person who gets to benefit off this no big deal but te problem is when you keep doing that over and over and over again the cost to the society start to grow and grow and grow again and that is what youre starting to se and agencies the federal aviation administration my friend and collig mout walsh he released a twitteri thread to day talking about internal footage of seniorifficials that the f a as flight programm operations division which he says is responsible for all aspects of air craft operations work shopping he plan to reduce the number of white mails in aviation now why would that be a useful thing youare not talk about a situation where you need posito externalities how it being good at your job when youare directing air craft how to land for example it putting a less qualified person in place but there the costs are not t of fus there is the costs are inpredibly acute if you are on the plain that gets misdirected into the ground e's tha less qualified person for any reason i's put into a particular position when the costs really really ar high for you when you are talking about high cost industries for example aviation you need a maritocray even more than you would in say a low cost industry stocking a grocery shelf or something well mat got footage of the f a a acting deputy cheef operating office are angil mccollup saying that more workers need to go from ramp to cockpit meaning sho want to see more baggage handlers tecome air line pihlots and then as the meting continues she declares important to quot get a little un comfortable get a little un comfortables always quote is always a youphem is im for ominto say something superrace tostraight now but if you are white just take it on the chin and accept id she apparently complains that flight operations is quote white mail dominated and tells the managers that quote need two talk about what the future could look here she was and nn te mail ter teth a a whilyesn worst the and t o right is teviof represent an i do not care about the representationa level of the federal aviation ad ministration hit is absurd why should i possibly care about weather the demi graphic of the f a a is representative in any way of the broader demographic do we have to have a heavy share of his spanic females in order for the f a a to be good at its job and first of all you have a huge selection by is problem i' love to see what the applicant pool looks for the f a i promise you it is male dominated just start what that but beyond that what in the helishy talking about why in the world what i if you'r talking about a job where your personal life experience means literally nothing making sure a plan gos where itit is suppose to go is not one worts a li grew up in idiverse neighborhood and i'd a bmunch of friends adverse backgrounds and that is really informs how i do my job as a person who makes sure the plain lands on time where it is suppost to land it is the dumbest thing i ever heard i'm in togmelic english literature or something subjective that you'r talking about making a plain land in a place without hitting another plan that is for your talking about i do not cor the grup poor or rich you have one job in one job only and all i care about is that you good that job on't cor about any of the other things but as mat points out this actually is a problem inaviation just as it would be in any other job when you lower the standards for the job soas to achieve a quorticl diverse work force what you are actively doing is making the employment base worse at their job that is what it is get's more on

baked into the agenda several sources have also in for mat about something f a program its alled e fast which prioritizes called indian tribal own corporations and socially and economically disadvantage businesses for billions of dollars and critical grand funding again bottom line here is competence and maritocracy are good for every one and the the predictable result of all this by theway in te employment market is action makes it harder for private employers to employ people who are qualified of minority groups because when you as an employer are deciding and we hear delyuare obviously by by all federal laws and regulations i have to say that because otherwise the analar b sends me an angry nots for using mifhree speech they done i before we abide by all federal and state and local regulations and laws oqe we have set it now here is the reality about hiring in the united states is a broad tren as a broad trend when you consider whether hire somebody one of the things you are considering is the possibility of liability down the line legal liability down the line and the more we creata system and which we say that if you are a member of an intersectional group not only am i supposed to hire you if you are less maritorious than the white gui next to you but also if i decide that ou're not good at the job and i fire you i now may face a discrimination law suit why would i hire you in the first place enactio makes it less likely that it qualified minority cans it will get the job tbecause of the risk of liability that is now attached all this is devastating to american public life especially because it also results in a misreed of situations when someone is in competent and they happen t be minority n makes it easy for people to actively say oh it must be their in competent because theye are minority when that is not true in competent exist all over the spectrum the beauty again of a maritocracy is if somebody does not make the standard it is clear they din't make the standard because they did not make the standard as well note the standard is but if the standard no longer applies and you'r being hired basted on your race or based on your ability to do as these mayors are doing and simply blame the man for your own problems when that happens and then the person fails then it is easy for people to miss a tribute dat to race tat suppose to properly attributing it gto the general sinfulness and failure of mankind all the stuff is deep and in stark and to huge problem for the united states o america s why d yi hask to go d yi is terrible for the united states and every vestige of this arguments that incompetence can be covered for by claims about american racism that crimerates can be covered for by claims about american racism that a educational under performance can be covered for by claims about american racism all f that reduceis it reduces the ability of smart capable people of all races to get ahead and make the world better place for everyone who surrounds them te entire society rit large ogan meanwhile the media are doing it their best to go after there presumed opponents insane story from enbusy news targeting another hone my friends hiratchic she is the creator of libs of tiktok there rib on chia apparently is that because she is posting true stories there are bunch people who read her stories than they send athreats this is not called a new story is not it is not if i cover the news and then because i have a very large audience thereare some nuts who go and do nuts things that is not my fault that is the fault of the nuts and yet that is presumably enbusy news is basically saying that we need to shut down free speech in order presumably to prevent crazy people from doing cracy things thy 've an entire piece from enbucy news titled after libs of tiktok posted aat least twenty one bon threats followed now many of these bon thrats turn out to be hoaxes its on clear we have en sent many these bo threats some o thse people may not even b followers of khia but the goall here is to suggest that social media ought to shut her down based on the activities or follers now this a super dangerous precedent and it is amazing that a free press is attempting to push that for the free press of all people in america should be really careful about what they wish for here if we are talking about the idea that bad coverage of issues is now to blame for the bad actions of people who cover those issues then the medias can have a lah to answer for in america it is perfectly easy to say the black lives matter riot ive twenty twenty can be laid almost entirely at the eet of the american media if that is the case at's a really easy argument to make but they are going after ciabecaus again this is what the media do the media have decided that freedom of the press only applies to people will agree with them according to enbicy news ratchick is not accused of making any bodthreats in iwall or anywhere else which means that its not a storie se normally when i do not ake a bon threat there is no story about me if somebody who listens to my show maks bon threat also not a story about me its ostory about s person medmonthreat whell get to more on this in just one moment first grand canyon university is a private christian university in beautiful phoenix arizona gsu believes our

when people or institution singled out by libs of tiktock later reported bom threats ar other violents intimidation the threats which on average cam several days after treats from libs of tiktok targeed schools library's hospital small business as an elected officials in sixteen states twenty one of the thirty three threats were bomthreats which most commonly targeted schools and were made the a emo absolute insanity that enbs news and this peckoes on and on and on and on again the goal of it is to somehow smear reporters for reporting long as the people who follow the reporters a small cadray of whom ju bad things can somehow be blam on the reporter that that is the gol here and this now merges with the blow back that tucker karlson is receiving fore doing an interview with laderpoten now i have not seen th interview of ladrpooten you have not seen theinterview with gladerpooten no one is seen the interview with gladmrpooten that interview is supposed tohit the airwaves to night on ac and as i've set i'm i can a pre judge the interview the question is whether'tucker asked him any hard questions or whether it was sort of a massage now i do not know because i have not seen it it will be a bad act of journalism if tuckerd ies not ask him some questions about to have in gershkuitch the the walser general rporter whos being held by gladinmerpooten as effectively a hostage or if rt does not ask him about what the end of the war looks or veris'n pusham on his murderous record or is abuse of human rights in his targeting of civilians an u crane and all the restrat there are heir bunchf questions that tucker aughtask be tukkrasn asked any of this question publicly yat ihave no idea what he asked thi simple fact that tucker is tucker and went to russia is now causing apparently some people in the e u to think about sanctioning him again this is the unbelievable stupidity of politics people who claim that they have any sort of principle abandone those principles at the first sign at those principles might be harmful to their political interest it truly is an amazing thing according to newsweek tucker karlson's interview with russian president vladimerpooten could see the conservative pon at targeted by eu law makers currents an former members of the european pirliament of told newsweek carlson visited russia this week on tuesday he revieled that he would soon be releasing interview with pooten carlson's work in russia could see the former fox news host in hot water with the eu according to give or hofstat a former belgian prime minister and curn member of the european parliament the law maker described carlson as a mouthpiece for for mer present in trump and puten is well adding quote as puten is a war criminal and the u sanctions all who assists to him in that effort it seems logical the external action service examine his case as well now honestly is the best thing that interms a media could happen to tucker having the eu target tucker for doing an interview with ladmer pouten makes tucker's case for him tuckers an tirer case with regard to ladmer putnd vladmer's lensky has essentially been that the attempts by the media to draw a stark division between vladmers lenskis ad ministration in u rane and vladmer poutens administration in russia is miss bagotten that zlensky is engaged in corruption that heis engaged in dicatroial behavior by the way ther's some truth to lot of what tucker is saying about that in my opinion that still does not justify a full skall russian invasion of ukrane or suggested its an americas interest to see u krane fully in justed by russia nor do i believe that vladmer pouten somehow has yu kranes vest interest at heart all these things can be true at once but if the case the tucker is making is that the eu is perfectly happy to shut down freedom of sfeege but then they complain when vladmerpoutent does it there make in tucker's case for him when they say this according to newsweek the u's external action service is the blocks diplomatic arm responsible for foreign policy for an individual to be added to the u sanctions lest evidence must be presented to the e a s for a view if deemd sufficient the e s can then present that case to the europeing council which is the body made up of u national leaders which takes the final desision on wether to impose it sanctions or not now again highly unlikely but there are some who are saying that they agree with the stands that tucker should basiclly be treated as a propaganis on behalf of the cremlen now i think a highly unlikely that that is is what is going to take place but a demonstrates once again in the same way the media target ing hirachi shows it just shows thatif you violate certain taboos or if you cannot stan on one side of the political isle and not another side of the politicala political isle all principales with regard to say freespeech go by the wayside now as i say none of that answers the question as whether tucker's general prorspective on ukrane is right i happen to think that a general prerspective on ukran is short sighted and wrong i do not thnk the world is a better place if ladmerpouten waltzes in to keeve and simply takes it over at this point there there is a a grolling tren line on the right that is a problem one o the big divisions con right and left in the united states historically speaking has been that people on the right ten to tink that america kicks ask and people on left tento thing not that is by pulling data here for example is some of the polling data from puw research center the question was whether the u s stands above all other countries in the world meaning were the best whether the us is one of the greatest countries along with others or whether other countries are better than the u s and what you can see is that over the course of the time period two thousand leven to two thousand in twenty three democrats have basically decided on mass that the that no one among the democrats believes that the united states to thegeatest country in the world extremely low number in two thousand eleven thirty one present of democrats said that the united states stood above all other countries in the world as of twenty twenty three that number was nine per cent nine per cents a fewer than one in ten democrats or those who lean democrat believes that america is beter than all the other countries in the world when it comes to whether people believe that other countries are better than the united states in two thousand eleven only eight per cent of democrats said that other countries are better than the united states as of twenty twenty three that number is now thirty six per cent thirty six percent of democrats believe over one and three that other countries are better tan the united states which dos rais the question is to why do not you then go to one of those countries whi tomore on this in just one second first for my catholic listeners lent the forty days leading up to easter that starts ash wen sday february fourteent it is a time of intense prayer fasting and giving hallows annual prave forty challenges one of their most popular last year over a million people joined this year their prav forty challenge focuses on surrender and includes meditations on the powerful book he leadeth me a story about a priest who become a prisoner and slave in the soviet union during the cold war his story is one of ultimate surrender we are called to offer up our own wories anxieties problems and lives to god there will also be lent music lene specific bible stories and other lentin prayers the seven last words of christ with jim colvezal halo is truly transformative it will help you connect with your faith on a deepert level what exactly are you waiting for down low that hallo ap today that hallo dot coms lash appero for a exclusive three month free trial of all six thousand pluss prayers and meditations reconnecting with god it is gimving thost important thing you do on any given day do it with hallo dot com slash opuro right now that hallo dot com slashabureau but if you look at the republican side of the isle re publicans have been prety consistent until the very recent past until basically jobin took office re publicans have been very cansistent in their believe that america is in fact bust country in the world in two thousnd eleven forty seven per cents of americans believed that america was at the best country in the world only five per cent of americans believed other countries were better than the united states fast four to twenty nineteen same numbers forty six per cent of republicans believed that america was the best country in the world and only five percent of americans believed that other countries were better than the united states but if you fast for to twenty twenty three that number has now dropped fifteen per cents only thirty one per cent of republicans believe that america is tbetter than all the other countries in the world at now seventeen per cent are just under one in five republicans believe that other countries are better than the united states there is a a growing cents and it is connected to jobidon being elected buts not totally due to jobin being elected there is a growing cents that things are falling apart in the united states and this is playing out in some strange form policy terms and that there is always been sort of this under lying idea on the palio con right that virtually everything goes wrong in the world is due to american over extension that that it is american foreign policy in the post war era that is created all problems nowt this neglects the fact that it was american forim policy that defeated legitimately the greatest threat of the twentieth centry which was not notzo germany the greatest threat of the twentieth centuries f the soviet union because that throat lasted literally from the soviet revolut tion of nineteen eighteen all the way forward until nineteen ninety it was a wasing for generation threat and the united states defeated that s that makes for a pretty good foreign policy that is a pretty good forign policy record and when you point to the shortcomings of american foreign policy since then those are very real but american hegemany has created freedom of the sees american hegemany has crated freedom of trade american hegemny has insured a huge percenteg of the globe has risen from poverty and yes edison sured the prosperity of american citizens i understand that there is the and bazare notion that americans now are living worse than they did in nineteen eighty there is no dated to support us the notion that americans were living better in nineteen eighty i promit i just easy question for any one who believes that would you wish to go back and leave in nineteen eighty materially speaking not spiritually speaking materially speaking just intermis the stuff you have the answer is no no one wood because the way that you actually measure wether an economy has move ford is the kinds of products goods and services you can now obtain for your time in the work force again all ill refered to a book alled superabundance here by marian tup among others that is really good that can a breaksdown just how economic progress is worsed in the united states the reason that i point the south i's because when it comes to things russia verses you crane the question of whether america is a positive forsed in the world is very much getting telescopes into a narrative about russia and you crane si has said before you arenouh to be a great lodimer's lenky lover to gree that it is not in america's interest for russia to widen it is to rect sper of governants into you crane ou cranes an incredibly large territory it has significant wheap resources it does have ports that are very important to maintain for the west you cran also happens to be the borer into vertually all of europe it is huge country mean to understand how vitally important you crane is to the europian map y ave to look at a map of europe in look at you cranes worders here is a picture of what europe look when the soviets were dominating the eastern block at the war saw pack that is the the countries in pinker these were essentially countries that ruled indirectly by the soviet union and as you can see when the soviet union was round the borers of the soviet union whent all the way up to grease in the south they went all the way west to austria and west germany in the west and denmark and thy included poland easgermany checks locka hungry romania bulgaria and that ment as every one sort of new that the possibility of a serious world war was pretty high butdo you walk across that word from east west germany buth symtanks and sudenly unworld worth ra ay in the post war europ that map changes and now what you see is a bunch of newly independent countries that ben broken away from the warsaw pact and no longer part ofthe wors aw pacties are independent countries the independent governances and histery did not stop for these people i was just in poland cave the polish people do not wish to be dominated again by the russians they do not if you louodnt know anythig about polish hestry but you will realize is that for a very long time for about a se nchery and a half before the reconstitution of poland in the aftromouth of world were one there was no poland who is basilly divided up between the ostra hungarian empire and the russians and the polish people have notdis ire to be dominated by the russians again an and ifyoull that old that old map the russians did run poland and that is why the solidarity movement was created it is why polan sought to break free of sovia dominatian and when you go to the new map what you see is a bunch of countries that do not wish to be dominated by the russians ranging from finland and sweden in the north toastonia lot of yelithuania the baltic states those include of course poland if for example russia were't you take you crane the way that this mapworks bellerous is on the border of russia bellerous is effectively a russian client state bellerus was used as a staging point for the invasion of ucrane in the first place back in twenty twenty two if you crane were to be taken over what you ould now see is the russians butting up against poland buting up against hungary buting up against romania butting up against much more of western europe it is not an america's interest to facilitate russia's ownership of the resources in ou crane nor is it in america's interest for russia to now be on the borders of a bunch of other countries that they would then try to break one the other things the consee from this map is that t e baltic states are in serious danger every day of every year astonia lotgian withuania it is only the security guarantees of nado that in sure that russia does not walk over the borders into the baltic states how easy would it be for russia to simply take lithuania the enter is really really easy they aready run colinin grad a colengrad is is actually a russian territory that exists on the borders of poland and lithuania eve noites not territorially contiguous with russia how easy would whi wiselethlania freeking out wi lithalania is freeking out and again russia has inmaded many of these countries before russia already took over crimea which you can see on this map in the south of you rane russia has already taken over parts of georgia as you can see on this map russia's threaten cassic standwhich is also in it south awso checking a russian territorial expansion is in america's interest especially is not can accost us actual blood the wore to spending money on it all thse things can be for once because form policy is really complex i i'll be fascining to see what tucker actually asks poutent about i will but again the basic idea that americ has no interest in what russia does in ou crane even to the expend of spending to money is pretty wild to ma i also point out the many of the people thereae some people woare pretty consist in about not spending money widely people thomas massy he ise consistent we on't wan spendalot of money on anything including for example social welfare programs a thomas massey is in actial physical conservative i dis agre ithn about forign polsy but leasis consistent prom mi have of the lot ofthe people who are complaning about spending on u crane for example is that they are perfectly fine with expanding social security abenefits medicar benefits medicade benefits thet are bankrupting the united states in fact the congrussional budged office just released ae a por that federal interest payments now exceed tefend spending for the first time which is an insanestatistic we are now paying more on our federal debt just the interest ten we spend on our military budget every year tand that is only going to continue for the rest of time that effectively by the way means that were actual giving money to china to pay off our nterest in order is that we can then spend money hon our military which is really badto owthey the worstspending tomench money argument does not work if you are also a person whose in favor of six seven trillian dollar budgets and is unwilling to talk about the restructuring of america's national debt and just one second we will get to the situation on americas southern border which of course of more interest i think vastly more americans than what happens

amazing story out of fox news last night and here is what it' says the white house on thursday announce that you us emigration and customs in forcemen will soon be forced to reduce operations at the southern border do to lack of funds the white house is now threatening that unless they get the border bill that they want they are going to make it worse at the border nu'st be clear about this there is plenty of funy at the border all the wite house hase to do is put back in place remain a mexico and all these problems go away all they have to do is realicate border patrol officers away from the processing of illegal emigrants into the american interior and go back do policing illegal imigrans and then quickly to porting them it is all they have to do jor bitin can do it right now tbut instead he is basicaly threatening to make the problem worse because he is somebody who deeply cares about the border you see press secretary coreengson pare told reporters that because republicans have not passed he by partisin border security agreement with funding for israil inu crane the administration is left with no choice but to pull back she said during a gaglon our forse one yesterday quote tbecause congressional re publicans are choosing partisan politics over our national security and refusing to pass the by partisan at national security agreement that includes significant border refforms in funding over the coming weeks ice will be forced to reduce operations because of budget short falls alh is that what is what is happening right now in the middle of the biggest emigration wave in american history youre enove to reduce operations cause you do not haven of money your only spending seven trillian dollars a year i believe you i do not believe this is just a gambit in order to make the problem worse as a threat ai mean you wont o talk about people who do not america it is hard to argue love america when your basicly threatening that unless you get a bill thet'l let us you off to hook for your own border molfeasintrican make the border worse that is an amazing amazing statement atd also points out why politically it is foolish for re publicans to the senate to be talking bahoits time to get something done now lisen there are things that the senate could do that would be truly worth while really tied jobidon's hands they really tied jobidon's hands thow be worth while but again i've read the border bill it does not tie jobidon's hands in any serious way when i comes to implementation of the borderbill the executive branch is still going to be using proscutorial discretion the executive branch is still going to be directing asylum officers to let people into te country on their own recognizance the change in the asylum definition whutd have to be strictly and coherently a plied which is something jobidon has really shown little interest in doing remember the currenasylum standerd is the you have to show a real fear of going back your home country to clam asylum and that has now turned an implementation under jobidon into just saying the magic words now normally if there is a legal burden on me to show for example tat i've a credible fear of going back to my home countryi'd have to show you a policy procedur a set of deat threats they would make it impossible be for me to go back to my home country it you are trying to escape olivia because you are the target of an actual drug car tel and you can show theme documentation of this is the case that be a good case but that is not whats happening people are shung up in the border saying the magic words and being released into the interior now all that will happen is they will sate new magic words and be released into the interior what is an i understand that senators want to get things done i understand that they feel lie they can get nothing done in the senate under these polorized circumstances the polarization is being exacurbated by the executive branch that means one of two things either the legislative branch has to act in tandum not to work against one another but to tie the executive's hands youe the members the legislative have to be oriented against the executive branch and tie the executive branchr's hands or there will not be any common ground that is worth fighting for yesterday senator christmerfyive connecticut he tweated out of speech by senter james lankford whois the oklohom up senator who is been pushing forr the borderbill in which langford talks about how probems are not being solved in the senate in order for a problem to be solved in the senate the question is who are you orienting againdst you are not orienting against the problem of a of a open boarder that is not what youre orienting againds youare orienting against the problem of an executive branch that toes not care about the law which means than less you are actively forcing the executive branch into the corner you are bild does not to squat that is the problem herewas lank for yesterday on present wen o ot yes to be able to move on this bill swe change in the wall i understand we have differences but we have got to you sit down together figure out harburg an a sall problems because the american people sent us here to do that nay whall again the american people sent you to solve the border probem that problem is not solvable unless you tie the executives hands the demicratarn' cann't do it no dea that is effectively what we are talking about right here now meanwhile the senate is moving on to it is next priority which was always really the foreign aid an all the stuff got tied together despite the fact that it youad been disaggregated from the start and i got tied together for ariety of reasons its started off as just a series of standalon bilt one for a du crane one phrade israel onephrae tiwon and a borderbil and then what happene is that jobiden tied together eu crane and israel and re publicans who are kind of dice on the eucrane aid because we have already spent an extraordinary amount s money in eucrane blus tere is in fact to wing of the republican party tht ois not rely care what happens in gave and because of that democrats tied the two together the understand republicans want the israel eight and thenderstand democrats want the cranade and then republicans in the senate said o ka well if you are tying nat together than rurgnati and something you do not a borderbill and then republicans in the senate proceeded to ritepry bad borderbill senaas being stripped out and now thers can be attempt to again tied together theu cranad and the israel aid according to the walstre journal send at democrats tried on wednesday to pin down morgio piece support for a bill that provide military aitsucrane israel and other allies the broader measure was the product of four months of by partisan negotiations by republicans made a clear that the one including th borderbill had no path forward with the broader messhr dead send at majority leader chucktumer move to schetually procesrael votes wo advancan narrower ninety fie billion dollar version of the package thotd fun urane israel ans i wan but exclude border security provisions there ar still hurtles that oure emerging on all of this asked in the early evening if re publicans could guarantee the votes for slim down for anade package if they got the border related amendment votes that some wanted sen at minority whih john thune said those ar ood questions and we do not have any answers at the moment unclear whats can a happen with the with any aid bill moving forard meanwhile what is truly amazing is that again the more controversial provision the one that that obviously has lotted to be attached to it is the far larger ade package directed ucrane there is significant by partisan support for actual support for israel in fact the house attempted to move an israel ad bill on tuesday for about seventeen point six billion dollars and they got two hundred and fifty votes for id which again count those votes that is including dozens of democrats bunch of democrats voted against that bill many of those democrts voted against the bill becase they wanted a paired with eu crane or never but that is an overwhelmingly popular bill at's by partisan bill in the senate will majority leader shumer even bring that up jobiden is pledged to vedo it by the way which demonstrates once again the democrats are scared of their wild left wing base their scared of the resheeted to leab ao c wing of the democratic party which by the way those people are nuts there are nuts rsheta to leab is a nutjob she is a terror supporting nutjob orshietad to leab the congress woman from deorbormichian hereshe was yesterday on the floor suggesting that benjamin at to now who the primeministr of israel is a genicidal maniac which is amazing thing to suggest from a lady who has never had a bad word to say about the october seventh genicidel massacr attempt against jews in southern israel also i am really enjoying e spectacle of democrat morons and their lackeys in the media pretending that benjamin at now whof the prime minister of israel is the sole power in israel right now he is part of a unity for the thousandth time a unity government involving his political opposition the people of israel and their political re presentatives are united at this point that beby's even talking ow bringing ya your lapeed who is his chief political opposition to some sort of unity government yart he has his his biggest opponent bany gons already part of the war cabinet but again this is all a bunch of that it is its its a clown show for people who are very very friendly toward terroris people rshueto toleave here she was yesterday ni oppose netin a whos war crimes and want him gone to by many of my colli that continue to tell me that do not want a condition to eight they give it to a jenathidomaniac my message to those co my collige the thimple if you do not support net tin yaho if youare discusted by the cotless thaty of the lifeless children pulled out of the rubbl if you actually believe in alpholding human wite in internatalaw bo no on a blank check to netin yahos genified by the way she wants commass refunded that is what she would meanwhile ao se hoagain has the brainpower of a come quat she is out they are doing the same thing she suggests that what is going on inthe gosstrip is not war it slaughters who first pell soe one should inform her what war actually is generally a lot f people w get hurt and died is why wors bad that is why war is bad it is in fact a war i know because the ware not a war once hedwoard of surrendered already and hommass refuses to surrender in fact cmmoss came out yesterday and said no to a deal on hostages what were their demands for some sort of hostage deal thei'r hostage deal was that they wanted israel to stop all operations in gosa and leave them in pleas in the gossa strip after the worst terror attack on juesince world war to athing that is certainly not going to happen that is that that is wha the action when they want israel to turn over preymuch every murderer that it has not costody back to comass we have commassand place and maybe then theyll get some hostages back by the way intelligence report suggestat a huge number the hostges who were held already dead you are talking at least thirty hostages dead probably another twenty who are dead is well but here is ao c complaining about the situation in the gosistrip which corse tod be over literally to morrow if commassurrendered more than one thousand two hundred is reallies were killed on october seven and a hundred and thirty six remain hostage in response twentey seven fousan four hundred and feventy eight polletinian have been killed seventy persents of whom our women and children and most gosand to daht can not reach eigh fully functioning hospital this is not war is is slaughter o ga what is point out at this point that twenty thousand commos fighters have either been wounded or killed in this war the number she citing includes py ten thousand terras when she says women and children we should also recognize that many of th people wo are classified as ponting what children are sixteen year old boys who work with commass to reality tht i wish it wornt the reality it is in fact the reality of the situation an again comoss reject to te sease fire this week this week it is these delusional democrats to whom jobidon seems to want to cave which is course is absolutely pathetic

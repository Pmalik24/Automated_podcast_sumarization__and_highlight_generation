h benchpirshreesponser baexxpressvepian protect or onlin privacy today expressin piantacan flashmen the is a famous comic from twenty fourteen during the last major war between israel and comas it was done by cartunist a f branco and it depicts then secretary of state john carry sitting between is railly prime minister benjamin at tinahu and a member of comas the comas terris has a baby strap to him with dinamite nd he is holding a paper reading demands death to all jews carry is asking mitinahu could you eleast meet him half way the more things changed the more they stay the same this weeken represent of promilitiapol chair of the congressional progressive caucas appeared oncianen wher shos asked about why there has not been more international outrage over comases systematic rape of his rally women the accounts of comass rapes have ben legion over the week end thirty nine yearald joni sadon told the ucase sunday times that he saw at the nova festival a beautiful woman quote and eight or ten of fighters beating and raping her she was screaming stop it already ia'm going to die any way from what you are doing just killme when they finishd said senon they were laughing last one shotter in the head here is giapal's response rapis erific sexual saltis forific i think that it hoppins in war situations terrist organizations comass obviously are using these as tools however i think we half to be bahelens about bringing in the outrages against palistinians fifteen thousand palistinians have been killed and is rally air strikes three quarters of whomand its far women and chanit horrible but r on teisraily sulter raping whotdanna i think why we are not we are not i do not want this to me the hierarchy of oppression that is hysterical for the first time promil giapol now opposes a hierarchy of oppression balance you see is the key balance in all things never mind the new reports emerging from hossages about just what they experienced in gosa at the hands of comas according to the daily mail quote for weeks they were starved beaten druggd brandod made to watch footage of comas terroris invading their home land with weapons pointed to their heads until the moment was rite for the teragroup one hostage was operated on by a veteranarian many of the hostages were kept with supposed civilians in the gosipstrip giving the lie to the hard and fast distinction between gosas cmass members and the civilian population but still why cant the s raillies meet their jew hating terrorist enemies half way increasingly this seems to be the loceck of the bidon white house although to be clear they are not actually asking israel to me the palsinians half way thartually asking them to meet them about eighty per cent of the way as israel's offensive against comass renews in southern gosip the white house has now rachueted up it is absurd and continuous demands for israel to do a quote better job protecting civilians as though israel is in the business of murdering civilians the same way comas is hor as though israelh is not already taking in sane procautions to avoid the killing of civilians israel is actually taking more precautions to avoid civilian duths than any army in modern history is ronzermer is really minister of stratigic affairs pointed out over the week and we saw that unicep directod their on tomsufi burgees pe than we heard pethiceloido say that iffact continues this could be not only humanicary dis asto re startantic calamity for israel your respass elisten we are doing everything we can to keeph civillians at hans wherei want the american people to understand is dishors not going on thousands of maes away it is going on literally hundreds of the yards away in its going out an a time when rockets are flying into our country we have people running to ban shelters i think wit these rally army has done in inprosetuting this swore thes unpress denen in the history of bors there when you have not enemy right on your border i a you doing everything to get the civilians of that enemy out of fones way i do not think any other country includng the united states hat an if you ever face the situation this would take such great care yet defene secretry loid osten spent the week and warning theseraelies that the government risks quote strategic defeat in gaza even if they wen a quote tactical victory because palisinians he said might be driven into the arms of the enemy this naturally create to catch twenty too israel cannot get rid of komas without civilians dying specifically because camas once its own civilians to die if israel does get rid of kommas and civilians die by gaustin's logic israel then suffor astrategic tefeat and if israel does not get rid of comas israel will suffer in actual defeat this is call they no wind senario and yet the white house seems eager to provide israel with no wind senarios lately thus the bide administration is reportedly encouraging israel to restore humanitarian aid into gaza at the same levels as they did during the recent seas fire that is political idiocy first off it removes all in centive for comass to come back to the table if the aid is something comass wonte since they steal it giving them the aid walcomas continues to hold hostages is ridiculous second israel is currently at war the fuel tou us once shipped intogaza goes largely to comas then of course the media lie about all this leading to awkward exchanges this one between a sky news reporter and a spokes person for the idea you will telling people when is can be talken to next people do not have power to power bo at mebal finvamgal wi fa well i don'know i me i think you and all f your viewers saw our hosages being caraded through the streets as they e released the israel over those seven nights and hundres of gods sencs holding their phones o vibuing them clearly there is enough power to power their phones when we are the'r carading our hosages throughou gaza

straight which is the placewher all these attacts are happening that is the rout by which ten per cent of all lobal trade passes attacking the os navyes rectly is absolutely insane unless you think the united states is wek why wouth the terrorists do that well maybe because they think the uninted states is we tand aybe they think that because the democratic parties bas is showing sympathy for terrorism there is no other way to put this the latest galloppole shows fifty per cent of americans approve of israel's military action in gaza with forty five per cent disapproving hevy partisan

minisota airison wost gonson floride jorgian ofvada and pennsylvania are expected to meet in zurborn michigan which is absolutely ground zero for radical islemism in the united states to launch what they call quote in abandon bidin campaign leaders from the swing states they say will work together to guarantee bidans lost in the twenty twenty four election it should be noted by the way the leaders of this particular campaign have their own ugly histories taccording to jewish incide are one of the leaders wen hosan shibley was forced to step down as the local head of the council on american islonic relations for leged domestic abuse in sexual mist conduct he calls israel quote zianists icis several of the leaders of this rally support october seventh this is the kind of action that terroris are looking four they believe that if they creet enough trouble well get americans thinking twice about supporting israel in the first place this is the tactic and it is nothing new of course goes all the way back to the erb oil en barg of nineteen seventy three it was also osombon laden strategy in the nineteen nineties he believe that america was ay quote paper tiger and after a few blows ran in to feet according to an interview he did in nineteen ninety eight quote been laden believes that whale we considerd to be terrors is just the amount of violence required to get the attention of the american people his aim is to get americans to consider whether continued support of israel is worth the bloodshed he promises the laden told the enterviewr quote we teld the americans is people andwe till the mothers of soldiers and american mothers in general that if they value their lives and the lives of their children to find a nationalistic government that will look after their interest and not the interests of the jews this tactic seems to be working at least with members of the political left in the democratic party that is why members of the progress of qualkus have to down play the mass rape of women ecause they would to cave in precisely the way commoss and the whoot thes taneron wish them to cave in but they do not realy on to lose all moral

large part of this game is an intimidation tactic on part of ratical muslems and the international left that is caving to it and a greeing with it well yhou ouhto say far thei'r being successful over the weaken are not knifemen in paris killed a german tourist and wounded a brittan he said yeuwas mode of ittd by the warn gossi according to the ou ki telegraph these suspect is twenty six heis a kin victed terroris with a history of psychiatric problems which am makes you wonder why is he out on the treets of paris why is it that europe is damned stupid hoe re portadly shouted wait fir way for it a'llhoakpar i know it was thot's a hard one before being arrested near the itful tower on saturday they dea later emerged of police owficers approaching the suspect he is a french born national to aranian parents with stun guns at drawn he shouted he was wearing explosives and was also ready to die he claim that france was an accomplice to muslems being killed in goza he is said what we do not forget your crimes agains muslems especially women children we will fight you and kill you until last day of judgment apparently this meant that he was going to a attack a german couple with a knife thas that is it that i g you ask yourself why wouldthey do that right it me sure they hate jews but why they attacking random german tourist in the answer is to scare the hell out of you that is the whole point of terrorism the whole point of terrors m mis to scare you into doing what they want that is the whole idea here and that sort of tactics now being applied pretty much everywhere in philadelphia last night cuon unchal protestors socidedythey are in a threaten a philoful shop in philadelphia what ar this philofal shop to is the pilofal shop involved in making his raily form policy apparently corny's protestors it is why because it is raily owned s they litterally gathered outside this filoful shop to threaten the owner of a philafal shop in philadelphia i mean let me think i there another population in history that threaten jewish business owners for the crime of being jewish hart oh ya ry i did not see that one coming and inicates verry go these these are the protestors threateng a philoful shop in philadelphia for rorld piece of course they are shouting goldy gold ta you can hie we charged with genicide golddhes is the name of the philaful shop by the way the amount of projection here is just astonishing he is are people who would love to see every jew whiped off the face of the earth which is why they are attacking a jewish philoful shop in philadelphia and they certainly they want evereton the madeleace killed they they want thse people gone and and yet they are the one's charging everybody else with genicide it is at tht the amount of projection is always insane from the antisemit meanwhile over in columbus circle you had protesters who decided tha it was a great time to go shoping la they decided to break into shops or a run rough shd through columbus circle then now reach ta columbus circle and they are going to a run into columbus circle an basically a run roughshod through the shops i gain what is the gol of this the gol is to intimidate the goal is to suggest that the only way to stop there bad action is to give in to their demands in the uning away pas security security doing a mazing shop also wildly understaff right there m excellent stuff happening all over the country in this has it is predictable effects which is the intimidation very often succeeds for example over in williamsburg virginia every year they have a in official minora lighting agan it is that time a year this week conica starts conica is a isa in the yhuish calender to more minor holiday but in america to obviously become a big holiday becaues istructs to position to christmenisin being part of the season and all of this sort of thing wit that said it is very common across the contry for people to hold conica manora lighting ceremonies the event organize ar cancelled it why because apparently the manora lighting which was sceduld for the second sundays art and music festival on december tenth in williamsburg said that it did not want to appeuare to choose sides in te israel comoss conflict now yu mant said yours of waight why what is ligtig up minora have to do it the israel mass conflict in the answer is nothing but again the idea is that if you even light a minora you are choosing sides which by the way actually as kind of honest because let us be real that is what one side wants every one who would ligh to mnora they want dead or expelld that is the goal the put the event organizer claim ta conica celebration woith send a message the festval was quote supporting the killing bombing of thousands of men women and children anddum they even went further they offerd to reinstate the event if the event called for a sease fire you mur the political priors of the people who are antisymetic then they will allow you to do what a that they will allow you to let you minora which by the way it is a rather counter to the to i's basically the the conica story all over again th conical story is about the greek spasically saying to the jews they cannot to minora and the hoose then leading a mass of rebold to stop them from impinging on their religious freedom but this kind of cowardice it is becoming common all over the united states it it is certainly happening onar campasis will get to that in just one second first i've got a holiday gifta gea that is sure to make you the hero of the season now you

holding a teachon this week thacposter for this thing is insane again thisto the columbia school of social work apparently the poster shows a chain that is being brokin by a love flower being fired from anaca forty seven i'm not getting and a bird of peace quote significance of the october seventh palistinian counter offensive teachin and discussion now you might think what what wode that counterofensi be oh y out tht was the mast slaughter and reap of hundreds of people a thousand two hundred people killed twon forty taken hostage that is the count ar offensive and here holding a teachin at columbia school of social work s that is exciting stuff meanwhile coronel students according to mediite protesting against israel and the universities involvement with companies that due business with israel occupy ta campis building on friday holding signs condemning the war in gaza chancing from the revers to the sea palestine will be free which of coursity genisidleslogan and holding a moch trial of the university president won marthopolic for quote complicity in genecide studens with the cornel coellition from mutual liberation against to the intersectional coalition organized the protest which joind many other student demonstrations against israel with other groups on campuss students for justice in palestine which of course is a radical front group the roups first helodyan on thirstand campus they advertised the event as a quat occupacion and then leading up to a moch trial and then finally thyanded up occupying school buildings they distrrupted studying they prompted complaints to the dean they liverta a list of demands that included that the university take a strong stense against stande against quotdoxing of students bydoing they mean if if you take part in a protestin you show your face that' s from of doxing nobly sending their home addresses is ow doxing to point out that a person participated ninr protest the group demanded the university divest from israel and declared the chool is implicated in breaches of international law and then they held a trial of the president of the university in founter guilty of genicide and a partide why thecause cornel hastize to engineering arrospace and other tec companies they be very dificult by the way to divest from the palistinians because there are no businesses that that actually succeed from those particular areas mainly because teyre run by corrupt corrupte grats ofm that all went particularly well the administration maned of meeting with them probably the administration wall and opcavingsto them becaue this is what these administrations do that is exactly would happen over a brown university on monday night last the brown university presiting christina pacin spoke i dividual honoring a palisinian studen had been wounded in isshouting in vermont and then num the the president was t interrupted by protestors calling for the university to devest from israel of course now it is amazing is that the university published the speech as written on website that is not have speech was delivered according to the version on website shoose to pose to say quote at a faculty meeting last month i said that every student faculty in staff member should be able to proudly weare a starv david or dona cafea on the brown campus or to cover their head with the heeshoboryamica but after the procomau students began heckling her that line change to quote every student faculty and staffmember should be able to proudly dona cafea on the brown campas or to cover their head with the hee shop im there goes the astarve david and the keep up and the omicup yup kaving to a all the worst people again that that is what the left us they cave to all the worst people and and youknow knows that is america's enemies they know this to cross the board this by the way is why again all overwhy is it that i feels the world's on fire because when the world america's enemies since weakness in the white house they take advantage of this this would also be presumably why ven isualaw is now threatening to invade one of its neighbors according to yahwho news ven isualen electorial authorities on sunday claims that ninety five per cent of voters in a non binding rough rendam a proved of the nations territorial claim on a huge chunk of neighboring oil rich guiana that by th way that sounds an amazingly free in fairvot in a socialist tyranny when ninety five per cent of people aprove well that is ut that hthat is when my favorite things by the way about these tyrants is that they will hold the elections in an attempt to show that theyre in factnot turanes and then they will stack the result much that is ninety five to fives the guys vin hide the ballic hide the ball little bit tays sixty five thirty five or something but kno it is ninety five to five that they should go in crushguiana and steal all of its oil maduro who is the corrupt tyrand of veniswuala hailed what he called quote an overwhelming victory for the yes thruout vennizuala quote we ave taken the first steps to vanew his storic stagi in the struggle for what belongs to us to recover what the liberators left us the reugh run am naturally raised fears in guiana and around the region about veniswalis ultimate intentions over the contested territory maduro hopes the outcome of the referenimals strengthin his nations century old claim to the oil rich tas a keebo territory governed by guiana the defenceminister of ladmen padrinas a quote to day is ta day hof ratification of national sovereignty the people have done it with flying at colors about ten point five million votes were cast according to the president of the national ectoral council of his amoroso but the tally stort confusion because in opposition politician suggested that each vote or casta total of five votes one foreach question on the refrendum related to venisuala's claim apparently was two two million people who turned out the madure government said it was not seeking justification to invade or annex the huge territory but of course the whole point is a threat the whole point is the reat any when they are saying basically is sure we might invadehim he we have an absolutely good claim to the territory of our neighbor we should just it maybe we will grabit or maybe you will sign us a bribe is the same sort of stick that kam thunk un routinely does in north correa he drops some sort of newclear tast weapon and then he asks for the west to pay him he will not do a bad thing teniszualea has claimed the huge territory of a sokeepo for decades even though it isone hundred and sixty thousin square kalometers represent more than two thirds of guiana and its population of ne hundred twenty five thousand is one fifth of the entire population of giana i'm good times good times and again that is only happening would that be happening undersay a presedet en trump i have serious doubts meanwhile the situatien the situation inu crane continues to be very bad for the ucranians they tried and all out frontal assault on dug in positions it did not work now according to politico nato secretary general yons sultenburg worn the wessian military line should be ready for bad news from the ucranian front as keeve continues to defend against to rushas all out invation stolenburg says wors develop in fases we should also be prepared for bad news his comments come as western allies to bate over amo and financial aid for ou rane and moscow is busing is stroup levels russian presient of ladimer poutent signed a decree on friday to increase the number of soldiers by a hundred seventy thousand a total of one point thre million the lines really have not moved very much stolenburg is calling on nato members to ramp up the production of ammunition now the reason that that putten is doing that is because he assumes that the wess is going to essentially leave you crane defenseless the wesiould not do that the wesho provide you crane with what is necessary in order to defend it is own territory while looking for an offram thisby theway has been trucence about two months into the war because it is perfectly clear from the outset of the word at the military gol a pusing russia completely out of crimea or the donbass was not going to succeed russiad spent ten years intrenching itself in these areas and absent providing craneof f twenty twos nothing was going to change in these particular areas at wit that said russia is sencing weakness and they are pushing and theyare pushing very very hard meanwhile the left is concerned with the things that we are almost concerned about riht amenlihe we might be concerne about the world being on fireboat the left is concerned about is fossil fuels now maybe you think that that is crazy because it is crazy but for the left yeft understand that the the chief moral priority on earthright now is d industrialization and redistributionism hit is the thing they care about the most they believe that the world is on fire not because america's enemies sends weakness and then prey on that weakness they believe the world 's on fire because we are not setting quin more of an example and the way that we need to set and example is by d industrealizing it is by taking green initiatives in order to curb our own economic growth now ironically the result of that is going to be the impoverishment of many of the countries that requirer actual economic health is can make those countri's more aggressive not less richer country's tend to fight each other less i gues the idea hers in poverish every one an n the world will become more peaceful it is really really stupid the u a e climate chief sultan altabare he he said yesterday that the fossil fuel fades out this thing that is being push by the entire international commuties this is really dumin is not going to work he happens to be correct we donot not to tenywish seni up essis agons i esuris the siens a thuse mol sisins oh the o mosonnouou o tha sus the th tas ot to fursi fued is whats wont let ief will not wont apes one point

right about all that that would be of course i vw a e and and he is totally right about all that but the west has this bizar religious vision that if they magically say that fossil fuels should be faced out than an they will just disappear and everyone will retain they are level of economic development or sout ovoche they will not and which is what the sultan is sang there hes well i know if you do this than the economy is going to tank which of course is true none the less biding climate onvoy john carry the wen directly from failingan form policy to failing on climarchange i he is now

there there is notural realism about the world that is strue on virtually every topic when it comes to form policy there is no realism because the assumption is that if the west simply goes hands off the world will be a better place which of course daylie and then when it comes to things invironmental postylicl the world has to be superhands on we can get involved imperialistically with stopping developing nations from developing the're own economies ore no lecture them a lot a lots we are notk on a focus on the things that actually make a person moral instead we are going to quurn'tquot heal the earth by telling poor people tht they are not allowed used carbon base fossil fuelis the most efficient fuels known to mankind aa perfect example this sort of moral disconnect unfortunatlly is pope francis pope francis i've been very critical of pope francis of course iren't have a particular dog in the catholic fight except that i believe the catholic church is strongest and best for western civilization when it holds to some semblance of traditional values two stories from the vatican over the course of the week and one pope francis did take action against one of his biggest critics according to the blaze his the second time this month pope france is punished in american prelit pope france is punished cardinal raymon burk seventy five r old cannon ware from wisconsin he revoked berks salary and his subsidized that vatican apartment he was living other cardinals in rome and his apartment for free hereceives a monthly stipen of about five thousand box he said that he was taking action gainsberg because he was a sorce of disunity according to anonnum anonomous participans in a particular conversation on november twentieth another un named source tait france is punishburg because he was using his privileges against the church reports from earlier this week claim that the pope sed of berk during the meting quot cardinal berk is my enemy i take away his apartment and his salary francis danize at making those comments at never use theword enemy or the prone oun my i simply announce the fact the meeting of the disastery hads without giving specific explanations berk has been very critical of francis by saying you are focsing on the environment and you do not seem to care at all about the crucial social issues that ar dividing the church to day and in many cases you are being soffed on them that happens to be right by the way the pope has been unbelievably soft what he does he issues the sort of vague exclamations about say elgib t k issues inside the church orsay about female priests yeshhe does not actually cave on them you's makes really vague statements that seem to open the door than we ask for clarification es as why why how dare you ask for clairf ication i was perfectly clyr kno you warn't or nobody wo be asking the questions that is happening on the one hand and then on the other hand you have got the pope calling for the elimination of fossil fuels which by the way for a church that is seeking new adherents in the poorest parts of the world it turns out that you kno what they actually need fossil fuels i'm sirry to break it is the pope and everybody else in the environmentalliss corner the singlemost efficient source of fuel on the planet remains of fossil fuels that is particularly true if you are looking at

it is ridiculous i can meanwhile closer to home over the course the last few days the congress expelled george santas e curnently faces twenty three federal charges including fraud and identity faft heis pled not guilty before fridays expulsion which passed three eleven to one fourteen only five people in history had been booted by the house three removed in eihteen sixty one becaus actually served in the act of confederacy the other too in nineteen eighty and two thousand to according tothe walster journal ore convicted of serious crimes congress move to boutsantus because he is pretty obvious the guilty of all the stuff however setting a precedent of booting members before they have actually been convicted of a crime at's can open the door to a lot of things you once you start booting members based on the fact they'v been accused of a crime welcome to congress were half a congress is accused of a crime at's the walstrturnal euditorial bord points out said it is no good to argue that santusis fabulus who fibped his way into offics how is that a distinction with other members the congress what is the rule now shortly after santus is the ouster pennsylvania seneter john fedderman rened is called to eject senter bobanends vrguno exspelsantas how can you allow somehing manendas germain it is amman endas i thin is hat is a center for egypt tbecause that is the accusation is that he was paid off by foreign countries yah s o may now be that in congress in accusation is tantamounts two a canviction and really that started withthe antitrum movement because again the accusations against trump as and you crane bast on rush on all the rest of the sort of stuff we are considered sufficient to push an ampeachment inquiry into him asd to now the accusation is gon to be tantomounts to the actual conviction regardlets what you think of santus and i think he is a ridiculous figure almost as ridiculous is one third of the resticongressbut if the new standard is accused equals guilty then welcome to congress where they are five people left and meanwhile the demaltrump verses jobidon that race continues to move forward howse democrats are realizing that bidonomici da giant fail according to axios howse democrats have rejected the white houses months long campagn to sell bidonomics they stop pushing the term at months ago the democratic con gressional campagn committeeo a commitee and house majority pack two key fundrasing arms oure avoiding using the term bidonomics on social media and personalleses because they say the tagline is ineffective in the meaning this passumer howse democrats stufk with people over politics rather than bidonomics apparently according democratic sources their saying at bidonomics presents a bunch of vitions hey saies tone duff becaue thear bunch beople do not the economiy one democratic strategist said the biggest problemlsn't using bidon but the term as two philosophical and required to much explanation sthey are gin a continue to push bidonomics policies they just will not use the cachrase bidonomics because the giant fail and there is some hilarity to that because the reason bidonomics became a thing is because obomonomics was a thing in abomalis personally popular linking berocoboma personally popular president with his failing policies made the policies somewhat more popular attaching bidon's name to his bad economic policies makes his bad conomic policies worse for the american people democrats are running headlong from jobidon in the twenty twenty four election which is not a good tine for jobine which means the real hope for democrats is notchobidon the real hope for democrats is that somehow some way people srup to vote against donal trump that is a very dicy proposition hey're masically making two separate arguments one is the donal trump will be adictatorill get to that moment plas they are making the argument the donal trump is a criminal the problem there for trump is that he does not have to be a criminal to be convicted as a criminal in places washington d c irl get to all th opdates from quart in just one second first if you are a business owner a nean

is indeed the smarst way to hire ugay meanwhile as jobiton continues to fade in the poles and again the poles are not good for jobiden right now i'm looking at the latest poles the real cerpolitic selection poles between at donald trump and jobiden the latest messenger haerisacx pole has trump up fifty two to forty eight on jobidan in the pulling average trump is up almost two points forty seven to fifty fout o forty five point three bidin his lad and only two of the last may be ten poles he is oure very bad numbers for jobitan again i's not that his numbers have gone down they haven' theyve been pretty stagnant in fac thay're little bit up from where they wore back in june the problem is that the numbers for trump have risen pretty dramatically why are those numbers riseing because trump is not in the news well democrats have two ways of putting trump back in the news that is their actual stratagy one is clam the donal trump is going to be a tyrans and the other is cruminal conviction those are the two big plans on the trump is a tyrant side robert cagan a post opinions contributing editor has a piece over the washington post called a trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable we should stop pretendin huion les compla no one things trump is going to be come dictator of america you now he become dictator of america by taking control the military do yu thing the military is simply can go along with donald trump's plans to completely subvert the constitution of the united states oyo thn that is of thin tht'scgan to happen ti n happen on january sex dhe income remotely close happening on january sixth trump dictatorship and what is funny is that the elements of dictatorship that they suggest are all things the democrats are currently doing again the projection here is superstrumt oh my god he might take over the buracracy oh you mean democrats have taken over the buracracy for a hundred years o my god he might put federal judges on the cartz that are conservative oh you mean democrats ave ben trying to stack the corts for you now the last several generations inwwhat exactly is that the trump is goingto do that insamely dictotorial wel acording to robert cagan the next pase is about people falling in line he is tralking bot hou trump is going to pick up the nomination and all likelihood and the he says trump ll not only dominte his party he will become the central folks of every one's attention even today the news mediat can scarcely resist folloing trumps every word and action once he secures the nomination he will moom over the country a colossis is everyward in jestured cronicled endlessly sthe first ofall that was true of obama as well but then the idea is going to be that once he takes power something terrible is going to happen if trump does when the election he wil imediately become the most powerful person ever to hold that office not only will he real the allsom powers of the american executive but he will do the fewest constraints of any president fewer even than in his own first term whatl limits those powers te most obvious aunser is the institutions of justice oh o which trump by his very election whaf devile to fight and revealed as impotent a court system that could not control trump is a private individual is not kon controll in better when he is president of the united states and appointin is own attorny general and all the other top officials at the justice department ire you ketingma in otherwords because trump is going to nominate his own ageate this makes imidicator i've to introduce you to marigarland we are going all way back to clinton jana renot what what with the hallery talkingabout here will i future congristop mast rober kigan president can accomplish a lobtiese days without congressional approval as even barokobama showed you mean whuld mean even brokalamma he mainly showed it it was barokobama who started this process the final constraint on presidents has been theire own desire for a glittering legacy but is that the way trump thinks he thinks his legacy will be napoleon will his presidenty turn intoadictatorships ays robercagin the odds are again pretty good what what exactly what that hell what is even talking about he says that his administration will be filled with people with enemy's lists a de trurmin codra vetitificials will see it is their sole presidentially authorize mission to rude out those in the government who cannot be trusted many will be fired others will be subject to career destroying investigations againtly this is tiresome nit isznocconahunt this dog's nockanhat which means that in the end what democrats are really relying upon is not scaring the hell out of you about trump it is gon o be criminal conviction the bad news for trump is that criminal conviction is a high likelihood given the latest developments in washington be cees an mc carthy over at national review points out that over the weak end trump wass delt two defeats in washington to see federal courts judge tonnat chutkin whos presiding over the criminal case with regard to genuo six twenty twenty rule that he is not immune trum criminal prosecution now it is unlikely whois ever going to get a ruling in his favor but it could ddetermine the viability of trumps twenty twenty four presidential bit according to mcarthy accoring to mc carthy trhutkins forty eight page opinion wrejected the former president's claims that the first a mendment barred his prosecution by the bye injustice department special council jacksmith lishe says i've puriodically spotlighted the immunity is sueds not that i thought trump had much of a chance of prevailing he says the immunity issue is critical for trump because it is a pealable pre trial and thus potentially a vehicl four delay and delay his trumps main strata to be thatchiscot shot down there is no delay he says trials are not one by legal claims which our argued outside the jury's presence jury trials are one by factural evidence a good deal of the evidence against trump is unsavory but but it does not really matter because it is a dc jury he says that trump recognizes he could be very well convicted in the federal election interference cate he knows the recent pulling which showed him leading by non o number of battle ground states indicated a material slices of his support would fall away if convicted in one or more criminal cases he says that the the lay tactic was trumps best option and now the delay tactic is probably going away he says he thinks that the a peal by trump is problegoan' be rejected by thes supreme court he says for now what matters most is this at is doubtful the former presiden n currentupe pe o front runner will get the e lay he seeks in his election interference case he is very likely to befacing a criminal trial in washington running from march to may twenty twenty four and if endence are acquired to be an antendence throughout the entire federal criminal trial and let us say that he is convicted he says that he thinks chut can would exercise for broad authority to allow him to remain at liberty pending sentencing which is about three months after trob of that means just that he would be sentence if convicted may june july august o in august is mc carthhy says if trump were convicted in sentence to a term of imprisonment the default position of federal law would call for the revocation of bale and in order that hed be remanded that presumption could be overcome only if chutkcan made af finding that trumps opeal raise his substantial issue likely to result in reversal of the conviction which is probably unlikely we may enter the final days of the twenty twenty four election would trump actively imprison that is a thng that may actually happen ow that chut can has basically rejected all arguments to the contrary that is the plan and s when trump says this election interference he is certainly not wrong at least when it comes to that d c case which is ate which is a dabocal al ready coming up we will get to the new religion of the left with goddess beyond say if you are not a member become member usecoachpera

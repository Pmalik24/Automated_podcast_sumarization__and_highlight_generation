i have now idea what gave mou the confidence to start performing magic shows for money when i was twelve i was not especially good had' been doing it for long ot trad ever been to a magic show i was a beginner i was a real beginner i be givin one of thos magic kits you give a little kid that they sell i toy stories and then i went to the bottomer counting public library an liberty road and found some books on magic in the library nd it blew my mind ththese books hes incredible secrets were just sitting there right there in the shelves and the open anybody could look at them i could not understand why any body was in any the other isles a sellic o they do not know they do not know these are here before long i was up advertising in the bottomore dewish times i was booking shows that paid five dollars i belive the price was in the add these wer kidsbirt take parties i dad would drive me the kid's parents would drive me home after a few months of this i got i call from a real magician lik and a dolt who actually knew he was doing who it notice somebody under cutting is prices who are you he asked it was not hostile the magic world o botto more was small and iav been knew wet erybody to have some any new show up he was just curious and generous you let me know there was magic store down town on charles street where guys got together yooge magic mard on saturdays the place would be crowded with any magicians who did not have gigs that day and they would smoke and show each other moves i old guy name danteeny with the huge white beard used to go there youould give you one of his special coins it was stamped with the words danteeni he knew who deni n you bought a trick they tok you to the special table in the back grom and sa you down i taught it to you one o mon is a re member it this was done with kindness with helpful tips how to till your hand how to turn your body when to pause for effect ias exciting to be taken seriously by these man charing these secrets oeri did my act from seventh grade through mysolf ma year of high school ind many times it got kind of carved into me i could probably performd it word for word and move from move up through my thirdiys but now i'd have a hard time i shall regularly have dreams i am supposed to be the act iad one two weeks ago wedesidtod do this weeks radio show about magic a few months back when i wand that david castinboun when my cot workers here was also a kid magician it also py birthday parties for years starting me was in fourth grade anthe moment we set down in the studio to talk about this it only took about a minute to be comparing card moves with the four asas yet one of hem his face upright but you can soll go onn two or three for all i know is that you are doing a double lift on that first days triplift a triple wift then he god der nelmsley count the hen very quickly we just started comparing gear appearing came also disappearing came oh i had the disappearing came iudn't have the appearing ame n seems o o danes does not it sort of do you have a me say it do not as i does not it yes can be dere metal one can be dangerous i had the plastic one s e cheaper in now as twelve years old i had business cards i go the twelve year oad with business cards and mind said on it ot my name and magical misterfire well my businescarded said master magician which just it seems it some level a black bout level or something you kno it i geik is ertifie master magician or something but ye hat woult i's pretty finny a magic at twelve year old kid walks up tour hand ou bidesciptis master magician would be more amazing if they walked up to your and handed you recard that said certified pommer o lo diy did i wourd talking about this stuff and he said this thing that honestly had never crosse my mind ever in my life until he brought it up we are talking about whether we were any good i always thought i was fine and then it occurred to me that may be the reason i got hired w asn't that i was any good it was is ten years old and it was probably adorable to have this little magician come over and is three piec sut and do tricks for your kit is birthday i feel this is obviously true and on finding it upsetting caus what i realize is i thought i was the one who was in charge of the situation during the magic show and i was controlling everybody's minds with my mind and my magic cree and wout your saying is actually that kind of the joke was on me i was the entertainment but not in a way that i understood hit is got to be true right that is clearly to me asn't adult if you are hay there is tust little catill cme over and do magic for your party in tat fec t is when i usually thing about my years during magic shows the biggest feeling i have about it as i feel embarrassment there is a cloud of embarrassment that keeps me from staring at it too closely bike i know i was doing these storeabout tricks and beginner's level slido hand and it toxido and bo hie and a keep with a great reat finding and what a member the act some of the dis pi corny but at the same time i can say for sure audiences work engaged they were engage from beginning to end people were not restless and i know i got laughs and i thought i was good coit seemed i was good wasnit efforts i can de tat i realize i i do not have a clear picture of this at all and there is thingsabott our past that will never fully get into proper perspective but this this is a completely answerable question i called yuting melter who was a good friend o my mims when my mamwas alive who laved around the corner from us and who book me not once but twice for er doughter amy's birthdays first of all a wint you get quite a ind me gu why time i me o i want to get you magic trick o be

professional way of a wearing it a wearing the cape ye ovthat cape ut a e yet my mamma a me that here you ke ye know that oh i'm glad i remembered it go well yes she sowed me that iu been that ni look i reassuring but at's ta david and i reali st our common conjuring careers as magical misterfire and master magician he are talking we realized that much of our pleasure in magic was just knowing how the tricks were done the quickmen itself was kind of mesmerizing with its false chambers and flaps and secrets of the audience did know every trick had a principle behind it and was cool to think about the principls the magician o ricky jay one said this thing in an interview he said there are many effects in magic were woulds going on behind the scenes is actually much more interesting thanwhith the audienc sees and his magician whu sodto one to say if only you could know what is really happening here never the last ye monce david and i dove into a bunch of stories with actual master magicians and i have to say the most exciting moments in all those stories are about that tabout how intriced and psychological and ingenious what they do is ad even as wave been writing in editing the stories lik over and over i've gotten that feeling of excitement about it that i used to get handling the praps or practicing the cups and balls and thats to day show from evb easy chicago itso this american life on our glass stay with us econ the old ist trick in the book it can take years to come up with the magic trick several magicians told me this which mayny wonder what are they doing all that time what takes years to make something that just a couple minutes long and isn' the parto magic i really knew nothing about fom my time is a kid magician i can never invented a trick then even occur to me s i wanted to see it oeu dn't ow on emptivy cribs when they ould do the house stores and get to the bedroom sguyes would always say this is where the magic happens an ooket very different contects but the act of inventing a magic trick that actually where the magic happens and i wanted to finally witness the dark beating heart of where magic comes from i wanted a magicion to explain step by step what takes years ut the wone magician who seemed notous interested but actual kind eager to come forward and do that was teller ot pen and teller tellers the smaller one theg one he never speaks in the act but corse in real life he talks and he the idea of explaining how a trick is made he went said in elecshure because if yel understay the good magic trick and i m really understod that wrihte o to the ma calics the core of its psychology the magic trick gets better not worse the trickey agreed to explain here on the radio as one that he loves to perform it performs a lot an h started working on it years ago tooking to invent something new forpen an teller's live stage show here was his old effect that he was intrigued by se might there ight be something in it that he cult adapt for himself it is not unusual for a magician teller to take some secret from a very old trick it were purpose it into something originall his particula one came from a magic book written in the nineteen twenties and thirties by a guy in nabraska named david p abot and i mat youre magician who made his living is alone shark hit was famous among magicians back then het invent these incredible effects and perform them but only in his living room he thought that was the best place for magic whoo de the thirst tood teller all the big naves of magic would come to this guy's little house in olhon the braska to see these great shows and towards the end of his life when people would come to his house he would show he would show you the book that he had thet it was all f his magic explaind idn't detail he died the book was not published his wife said she would publisheit she died two years later the house was sold the book ad vanished it was a legend in a certain corner of the magic world this lost book wit thes incredible secrets when publisher went on a decates long quest to locate the book found pieces of it and thin finally a full manuscript and four legal sizes lucely finders forty years later a nineteen seventy four in put it into print for the first time and the trick thad attracted taller was this golden ball six entes across a small cannon ball that abit could float around his living room that wasuppost to be one of the most beautiful routines in magic that is exactly tellr's taste tell e love is doing silent beautiful tricks alone on stage an sola bits this are in every pen an teller stage sho is most famous tread is a pantomine with a rows shadow on a carving knife i'l stripping things down to the absolute simplicity and it seems a ball and a hoop and a percon is about as simple as you can get he got to work oh and i started by taking the original david pabi book this long lost book and i set this book on a music stand my library at home and i learned this let me just pause on this page this a page which shas seven photographs and is that abbot that is david piabit yes he looks a bit a white haired fire plug and he is in a black suit and he is moving a hoop over a ball and his little arrows indicating which way you turn it this way and that yes the level of the tail that he provided was astounding i me i i feel he is he is speaking directly to me he tells you how to make the paper mashae that you make a ball ot istrips of newspaper ex wide andlet me let me show you some of the isome of the the beautiful beautiful floating moves that he created ah the cay was standing up and walk across the stage i may be is ho ti mention this earlier tell er an my coworker david castebam and ire doing this interview on the stage were pen an teller do their magic sho five nights a week in my spa gues and bik theatre at the reo hotel and we left t go quite a distance ty of thisork tell her picks up the ball and the thread he ask us not to stay anything here on the radio about the details of where the thread goes or how exactly it antracts with the ball but i still light i can say s a picture a guy and a whoop and a ball and a very long thread on a stage the early days of this i'm learning moves to make the ball float and ow a say i the ball is floating up the string towards you and then from your left hand to your right hand you areactually catching the sound of it which is which is not normally audible to to anordience racse can i jus reust do it tell a gestrio ba he summoning it with his hand and it glides along the thread to him that is a sound your herig i wit is mind mending is that david i can actualy see that he is tilting the thread downwards and that is why it sides towards him but we can see the balls on a thread we can see how it is dyne we hear it sliding alam ait is pritic and at the same time it totally looks he is this sorcerer who enchanted this an animate object into abeying him that is beautiful actally when you see the thread yes it is heare's her's one of david pabots moves that the ivent the ball is floating from hand to hand without really any movement on the part of either of the either of the hands just by an intricate wheyther the thread is interlaced in the thingers then takes the hoop and spended around the ball in various ways which makes it look there cannot possibly be a thread there but of course we can see the thread can i say that is crazy that is convincing your brain really cannot sert that your brain can not sort this out it is visual double talk it is amazing i'm sitting here i'm doing it and it still fooling my brain which i totally remember from being a kid magician and practicing the thumb palm in the french drop and all the other sledtef hand in front of a mirror if you do it right it fools you it feels amazing to you and that is how the trickes word this wis teller's first step to inventing his own version in the tread hespend mints mastering david pabots moves from a hundred years ago i started to figure at what else he can make the ballo on his own hour pactice every day it the bollanthread on vacation with him and vidiotape himself see how the moves li oh no i istray us with i here i am in a cabit in you talk my pajamas i just i was just subsessed with it he took a trip to teronto were a agician frand tought him the version of the floating ball routine that he did and the ma toler was there he tried this thing just con it messing around he put the ball on a bench and lifted one end of the bench and then made the ball roll up the bench nd then later he had the thot that the footing ball as actually more interesting to watch when it is not floating hen it is just this ball that somehow alive and rowing round it is weirder and it is more mysterious is less clear what is propelling it it began to cross my mind that no ond had ever done a floating ball that did float and i was i was jubilent i thought oh why i got an i i finally got an idea i finally got in o riginal idea to go with this with this with this method the next step was to put something together into routine and actual trick as it might be performed this aboute a tremendous amount of invention making up all kinds of new moves on his own for the floating ball that does not float here is here is a move were i kick it across the stage in the land softly i come mag just discrber you doig say kicking the ball on its going may be twelve feet out there and then suddenly coming to a stop and just sitting on the floor what you would think in real life if you kick a ball the ball does not stop until it runs out a momentum this is suddenly that balt stops stops debd unbelievably difficult it is it is me using leverage and slack and all sorts of things i ai hes pend minds inventing these moves an nine alone in the theatre after they finished the shows and all this was preparation to show his partner pan and this point had not seen anything it was a lot of preparation all sorts of things i coan been practising with ha silver ball i gave it pabit is mysterious floating gold or and now e er placed it with a kid'sbal the bounc the size of a kick bal his magic is more magical if you do with real stop people know an he but a sat it is changling fanc cause he thought ready see kids bal at playground but he says when he put the changling fence up on stage it suddenly felt the set of god spou and he didt sid david ni asked teller why dneg to show pan something rob to someting with the moves you would been inventing he said now no that is he thing bout magic you you cannot look at a half finished piece of magic and know whether it is good or not it has to be perfect before you can ivaluewate whether it is good nhe magic is a fantastically meticulous form you you forgive other forms a musician misses a note moves on fie ihe will come to the conclusion of the piece magic is s an on off switch either it looks s a miracle or it is stupi i spent up i i would gess it was it was probably eleven months or putthing together a routine of moves that i invented iwith the non floating floating ball and i showed it te pen described the act that he saw what was it i believe that what he saw was very very artsin it was very lonely it was very sweetly melancholy it was trying to recreate that sense of solitude in iu kn in a theatre later night he sat way back in the theatre wait towards the back i that he could get a wide stage view of it i finished it and he quietly got up and left the theatre and i thought that is probably not a good sign i went back to his dressing room and we talked for a while i never being in the dress rom being really really really wicked uncomfortablethis of course this teller stage partner pendulat ere was nothing about it the grabme i thought it was tacnically good as a juggling bit i thought it was oca jugling he means the mechanics of moving the ball around i was the first time wed really had something that outside of outside of the overlap to get into the penan teller show it has to be an idea that appeals to both pen and me and he said and to his credit he said that he thought it was way to circ disolay it was wag to sort of artse pretensious i remember teller giving a lood it mat of me caus i said what is the idea beyind and he was a very offended hit was lik it the ideais the trick and i think it had not clicked with him because it laced and a sentral dramatic idea of course to me i im i was i was all wrapped up in the idea that it was a floating wile was not floating which is not a very good idea an it is that is not an idea that communicates to an audience he ex sday starbuxs they talked about what idea might work with the trick pen sug gest it presenting it this a kind of history piece and od cossac the period music a kind of thing the would do in a magic history conference tell iu i't excited about that he met him later adding to the idea they tell the odience he was using a method from a hundred years ago that electronic acnolegy and kno help from off stage imagining that vergin in the trick pen ron im back quote from reading this af loss little faith in the idea i guess we can trid this but it dis not een to bring another level in and which itis do it the wat he wanted and not look for more here i'm sure pe bill coald find io now it seems to make a lot of what i did not may be worse i in 't of to every bet in the show that is for sure toll itin y that seem wrong for pen to settle he got back to word sole the problem and his you are making this trick turn from just the mechanics moving a ball around on tha thread tactually thinking through what tells a story wat's engaging wut's fun to watch what satisfying tell i realized one of the thngs that was missing from the trick he says any magic trick is better if there is a reason the magic happens for instance if you put let us say a coin into your hand close your hand snap your fingers open it and the coin is gone there is not much of an impact to that and the reason for that is that the action seems arbitrary that there does not seem to be a cause thet make that ef thet happen ioot why would a coin disappear yes iif you put the same coin in your hand close your hand and even do just this even just say take out as a a match the match pass it around your hand an act with a sudden jolt as though something has happened inside your hand with a coin melted away and you have been burnt and you open your hand and there is no coin now that level of acting that level of causality that suggests that somehow the fire of a match could make a coin melt away suddenly adds a dimension to it that i think is pretty crucial but's o he gives it story ie's that a little bit of a story it gives it it gives it emotion and i realize that i was doing all of this stuff with nothing causing it there was no cause why is the ball moving around i the ball is just moving around it was just arbitrary movement when i tell us collaborators he betterin magesy name johnny comsend ve men suggestion that changed everything now he sad you got a treat the bal a train dog het wil give a reason for its movement wogec cause to tell it tried it i i thought what you what is a typically a train dog to i jumps through a hoop a train dog is not always going to do what it once what you wanted to do i'd hold it the hoop the dog would not respond i'd call the dog and insthead of jumpingthrough the hoop it would come over and land on the roym of the hoop i sit down and ignore it what is the dog do when you ignore it while i very often comes to you and what we here is what is happened what is happening as i'm realizing that the plot of this is the dog trainer is getting the dog to jump through hoop that becomes the plot that becomes a little bit of a story now i han't a plot and a story tell it id something else at this stages it is essential and bases it to the kind of drama that particularly happens in a magic shewl one of the things that you do as a magician is you try to you you try to put yourself in the position of the audience at every moment you say what would i be thinking as this moment and you try to manipulate that one of the ways you do that is my giving the onience a little chance to figure something out asn't take it away from and he does that with this routine re imagines it the ball starts on the bench always in contact with the bench the audience willthink the ball is controlled by the bench andtht he lifts the ball off the bench it sticks to his finger and floats in the air they mght conclude that it is his finger that controls the bal d then he drops to the for away from his finger eac'h time you think of something i give you the chance to think of that and that i take it away from you one one thing after the other i takes a lot of work he finishes the new roeutine shows it to his partner pen who hates it truee true he hates it just he makes it further away my taki at least it was an abstractbly gid thing it is closeit my taste what is becomes something a dog it is moved very far oiti because you hate and animated sho wite to i hate i hate om i hate antable morphism i do not relationships with animals for a anl of objects at all which is basiclly with the si e but se the thing is who where is my argument where is his argument what is he supposed to say this a delicate conversation rin here these two men ho respect each other bit do not socialize or hang out together ho been arguing they say constantly and fiercely but productively for ever forty years and pan knows how much work teller is put into this trick and how mict ute enjoy performing it every night and ti's not saying this out right but it is it is implicit this is beautiful this is mister foing this is entertaining people will lov it it is really important to me all those five things are true soit is very very uncomfortable ad contobo because pen agrees it is a great trick totally works he does does not it it does not eel their show to him tis red ball that is also a disobedient poppy that is the kind of idea you might see in a cartoon and the tried about the shol around the principle that there hould be nothing in the show that feels even vaguely familiar to the audience nothing you can imagine seeing in anybody else's work pen does not say yes whens they know either he does a teller to be in the show it still needs one more idea to really make it ours now iave respect for each other it try to come up with that idea and i do not know which one whof is brought it up i think i'm the one who said what if we actually said i said the when mike close and johnny thompson came and watch me do this trick tesy do other magicions they admire they knew there was a thread there and because they knew there was a thread there they were more baffled then an audience that could imagine that there was thathis was being done with a little gyroscope inside the inside the ball i said what if we say right out at the top here is he trick that is dug with a piece of thread in a special back drop then sad i think all you need is now here is ha trick that is done with a piece of thread that gives them much it brings them over on t our side and suddenly this now had an idea and the idea was bigger than the little plot with the little ball it was bigger than all the little magic tricks it was that you can state the actual method of a magic trick clearly at the beginning of it and it can still full the hell out it can ti that that what by knowing this extra piece of information the trick becomes better another ids if the audience in the theatre the same feeling that david i had standing on stage seeing the thread and still feeling a maze not the audience can see the thread but they know it is there somewhere pendid lobby a little for sudden change in lighting the boom would reveal the thread to the audience fully visible in the end this solution just telling them about the thread was enough for him an eighteen months after teller picked up david p abit is book to practice for the first time he an pen added the ball to their shell is not the longest theyve ever worked on a trick not even close he told me about one that took him six years making anything good takes time this a there is a quit that a your partner ar forty years pencul hat said about you it is kind of mean there is no better partner than teller thes he is not the smartest or most creative person of ever been around but he is the harticed working he would not give up you can put him on a single task in the middle of it hid him with a baseball that square in a face and he goes right back to the task wi'm sure he is talking directly about this bist and and that is true it is true i i have a certainly te dog with a slipper quality about me especially i doll trust my got this trick that we do in the show his not the trick that i thought we were going to do but it is the trick it was call we out toics o teller teered up as he said this i told his partner pen yer he does e does get choked up about tthes stuff i get choked up about o it is not it they are very different people pen and teller even the way they tell this story in teller's telling the stray has a happy end they added the extra idea f compromisewas reachd the partnership worked when pen tells the story the compromise is little deeper i think that a teller dos a beautiful job and the audience loves it and a kind of zon out it does not feel that the whole bit jus snaps into what it should be it does not feel amon now even now or even now you are not into that trick no te tell men i know that but a me tell her may have noticed that every show order we come up with at some point i suggest we have a show o through it he i notice that i noften notd yehaded it is a pattern that shows up but can i say again really good trick he is a beautiful job he worked realy hard and the audience loves teller told me of course he knew the pen still at his tout it do not work to gether long he said without knowing something that interestingly after five years performing this trick they change the ending thad more of what pen on it which is un delind the fact that it is done with the thread alittle more he de this version on the trick on line is vidio from pen an tellers tenecio folas mav will link at our wipside here is at they added to finally finished the trc for gen over six years after tell our first started practicing with thatbits book ant the end ofthe retin pen walks out on stage grads the thread from toler and then dangles the ball from the threa pen takes an oversize sessors cuts the thread thball droppes to the ground and penn kicks the ball cross the stage it as mad what is acting of course we ways into that ball r coston linming out making a very very big object and object too big to fit in a building making a disappear that is in a minute from chicago boba gradio when our programm continues sis american lie fom myr glass to days programmed the magic show my coworker david castenbaum and i both of us former kid magicians returned to magic as adults not all looks very different we hav arrived it at two of our programmac too the lady vanishes ponnin toete this showed david became obsessed with this one trick that he had seen back when he was a teanager the ginnispoke of word records listed as the largest illusion ever staged david wanted to know what t was to be on the other side of that one what it was to be the magician hyes this is a trick i loved when i was a kid i'd kind of forgotten about it and then one night i was home recently watching the tevy show the americans the showse about this family living in the you ask in the nineteen eighties the parents are under cove russian spies because it' set in the nineteen eighties these big historic moments papa president ragan getting shot ere on contra but then this one episode it opens with this mo this is the statua liberty david copper fields making istatch ot liberty to spear on tevy everyshing old prerson i knowsn watching this i si remember this exact non a happening in my house i was thirteen years old about the same age as those kids and as the kid magician i think i'd circled the time and channel in the tea v guy that was our family system for reserving telegen hene ihave tried to relive this amazing moment in american history with other people though i get mostly blank stairs but i figured some one involved ith the americans must have been a nerved me caus there 's two minutes of the show where the family is just natching the trick on teln i reached out and ye one of the producers of the americans jol fields was just me i was in my parents wood panels den in tronto canada on there brown cordoor a couch it is extremely possible i brought some friends just me in one other way too i was a magician as a kid the whole thing hanging out at local magic shop his collig joe waistburg was there also the creator of the americans joe kept ribbing us through the interview where were you when you watch the david copperfield special not watching the david copperfield special we even aware that it happened ah i would have to say no for those of you who were not following the national magic seene in the nineteen eighties and i realize now there are many of yiew david copperfield was one of two truly big name illusionists at the time it fellik he was in a kind of battle with the other one dug henning both had tevy specioals on seperate networks copperfield was handsome cleam cut henning was the hippy whering tideye long hair and teeth that had notseen bracins i was squarely team copperfiew my boss i re a glass i learned what we were endting the story one thousand persent tea hanning love tenning's goofy sense of wonder which i heed copperfield my man seemed driven intent on proving that he was the best in the world going bigger every time in his previous teviou special he made an airplane this appear joe was somehow unaware of this too was ther r plane on the ground or in the sky knose on the ground o well that is not it was actually people stood around this airplane in a ring holding hands and it just vanished the statue of liberty even more amazing i watched it again with joe and joll and here a'll just narried for you imagine it is nineteen eighty three youe in the family living room on some cawh i the illusion of the circhtevie special opens with helicopper footin to the statue illusion happens at night it is all live up we fly up by the crown the torch and then cut to the man himself david copper looking a teen hart cop big dark eyes some sort of silvery rockstar jacket and this of course did not register with me as a mittle school kit what he is young to be taking on something ambitons twenty six years old he gives this little syiwe er i cois iioai a aty ready or po weess ago and i was on bo a young sights here about seven years old ca looi sa a da sad he soin caris an he said he solin caes i than i watched i e look e taoaa bact to the stat acinally he o wily ey sai a you tiki what i ut lt i was thinking or i somehow doubt it happened oxactly that but whatever i otit finally it is time i dan it is mag won e asolu no ataeillusion you all watching at hole is exactly the ways tillang a macopperfield has an audience sitting right there on liberty island at the foot of the statueevery one is stting on the stage s out doors looking up at the huge statue of liberty which is about two hundred feet awaythere are spotlights on it and a helicopper circling overhead our view is the same as the audience were just behind them looking up at the sttue tue on either side of the stage are two big scaffolding towers kind of framing the shot you have a view ith the statue between what happens next is one continuous camershot no visible attince a gint curtain is hoisted up suspended between those two scaffolding tower he cannot see the statue now but it has to be there right behind the curtai then copperfield puts his left hand to his temple closes his eyes this is a signature copperfield move familiar to methan now it is as if he is doing it with his mind a few seconds passed the curtaint drawns and pricing gone tat whe is gespotlike the helicopper o sir but now circling nothing just empty space the camer cuts to reactions from the audience everone seems astonished there is one guy wearing a priest's copp i was amaze yo e ter tatheriy du obody i deas were wore a no i lode wor you and then an older woma av nasee tan a a copperfield i think im an attempt to land some larger meaning makes a speech about emigrantson how he shouldn take our liberty for granted then he makes the statue reappear even joe weiseburg the non magic fan when he finally watched it as int a dull he was moved fore jole an me as gid magicianse we tried to figure at how he did it did youhave ny theories i had i did not have a good theoryan and as somebody who knew a lot of magic guimics always pretty do not found it did did your friend say tell me how he did i i'm sure they did and i think i would have i would to believe that i told him i did not know i'm not proud of this but when kids asked me how copperfield did it ihave a pretty clear memory of saying something sorry i cannot tell you which was true i could not sometimes it is not fund to learn how a trick is done it is all double lifts and hidden compartments and when you learn the secret it can be kind of elet down but there are those times when the secret to the trick is cooler than the trick it sell the sheer angenuity and genius of it and i am going to talk now but how this trick might have been done we thought a lot about whether to put this on the radio but the truth is you are ll a simple googl search away from what i am about to tell you that is one of the weird things about magic to day over thirty years later the inner net exists it is a whole world of explanations and pretty good instructional vidios for a spiring magicians but if you would rather not go down this road with me you can skip ahead or stop listening for about ten minutes i totally respect that i should also say we did reach out to david copper fiew and we made a pitch which was basically this may be your greatest hit it is been thirty four years now every one is going to be fooled by this trick is ardu been fool you will never perform it again nobody's going to perform it again we are not hurting the livelihood of any magician by revealing the secret why not come on the show and talk about what it was to be on the other side copperfield was completely gracious but he said it was not his job to talk about how the tricks are done and he said something else he said to protect the secrets of his tricks he is hired people to put fake explanations on mine to throw the curious off the track which of course makes the whole thing even more interestin here is the explanation that is on the inner net and also in one book written by a non magician instead of moving the statue copperfield moved the audience the entire audience rotated them actually there were sitting unknowingly on a giant rotating platform think a huge lazy susan here is how it woul ae worked the curtain gets hoisted up between the two towers blocking the statue from view and while it is up the platform with the entire audience on it and the giant scaffolding towers and the curtain the whole thing rotates until it is facing away from the statue that when the curtain falls the audience is looking out at nothing or i think to be precise they'r loking out at part of the new jersey cost line it is such a beautiful secret smart and simple dbig there is another part of the secret which is even crueler when i first hurd there might have been a rotating platform and wondered what was to stop the audience members from just turning their heads and seem the statue after all it should ave bee just off to one side the answer it is hidden in what in retrospect is the only possible place behind one of the scaffolding towers used to hold the curtain up he scaffolding towery's tiny com pared to the statue but it is close enough to the audience that with the platform rotated to just the right position the tower blocks the statue from view watching the tevy special again knowing this made it even more impressive i kept thnking how exciting and nerve racking it must have been to be copperfield in that moment to pull this off the rotation would have had to been fast enough that it did not seem to take too long but not fast that some one would notice and super smooth here is joll fields former ked magician first all how could the people there not have noticed suck high stakes r it is ballsy but these people on the thing and hope that really no ones can anotice it is wildly got setrick wha could it t not work what could have gone wrong ah one or more people could have said avis platform's rotated some one could hae a compass the more i thought about this the more questions i had was this really how it was done could you get away with something that maybe this was a fake explanation planted by david copperfiel a scaffolding tower to hide some deeper secret i figure the best thing would be to tract down some of the audience members who were there at the foot of te statue of liberty but remember it this happened in nineteen eighty three and it any case none of the audience members er name i did not see any easy way to tract of down but as i was watching in rewatching the vidy of the trick i found one shot where some one's name was revial some one i could tryed at contack it comes in the lead up where copperfield is in the office of the park service official for the statue of liberty it is just a quick cotaway where he is explaining that he had to get permission to make the statue disappear but if you freeze frame on that part you can just make out on the man's desk a name plate david l mafitt i had no idea if the sky was still live this was after all thirty for years ago but i started searching for a david l mafitt and i found one in virginia but with a previous residence of liberty island i i got on a plain to fly down through rec a awt a at wit my rat wa cari for ten years if you wanted to do anything with the statue of liberty hou had to go through david l mafitt he lived on the little island with thes family the park service has a house there gry the statue was right outside his window he feltli gt was his job to protect or ias almost member of the family when a deoderant maker tried to use her in and add maybe because she has her arm up david maffitt fought back when a furniture company wanted to hang a couch from her and have some one sit in the couch he vtod it and when david copperfield requested permission to make her disappear he said no i personally felt that was a anaprolpriet use of such a sacred i gone and i wrote that ta rejection to the request and i thought that probably was the end of it but the copper weeks later maffa gets a letter in the mail from the director of the national park service giving copperfield permission copperfield had gone over his head he had connections i the white house copperfield's teem did confirm this they said he got permission directly from ronald raken put it modly i was a little bit taken back a few days later a wafked and office and there david copperfield he standing up there very andson mih looking i well dressed copperfield apologized for getting him over rule mofat says copperfield seemd sincere a nice gott ma sin to pirmit and tan he says i would for you to sin awayver that she will not disclosed how i make to scatue justappear as is no i will not do that that a i would never do anything that would lemint my freedom of speech hard to argue with that wayer at the foot of the sttue of libert maffa was there during the filmae and he saw how the trick was dont he says he kept his mouth shut for the last three decades only told family in a few friends but he confirmd for me the explanation on the internet that is the real explanation he even demonstrated for me we got the lacy sus an did i use for pottery that than could you get that or i'll get it he had a miniature statue of liberty of course it dage charce turning he an it goes maybe twenty fave or thirty degrees to the right during the filming maffa was standing just off to the side of the platform i found another guy who was there and who confirmed the basic mechanics of how the trick was done but talking to himn made me wonder if there might be a whole other level of the steptune to the trick his name is al serula his name was in the credits for the show he flew a helcopter in the veat non more and now for tvan movies many the vengers spider man mupit is take manhan the one i wane to ask you about was in the nineteen eighties t would be probably cirkqueny to one of as wer we it was in nineteen eighty three at night hork it involve the statue of liberty a working girl no when david copperfield made the statue o taverit copper ou yer yet i was a pre great deal actui he told me the helcopter's job was to fly from position a to position b while the curtain was blocking the view miscally from above the statue to above a designated empty spot which was rigged with duplicate spot lights if you think about it the helcopter and the lights are the fixed points in the trick the things that make the audience think the're looking at the same spot i did think he was ere to beablo o how con w whetwere you worried about happening bee tl you se oa page moerer whatever they trek a wot wat yo raon cat a barring and tage n i on e bottom that wul oi hey got away to couple of time ye culd wor o worka right and could not get it to work at wher he wantet hich put this un pleasant thought in my head was the audience really fool by this wer were they may be in on the whole time ah yet zatray yet adgi yes i shomer the people on the ardiance for stage the new work ginner happen oh not everybody ont phin tur do no i do not know bout that partry u know we deer i didt to that i never acton he never makon i asked david elmafat the park service sky wats the audience in on it he answered with a story this happened just after the finished shooting thereby a slappin eeby on the on the back in everby a hacpyat all and i stad some to one of the called audience a haw did you and up here and she i was paid for this and i was paid to come here ye and that was count of the end of the conversation i was i did not that is not i was not investigating i was just curious worthy people came from a specially when the actual amaze at it was disathat it had disappeared because they felt the stage motn they they could not help but feeld the stage moving do you think they were all actors i do not not they were actors ir i wanted te at i do not know i know that one of tem was paid to be there moffitt went back over this in his memory because he wanted to be accurate he later told tus he thinks it was one of his employes who talked o the woman to be fair its been over thirty years but this thought that the audience might have been in on id it made me incredibly sad it felt cheating if all those people going wow they were paid to go well they were not fooled that is not magic that is we are watching a play about magic i told the americans producers joe and jold about this joe the former cad magician did not see it the way i did at all it means he bought off the whole audience no no no it does not it might mean that it does not e let us say he no the audience was os the talivisian audience is the audience he promised to make the statue of liberty disappear with no cammer tricks he made the statue liberty disvea with no camertrics it is mefree ro matic and it was moving i think it is little troubling if true if true i honestly did not kno wan to believe i watch the teevy special again and ag an and some of the audience members started to look actors at least in moments lik just after the curtain drops an the statue was gone the s one guy leans over to the woman next to him on points and this kind of hoky ray then there is the fact that one of the audience members is in a priest color really he hppend to get a priest in the audience and to priest dressed that way when they go out at night finally i got it toi i was at this magic show talking to these two people one of them i'll call a former high ranking official in the magic establishment they knew some one who had been there on liberty island during the filming of the show and would know the truth i called the person up and he agreed to talk my name as etalonzo i'm known as the misvit of magic and may be remember me as max the owner of the dine room say by the bell edd was also the guy who made that curtain go up and down in front of the statue of liberty actualy there were two guys was a big curt ed was eighteen years old the time ha young magician sayd he stayed overnight at david copperfield's parents house in new jersey before the shuede i told him ihad heard the audience might have been in on it i told him what the park servisgy had told me that an audience member had said she had been paid to be there really i'm totally surprised heit is possible that may be some of the people were paid to be there only because they could not get enough regular people with the amount of tickets that they gave out sometimes you do use paid extras in an audience he says they show up one time and he can tell him the dress nicely but even if they were paid people they would have not of known how the trick was done it was no reason for for any one to know ahad a time copperfield's team by the way says no audience members were paid they said the woman who claim she was paid to be there must have been on the production staff and edd says an enormous amount of work was done to make sure the trick woold fool people edd did not want to talk about or confirmd the mechanics of the trick but he said they did a whole dry run beforehand out in lost angelis the idea to make the statue of liberty disappear came from an illusion desiner named jim steine byer copperfield's team with the help of a guy name don wane atat all kinds of improvements and built the stage as a test they used it to make the moon disappear they said the stage a basically in his parking lot hthe you we were in a parkin licause the the stage was enormous david thought that we have to do kind of a demonstration to work out the bugs before we hall this thing to new york a butch of top magicians in alle sat on the stage copperfield made the moon disappear and everyone gave notes tweeks to make it better s ehe could fool a real audience edd says the night of the filming at the statue of liberty it was clear to him that the people in the audience were a fool i asked him why in a couple shots the audience seemed a little fake to me he had a retty good explanation which is that they filmed the trick multiple times copperfield's team officially denies this edd says it though i think that may be after we didit about the third or fourth time some of the people that were sitting on this platform may have had an idea as to what was going i grilled ed for an hour abol and for what it is worth i believe in when he says the audience was not innoln hough i do have this tiny sliver of dow which i have to say i kind of enjoy the feliout david copperfield told us he was disappointed that we wanted do our story on a trick thatis over thirty years old he said he had better stuff now stuffy just invented that hes totally jasabout yeu need to see it he said ire and i went to a show in lost vagus copperfield this sixty years old now and doing two or three shows a day that is just how he rolls the other year he did over six hundred performances the show was not all to my taste but it was amazing the work of an obsessive person driven to keep creating new things at one point the lights went out just for a brief moment and when they came back on an enormous flying saucer had appeared right over our heads i mean huge it took up a good part of the theatr and it moves the malinium falcon or something hovering and banking the wey you imagine flying saucers moving when you were akid it is this moment of jus sheer surprise and delight and joy i do not care how he did ter taston down dn bel bergham is produced to day by

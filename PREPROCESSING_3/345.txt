welcome to the huberman laconcans a science scienspaceto s fr li i mend your hubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthymology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking about goal setting and achieving goals now we have done three ful episodes about this topic previously i did a solo episode about this topic where i described the nourol science of the circuitry in the brain enbody that underlies goal setting and pursuit i also hosted two expert guests who have done extensive research on these topics those guests were doctor emily balchettis from new york university and doctor mya schon car to day's episode is going to focus on the key take aways from those three previous episodes as well as incorporate new information that has been published in the scientific literature since those episodes eired that by the end of to day's episode you will have a potent tool kit fort setting and pursuing goals we will talk about how to select which goals to pursue and when we will talk about how to measure your progress we will talk about how to initiate and sustain motivation as you pursue your goals we are also going to dispel some prominent myths about goal setting and pursuit geven that this is a tool kit episode i will talk about some of the underlying biological mechanisms for the protocols that i describe but most of what i will cover are the protocols themselves the how to identify a goal select the best goal for you to pursuit how to initiate goal pursuit how to maintain goal pursuit how to avaluate progress and how to do the posttolk analysis after you achieve a goal or as the case may be not achieve a goal although i am confident that if you implement even a supset of the protocols that we cover today that you stand the greatest possible chance of both setting the proper goal and achieving that goal and i can say that both with confiden nce an humility because the protocals i describe we are not created by me they are gleand from the scientific pure reviewed literature and they have been shown to work before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theem i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well end enough everything in life goes much better and when we are not sleeping well or long enough things in life get worse we know that from data we all know that from our own experience one of the essential things to getting a great night's sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment needs to be such that your coor body temprature drops by about one to three degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and then increase by one to three degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning with eight sleep smart mattress covers you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment that it is ideally match to your temperature needs i started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover a few years ago and it is completely transform the quality of the sleep that i get much that i actually loathe travelling because i do not have my eight sleep mattress cover when i travel if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock calm slash huberman and you will save up to a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u ssa candida u c select countries in the eu and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by mawe newy venison mawe newe venison is the most nutrine dense and delicious red meat available i've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes end with guess about the need to get approximately one gram of high quality proteene perpound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition the're many different ways that one can do that but a key thing is to make sure thatyou are not doing that by injesting excessive calories mow knewe venison has the highest density of quality protine per calory and it achieves that in delicious things ground meats tenison stakes jerkey and bonebrof i particularly the ground venison i make those into venison burgers probably five times a week or more i also the jerkey for its convenience specially when i'm travelling are especially busy with work and know that i'm getting an extremely neutriant dents high quality source of protine if you would to try mowe newe venison you can go to mae nwy venison dock cam slash huberman and get twenty per cent off your first order again that is mawe newy venison dock cam slash huberman to get twenty per cent off oh cay let us talk about goal setting and pursuit and as i mention a few minutes ago this is a toolkit episode i'm not going to talk too much about the mechanistic underpinnings of the protocols for gual setting in pursuit i'm mostly just going to give you those protocals but before i do that i want to take just three minutes i promise just three minutes or less and describe the nurl circuitry involved in gual setting in pursuit and there two reasons to do that first of all the biology of gal setting in pursuit is absolutely beautiful it is incredible that we and many other animals in fact have this neral circuitry and that it works in the way that it does but equally important is that when we have a mechanistic understanding or framework for how a protocol or set of protocols work it makes it much easier to tweak those protocols and costomize them to our unique needs and with that said the goal setting and pursuit circuitry essentially consists of for major stations in the brain although it is important to point out that each of those stations has a number of other connections that are important for the whole gual setting in pursuit process but we can distill things down to for major hubs or stations within the brain and those are the bazil ganglia the latteral prefrontal quartex and the urbital frontal quartex going through those one by one the migula's a strucsure within the brain uaship two of them one on each side of the brain that is involved in circuits associate with arousal in driving levels of a lertness s also involved in fear you' probably heard that many times before but also things anxiety and actually the emigla can be involved in what we call positive vailance experience is not just the bad stuff fear and anxiety but also positive forms of arousal and even learning the bazil ganglia include a lot of different brain structures but for sake of to day's discussion what you need to know is that the basil ganglia includes two major pathways one is the called go pathway which is the pathway involved in generating actions and the other is the caed nogo pathway or the pathway involved in with holding or ceasing action and this is really important understand because with all goals we have to ask ourselves are we trying to learn how to do something new or are we trying to withhold a certain set of actions and of course any time we learn anything it is a process of both generating and withholding certain actions we have got the imigula and we have the basel ganglia which has thi go action initiating and nogo action with holding circuitry within it and then there is the lateral prefrontal quartex which is involved in immediate and long term planning and this is going to be a key component of to day's discussion because we are not going to be talking bout lateral prefrontal quartex perse but we are going to be talking about time persection in the contects of setting and achieving our goals because setting and achieving our goals is all about being able to orient both in space knowing where we are in what we are doing but also in time now where we are in that road of progress toward achieving our goal are crossing that finished line and repeatedly updating those finished lines in many cases and the fourth structure is the orbito frontal quartec which all brain areas tends to be a multi tasker does a bunch of different things but for sake of today's discussion it is important to understand that the orbital frontal quartex is involved in evaluation of our current emotional state and arousal state a as it relates to our goal pursuit for instance are we happy because we are sensing progress or are we unhappy and feeling frustrated or sad or angry because we are feeling that we are not achieving progress or that somehow we cannot get into the sorts of actions that are going to allow us to eventually reach our goals o case i described for major structures all of which communicate with each other and of course a lot of other brain areas and those four structures were the imigdula the bazo ganglia the go and nogo circuitry the lateral prefrontal quartexs and the orbital frontal quartecs and those represent the cor components of the nuerl circuitry involved in goal setting and pursuit i realize thit idn time that section i do not know whether not it was three minutes or less but if it was shorter than three minutes great and if it was longer than three minutes well i promise to shave a couple minutes off the end of this episode o case now you have the understanding that we all have the same nerl circuitry for goal setting in pursuit i find that amazing regardless of whether not you want to achieve a fitness goal or an academic goal or workgoal monetory goal relationship goal if you want to just get better at relaxing been told i should perhaps pursue that goal well youare going to use the same neral circuits for each and any of those i find that incredible i also find that very reassuring because what it means is that if we can focus on the tools and protocals that are anchored in the biology of goal setting in pursuit as we understand them to exist in all humans and indeed in other animals as well well then we should have the greatest possible confidence that we will in fact achieve our goals how do we go about doing that well the first question you to ask yourself is what goal do i want to pursui and the first protocall for deciding what goal you want to pursue is that tually quite simple one in terms of how it' stated but it is fairly complex for a lot of people to answer and that is which specific goal are you going to try in pursue because guess what folks most people who tryin to achi ou've many goals simultaneously fail at all of them this is what i call the overhaul approach when people think o k on january one or next month or next week or perhaps even to day i'm going to start exer cising i'm going to start meditating i'm going to learng to language i'm going to learn to dance i'meing to do all these different things and that is just too many goals i think here is an appropriate place to high light the word priority a priority literally means one thing that you place ahead of all others these days we hear a lot about priorites plural but we really should be thinking about priorite and defining our priority for learning in a given phase if you are somebody who wants to get more physically fit or yu want to learn something cognively that is terrific you are allowed to have multiple goals but i highly recommend that you first select just one goal of course you do not let go of other aspects of your mental health and physical health that you do not throw your life away in service to this one goal we have all seen how that goes and it is not a brif picture but rather that you continue to engage in healthy ways with the other aspects of your life that your proficient at are mostly proficient at but that you select one goal that you are going to try and attain how you select that one goal of course is going to reflect your values your motivation your resources but it is very importat that you spend some serious time defining that one priority that one goal for this initial goal setting and pursuit period and in a moment i'll tell you how long that goal pursuit period ought to be but for some people the best way to defind which goal they are going to purso is to write out the different things that they want and then essentially cross off the various things that they are willing to put on hold for the time being and circle the thing that ayre really going to focus on and only that thing and again this is highly individual it is going to depend on you your past youre present your future your resources all of that but having that one priority is going to really increase the probability that you are going to achieve your goal now we also know from the scientific literature that how lofty that goal is will impact whetheror not you are able to achieve it and i think most people mistakenly believe that if a goal is easy to achieve it is more likely that they will achieve that goal sort of a du but in fact the opposite has been shown to be true if a goal is too easy to achieve it seems that it does not recruit sufficient amounts of the arousal network that involves the amigdula but a bunch of other brain structures as well that get people into the necessary actions to continually pursue that goal this perhaps should not be surprising in order to learn something we have to shift our nervous system into states that are somewhat uncomfortable they should be safely uncomfortable states but they should be uncomfortable states and we are going to talk more about this as the episode continues but any kind of successful learning or goal pursuit is going to involve errors it is going to involve failures it is going to involve frustration it is going to involve anxiety all of those states of mind an body in fact shift the brain into modes of called nerral plasticity they give it the ability to change and that should make perfect sense because if you can complete what you need to do easily there is absolutely no reason for the narl circuitry in your brain or body to shift in any way why would it rather those states of discomfort frustration anxiety et cetera represent shifts in nurrow chemical states that literally open the opportunity for nurrl plasticity to occur the changes between nurons that allow those nurons an their associate neral circuits to perform differently in the future when we learn something the key here is tofold first define the specific priority goal that you are going to pursue and set aside all other goal pursuits and in doing that it make sense to pursue a somewhat loftier goal then perhaps a more mun dain goal or if exactly what goal you are going to prioratize that you try and achieve perhaps more than you think you ought to be able to achieve within that given goal and within the goal that yu decide to prior attize you want to set a level of progress a level of performance that your striving to attain that is a bit above what you actually believe at this time you can accomplish now in doing you are inevitably going to encounter some frustration and anxiety but remember the component of the neral circuitory that we talked about the beginning of the episode the orbital frontal quartext that orbital frontal quartex is not just part of a neurl circuitory that assesses how we feel in a given moment as we are trying to pursue a goal but it also understands context it has the capacity to for instance see that you are experiencing anxiety know that you are frustrated but now that you understand that anxiety and frustration that comes with making errors is actually the gateway it is a necessary gateway to achieving neurl circuit changes call neral plasticity well the orbital front ol quartex understands that context it literally can take information about neral plasticity can take information about frustration which you now have and it can combine those such that when you experience that frustration you experience those errors and you previously would have wanted to quit now that you are literally making progress youre literally shifting those neral circuits in the direction of improved learning now it is also important to remind that neral plasticity the changes in neral circuits that allow for improve performance in the future does not occur instantaneously that frustration that occurs during our attempts to learn or to pursue a goal is the triger for neural plasticiy the actual rewiring of neural circuits that are lows for proficient correct performance occurs during deep sleep in other forms of deep rest this is somethey iave covered extensively in episodes on neral plasticity and learning and if you to learn more about nerl plast icity in fact if youd a zeo cost tool kit that defines the socale superprotocal for nerl plasticity in learning that is not just nested with the contects of goal pursuit in learning we have that you can go to huberman lapdok calm you go to the men youscroll down to news latter and ou can sign up its completely zer cost and you will get that as a brief i believe it is a two or may be three page petyaff o ket returning to goal setting in pursuit first you nean to set your goal you really should take the time required to define your priority what are you going to try and learn and then you are going to pick a goal that really feels challenging that feels it might even be out of reach because that will recruit the nerl circuits associate with arousal the're modiv ating enough to get you into action now i want to be very clear i'm not suggesting that you pick a goal that is impossible to achieve or that you believe is impossible to achieve that is not going to serve you well rather i'm saying pick a goal that feels just a bit out of reach and do not obsest too much about whether or not it is a lot out of reach or little bit out of reach pick something you are excited to pursue that you would really to accomplish set that goal and then just set aside all other goals still of course maintain or improve other aspects of your life that are necessary for daily living for mental health physical health et cetera but really just focus on one goal i promise that you will be far more satisfied with the results if you can truly set a priority once youve defined the specific goal that you are going to prioratize there are two more things that you need to do before you start to pursue that goal the first one is that you need to define the specific verbs the actions that are involved in pursuing that goal this is absolutely critical lot of people will set a sort of title goal or a goal state ill say oh i want to be rich or i want to be smart or they will say i want to be fit or proficient in a given language it is really important that you put additional specificity on your goal in fact it is important that you put a lot of specificity on your goal and tht you focus mainly on verbs when defining that specificity now ther're a lot of reasons for this that have to do both with increasing the probability that you will achieve your goal as well as it maintaining mode ifation as you pursue that goal for instance rather than saying you want to be fit or you want to be a better runner or swimmer you would want to get very specific about the verb that youare going to engage in in order to achieve that goal now it is somewhat obvious in the case of running or swimming i think everyone understands that if you want to be better runner there is going to be some running involved if you want to be better swimmer there is going to be some swimming involved of course but presumably there will be some other behaviours as well everything from driving to the pool or lacing up your shoes in there is an essentially near infinite number of verbs involved in any type of goal pursuit what are talking about here is really defineing the goal on a piece of paper and i do think that is im portant you should write this down and i think the process of selecting your goal that priority as well as defining the specificity of the verb action that you are going to pursue should be done on paper you of course i're going to think but than you should write it out seeing things on paper and writing them out by hand with pennor pencil really has been shown to engage neral circuitry in a way that is different then typing with your thumbs into your fone which by the way is a new feature of human evolution i do believe this is the first time in human evolution that we have a written with our thumbs i do not know i do not have a time machine i cannot go back and check but i'm willing to place a bet that that statement is correct the point is that writing things out is not only important it is also the most effective way to embed knowledge in our nervous system it i highly recommend that you write things out on a piece of paper in your process of goal setting when we are talking about generating verb specificity about your goal it would look the following let us say i want to quotn't get more fit or learn conversational french or anything for that matter gardening maybe i want to build a gazibo in the back yard or a deck in the back yard the key thing to answer is what is the major block of action that is going to be involved in pursuing that goalso for instance if you want to get more fit and you are oing to do that primarily through running and wait training or swimming in wait training you would want to get very specific an defining that priority goal as i'm going to run ex number of miles per week or i'm going to go to the gim three times per week to lift waits although i would recommend getting even more specific than that i would recommend that you literally write down i'm going to go to the gim three times per week for a minimum of sixty minutes where fifty minutes of that or carrying out hard work kay with of course rest between sats et cetera or i'm going to attend three classes per week or perhaps even just one class per week of learning conversational french plus i'm going to spend two hours per week of practicing say word problems or mathematical problmes whatever it is you want to define first the priority then you want to tefind the verb action that represents the bulk of effort towards that priority running in the case of the person who wants to get fit by running weit lifting in the case of the person that wants to get fit by weit lifting of though of course i hathe recommend people do both resistance training end a cardy of ascular training if indeed they want to be truly fit or in the case of language learning or learning how to code or gardening or something that sort to really defind the verb actions involved and then to place specificity in terms of the amount of time that one is going to try to achieve each week in pursuit of that spicifc priority goal i realize that that process itself takes a bit of time but when you look back on the hundred year plus scientific literature of what leads to successful goal setting in pursuit you find over and over again that those two components we have been talking about specificity and measurability are paramount you just simply cannot discard those from the process if you expect yourself to achieve your goals whether not it is the a b c method or it is the smart method or the smarter method again all acronyms coin not by me but by others previous to this conversation you are going to find elements of specificity and measurability showing up again and again these are key features of any protocal that you are going to use in order to try and set and achieve your goals and i should mention that setting specific goals and clearly defining that verbs that you are going to engage in to pursue those goals and defining how long you are going to try an engage in those verbs each week to achieve those goals has significant impact on the probability of success we are not talking about a minor effect in fact in the original episode i did about goal setting in pursuit i talked about the called recycling study i'm not going to describing a lot of detail right now but essentially the study looked at motivating people to recycle more recycleable products in the work place and what they found was that when people were told what the specific goal was and what specific actions they need to engage in were and how much of a given batch of refuse say you kno after lunch tor some boxes or some forks et cetera some napkins how much of that refuse they were going to try to put into the recycle verses the trash it led to a greater than doubling of successful achievement of that goal now that is a perhaps trivial goal to some of you although let us facs it recycling is important but that result has been shown again and again and again for different domains of goal setting in pursuit this thing of setting specificity really spending time with it on paper stting specificity of actions of which specific actions and then setting specificity of how long you are going to gage in each of those actions each week greatly increases the probability that you will achieve that what previously seem to be a all too lofty goal earlier i mention that during the course of to day's episode we were going to dispel some common myths about goal setting in pursuit now i'd to mention two popular myths about goal setting in pursuit the first one is that if we set up post it in a little postet sticky where you write down what you are trying to achieve and you put that on the refrigerator you put that on your mirror that it increases the probability that you are going to stick to your goal turns out that is not the case and the reason for that is that your visual system adapts to whatever is regular in your environment does not matter whether not that environment is sparst it only has a few things in it or whether not it is dense a forest anything that shows up regularly in our visual environment gets cancelled out this is actually a basic feature of the way your visual system is wired for those of you that are taking a sticky note or a magnet or a sign and putting it on your mirror and leaving it there from day to day maybe that says run sixty minutes to day or study french twenty minutes whatever the goal happens to be if you leave it there day to day to day it actually diminishes the likelihood of progress i know that seems hard to believe but it is true instead a better approach is to continually write that thing out each day and put up a new sticky put it in a new place perhaps on the refrigerator sometimes in the kitchen may be on the when shield of your car athough of course remove that while you are driving et cetera if you are going to incorporate visual reminders in your goal setting and goald pursuit process you want to change those each and every day this is actually something that o perhaps apt developers will start to incorporate because i think the notifications that come through on various aps design to remind us to do certain things can be helpful but there too we tend to attenuate to them and we simply either do not notice them or we start to swipe them away over time visual reminders can be very effective if you want to use them great you certainly do not have to but if you 're going to use them you want to update them every single day otherwise your visual system and certainly the airs of your brain that are associate with assessing novelty in emotionality we will simply start to cancel those away the first common myth tht we are dispelling is what i call the post it fallacy the idea that if you write something down on a post it you post it in an area that you frequent every morning or every day or every night that you stand a higher probability of adhering to what is on that posted that is simply not true you would want to replace it every day and you would also be wise to move that posted to different locations the second myth is that if you want to increase youre motivation toward pursuing a goal and you want to increase the probability that youill achieve that goal that you should engage in called accountability meaning that you should tell people you are going to achieve that goal now i realize that there are some prominent examples in pop culture of people posting something on social media and saying in three years i'm going to be no playing in wembly stadium or in two years watch i'm going to be at the top level of my game whatever that game happens to be sure there are examples of that and those are beautiful and inspiring examples however the scientific data tell us that if we inform people around us that for instance we are going to write a book or that we are going to start a pot cast or that we are going to run a marthon it whatever it happens to be more often than not we get feed back that is generally positive inform i think that is good and to be expected frankly youn friend tells us hay imen to write a book or i'm going to pursue a new fitness sgoal or om to learn a language woe say great go for it you can totally do it you very likely to succeed go for it how do you want me to support you as there anything i can do to support you those all are frankly healthy exchanges and yet the data tell us that the positive feed back that we get from others when we announce that we are going after a goal activate certain reward systems and motivation systems within our brain that then quickly dissipate and then diminish the probability that we will engage in the type of behaviors that actually lead us to achieve that goal we have the posted fallacy and we have the myth of accountability fallacy within the contect of goal pursuit i of course am not saying that accountability is bad to the contrary accountability is a great thing both to ourselves and to others at something tha we should all cultivate throughout life i merely talking about the myth of accountability in the contect of goal pursuit and i'm actually being more specific than that i'm saying do not tell people that you are going to go out and achieve something prior to initiating action toward that goal because in fact the positive fe back that we get wi'll diminish the probability that we will continually pursue that goal in a way that allows us to achieve it you could interpret the information i just gave you as meaning that perhaps it is better to tell some one who doubts us that we are going to achieve a goal and then of course they are not going to give us the posii he back whene i can get all that reward circuitry activated rather we are going to get the a friction circuitry activated of us wanting to prove ourselves and overcome the let us just say the lack of faith in our ability to achieve a goal and indeed that can work there is evidence that can work but then of course you hve to find some one who does not believe in you you have to get them to tell you they do not belie in you and that could have all sorts of diliterious psychological effects that might undermine the goal pursuit process in other things as well if you are lucky enough to know somebody who doubts you gohead tell them that you want to pursue your specific priority goal but more likely than not the best thing to do is to simply keep that goal to yourself you mayny to inform a family member or others of iu know where you will be bet ween the hours of za at m and in a m if you are going to be exercising your learning language or meditating whatever it is during that period of time but what i'm referring to here is what i will call the do not tell the world rule do not tell the world that you are going to achieve ex uires e just simply tell yourself in fact i would suggest that the more time you can spend with that one or two or three cheets of paper where you defind the goal the specific actions that youre going to take how you are going to measure progress which will talk about bit more later the more time that you can spend with that goal in your mind and on that paper the higher the probability that you will achieve that goal that stands in start contrast to telling every one around you that you are going to achieve a certain goal the calld accountability myth or the myth of a countability within the context of goal pursuit would be the more specific way ogt to describe that myth now it turns out there is some utility to having one person that is a called accountability budy if that person is really just strictly addressing accountability they are reminding you to do what you need to do or they are asking you did you do what you said you were going to do but that is a bit more of a tough love accountability model what the do not tell the world rule is really about is not getting the kind of dopamine and other forms of nurochemical reward that come from just simply saying that youre going to pursue a goal because as you will soon learn that dopamine and other molecules too of course are going to be critically important not just for initiating the sorts of actions required to achieve your goals but for re engaging and constantly updating your straegy to insure that you reach your goals it is worth mentioning that the friction model of achieving your goals does work amidi for incance some somebody that if i were to say to a family member of friend a ma achieve a particular goal and they sai there is no way you can do it that would recruit a certain set of nurrl circuits and a hormones and nauro chemicals in me that would make me much more likely to lean into the required set of efforts to achieve that goal but there' ha danger in approaching a givin goal that way specially if the goal is something the already wont to pursue which is that then a lot of your effort becomes framed in the context of making some one else wrong as opposed to achieving the goal and of course you can do two things in parallel you can achieve your goal and prove somebody else wrong but as we have talked about in various episodes on motivation and pursuit and the dopeming system and is will talk about a bit more in a few minutes there is something tremendously powerful about learning how to derive pleasure from the effort process itself that is learning to enjoy the process of pursuing a goal for sake of that goal for yourself rather then trying to pursue a goal simply to prove somebody else wrong i'll just tell you right now that intrinsic motivation motivation that is directly attached to the thing that you are doing and route to a goal is the most powerful and sustainable source of motivation as many of i've been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one i'm sure to get enough vitemens and minerals and the probiotics that i need and it also contains adaptedins to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste gright for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a g one if you would to try a g one hey'l to drink a g one dot cam slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitemin d three k to again that is drink a g one dot cam slash hubermen the final protocal related to goal setting because really up until now we have been talking only about goals etting we have not yet talked about goal pursuit is that you want your goal to be measurable and whend we say measurable you really have to define two things first of all you are going to have to define how long you are going to pursue this goal over all in other words how long you think it will take before you achieve your goal and in addition to that you are going to have to define how much time you are going to spend pursuing that goal each week or each day now there are an infinite number of time blocks that one could use to answer these questions for instance you could set and over all yearly goal and you could break it down into monthly goals where you spend ex amount of time on that goal each week and ex amount of time on that goal each day and essentially latter up from the shortest time frame to the longest time frame required to achieve that goal and certainly all of that is duable but that i believe is going to be an overwhelming amount of work and indeed is going to be counter productive toward achieving your goal what i recommend which of course is glean from the scientific literature at least the consistencies or the centere of mass that is the major findings that show up again and again in the scientific literature on goal setting a pursuit is that you establish a roughly twelve week period of time to focus on your specific goal now of course achieving the entire goal might take longer than twelve weeks but chances are it is not going to take shorter than twelve weeks although if it does you could simply closes out that goal pursuit and then pursue another goal there is no reason you could not do that but there is nothing magical about this twelve week period but it seems to adhere to a number of things in society in culture in work schedules in seasonality meaning the holidays an the shifts in the over all seasons that works for most goals and most people a twelve week cycl or roughly a three month cycle sometimes calle the quarterly cycle of goal pursuit toward your particular goal i think is a good mackero time to focus on and then within that twelve week cycle to define very clearly how many hours each week end each day end on which days you will pursue that goal ocas it is twelve week cycle to pursue your goal that goal might be achieved by the end of that twelve weeks or even prior it might not be but you set a twelve week cycle or quarterly cycle or if you prefer to think about it a three month cycle and then you define how many hours per week you are going to spend pursuing that goal and then you define how many hours per day you are going to spend pursuing that goal and then you define which days of the week you are going to pursue that particular goal i think those three numbers the twelve week cordialy c a three month cycle the number of hours per week and the number of hours per day and particular days that you are going to spend working on a goal is going to be effective for ninety per cent if not more of different types of goal's out there and as with defining the specific goal itself i highly recommend that you write this down with a pen or pencil was just owe much data to support the fact that writing things down ideally in complete sentences on a piece of paper with a benner pencil serves to reenforce the goal setting and pursuit process greatly increasing the probability that you will achieve those goals what youre really defining in that process are the specific verb actions that you are going to take end the specific quantifiable amount of time that you are engaging in those verb actions in order to achieve your goal what we have not discussed yet however is how to define or quantify the goal itself noof course in different endeavors you are going to have the opportunity to quantify and define goal achievement in different way for instance if you want to be able to run a sub six minute mile or a sub five minute mile or if you really impressive a sub four minute mile well that is a highly quantifiable goal that you can break down into a series of training steps or milestones meaning that you could quantify at the beginning of your goal pursuit how long it takes you to run a mile you could then set out to achieve a faster time within two weeks or three weeks and then do the appropriate training to achieve those numbers and simply keep updating that in order to eventually reach your quantifiable goal at twelve weeks an you might not complete your goal of running a subfive minute mile or subsix minute mile at the end of twelve weeks but perhaps if your goal is to be able to run a sub five minute mile by the end of the calender year in your initiating this whole goal pursuit thing on the first of the year will hen you have twelve months broken into for three month cycles and you would essentially set the quatifiable goal at the end of the year december thirty first perhaps as when you actually do that run a where you hopefully would achieve that subsix menor or five minute mile or may be i four minute mile and then you back track from that date and you set milestones of goals at your tring to achieve that is a highly quantifiable set of goals because it is literally distance over time however in a lot of pursuits in fact i would argue in most pursuits you do not have that very clear quantifiable result you might have for instance the achievement of a doctoral degree or a bachelor's degree or in a a degree or a professional degree of some sort which represents a finish line a you could perhaps even attach a great quoint average or a a publication goal to that but in most endeavors that are not athletic or are not within the realm of finance it becomes much harder to very clearly define your goal in purely quantitative terms that is the reason why we spend much time talking about the measureability of the specific amount of time that youare going to engage in the verb actions that each day which days each week over the course of these twelve week cycles because ultimately what is going to allow you to arrive at successful achievement of your goal regardless of weather or not that goal is highly quantifiable ext number of dollars ex number of minutes to complete a mile run or swim et cetera or it is something that is a bit more nebulous in terms of quantifiability conversational french rit there is conversational french that you can learn is also conversational french that incorporates humor or that incorporates good humor or a perhaps you want to get better at writing poetrieor simply spend time writing poetry and can you quantify the quality of that poetry while perhaps i if you could win a particular prize for poetry but i think for most endeavors they are more loosely defined in terms of their quantifiability now we can always attach quantifiability to the ultimate engoal if we choose for instance i could decide that i 'm going to learn conversational french and i could decide that the ultimate goal at the end of this twelve week period is to be able to have a ten minute conversation with somebody who is fluent in french their native born in france and that i'm going to make zero mistakes that is pretty lofty goal but the point being that if you are picking a goal that is not easily quantifiable wou want to be exceptionally precise about the amount of time that you are going to spend engaging in the specific verb actions that are going to allow you to make progress toward your goal because ultimately whether not's a highly quantifiable goal or it is a more loosely quantifiable goal in terms of the en goal the process of achieving goals is always going to be in the form of actions and actions themselves are always quantifiable it is number of hours of dedicated work toward that particular goal a common example of an engoal that is very hard to quantify in terms of the engoal itself is the writing of a book for instance now you could set out to write an eight hundred page book but most people agree that the length of the books should have something more or less to do with the content and not the other way around in other words that you do not just want to add words in order to achieve a certain number of pages that said most all experienced writers well tell you at least two things they will tell you first do not wait for ince piration simply set a period of time each day that you are going to write and writ ex number of words or for ex amount of time each day or perhaps even just three days a week but most of the experienced writers that i've spoken to write every single day and they write eight hundred words per day or two thousand words per day or five hundred words per day whatever they can do consistently they may do it for time they may do it for words but they are writing during that time they are not waiting for inspiration to land on them they are not trying to get optimaly cafinated and perhaps they did not even sleep that well the night before in otherword they are dedicated to engaging in a particular number of hours of word generating action rather than trying to focus on getting the number one best sellar at the end after the book is published of course they can wish for that number one position on the best seller chart but ultimately the greatest probability of achieving that goal is going to come from engaging in a particular number of hours generating a particular number of words each day again the highest probability of achieving our goals of achieving any kind of goal is going to be by understanding the specific verb actions that we need to engage in and then quantifing the amount of time that we engage in those specific word actions and then simply doing those ferbs up until now we have been talking about goal setting and we really have not talked about goal pursuit itself now i'd to talk about what the scientific literature says is the best protocal for initiating our goal pursuit for starting toward our goal and to do we have to address a set of key questions the questions you have to ask yourself are do i want to pursue the skoal meaning in my highly mod invated to pursue the skoalery even mildly motivate to pursue the skoal do i want to do the things involve to get this thing to accomplish this thing or in my feeling resistance do i not want to pursue the goal or perhaps this is a day to day shift that occurs wear some days you are really motivated and other days you are not now the reason to ask yourself the set of questions is that the day to say that there are too different strategies in fact too markedly different strategies that you will want to incorporate depending on whether not youremotivated or you are unmotivated to pursue that particular goal for whatever reason and of course it is an entire psychology to motivation and you could get a therapist or a coach to work with in order to address that underlying psychology yes it might ladder back to childhood issues it might latder back to esteem things none of that can be covered here in any sort of meaning ful depth because frankly we each have different circumstances different pass different psychologies there are however some universals that we can all apply in order to help us get started toward our goal and this is nested in this whole concept of whether not we should visualize the end and successful completion of our gol keep the end in mine as we start off toward a goal or whether not we should incorporate a different strategy here is how it goes if you ask yourself do i want to achieve this goal and i would hope the answer is yes because the over all goal should be something that you want to pursue it should be something you are deeply desiring to accomplish then you have to ask yourself next do i want to do the things required to achieve that goal now maybyeou do not want to do all of them you only want to do some of them but given that you have now carefully quantified which specific actions you are going to be doing on which days and for how many hours and how many weeks for these twelve weak blocks you could simply ask yourself do i want to do this thing to day and if the answer is yes well then it turns out that spending just one to th ee may be five minutes but even just one minute visualizing the outcome the positive outcome of course and the feeling state that you may have becaue of course you do not know you do not have a a time machine you cannot feel yourself into the future but you can make a good guess as to how you might feel in the future if you accomplish that goal spending one to three may be five minutes in a sort of meditation althe sort of a visualization is perhaps the better way to describe it thinking about that feeling state and the outcome and some of the things that are going to be associate with that outcome turns out to be a great practice to engage in just prior to initiating that day's work toward that goal however if you arrive to your practice meaning you show up to the piano to learn piano or you are sitting down to the table or maybe you have not even gotten enough motivation to go toward the piano or toward your notebook or computer or whatever landscape it is that you are going to be a pursuing your goal within and you are having quotenkote a hard time getting motivated toward that goal well then it turns out what the scientific literature tells us is that visualizing the end keeping the end in mind positive visualization of all the good things that you will experience when you achieve that goal is not going to be an effective strategy to motivate you rather if you are not feeling motivated then what the scientific literature tells us is that you actually want to spend one to three may be five minutes visualizing failure visualiing how terrible you will feel if you do not achieve your goal visualizing severe consequences perhaps mostly of the sort telling yourself gosh i set a goal i set a twelve we block i quantify it i know i want to do this here i have the time to do it and i'm simply just not doing it and in that case you would think o k whi you should cano build yourself up may be call a friend text a friend get some encouragement no the scientific literature tells us that when we are not motivated and it is a goal that we actually want to pursue in of course here i'm talking about adaptive goal pursuit meaning things that are going to enricher mental health physical health et cetera not things that are going to be detrimental to us well then if you are not feeling motivated you want to spend one to three perhaps five minutes meditating concentrating on what it is going to feel to fail and the fact that you are not succeeding but indeed that you are failing and i know the sounds rather harsh advice that this protocal a sounds ond of a self flagulating protocol it is not intended to be self flagulation in fact it should not be self lagulation but rather what you want to do when you are not motivated is to think about failure and what that failure at the end of twelve weeks will feel and the reason for that is that the data tell us that when we visualize positive outcomes yes it deploys certain narro chemicals in our brain and body that make us feel good although frankly if you have heard that imagining something creates the same narro chemical and nrrow circuit states in the brain as actually experiencing that thing that is simply not true that is a myth we have talkd about this some previous episiis simply not true but if you are having a hard time getting motivated toward a goal that you actually want to achieve then spending that short amount of time thinking about how lousy you will feel when you do not achieve it recruits certain elements of your called autonomic nervous system it creates shifts in the release of things epinephran nor epineperan even release of the called reward molecule dopomin which in fact is not the molecule of rewarded is the molecule of motivation and its associated with pain it is associated with negative thoughts end of course its associated with posive thoughts and outcomes but basily what i'm saying is if you are highly motivated to do something you are ready to go spend one to three minutes may be five visualizing the posive outcomes that you are going to experience when you ultimately finish out that twelve week cycle as a con sequence of all the great work that you have done if however you are not motivated if you'r i want to do this thing on procrastinating i'm just not feeling doing it yes i want achieve the goal but i just do not feel doing it well then your task is to take one to three may be five minutes and think about how much more lowsy you will feel when you do not achieve that goal at the end of twelve weeks and that the data tell us recruit certain elements of your nervous system your harmonal system that are more successful in getting you into action into starting toward your goal than worry you to try and build yourself up towards all that positivity yes indeed there is a place fowr negative thinking i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endi an e to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals i'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your mediate and long term

that information with inside trackr they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids whit those hormone levels et cetera mean

hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off now in terms of tools or protocals to both initiate and to sustain effort during your goal pursuit process we need to think about the specific time domain or the amount of time that were trying to do that within for instance there are tools that you can used to stay motivated within the one hour learning block that you happen to be doing on monday morning for instance and there are other tools and protocols that you can incorporate towards staying motiv ated from one day to the next or from one weak to the next but i think the most useful of those tools are going to be the tools that you incorporate to stay motivated with in a given training block or practice block toward your goal because what i just described a few minutes ago was the process of how to initiate your daily work right you ask yourself that question in mi motivated the answer cund be yes could be know if you really want to get i quantitative about it you can give yourself one to ten score or ten being the most motivaded frankly i'm not that quantitative about that sort of thing i'm wore subjective about it but i know some of you are real a number junkeys and you really to quantify everything keep a journal and look back sey how that relates your sleep in o some people are of that oriantation other people myself are simply going to sit down as they okat it is time s time to train or it is time to practice whatever the thing may be how motivated am i m i ion't on't a six out of ten or seven ut o ten ok i'm ready to go om an avisualize the end in mind in a positive way or if i'm a too out of ten or anything less than a four out of ten i thngyou ii'm not that motivated that i'm going to basely scare myself into doing the work that day that is how you initiate the work each day and i just gave you a couple of quick examples of how you could quantify that took me about thirty seconds to do that example out loud take you about thirty seconds to do but again if you want ta quantified and more detailn write it down and relate its other things be my guest now you already have a science spaced protocol for how to get started each day toward your goal now what about within the one or two hour block or perhaps ninety minute block that you are going to use to pursue your goal and here it is very important that you have a number of tools that will allow you to both set the optimal amount of focus that you are really concentrating on pursuing that goal youre concentrated on the verb actions that will deliver you to that gullis perhaps the best way to state that and that you can constantly up date or renew your level of focus should it start to dissipate now i want to be clare have done entire episodes about focus and how to increase focus with behavioral tools everything related to meditation which indeed cannot increase your ability to focus i've talked by nutritional tool supplementation tools prescription drug related tools there is a lot of information on that you can simply go to huberman lab dot cam put focus into the search function and it will take you to not only those episodes and the tool kit for that but the specific time stamps for that but what we are going to talk about now is not about how to increase focus per sa rather it is about how to use focus in particular visual focus in order to increase your or maintain your level of motivation within a given learning block within a given batch of time on a given day where you are pursuing your go your engaging in that practice which of course will include frustration anxiety it has to if you are going to get any better and how to set that motivation and keep that motivation throughout that hour or ninety minutes or two hours is critical how do you do that well turns out it is fairly straight forward it is anchored in the fact that your cognitive focus your ability to maintain a narrow cone of attention as well as your bodily state of readiness and your mental state of readiness to perform work is powerfully anchored to your visual system as many of you have heard me say before your eyes are actually two pieces of brain i be more specific than neall retinas that line the back of your eyes picrus are literally two pieces of your central nervous system of your brain that were extruded from the cranial vaulturing development yes these two bits and for those listening i'm just pointing to my eyes your eyes are two pieces of brain outside of your skull and your eyes can view things broadlias you can i called soften your gaze and view the entire horizon you can see the perifery of the room by rel axing your eyes you can actualy do this now in fact when you drive most of the timeyou are doing this you are not looking in a particular focal point viewing things in called panoramic vision and of course you can draw your visual focus to a particular ocation what we call a virgence i movement that is your bringing your eyes in toward the centre toward your nose a little bit ind your focusing them in a more narrow cone of visual attention this is something you can do almost imperceptibly to others although if we were to measu your eye movements what we would see is that your eyes are actually moving inward a little bit toward your nose when you do this virgence iy movement and narrowing that cone of visual attention and then theire you relaxing into a state of om being slightly further out from your nose not the eyes themselves of course they cannot move within the sockets but you are the pupils of your eyes are moving out a bit from your nose and your in called panoramic vision essentially what i am saying is that you can narrow or broaden your visual attention and that something that can take a low bit of practise i highly recommend that you try this in th you practice ilitl bit but indeed everyone has the nurl machinery to do this from birth this is not something that requires nerrl plasticity to be able to do you can do this right now you can narrow your visual attention you can expand or relax your visual attention and thereby narrow or relax your visual field from being smaller or larger theiare data that show that when we narrow our visual attention and we hold that narrow visual attention on a spot several things happen first of all there is recruitment of circuitry within the called brainstem that then deploys nor chemicals that increase are level of alertness an orousal that is right when you focus your visual attention on a more narrow location or one location in front of you and you hold that focus you are causing the release of narro chemicals that increase your overall level of alertness in the brain and body conversely when you relax your visual focus called panor emic fision you are turning off that recruitment youre not actively recruiting molecules for relaxation within the brain but you are turning off this release of the nerochemicals associate with increasing focus and arousal why am i talking about this in the context of goal pursuit well if you are feeling lack of motivation at any point within a given training block or bauitism calling it this could be the beginning this could be five minutes in this could be half an hour in you would be wise to picka visual target ideally a visual target that is within the general range of the work that you are trying to perform another words if youre doing desk work or the piece of paper you would draw that visual target on a piece of paper approximately the same distans that you were reading or that you were looking at music on you can tell how little a playing af piano i've done in my life but the point being that you set the visual target at approximately the same distance that you would be performing your particular work f youare doing a sport the distance might be some many meters off in the distance whereas if you are doing desk work of some kind that it might be much closer and then you focus your eyes on that location and you actively work to maintain that focus just i'm doing now into the camera for a given period of time and i recommend that you set a timer and that you of course allow yourself to blink i just did there and that you try and achieve at least thirty seconds but even better would be sixty seconds even better would be ninety seconds of that focus divergens i movement during which several things happen including the deployment of those narrow chemicals from the brainstem that i talked about before which ire going to increase your level of autonomic arousal and also increase your level of focus further and there i'm not just hoing about visual focus i'm talking about cognive focus it is also been shown that when we focus on a particular point in the way that i'm describing here that it increases are called systolic blood pressure a s many of blood pressure is always described to us as a giv in number over another number and the first number is the called systol or systolic pressure which is the amount of pressure your vascular system when the heart beats as the fluid of your blood is pomping through the arteries veins and caplaries of your system and then the bottom number is the amount of pressure within those arteries veins an capalaries inbetween heart beat it is the systolic over the diostolic and what we know is that visal focus and here i'm still holding mine now on the cameras over thevou listening i probably blinkd once or twice but i'm really trying hard to maintain my focus directly within the camera this visual focus increases the systolic blood pressure it increases the deployment of those narrochemicals from the brainstem and we know it also can recruit the liberation of molecules such as dopomine and some associated molecules elsewhere in the brain that together act in a synergistic way to increase our level of focus and motivation this is based again on work describing the naral circuitry what i'm describing here and work from emily balchetus's lab which has shown that if people focus on a target on a gold line literally a physical location within their environment and then they initiate some work it could be physical work or cognitive work not only do they experience significantly decreased levels of perceived effort while engaging in that work but they also complete that work in a significantly reduced amount of time meaning that within a given training balt or training block you are able to get significantly more work done and you perceive that as less effortful or requiring less effort than had you not done this visual focus now i've een doing this for quite some time now into the camera this is actully practice that i've ben doing for well over a decade and it is actualy a practice that i use when i podcast or whn i post on social mediotes part of the reason why i'm accused of being a non blinker quite often but i want to remind people that you are ala wed to blink do not let your eyes dry out it is perfectly fine to blink it is not going to inhibit the effectiveness of this protocal but i do not thing i can really over state how valuable this sort of protocol is first of all it is completely behavior ll it costs nothing it is completely safe longs you remember to blink and it allows you to increase your level of focus your level of motivation and the sustainability of your focus in motivation while in goal pursuit it is a quite valuable protocol to incorporate and it is something that you can do once for thirty seconds and then lean into whatever it is your writing process your running process it is something that you could do repeatedly throughout that learning bout and it' somethng you can practice olf line a little bit away from that training bout as a means to sort of learn and get familiar with that than you can incorporate it very quickly and repeatedly and with much more effectiveness during these different learning bouts again it is a highly valuable tool that is grounded in nerl circuitry grounded in neurow chemistry and that emily balchettus's lap has shown in numerous domains physical pursuits cognive pursuits can really help people achieve their goals and to achieve them more easily or least with less purceived effort and more quickly now we can get a bit more granuler about the incorporation of this tool this protocol but wefore we do we should acknowledge that all of the things that lend themselves to improved cognive focus and physical ability still hold true igt you still need t get good sleep as many nights of your life as you possibly can you still need to eat properly you still need to try and limit your stress we have podcass episodes relate to all of those topics we have tool kits afailble t zerocost rely to all f those topics i'm not saying that this visual focus or visual target training is the only tool that you should incorporate it is a tool that you want to superimpose on the foundation of all the things that bring you to your practice with the best possible cognition the best possible physical readiness and that when added to that foundation of excellent sleep excel lent nutrition social connection sunlight in the morning et cetera is going to increase the probability that you are going to make those learning bouts as effective as possible now some of you may be thinking elevating your blood pressure is bad why would i want to elevate my blood pressure ah wel turns out the increases in sostolic blood pressure achieved with this visual target training or focussing on a finished line for some period of time are transient and they are perfectly safe essentially what it does is it boose or bolsters the activity of the autonomic nervous system it kick starts the deployment of those chemicals in those narral circuits that then allow you to be mode if ated for some period of time but then that is a transient increase onautonomic ralsal which is why perhaps every twenty minutes ir perhaps on the hour you might stop do a thirty second or sixty second visual target training then lean back in to your process of however you it is at you are pursuing your goal i should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in it is also a good idea to gointo that panoramic vision mode the easiest way to do that is to go outside or to be outside and to view a horizon and not look at any one particular points on the horizon but if you are indoors as i am now you can also just relax your eyes you yo blinking a few times and getting rid of that vergenci movement and trying visualize the corners of the room where the sides of the room rather the floor and the ceiling all at once that is a good way to explain how to caled relax your eyes and take you out of that virgencide movement i say this because a lot of people will feel when there pursuing their goal thas a fatiguing yeft remember to breathe rin you still hunt breathe as you are pursuing your goal and you certainly want to be visually focused on your guls your cognively focussed on your goal in your mode iv ated but that from time to time you also relax take a moment shake things off look into your panoramic vision mode and then go back to your mode of goal pursuit now there are few other protocals that might seem oh simple but frankly are o effective that i'd be remiss if i did not mention them the f irst of those is actually something that i'm borrowing from tim pharris who did a post on instrgram which we will link to which i think it' just spectacular which is thirty things that he wished he had known when he was twenty and while the internet is chalka block full of such lists that particular list is truly impressive those are things that i too whish i had known when i was twenty but also when i was thirty and forty and on but one particular thing on that list of thirty is particularly relevant now which is that the best productivity ap is already on your phone which is to put your phone into airplane mode or more ideally and this is the one that i try my best to imcorporate to simply turn the phone off and remove it from my work outs or my attempts to learn language for my attempts to learn anything i realize that some people need to keep ther phone with them for reasons relate to communicate with family or a co workers et cetera that is fine if you need your phone but to the extent that you can remove yourself from distractions that is certainly going to hence your ability to focus on what you need to focus on in pursuing your goals that is or stands without saying it is kind of a daw and yet i think a lot of people are searching far and wide for the productivity ap for the secret hack for the thing that sconiallow them to be proproductive and oftentimes there are dus actions that we can take in order to become more productive ore talking about some of those to day we talked aby those another episodes but there are of course important do nots do not have your phone facing up with why fy and seller service on if you want to be productive at something that does not involve your phone ideally you will turn it over you will turn it off you will get rid of it you' put in the next room if you are me you will sometimes lock it in the car i think the most extreme that i've ever gone to insure that i did not o engage with my phone during gold pursuit was during the early days of having my laboratory and i was writing multiple grants in parallel which is an immense amount of work i would walk into the laboratory in the morning and i would hand a studenor postock my phone and i'd say do not give this back to me until five p m and if i ask for it back if i even ask for it once every one in the lab gets five hundred dollars there wre quite a few people my lab and it is a significant cost to that and i must tell you the were numerous times throughout the day when i impulsively just let ocammo need my phona t on it i don'n't have to do it and i also wanted to demonstrate to them that i could creatan incentive system whereby i could fasily scruff myself into getting the work done and indeed i much to their dismay i never once had to pay them out although when we got the grants and indeed even when we did not get the grants i did take them all to dinner now another kee protocal for maintaining motivation while pursuing your goals stems from our understanding of the dopamine reward and motivation pathways topics for which i have done multiple indeed three podcast episodes previously and we confide a link to all three of those as well as the tool kit that we have published and that is available to you at zero cost on our website about how to regulate dopamin both base line dopaming stores and peaks an dopamine there is a lot there to be understood and incorporated cause as to do with various things not just in the realm of goal pursuit but also feelings of well being i'm staving off depression things of that sort the dopamine system is linkg to owe many important aspects of life far too many then we could discuss right now and we have those previous episodes in which we do discuss all that material none the less it is important to understand that dopamine is the molecule motivation and to some extent reward but really motivation and that if you want to maintain consistent motivation during say your individual bouts of work toward your goals and from one bout to the next to not just within a session but from day to day across sessions and from week to week and indeed from twelve week cycle to twelve week cycle if that is required and from one goal that you set to the next goal that you define and decide to pursue you want to understand this particular feature of dopaming which is that yes dopamine and its release is highly valuable toward getting more motivated and feeling more motivated but that it has certain properties related to things dopaming reward predictionare base lines of dopeing et cetera that make it the case that if you reward yourself every time you reach a milestone you finish out an hour or two hours of work you treat yourself to something you reward yourself that you are going to diminish both the potency of that reward and you are going to reduce your motivation over time that might be surprising to you but if you were to watch those episodes it would all become clear as to why that is the case it is also true that if you were to only reward yourself when you accomplish your goal or perhaps more commonly if you look at the accomplishment of your goal as the only reward in the whole process of goal pursuit an achievement that is going to undermine your probability of success as well rather the best way to incorporate the mechanics of the dopaming system such that you can achieve not just immediate motiation but on going motivation is to incorporate what is referred to as random intermittent reinforcement which is what the casinos use to keep people playng and it simply means randomly reward yourself and randomly do not reward yourself for successful completion of milestones those milestones could be within the bout of effort or it could be a cross bouts of effort tit say you set out at the beginning on your piece of paper to basically ut's a run or practise at some cognive endeavor four hours total per week in you are going to do that monday wednesday friday and saturday should you reward yourself at the end of each session should you reward yourself at the end of each week the answer is it depends and it should depend in a random intermittent way the simplest way to do this is whenever you complete a milestone could be at the end of a day you did your one hour whatever it was tha you designate you ware going to do on that particular day should you reward yourself cognively or with some physical thing i what that physical thing might be but in could be a meal could be a movi could be something that you enjoy well the answer is you should flip a coin and if it is heads yes reward yourself and of its tals do not it is that simple it is that simple it should be fifty fifty probability and it is random as to whether not you reward yourself now with physical rewards monitory rewards or food rewards or a movy or participating in something else that you enjoy it is a bit easier to define the cognitive rewarding of one's own efforts is something that people really struggle to comprehend but what i'm not referring to when i say cognitive rewards is i'm not referring to saying yes i'm the best and really trying to shower yourself with internal praise and tell yourself that you are the greatest thing that ever happen simply because you perform this learning bout what i'm simply referring to is the kind of internal do not amean a reward that comes from telling yourself yes i'm making progress i'm making progress i'm on the path i'm able to setagol an achieveagal which might seem a healthy thing to do psychologically in fact it is it is great d i think it is really important that people be able to self reward themselves especially self reward for verbs that put them in a more adaptive stands in life that enhance their mental health physical healh an performance and that of course also includes relationships were not just talking about solitary pursuits here were tongu about pursuits that bring us into the world that allow us to lean into life with more vigor and with more effectiveness not just to help ourselves but to help others what i'm referring to is completing something and internally patting yourself on the back for having completed that thing that is a good thing to do but if you want to maintain on going motivation you are not going to do that every time you are no t going to punish yourself but rather you finish out about of learning you flip the coin let say it lands tails on that day you simply shift into the next thing you need tou do that day now it is not easy to suppress thoughts we know this it is very hard to suppress negative thoughts but it is still hard to suppress posive thought internally if you are glowing from the fact you per formed well do not try and suppress that that is o k but if you flip a tails then you do not want to actively engage in a self reward process however if you flip the coin and it is heads well then you should absolutely engage in a self reward process and that process should consist of thirty to sixty seconds of closing your eyes you do not have to works better if you close your eyes and simply thinking about the fact that yes you can set a goal you can engage in the specific set of questions do i want to do this practice to day do i not want to do this practice say and then the spec set of actions maybe they involveisuall focus in the other tools we talked about turning off of your phone et cetera you are somebody who can get things dant you are somebody that is moving forward toward your paticular goal and s you just sort of create a little bit of a positive cognive loop around that ability that you are in fact building up and that something that people often overlook which is that not only is moving toward a goal great because it establishes more robustness in the nurl circuits that allow us to perform that thing ritem an afterall that is what learning is eventually you do not achieve the same frustration and errors that you do when trying to perform that thing eventually you learn how to play the piano you learn how to speak conversational french you run that subsix menute mile but also the nurl circuits associated with self generated motivation and with the tools that were talking about themselves are subject to nerl plasticity those become more robust and that is fantastic because when you eventually reach one goal i would hope that you would then update and set out to achieve another goal and you will find that over time you will be more effective in achieving other goal s by virtue of the work that you did in pursuing a previous goal because ultimately it is really about defining goals and then learning how to quantify the actions required and then engaging in those actions there is the specific circuits involved in generating those actions which are very goal specific and then there are the circuits which circuits are we talkung about or time but that a migdala the latteral profontal quartex the orbital frontal quartek and the basal ganglia we talk about earlier that have been built up that have been reinforce because as i mention there is one universal circuit for goal pursuit and achievement random intermittan reinforcement is the key and while i spent a good amount of time talking about self generated cognive reinforcement this also applies to any kind of physical rewards the movy that you are going toe reward yourself with the ice cream cone the whatever that you are going to reward yourself with perhaps its monitary perhaps its food perhaps its social random intermittent rewards of the ones that are going to keep you motivated and are going to best increase the probability of success not just within a given boubt of learning not just day today not just week to week not just quarter to quarter but across the lifetime in important protocal to incorporate in your goal pursuits is one that i learnd from doctor maya schancar when she was guest on the hubran labpodcast and she talked about the called middl problem the middle problem is the fact that people tend to have a lot of motivation at the outset of pursuing a goal although you now know that sometimes or some people do not have a lot of motivation when pursuing their goal at the start they need to think about failures and how terrible everything will be and then they will certainly have monetovation its going to be a furbase mone ovation but in general people tend ot more motivation at the start of pursuing a goal and at the end when they get close to or they start to purceive the finished line but that most people experienced the called middle problem where in the middle of a learning bout or in the middle of the week or in the middle of a twelve week cycle they are less motivated and this has actually been quantified in numerous studies and there several ways to overcome the middle problem the simplest one is to acknowledge it to recognize that it is coming and when it does come and you'r experiencing lower levels of motivation perhaps even increased failure rates and you are not performing as well you are etting frustrate to know that that is a natural process that everybody experiences and just knowing that can sometimes allow people to move through that to the place where then they con sense the end of the learning bout or they con sense that they are making some progress the finish line is there and than they get that increase in motivation again however sometimes the middle problem is such a problem that people need some tools to move through it and the best way to move through the middle problem or in fact to eliminate it is actually to make the middle of a learning bout it is own separate thing that you acknowledge the presence of and that you break up into three separate bouts or here were talking about carving up the one hour learning bout or the two hour learning bout in to an initial phase where you either have naturally occurring motivation or you use feur based visualization to increase your motivation you lean into that and then let us assume it is a one hour learning bout and then at about the twenty five minute mark you start to experience lower levels of focus perhaps than you use the visual target protocall but then you go back into your bout of learning and you are not feeling very motivated it is hard your mind is drifting you want to pick up your phone you wan to to other things you find yourself doing other things that is the period of time to take say the twenty five minute to forty five minute period within the session and divide it into perhaps three or even four smaller chunks of time and you perhaps have heard of chunking before chunking is simply breaking something down into smaller chunks that are more achievable simply what we are talking about here but really ch nking up that middle section of a learning bout can be very effective at essentially eliminating the middle problem now for those of you that are going to be really nippicke you will say weight you take that twenty minutes from the twenty five minute mark to the forty five minute mark within your hour learning bout and you divideit up into for liddle a chunks and in those two middle chunks a in a feel the middle problem for those two middle chunks ah well that is not actually the way it pans out fortunately when you break things down into small enough chunks you eliminate the middle problem and you experience sustain motivation now the extreme interpretation of that would have you measuring every minute or even every second of a learning bout and having consistent motivation throughout that because for instance if you can concentrate for ten seconds why whel you simply be able to just mark off ten second increments well at some point the marking off or the monitoring of those increments is going to be distracting toward the thing that you actually want to do the simple thing to do is to acknowledge the middle problem right the fact that we have more motivation the start and at the end of our goald pursuit sessions than we do within the middle and then to simply chunk that middle section into three may be for smaller chunks and if you ned to incorporate things the visual target protocol one or three or perhaps even eight times within that middle section beat it is going to hlp you move through with better focus and better motivation and what i just described can of course be applied to the longer bouts of effort that do not occur just during one learning bout but perhaps across the week for instance if you are doing four days a week of language learning or fitness training may be it is a monday when sa friday saturday type of schedual and you may notice that in the middle of the week the wednesday training session tends to be the one that you are less motivated to do for whatever reason there could be any reason at all for which the motiation is lower in the middle of the week it does not matter wel in that case you would want to first acknowledge the presence of the middle problems to you would want to acknowledge that that wednesday training bout is prone to the middle problem bec as it is indeed the middle promits in the middle of the monday and the friday training bouts then you would want to approach it with the understanding that it is going to be there and that you are going to need tools and protocals that will allow you to overcome it by for instance taking that one or two hour session on wednesdays and putting a bit more time toward a visual target protocoll at the beginning to increase your focus a bit more visualizing failure if you are feeling amotivated that means not motivated an nerd speak amotivated toward doing that wednesday session and you would want to break up that wednesday session into smaller chunk instead of looking at that two hour session you might break it up into a series of fifteen minutes smaller learning bouts done consecutively back to back and then in doing you have essentially taken that wednesday session and i'lbet that it becomes at least among your most motivated sessions the middle problem exists it is important to acknowledge and there are tools to overcome the middle prom on any time scale you simply have to chunk up the middle and approach things with deliberate increased vigor just as you would if you are running and there is always a tough hill you have to really or gear up for attacking that hill and then to do that repeatedly in those smaller chunks until you have completed that session to day been talking about how to approach gull setting in pursuits act and in and round the specific times that one is engaging in gual setting and pursuit the writing down of gulls defining of gulls the timing and then the actual training sessions or the practice sessions toward achieving that goal what i have not talking about is how to show up to all of that in the best possible state of mind and body in order to achieve the best possible results and of course there are numerous things that we need to do in order to quoti show up at our best where we would stand the best possibility of performing our best and learning the best in those learning bouts things getting adequate sleep getting sunlight in our eyes early in the day adequate and proper nutrition social connection and on t ked about all that on previous podcast episodes i'm not going to talk about those again now but it is important to recognize that the bakdrop of our lives how well we have slept what is going on in our personal lives will all impact things motivation and frankly our ability to even identify what is important because if we are dealing with a health crisis or some in close to us is dealing with the health crisis we tend to have our attention diverted toward that but i do want to acknowledge all of that because it is critically important in defining how you are going to show up to these endeavors and for that matter all endeavors now with that said there are a few things that you can do in order to try an optimize your ability to focus and your level of motivation during your goal pursuits and there are some really interesting data and protocals that i have not talk much about on this podcast ever that are relevant to to day's discussion and this relates to our called circadean rhythms in attention we have a robust rhythms in our ability to focus and our level of motivation that vary across the twenty four hour a ca circadean cycle with a regular rhythmicity that is independent of how badly we want a goal or how afraid we are of failure right all the stuff about motivation and fear of failure and desire et cetera all of that is still true but we all have a naturally occurring rhythm of rise and fall and return to rise and fall of our levels of attention and motivation and this is something that is been describe beautifully in the scientific literature in fact i'll provide a link to what i consider really nice review on this topic this is a review that was published by pablo valdas in the yale journal biology and medicine and twenty nineteen entitled circadean rhythms in attention and there is a lot of information within this review but we can distill out of couple of useful gems from it if you are somebody who is embarking on the pursuit of a goal which is particularly hard that is going to require really high level of motivation and focus know that there are three times s during the day when you stand to have the greatest level of focus and attention and of course this will very dependion when you went to sleep at night and when you wake up there is natural variation in circadean rhythms but it is worth knowing that most people find that their level of attention and motivation is going to be highest thirty minutes three hours and eleven hours after waking up eso thirty minutes three hours and eleven hours after waking up and this relates to a number of important biological principles related to circadean shifts in body temperature which are also relates to circadean shifts that means changes around the twenty four hour cycle in the release of particular neral chemicals of the amount of dopamine available to be released by any sort of goal pursuit a reward the amount of ceratonan available lots of narrowchemistry in their lots of narral circuitry but these heighten levels of focus and motivation that just occur naturally regardless of what goal one is trying to pursue in fact regardless of whether not you are trying to pursue any goal thirty minutes three hours and eleven hours after waking your focus and motivation are going to be their greatest relative to other times in that twenty four hour cycle now as i tell you this i can imagine that some of you are thinking great i'm going to schadul one bout of goal pursuits three hours after waking an another one eleven hours after waking great if you can do that and that fits with your work and other demands of life your relationships et cetera terrific however i do not want this thirty minute three hour and eleven hour proto caul to be considered a rule and here is why most people do not have a tremendeust degree of control over their schedule things work and family and other demands constrain them in terms of when they can get the work in and while i do think it is extremely valuable to schedule the specific time or roughly the specific time then the that is anoxymoron meaning a period of time during the day say before d ine a m were between nine and noon that you are going to carry out your goal pursuit endeavors i've talked about this an previous potcas some people do very well by schetduling an exact time from noon to two i'm writing other people myself do a little better if i set a constraint but it is a la bit broader such as i'm going to exercise before nine a m that cun be any time before nine a m or i'm going too engage in language learning some time between say six p m and nine p m i supposed to setting a specific time as just whort works best for me people very in terms of whether not they respon best to setting a specific time or a time block in setting up these kind of barriers after which you are essentially teling yourself you will not do it but and this is a very important but it is most important that you actually engage in the goal pursuit and i experience this recently i'm trying to run more these days i still enjoyd doing resistance training i still run three days a week but i'm tryng to run a little bit longer a supposted just doing the one long run per week and then a two shorter runs later in the week i've talked about this in my optimo fitness protocal episode if you want to check that out or check out the p t f were it is olved to still down to one or two pages if you but in any event these days i'm trying to extend the amount of time that i'm running i'm just enjoying that it is kind of a throw back for me to when i ran across country is a senior in high school in this was the time of year when i was start getting ready for the false season i'm enjoying running more and just this last week i hade the experience of having a very full sunday and that is usually day when i run in the morning or heihe during the middle of the day and i simply did not get a round to it because i had a lot of other important things to do and what i found was nine p m rolled around ten p m rlled around and i starting i wish i'd gone running my monday was going to be busy what did i do i laced up my shoes and i went for a run at ten p m something i ihave not done since college or maybeen high school andi ended up running for ninety minutes from ten p m until eleven thirty p m definitely not the optimal time for me to go running in fact i was think hit owe this might distrupt my sleep but in fact it did not i came back i showered had alomit of food which normally i do not eat that late and i slept a baby and i felt great the next day waking up at my normal time which cuse me to another important scientific fact that relates to protocal and protocol flexibility tust something that gleaned from a colleague of mine at stamford school medicine who works in the sleep laboratory and i intend to have him as a guest on this podcast which is that much of our subjective feelings of energy and well being during the day have to do noncious with how well and how much we slept the night before but how positively we view our previous days experiences and how positively we view our next day and in fact that same day pursuits and experiences in other words how we feel about our previous day performance and how we feel about what we are about to embark on during our day can increase our energy and that might seem obvious to a number of you but these days as i and many others out theire talking much about the importance of sleep which is of course essential you do want to get great sleep as many nights of your life as you possibly cannon if you do not sleep much for given night howfully it is for reasons that you enjoy and positive things a party or wedding or you kow usier imagination but it is also the case that when we successfully complete something that we told ourselves that we are going to do we feel great about it and that if it means that we sleep alil at less or that we have to do our practice bout an at three p m or two p m a time of day when we are really ordinarily in the trough of attention an we have to use twenty different tools or one tool twenty different times in order to get through that boud of learning the fact that we complete it leaves us with a feeling of accomplishment and uncertain although i do not know exactly which that there are nur chemicals and hormones that reflect that its almost with certainty going to involve dopomene and other norrchemicals but the point is not to get reductionist about it the point is that yes heightened attention and folkas occur naturally thirty minutes three hours and eleven hours after wak ing but the really important thing about all f this goal setting in pursuit is to do it to get it done to set the goal to do it specifically make it quantifiable when you are going to do it make it about verse states and then simply do it thank you for

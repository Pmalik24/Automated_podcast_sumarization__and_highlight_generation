aron release is five americans to house arrest after jobidon pays them six billion dollars the house oversyc chometevous to supen o the bidons and a mass of brawl breakes out between a group of white offenders and a group of black defenders in alabama i'm benthpirtisis venthperro sho benshpir showsponserby express ve pian i talk about them every single show i have not gon a ve pian yet at express we pian right out express wy pianza com lesh ben jobitn has found a new grup of people to bribe this is now i gess how we do business if you have a w and b a player who is not really famous cause she is a obun bia player who goes to russia and brings with her drugs and then she is a rested and she is stuck in jail yes unjustly we are what could be trade to get her back and the answer is the merchant of death which agan bad trade white socks gm level trading right there a merchan to death for for brittny griner well now we have a similar type of trade aron apparently has released from prison five americans but has place them under house arrests he nocthual being fully released on not being sent back to the united states he're just under house arrest an taheron which sounds a real parties being stuck in a house in taheron what exactly to we have to do to get them out of jail and into house arrest which again is its own sort of prisn in taheran all we had to do as give them acces to six billion dollars in oil revenue for qone uote humaniterion purposes by humanitarian purposes aron means terrorism and newclear development a statemen from the national securedals i security council spokes person adrian wasons ays quoe we have received confirmation that ron has releaed from prison five americans who are unjustly detained and has placed them on house arrest whell this is not encouraging stap these you us citizens seimacnamazi morad tabas an ment shargi an to americans with this time wished remain private should never have been detaining the first place we will continue tomonitor ther condition as closely as possible of course we will not rest until they are all back home in te united states until that time negotiations for their eventuall release remain ongoing and our delicate we will therefore have little in the way of details to provide about the state of their house rest or about our efforts to secure their freedom just to do the mauth forier for those horn thakonamat that is one point to billion dollars per hostage ah i you think may be a ron is going to think about taking some hostages in the future about russia far the trading strategy here a purest to be ba bruth to the new york yankees from the bloston red socks level of trading strategy here and this these this agregious it is a gregious aron is a terror estates we just gave them six billion dollars now to be fair at least it was not a hundred fifty billion dollars on the upper end or fifty billin dollars on the lower an of cash in pallats sent to a ron when berakobamo was present an basically to cut a crapy newcleer deals that he could have a legacy in the middle east and agan to be fair he wasn' trading talabantrrus for bull burg dall a deserver buttin good an if you wish to incenseibize terror states to take american hostages very difficult to think of a better way to do that than by giving one point to billion with a b dollars to get these people released from jail to house arrest in teron wasigansting another billion and halfbucks to get them released from house rust back to th united states or is thi the precurser to the long awaited bide move towar norondio is jobiding anto use this as the predicats to argue that now relations are actually warming there thalling wit the aronian i toll us now we should remember at this point that the aronians ar directly responsible for hundreds of american deaths in roch it was aronian back forse that killed hundreds of americans in aroch aron is the most nifarious force in the midle east whether we are talking about backing the hoothies an yemman whetheretime out backing casbalat i mass terrors group an lebinon which could lead to a war between israel and labon in the very very near future where the retalking by ron bat backing comas and shipping them rockets aron backing syria every bad thing happening in the middle east right now can be laid basically at the door step of the aronian the thing you do not want to do is give them actes to billions of dollars in capital jobidon gave them access to billions of dollars in capital which again bat tude not good at the presidenting was not trying get american hostages out of terrible regimes is a great thing to do but one point to billion dollars a person that is not the greckbright it turns out t actually stix can be very effective as well not just cerrate but te bin admnistration has offered no such stick in the past mean the rigan administration was able to free the aranian hostages by basically being incredibly threatening toward the aronian regime it turns out a fantastic way to insentivise people to take hostages is to pay them billions of dollars for hostages is this can be the predicat to an even warm removed by jobidon toward norondoso we should remember at this point that jobidon his chief negotiator with regard toron was the amand named robert malley robert malley was recently removed in terms of his security clearance his secureticlance was literally removed because who suspected of traficing in classfight information rober malley's ben a long time critic of the state o israel he is been a long time piece neck with regard to the aranian iatolss all the way back to the abominad ministration robert malley is one of abama's guis malley just last month he had his security clearance removed leading a group of republican sentators to urge the state departments an turn a wacstrug to investigate the suspension of malleys security clearance ratching up scrutiny of the administrations handling of the incident malley was jobidons top aron onvoy and he was heming the administrations efforts to restore newclear totheron when his security clearence was quietly suspended some time at this spring whe was then put on unpaid leave in late june following metear reports that is clearance have been suspended the administration bends over far backward to try an draw some sort of arondeol op that now they are sending negotiators who cantome get secure to clearance and theare clearing billions of dollars in cash to the iatola simultaneously their tempting to force the state of israel to make concessions tooranian back terra groups for example commass the latest attempt to by jobidon to draw piece in the mddle east is ha suppose sed saudy israelly normalization deal now the saudies are perfectly willing to normalized relations with israel theyve been wanting to do since the trumpadministration that is the reason why the u a e bocharain morocco all these countries tat are very friendly relations with the saudies have normalized relations with the israelies already saudy clearly wanted to do that i've seen public officials from tidaraba directly talk about this whel was the whold thup the whold up is that jobidin basitly proprescious on the soudies not to do it unless israell make concessions to the palist inians the palis inians happen to be governed by terror groups the palcinian authority is a long time tarregroup is lomicgehod is n actual terro group come os is clearly a terregroup back by ron right now jobitn's game with regard to the saudies in these railies is to try to box benjamin it is na hot the prieminister of israel in by essentially offering the carrot of a saudy piecteal and the stick that the saudy piece ia will be removed unless bebing intona who makes overt concessions to a group of people whoare likely to use all those concessions as launching pads four terrorism according to axios primanenturn its na who is seeking in security agreement with he united states focastone to turng a ron in the contects of that magadiel that the bie administration is trying to reach with saldy arabia and israel of formal agreement would give vu s security guarantees to israel at a timewhen ron continues to advance it is neucleader program bu presumably the fall with ron is just another way of attempting to pressure beby into taking some sort of deal with the saudies thy would amount to concessions to the palcing is now again the saudie do not care about that realistically speaking this ideao the saudies a desperately involved in palsing in pes negotiations is nonsense they do not care they the reality is that economic trumps everything right now in themidle east because all of theses kingdoms are dependens on prosperity for their people these are notomocracies they do not have the democratic support of their people the reason that they get to stain power is because they enrich their people through economic growth if the economic growth collapses they also collapse thy voth strong interest in creding economic ties with these strong is economic power in the region which actually is israel it is bidin it is standing in the way of all of that we will see how all of this developsen wi'll keep an eye on it bobviously gan just one second wi'll get the latest development in the hunter biding case weare the house oversy comittee is preparing to issue sopenust aboth hunter and jo first have ever invested a nice jacket shoes maybe a nice dinner well that istoff it is relatively temperar what is not temperary the sheets these

dod com ouse promicochburg at fifteen percents off your very first order o cay meanwhile we have the house oversan accountability comitte now announcing that they are going to sepinat the bidin family here is james come re publican of kentucky and the head of the house overside accountability comittee who who said this to day are you going to sepina hunter biding they had not time tiniar hunder out i'm during the tromin men a stratiin and they ask him all sorts of questions about i wat we understand what we understood at the end in the danin me alive about russha collosion yen this is always got a and with go bidings i coming in crort of the committee we are going cecipin an the famwy a me we are putting the case together to waiting court obviously with all the outhosation in obstruction were getting from the byin a ternees the we know that this is gen a ind upping court when we sipine of the byso we are putting together case and i think we have done that very well now well they actually pay tention to te sepinup probably not in there munch people ho have not in the past oviocsy see bannons in pay attention to a sepina handed up in contempt are colder when who ise atturning generals in pay attention to a scepina he anded up in contempt ave being helding contempt by congress at this point has very little consequence bot the fact that the house oversite an accountability committee is now attempting to actually cepinah bidns means that this is getting more and more serious commer says we wanto talk to three or four more associates first we'v been communicating with a couple of them is were trying to bring them in we did dav an archer for transcribed interview i they dn't come involuntarily they will in fact besopinut he sai i'll be very difficult you gettin formation from jobidin thrusipinas because of course any time he try to cipiin the president of the united states the presient intends to ignore all of that but comer correctly points out the thing that i've been pointing out for literally a couple of years at this point since the hunter byn lamtop the singlemost damning peace of in formation that we have with regard to how the money flowed in the bidin white house and with regard to jobidin is vice present hunter by anotherescitis the sing most dowing pece evidence is a tex message sent from hunter bidon to his daughter talking about how he paid half of his dads bills now here is the thing hunter and joe could have commingled funs very easily basically jos defence here is that the money did not formally enster my personal bank account but if i pay for dinner with my father then he benefits and that happens all the time i got to diner ith my dat and i'll payfordenter he benefits for my income of hunter is basily signing chucks for all of jos expenses obviously he benefited here is at jimes comer saying that tome the most damming piece of in formation is hunter literally saying that he pays joes bills whye they blockat is from more bankrecker ro eif the presidents don nothing wrong then they should allow us to see their personal bankrec i mean you san the emals they sho thet hunder bine was complain in to his daughter that he had t give haf of ti tink of to his father a thats thretty daing evident when his i come one hundred persent came from a haderstrage around the world were in fluent and e fort for bylating the fornagett registration at ay yow he is right about all that obviously and the jugsto position be tween the g o j basically attempting to gut a sweetheartseal with hunter bidon and the yeo ja simultinuously going after preseent trump his gon have some pretty major ramifications for the twenty twenty four race represent if dan mus a re publican af pennsylvania he points out the juxto position and how awkward it is for the bide administration haw do you seen that are not terms of this coantidance that sondting happnintin temptin that been s coming out an hon to find i biting the next day another attack on on tromp i think it is pretty obvious and the american people i think or ar waking up to itin a don everything they cant to suppress their their own a mowtheant's activitys and hide their own accounts and you desperately try to keep the biding family out a jail meanwhile they completely fokus on a diting that they number one a opponent in in a political a can paynaw i man now that that is benot a re public stuff merican people got un understand that that that isn exactly what is happening get well he is right about that hell soe points out of course that jobiden his lie repeatedly during this entire tobaco mean jobidon literally said that hunts receive no chine's money he said at n open debate in twenty twenty he said that he never benefited he said that hunter really never benefited from even using his name sid he had nothing to do with hunter's business all of these things wre un true here is it represent i musar pointsing out that jobitan is a liar ht forst us talk about these thing you finding ton te house over seccommitey had he sail of tit well it is it is pretty ugly its pretty clear that jo bidon a lide a and why did he lie because he knew t business that was taking place he knew a lot about the busines ta mn he informed hat his son that he was in the clear in the clear for one joe and why were you lying because you without and out pronouncing at i mean you must have known that this said this for there was some shavy dealings taken place get well here is the thing the white house is immediately retreatig to its fine old position in ther motin bailey argument ther ther they'r mot was jobidon knows nothing about any he business as and their bailey is you kno thething they retreat to is jobins just such wonderful father and they cannot actually show that the money flow directly to joe here is the white house pokes person for oversiden investigations even samscal comera and his fellow exstreme re publicans in congress are now admitting they have not uncovered any proof of involvemint a wrong doing by present bidon i mean they proved involvement deven archer literally testified to it they simply will continue to sprit inuendo an lies as they persuade baseless im peachments done to attack the pesent well i'm sorry to break it you guides you opened this dore it was you it was you you impeached president trump not once but twice and you did largely on the petagat that donal trump was a russian agents which was all inuendo and lies it was not true as completely baseless you made his entire presidency about a giant lie pursued by the muller in vestigation and you trotted out congrss person fter congress persons you say that the smoking on was just behind the next door and it was not congratulations play stupid games winstupid prizes i said it at the time as son as the im peach trump the first time every president from here an out is likely t beimpeach as long as the house of the opposing party is very likely that person is going to be impeach now in this case it may well be deserve but even if it warrant it is a matter because this is the way this is going to go now here is the thing if jobiten realy starts to go down for this if the evidence continues to mount it is not to late for democrats to get out that romains a very real possibility elizabeth warrent is starring to show a little bit of a crack in the dam s the senator for masschusetts who you stohave presidential aspirations of her own and then it turned out to us in native american well i now elizbeth warren says she is worred about influence peddlers on all sides which is an interesting answer people close to jobi or people close the gonal trom but i'm talking muc yobardn making tens of millions of dollars because of their closeness to him that cannot be something that you there cannot be something that you are comfortable with i'm as a phenomenon what i i always worry about the influence pedlers in washington regardless a party offiliation what of the things as you now i spen a lot of my thime in congress working on is how we bring more ethics tand more over signt in general to a everything that we do on government what can we got a united states supreme prt where people take cift and do not even report them even tog the lar reuires then to report they weill get to that in just a second because the democrats are now swiveling to clock clarence thomas this is the way that this whole stupi game works there she starting to show little ba discomfort with defending jobiden as i say if things tare to get real bad for jo they could throw the old man overboard and i'm unfortunately he cannot swim they do not care but there can swivel over to clarence thomas that is their next predictable movl get to that momentarily first tmany americans have lost faith in the government media and schools that is the bad news the good news is there is something you can do to help get the country back ontrack preger you is an educational mine profit fighting save the future of the country they ben watch five million time to day preger u vidios spread messages of liberty economic freedom and judeo crisian gallies to the next generation we were closely with preger yourtheir basitly assister company to our own i've produced several vidios on my own as as one of the narrators of a preger you viio theire truly is hope for america but only if wer reach more young people with preger you got to preger you dot com make attacks deductable donation whatever you give right now will be matched and have twice the impact if you do not a ten bucxs t doubles to twenty that is how doubling works seventy percent of yours say their mind was changed at for watching a preger you but you will please give to preger you to day your gifts can have double the impact ind reaching more people and changing more mindes go to preger you dot com to day whatever you give again wi'll be doubled honwnever to preger you dot com to day that is the best way to help young people prarticularly young people going t university actually see content that we will changed their minds away from the indoctrination of their professors henever preger you dot com to day and give generously o ke meanwhile the democrats are tempting to swivel the corruption talk over to clarence thomas propublica has basitly bee putting out ridiculous hit piece ave ridiculous hippes vout clarence thomas the suggestion being that he is some m sort of corrupt politicion clarence thomas has a lot of friend fort very rich they take him on vacation ga now i've just got a point out here this not rare at all a really is not rare people go on junkets all the time unless there is some sort of connection can be shown between the people quart basily taking clarence thomas on vacations with them or letting him use their beech house and in actual case or contrversy an fren clarence thomas is not a corruption problem ats not the way this worksy here is the thing when jobiton was by su presidents of the united states he was presiding over youcrane policy hunt or bidon was puit on the board of a ucraniun company you can see the nexise a when when jobidon was vice presidents if the united stateshe had influence on china policy certainly the chinese thought which is presumably why they were woing hunter by n ou can see the nexis if however there is a supreme court justice and he has a rich friend and his rich friend says would you to spend the night on my boat ad his sproome court justice goes nen spend the nght on the boat and the rich friend has no business before the court never has had any business before the court will not have any business before the court were exactly is the corruption as supposed to somebody just going on vacation with a frend while probublica is not makingthat distinction they have an entire article to day talking about how clarence thomas had thirty eight vacations wow thirty eight well that that sounds wild except for we are talking overthe course of thirty years soethin a vacation por year during his three decates omas supreme court clarencs thomas has enjroyed steady access to a stop most americans can only imagion well yas is supremecourt justice aman nay name a poor supreme court justice quick go a codray of industryt tightans and ultra wealthy executives have treated hims to far flong vacations aboard their yachts ushered him into premium sweets at sportin events and sent their private juts to fetchihim including on more than one occation ind his hire seven thirty seven o kay i'm i'm skinn point out that is a person who a who traffics in economically you lead circles this sort of tuf is not un common at all i've spent time in luxury sports sweets and i'm not a supremecort justice and i've traveled on private git and i'm not a suprime cort justice and unless they can prove some sort of actual corrut even a lege ame actural corruption here clarence thomas going to a sport's game with a rich friend does not amount to corruption clockwork thomas his leisure active tes have ben underwritten by benefactors to share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence wet you mean that his friends agree with him on politic tept corazy how no be still my beating heart propepublica but this of course is being used as ea as an excuse to try and get rid of clarence thomase because clarence thomas is the most influential justice of my lifetime and he has been incredibly influential and wive riety of ways it was sculia up untola scoliis untimely death obviously but the religious angrat clarence thomas because he is a concervative blackman and and that you are not allowed to be an originalist blackman on sprime court not allowd to do this the the real animas here is baut his politics which is wy e supreme court annalas for seeanand jon bescupic is that talking about clarence thomas controlling our lives which is weard since he is one of nine justices whoth dime r they on remember theywork us the best part of benus princort justic is they set the law of the land for all of us clearence thomas was one of only five votes that rol back rod away clearenc thomas wrote the opinion expanding the second an maman an gunrights clarenc thomas is controlling much of our lives i think hi should answer to the american public oka by answer to the american public you can try in peaching him any tim you arn yers can t have to find s mathral criminal grouns which do not have at all but none of that matters again the way this works is when democrats go after a political oppony you do not need an excuse jes do it when a publicans go aft for a political opponent even if there is good evidence that the person is corrupt we pretend its not happening wet's more on this 'n just one second first hiring somebody does not need to be this hard i know can be exhausting long expensive thankfully ziprcre is a hiring partner focust on you and

that were all going to ignore apparently it is just ok now that the january six committee the lead it all of its records what the hell is there any institution in america at this point that is not utterly incompetent and or corrupt according to fox news the house select commitee tat in vestigated the capital right on january sixth failed to adequately preserve documents state and bidio depositions includig communications it had with the bit in white house that are still missing according to the re publican law maker overseeing the geope investigation into thecomitte's work this is nuts o caye the j six commte temost highly toweted can gressional committee since the nine eleven commission this this committee te lead it all of its records now normally that would make a huge difference because presumably there are other records of for example the footage write the police at tat sort of ootage the senate has that sort ofootage however hw bout the communications with the white house what sort of coordination political cordination was going on between the j six committee and the bidin white house what sort of political con siderations were going into the questioning that was happening how much was the white house running the show the now dispanded j six commitee which was run by democrats an ncluded only tugiope members has also failed topovite any evinence it looked into capital he will security failures the day of the right icoing to represent of berry louder milk or ublican of georgia he is cheirman of the sub committee on overside for the comitte on house administration lowder milk said his staff has had difficulty gathering all the in formation it needs to investigate represent of beny thomson's handling of that jasix investigation he says part of our task at's this overside sub committee is to actually address the security failures looking how did it happen how are thse people able to get into the capital he said the documents they obtain came over in boxes completely onorganized no table of contents in dec nothing of an index at all he says nen we realize that there is really nothing there from the blue team at all that is the group within the jasix comitte that was directed to investigate security failures as the capital they ignored the actual part tha woldhave mattered about j sixon from preventing ae future jasix namely why was there zero cops at the capital building on the day where every one knew that things were gonto gat ugly wy where that is ha real question where were these security plans why was it that a few hundred rioters could storm what should be one most secure buildings on on the face of the earth on the day when the election for the president whoas being certified wy ah it still beggars the imagination i put aside whatever the evils of people breaking intothe building worn those were substantial if yeu ras tack and cops obviously but why were there seven cops where were capital police where was every one i this is the thing congr hould be investigating an apparently then new in bother according to louder milk he said the blue team was essentially shut down by thecommittee in order to folks on placing blam on trump hes we have got lots of depositions got lots of sopinas got vidio wother documents provided througcopina's by individuals herenot seeng anything from the blue team as far as reports on the investigation they did looking into the actual breach itself we else it in have an vidiofs volv ed apositions that is an amazing amazing things the destroyed presumably whatever records they had ore there is not turning any that stuff over there lodermlk said he came across a letter tha was not turned over to his commttee from thompson to white house special council richard salber and the d c s discussing an agreement made between the jasix committee and the executive branch to interview personnel whose names were laiter ad acted apparently the jasix comittee knew certain staffers at the white house in these staffers tustified ands on then they just refused to turn any f that stuff over this is really dicy sort of stuff if youre a fan of transparency you should be pretty upset about all this now presidet in trump for his part was up set about lall the her was president trump today about it gy totally dispe telec a the we di tos what happen an that they allowd that to happen and that canmee dis an one any bety to to coped e but now we cand an we di something that es tatein an tav that we have thi ipen ope as we ohav sipenopele all the send tha ja six commiti te un solec si cole everything is to lei and destroye to tav comma tanwy thing was to lede an distroi that that is a crimial act it is insane it is a really really crazy thing foreshore fore shore onyu meanwhile weare now learning that done the prosecution jacksmith going up against at donal trump actually sought and obtained a search warren for donald trumps twitter account what they wanted were drafts of his tweets apparently according to politico jacksmith did obtain a search waren four trumps twitter account earlier this year titters in istral resistance to complying with the january seventeenth warant result in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and levying a three udred fifty thousand dollar find a federal cort of ap peals up held that fine last month in sealed opinion on wednesday the court un seald to redacted version of that opinion revealing details of the secret cort battle for the first time what exactly with smith seeking from trumps accoun apparently he was looking for drafts of the tweets obtaining datof from twitter might have re vealed patterns about trumps use of the account whether others had access to it and whethrthere ar any draft statements that run sent nout that is really weird right im he let what would be in the draft statements tht would be of relevans two jacksment tha trump was gon ta sended draft sang i know the election was last by may but rigt anyway ike that was going to be in the draft statements or something by the wy the facety did not send it would be a pretty quick and obvious defence to anything that migh be found in thedrafts anyway twitter complain of the order violated the first menment the ustistrat cort judge said no and force twitter to turn over the records by the way one of the things about this particular attempt to but to obtain trumps twitter records is that one of the federal judges who as overseeing the prosecution apparently suggested in a footnote that dot the that they had reason to believe that trump would quote flee from prosecution the same distric court judge wo saying they need to check his twitter account was also saying that they thought thet trump might aftually abscond leave free fleet he is one he is literally the most famous person on the planent where would he flee too what evidence could you suggest thoee suggest that donal trump is going to flee prosecution here meaget more and more this case looks just kangaroo court it is it is really absurd meanwhile he have members ofthe medio who are very excited about the fact that donal trumps twitter history is going to be searchd including his draft here is therporter from royder's jeff mason saing hi's got betons there in trumps twitter draft there are a lot more things that but could be in those records that we would not see publicly drafts and i kno from my reporting covering him the theentire time he was in the white house they would draft tweets he would he would i say tweets he wit t give tweet ideas to his staff when they would put him together there is got to be a wealth of knowledge there long ther the direct messages a bunch of stuff that but that could be useful o git well i'm just because he think a thing is useful maybe that that is cll a fishing expedition and it is pretty absurd that it is come this fir meanwhile president trump is i not going to partispa in the first omat youud imagine he says he is not going to sign any sort of arans ee loyalty pledge ahead of the first to mate the arons he has said that every one does have to sign a pledge that they will vote for whoever the republican candid isnin support that re publican candidat trumsad are not signing the pledge by ot as sin of pledge f ther people on there i would not have he told ther poniy he could amed three or four of the jopy challengers he would not support for president ansa and he is specificaly criticized chris cristy which you can see and esa hutchinson and then he added of course ronisantis because that is the way thes dumb nonsense work but botoline is that da the the idea that he was ever going to participat in the bate i think is is foolhardy he is up a lot in the poles are not a logic the lot of logic suggesting that he needs cho jump into debate for any perticular reason i will say that iscan be used against him by trobitdon all the people who are where voting for trump in the hopes that therewill be a biding trump tobate i'm in predicting it right now there will be no trumpitin bate is not going to happen jobiton will not to make present entrump he is not going to do it jobitenis simply gin a say i do not dobay irobete insurrectionsi convictegpas and thn the me yol go what a hero what a hero that jobidon andyourbidon ill sa brugejog then theall cheer and the lights will slowly dim is the music rises and that that that is the way this this idios e is going to go now whate's that mean for the rest of the republican field whall basically it means it

fouche to the g o j he suggesting that anthony fouche ashually committed perjury before congress when he suggested that he was not volving gain of function re searchers ranpaul going after it what whald turn the tables for you what evidence to have we how i do not think there is ever been a clear case of perjury in the history of government testimony and i do not say that litely he said atimatly that the government never fund in this gang of function research we now have the government accountability office te g o has admitted that the funding came from the an i e we have that acting director taback of the admitting it in writing that it came from the ani but now we have really the slokind god and that is fauchy in private saying the opposite of what he was saying an coblin imean that is right anthony fouch has to turns out was saying the opposite in private the free press has a fantastic piece by david's wag about this on april seventeen twenty twenty with much of the hunctry still in some form of lockdown and news of overwhelmed hospitals dominating the hadlines doctor anthony fouchy that a member of the president's corronviros task force was asked to questions where the end of a white house prestbreefing was their possibility the novel vitrs came from alabin han china there is a study recently fouchy said where a group of highly qualified evolutionary verologists look to sequence s there and sucuincis in basas thevolve and the mutations it took to get where it is now is totally consistent with jump of the species from an animal do human was not from alab fouchy maintained this for a very very long time but fouchy had an incentive to arrive that conclusion because the when instedt of verolghe was known for doing highris verology research studing hamnipulating corronofvirises and fouchy had funded such researh at the w ive last month a trope of explosive emles andother documents released that e house lick sub committee on covin these revealed evidence of fouchies and other officials behind the scenes involvedment with scientists an journalist demonstrating their efforts to quash the labli theory entirely the recently disclosed private communications first reported by public and racket lay bare that the highly qualified authors of that paper achally had extensive un certainty about the viris being the result of a natural event at all apparently a month just before that a that paper was published christian anderson one of the paper's authors were to slack message to his collisan quote the lab escaped version of this is frig and likely to have happened becaus they were already doing the stype of work and the molecular date is fully consistent with that sinario and then another co author rote on slackwuhot it is not crackpotto suggest this could ave happened given the gain of function research we know is happening fouchy then intervened and he basintly got them to write a paper saying thatit was very unlikely and thn he went ne lide and said he had not fundto gain o function research in the first place and a he tried to read o fine gain a functian research to mean gain of function with iny species at not cross species should he be tried for persury on this one i mean he fred it is pretty obvious that he should it is a meric arlans docakon to take thet one up yat no thate they are to busy going after everything thet dons rup does obviously meanwhile the left which it turns out was wrong on many aspects of covin they just keep doubling down and creding fancy senarioes where control is justified sam harris a person with whom i've ben friendly and a and i've had him in show he said man his show it is been a little while since we talked a sam harris did not interview tha's gonviro in which he talks about government control and in order for him to justify government control during the pendemic he basically had to make the case that if covid had been capable of killing everybody on earth we woud hav bin o cay with govrnment force well i mean mabe be but also that was not the case i'v failed to yes and if aliens were attacking earth and martial law might be it necessary asd dt i do not understand what tho has to do at the price of tea in china as they say here is a sam harris but dil up the the deadliness of the pathage and give us something air born abola that int cubates for a month you do not you do not know you have it and you are what you walk around spreading it ansgot seventy five per cent fatality rate and it is mostly killing kids no one gets to make that choice any more i may then literally the the cops come in and vacinate you and ii would say that all of us would agree to that the momentagain theu turn up the lethality on the on the pathage and you turn up the effectiveness of the vac ying you turn down the risk of the bacing give me a truly safe facying where there is not even one documented case of vaxian injury right that then you just have to be completely crazy to be worried about being vacinated in that invin that kind of environment im then it is just a no brainer then then we just do not tolerate a diversity of opinion because the stakes are too high is it it is a full on emergency bodies of kids yoare being stacked up in parks right we we there is many of them we do not know what to do with them we have got these mobile morgues and we have evaxing that actually works and then we have got ar if ca jun our saying may maybe tdo not wantin amaybe do notwant gat the jab on roga's pokcastsright that is that tastly the world i've been worried about ever since col well i mean i soon the argument that he is actuay making here te sort of steal man his argument is that he is worried that vaxing skepticism is going to mean that if we ever do get a viris this then the reaction is going to be a lot of skepticism bat number one that is the fault of the institutions and to be fair it is the faults of people sam harris who were promoting a lot of government interventionism along these lines and there the reality is that if you looks at the statswhat you saw is that wherever the viris got incredibly prevalent people actually voluntarily took the vaxing more during those time periods then when the vitris was not prevalent wich is precisely what you respectsanthing with mass people in other words take prophalactic measures as they see fit in order prevent themselves from getting really sever versions of the virus this is why elderly people took the virate an took took vexing into far high rate thn people were twenty and that thatshuld be the case by the way but i mean of course if we are talking about air borny bola killing seventy five percent to people that it tauched and mostly killing kids i mean i would not has did get o vacs that point would you bu why why would anybody and yes i mean a full blown emergency is different that is the whole point the point here is tha the government treated this is a full blown emergency for three long years in many places in the united states and across the world when it was not den't understand how the govrments failure's here oure somehow justified by a completely speculative hypothetical senario i mean i can make those up too iit is very eason makes up what if the government lie there was no covet at all when that justify no governen interventionism and suggested the ar action line to you meanit there arether hypotheticals all across the board its not hardly to a hypothetical i'm just confuses to whi sam harris things that justifies what the government did here ocane meanwhile an what has been a bizarle holarias and yet controversial case athere something happened the other day in montgomery alabama that is now being called the alabama tea party rawl a it is ord the alabama sweet tea party i have seen apparently what happened is that it was a saturday evening i montgomery's river front and a black riverboat co captain was attack by grouop of white people as other black people rushed to his defense here is a vidio of what exactly happenesa riverboat captain trying to park his riverboat here somemody comes thay man nactually hits him a white eye is coming in hing the black eye the black eye throws his hat presume blee saying tha he wants to go and a these other white people are wacking a longside the whick eyind their trying who pull the black eye off and then other white people run in and tack al the black eye which whinht a bunch of nearby black people i they got the hat signal and a and they run in to intervene a one black eye jums in the water and swims across the a the the river here to go and help the the black security guard actually as the as vidio continues athe term aqueman was trending on twitter after that the reason this was treated with with some humor is because everbe understood that a the white eyes here reatually doing the wrong thing tey were one who arrested and nobody actually got yo seriously injured in all this as if tuesday warmths were issued against three men who are on the pontun boat richard roberts forty eight who counts of thir degree assault allentods twhenty three one counts of thir degree assault and szacry chas simp shipman twenty five one counts of third degree assault all our mist demeaners the three charge were white men on board pontounboat the prevented theriverboat from docking for nearly an hours woul sounds a they were being jeriks here was the montgomery police chief announcing the prosecutions the police depoltment did not have the lok fme of e ve that we all ha fen no noa we have more information agan will not cho in olkin the vidio sertanly paint of in in piccur after mn shlo e piccher members of the to and t liteti cumping in to defend the river boats co captain davian picket as you can see from thes new footite the fight quickly escalates and one point a man even swinging o holding chair on diubly delleasy oiy this morning richard roberts two other men i'll an tod and zacary shipman are expected to turn themselves in all of them they sing mister meanor asault charges gay this is a a bizar story with a happy atneand seems the people who are engaging in assault our going to jail now the police say this is not ratially mot if atted some age to un to drunk people being drunk an and att acking other people but the media can quickly turn this into o racial stories that iswhat charles blow is doing over at the near times says the alabama sweet tea party that was one nickname people gave to a brawl this past saturday i mongomery alabama river front doc capturin viralvidios after a group of white people attacked the damien picket in some obvious ways the holeposod to sad the situation should neverhave descended in violence the people were asked to move their boat sto the riverboat could dock should is simply complied but nother ways many black people in particular sougit as an unfortunat but practically unavoidable response to wat can feel an unending stream of incidence in which black people are publicly victimize with no one willing or able to intervene or render aid black people coming to the fence of that black man was not just a specific thing that happene at one time and place those allso a o parture in some ways from the most memorable images in a history that centuries of black tageted rutality which traces the journey of black people in this land that became the united states leave it to charles blow to turn this into a rough erendum on all eamericas racial history as pose to some drunk jack assis attacking a black eyin getting their assis kick for the benefitin going to jail ait got by the way wuld charles blow be writing the reverse if this eningrup a black people attacking a white riverboat captain i have serious serious dafts there' be anything thits lettl sucidal analysis from charles blow sometimes dum people and criminals and bad people do bad dumb criminal things and the race in actually the be main issue in all this which is why again white people an black people were mainly happy that the perpetrators were a rested regardless of race a'll gat time for some quick things i things that i to day again there is something amusing about the emigration policy pursued by democrats coming home to rust new york mayor eric adams now he is oneof th

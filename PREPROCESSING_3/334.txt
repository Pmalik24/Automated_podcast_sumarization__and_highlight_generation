welcome to the hubermanlapcontens scus science science space to frlife i mender hubermen and on roprofessor of naurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is chris voss chris voss spent more than two decades as an agent with the f b i or federal bureau of investigation where he was a lead crisis negotiator and a member of the joint terrace task force chris is also the author of a phenominal besselling book entitled never split the difference in addition he has taught courses and negotiation at harvard at georgetown and at the universiy of southern california as a world expert in all forms of negotiation to day chris teaches us about how to hold hard conversations where we are seeking particular outcomes or perhaps where we do not know what the optimal outcome could be he talks about this in the context of business in the context of relationships including romantic relationships but familial and work relationships as well and he talks about how we should think about ourselves in the context of negotiation that we can all arrive at the best possible outcomes indeed during to day's episode you will learn to pay attention to emotions not just other people's emotions but your own emotions in order to determine whether r not your processing the information your hearing accurately and equally important whether or not you are being heard accurately when you are in a discussion of any kind but especially heated discussions in addition we discuss the role of both physical and mental stamina in the context of diffical conversations negotiations and decision makin because in the real world context oftentimes those can take place not just within a single conversation but over the course of several days or even several weeks months or years chris also teaches us about deception that is how to determine if somebody is lying by asking particular typs of probe questions thanks to chris vossis both breadh and depth of expertice in the negotiation process he glean during his more than two decates service in the f b i as well as his generosity in sharing that information by the end of to day's episode you will have an excellent understanding of what the negotiation proses is really all about and how to better carry out those negotiations that they can best serve you and others before we begin i t emphasize to this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponser is plunge plunge makes what i believe as themos versitile at home self cooling cold plunge for deliberate cold exposure i've talked numerous times on this podcast about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure deliberate cold exposure especially deliberate cold exposure done up to the nack in water can be used to achieve a number of important end points related to mental health physical health and performance plunge uses a powerful cooling filtration and sanitation unit to give you access to deliberate cold exposure in clean water whenever you want i've been using a plunge for more than two years now i can tell you that it makes it very easy to get your deliberate cold exposure at home it does not require much cleaning in fact it is very easy to keep clean which is essential you oft want bacteria and other things growing in your coal plunge basically everything about the plunge is made easy that anyone including myself can get their deliberate cold exposure on a regular basis at home if your interested in getting a plunge you can go to plunge spell p l u n g e dok cam slash huberman and get one hundered n fifty dollars off your col plunge again that is plunge dok cam slash huberman for hundred nd fifty dollars off to day's episode is also brought to a spy roca roca makes eye glasses in sun glasses that are the absolute highest quality i've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly in different environmence roca understands the biology the visual system and as design their eye glasses an sungla ses that you always see with crystal clarity originally their glasses were designed for performance that is for running and cycling and for sport and indeed they can still be used for performance they will not slip off your face if you get sweatyeitheir extremely light wait but i should mention that roca eye glasses and some glasses come in some of the aesthetics mor typically associated with performance glasses the sideboard style glasses but they also have a number of styles that youud be perfectly comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work i wear readers at night or when i drive and i wear some glasses during the day if i happen to be driving into bright light or outside and it is just overwhelmingly bright i do not wear some glasses when i do my morning sunlight viewing to set my circadian rhythm and i suggest that you do the same if you to try roca eye glasses or some glasses you can go to roca aro k a dac com and enter the code hubermen to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is roca aro k a dac com and enter the code huberman at checkout and now for my conversation with crisvoss crisvoss welcome andrew pleasure man i've been money to talk to you on record for a while you are quite the what we call in signs and of one when somebody is a true sample size of one i realize that yes you are because you have this incredible skill set from your time in he tii you but you also have an incredible understanding in knowledge of how to communicate about that skillset that people can clean useful information from it you are also the guy that i text recall every once in a while wand i've i'l run myself into a jam or when i think i might be in a jam and i will not reveal details but you tell me whether not things are o k and fortunately the last couple times i reached out you said you are good thank you always hapen out thank you well i have a lot of questions to day but would i to start off talking about is negotiations take many forms but if we could break those down into their broad categuaries that will be useful but before we do that i want to know about the mine set that you have when you go into a negotiation and whether or not there any s practice is i realize it been in this profession a long time and perhaps became reflective to you at some point but all of us at some point tor negointo negotiations business negotiations relationship negotiations et cetera is there a process of getting one's mined and body right for a negotiation you are shifting from more listening unless talking or im what are ther any tools that you use on the regular that could be 'm useful for us to keep in mind as we extend into the different categories and negotiations and waste to approachlest negotiations and thet cthere can be a couple different first of all just trying to figurt what which really going on is is reallesue and then how can i get in approach where i'm most likely to get the best possible outcome there is always more than meats time and there is a certain there is a certain few clea chaves but the real issue is there is always a better deal or there is no deal at all first of all trying my first thingers i want to find out whether not there is a deal at all or whether not to bay deal and then i men'l walk away really fast because those are ging to be complete wace of time it is not a sen to not get to deal this tis sin to take a long time can not get the deal what is ta sin to take a long time to get a bad deal i i want to no i'm muntr try to forgure real quick whether not is there cut through it on the other side of the table as somebody i coul trust i'm i'm getting i'm leading a little more inclined to dealing with the difficult people now as long as i do not give in i get i i want a diagnose early on what the possibilities are now if i'm curious if i'm actually interested now another aspect of the mind sad is fi'mb in a great mood if i'm just going t be playful a couple of really huge personal negotiation wents recently was when i was just trying to be playful i mean i was jus i was in a great mood and i'm jokin around and great negotiation is not exciting its astonishing m i'm minite a contlerent conversations right now with a possible nonscript o tv show and i was telling to producers it os thinking to be real housewifes m for to make te show properly theren't cin of any screamin it is that con t be bar rescue were ryelling a people when i can to be house kitchen were reelling a people it is never going to be exciting but it is going to be astonishing you will get out comes were suddenly you find yourself in a place what in a world how do that just happen and wi i lose a suit case in a airport the other day and i'm walking into lost luggage place and i'm in a great mood tos om home and i'm happy to be ome an i'min to get a good nights sleep and even mosst laten it thay i'm just happy and i you are ready to walk into this the lost luggage store where these people are batter children they expect you they know that you expect them the way for magic ane and proof your luggage is going to be there for whatever reason at when i set to say when i walkin a doris young lacyis hhow can i help you well first of all how you could hep me as obvious cause i'm een a lost luggage ire's only wh reason i'm inhers the net's kind of a silly question and i go i need you to wave a magic wine and she just laughs and she looks at me she ins up walkin me out to the carase climbin up on the cara s and she walks down o ramp the luggage comes o out of and i guarantee you they are not suppose to do that and she sticks her head and she looks around she comes back out and i've never see ne these people leave the office little on walk back to the carasol and she says wait here and she she disappears into the bowels of the airport which looks a superhighway done i wright god knows what it looks on anyth airport and pretty soon the carasol starts up again and my bag and another bag pops op this other poor shmok is in her wait ada'm i have never seen anybody do this ever normally they say hhere is a number will call yoin twenty four hours and might chow up at your house and i and i look around at the there is another young lady there and i say you do not please tell her thank you for me i i got ta go cause she she does not come back out for almost ten minutes and on my way out she she comes out the door and she hifies me she says how is that for way o it a magic wand and that was the magic phrase and i never would ave set it to her if i was not playful in a moment and i've got a couple of others when i was just playful and i'm joking with people almost at my expense it is shocking astonishing well you can get pupil to dofyou if you had in the right way interesting i wonder what it tapped into but it sounds it might have tapped into her sense that everybody's always asking me for a magic wand kind of ability but finally somebody just set it directly and that wev are not ot of fun to to actually play that roll because normally they are restricted to their keyboard an their phone eh i love that on the opposite side of that spectrum if ever youre feeling tense tress jetlag angry yeukw i can think about negotiations wear people are trying to keep their egoes incheck they want to be right that break ups negotiations it is ust not a se rly romantic break up that could include that but also professionall break ups in the the dissolution of a of a contract or something that do you ever have to check yourself ook et i needs it i man i imagine being calm is better than not being calm for most upmost all things im i d you have a process of doing that you seem ly a pretty steady i have never seen you i do over all an pretty steady im well wathe late night f m de g voice that i'm not sure that i coin the phrase but contofamous for to calm you down also calms to me down if i get ben out of shape em i will an a conversation couls heated i'll switch into that voice with the intention of of calming you down cos tat you not's the that is the hostere exotiator's voice but it will calm me down too lik intentionally going to that voice tamps down the negative emotions which i'm convinced make me dummer in the moment interfere with my capacity o process information got reasons for that layman's reasons no scientific academilic rerigorous studies that have been any journals while after you are done up an i tell you something that will perhaps be astonishing to you as to why there is real nurou science behind that late ni f m d g voice having an impacktd on other people's prancs but not yet and i'll do that as it calms me down now if i can if i can make the shift the hard part is to shift into a posit ove mind set if i can make that shift but i can only make it from a calm voice i also think it is the emotions are kind of a rock paper scissors sequence i do not think you can go from sadness to elation directly a sad im press doun i think there is something to getting angry to pull you out a sadness and i think if you are angry you have got o go to calm next and but if i can get out of anger and go to calm then i can say something o myself the reality is this is a luxury prob or i was in a negotiation with a counterpart that i knew was deceiving lying to me and i emember saying to myself and i'm lucky to be in his negotiation i mean i would not they would not be trying to hostle me if we were not really good if we did not have a product that was phenomenal i would not be targeted it at all i'm actually lucky to be in this conversation if i can make that next shift he mostily than i'm good the hard part is make anotious i meaning to share with you what i learned recently about sound and emotion im i'm researching an episode on music in the brain fascinating topic leaving out there is a lot known and the auditory system has this property where of course their nurans nerecells that responded different frequencies of sound low low frequency no deeper tones and i frequency squeals and that sort of thothat is pretty straightforward just we have nurans that responded different different colors are different a angles of light in in the room but what i learned and i confirmed with a good friend of my sta auditory ner scientist and and ner surgeons names at echang he was a guessed on the spotcast previously is that low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is that late night f m d j voice or responded to in the brain by nurans no surprise there but the frequency at those nurans fire is also low frequency in other words when you speak in your low voice the other persons brain hear's that and starts firing in a low frequency o in other words ittin trains to your voice not just the timing but it is actually you are essentially playing an emotional piano down in the low keys of there of their mind now when you go up to the high frequencies the nurans cannot follow that high frequency there is something special about low frequency sound that actually changes the emotional tone of the people that hear that low frequency sound this is wild right iing of course the content of the words matters too but any wy there is that there 's real norrow science to support the voice that you ere endowed with him that you a that you employed for your work well then and then also the point then to is it is not the other sides not making a choice it is an involuntary reaction that is right this is not something one can override except by perhaps plugging their ears right neitheir hearing that there their mind is getting shifted toward a state of low frequency oscillation which is one of more calm then yes that is a real thing and and werre you to have a high squeaky chipmunk's voice you might not have been the negotiator you at all the who knows maybe there be another tactic there i maynit i think back to the a what i guss it was during one of the gulf work campaigns whether they were not they trying to am squeeze out a sadom and some of a his people by playing milly vanilly at high volume for hours andhours is that tactic actually used m that that was that was a panama when they were trying to get noryegais itam i'm only a few a'm only a few countries o and i i an't notion or get the fand iways tell mou before and the wacky yet afastening useless information round tarism stuff that i tried that t at panama and and for whatever the mill itary guise they were plan music t and sounds and then also among h many stupid things that the if te i did a wako and late at night they tried that in the waco compound to and it was just there was one of things that the hostage negotiators were adimately against adimately against but they got overuled a by auntsing command among the many stupid things over done at wako that was also don at wake we stupidis conproductive hosters negotiators were always against it for those you do not remember wakco wako was a branch dividians a david corass ririt yethere was a a neflixeries tit was out about a recently that is fair about tha how hou went thow yes sad ending he eventually set the the building a blaze heiled himself in everybody else and a people inside set the building on fir including a lot of children pari including some children am theresm a epyagens that dove not gotten over that let you talk about some different types of negotiations a oftentimes i think because youre a former if beyind negotiator it te terris task force this kind of thing a btendefocus on the negative negotiations iht get the hostages away we will talk about that stuff a break ups business deals that have gone wrong a people lying cheating what about negotiations that are benevolent let us say that two people want to a come to it a true wind wind around what they each see to be their best interest in what is a friendship two friends taken a trip together acation who ise gan to pay for what whose gan to pay up front people in to pay each other back aor a romantic relationship two people are considering fusing finances to some extent or moving in together what sorts of questions should people be asking themselves prior to those negotiations in particular is it very important that people know exactly what they want going into a negotiation or i can recall many times when i've gone into life circumstances knowing i wanted a certain set of feelings or outcomes but not being extremely specific about i want this salary i want to live in in a west facing house on this particular location an exploration can of potentials a mi think can also take the former negotiation but how did how should people think about approaching benevolent negotiations were we are not talking about something tragic happening if it does not go through it might hurt it might be a bit high friction but stalk about how to get to a win win yet well is as couple interesting things are first of all in o the phrase win win a because win win is just great colliboration i mean point of fact it should be win win which might only be emotional win win now the phraseology win win i know that if someones opens a negotiation with me and they say right up the bad look i want ted to win wen do with you that correlates extremely highly with some one is trying to pick my pocket i if you use that phrase in the first five minutes i ready know where you come from you tryin to get me to drawp my guards you wen i lose and is came up on an instrgraund post i put up recent wyn which is essentially wat watch out for h person says wen wen not did not say win win is bad i said watch out for a person at ses it also you got to be cautious if if you some f the win win mind set and people set themselves up to just get slaughtered by the person is expressing a desire for wen wen and look in a pick their pocket if i feel win when my heart you go let us do wen wend deal if in a watch 'm all cay what do yout want and then i'v find myself given away the store there is a lot behind the wen wen phraseology that you have to have a complete understanding of in point tof fact both sides should feel good about the outcome and is not that the definition of wen wen whell kinossorter but it is how they feel about it more than really what they got in a benevolent negotiation among friends where we going to go to eat where we going on vacation what ruder we going to take people really just waint to be herd out more than anything else which operationally seems to be ununderstand how it is gon to make any difference makes all the difference in the world and how what is the best way for somebody to feel heard out well i'm ing to start out by telling you describing to you not telling you but describing to you what my best guess is on your perspective because it is really calibrating me actually finding out where your position is and the only way i can find out where your position actually is i'm in i'm in a increase you telling me if i start taking a guess at at first cause you are immediately right away ou he immediately going to tell me either 'm right or 'm wrong you are gin correct me correction is a is a satisfying thing to do and you are going to be much more candid with me if you are correctin me than if i'm asking you i'l and you'r feel good about correct of me it is going it there is all these great emotional lubricrance to me getting you to correct me unesto out by saying his his is what i think you are thinkin his i think you are approachingness is what i think you are wantin out of this out of this not what you should be but what you probably are based on your perspective and that is going excelerat the conversation expenantially it is ridiculous how much faster things are going to go and then it becomes both an ininformation gathering and repoor building procis simultaneously instead of separately which is what makes us approach fast or even though it seems more indirect if we are gettin read its say you anit get to thing a cart trip t ca a to san francisco from here and i must say ar my guess is you want to take the most direct rute because you hate wast ing time and you problgam say to me not i want to go up the pacific coast highway because tis beautiful stretch e a country i realize it is going to be waste of time if we go up the pacific coast cause we get a jump off it at some point but i really want to see the scenery you would have i've taken a guess or what you want and you con come back real quick and correct me and and maybe i'm thinkin time on the trip but i've forgotten how beautiful it is to roll up the coast and when you throw that i'll be our yeh it is a beautiful ide and we might not get into the shot who knows what is going to happen yet i know now now that we are haveng a conversation i'd rather run up the pacific coast highway before we before we go inland and make the trip and and that is how we get to a we collaborate for bettera better out come may be a better idea than what i had mine in the first place i love that because what you just described this hypothesis testing yes it is the way scientist or train yu may people do not know this but day teach us in sience not to ask questions but to start with a question how does it how does the brain developed for something and then you say a hypothesis and you test hypotheses and thye figure out ther right ar wrong and that takes you through a set of decision trees and you eventually get at what you hope as some cort truth a and an healthly others arrive there as well an you get at consensis i love the idea of hypothesis testing in fact when you said i take the most directr out from where we are now i inlos angelist to i san francisco i'm i to take one o one not the five the five is faster s i meanly think but i one o one first while their couple really great talko and hamburger spots along the way that i sat op an my bull dog an also get to see at the coast and it makes those extra two hours completely worth it and you are exactly right and i in that working through the decision tree does not necessarily mean u presuming that the the hypothesis is right it sounds you be equally o k with the hypothesis being wrong because really what your trying do is just learn and in learning set up ya collaboration a no couple of things first of all when you talk about hypothesis d when when my son brand was involved on a companies on is aton his own now but hes always say hypothesis test your hypothesis he always use at term dand even now lik ca we were talking about it and you jus said you knew some hot dog and hamburger places ar but a calli cow i did not even know that yend why yet i want to check those places out as how you discover new stuff in a conversation lof it and also i sire people are noting to not say the words wind wind when approaching indof negotiation what what do you think it is about those little catch phrases that that signal lack of authenticity or trustworthiness because you could imagine that somebody umight come to you and say hacrists lets a i let us do some collaborative thing for social medea for potcast and this can be a wind win for both of us now i know it i never say that with you but you could imagine that somebody really means that but for you it sounds it it is a flag that im theire tryn to pull one over it is it is a it correlates really strongly with the people that a deafnike tryno cartyour throat and i've had i'e had im admit that to me candidly mas i i'll be im i've experienced it thi give s mebody throws win went out early to me i'll say right i think i know where this is going but let me explore it and e'll a yeah this great opportunity for you that is another top and wogan put you in a room with all these billioners and it is goin to be all this opportunity for you if you just come in and speak and you knont we do not have a budget oh i've goten that one before the the famous that the famous a the world owere just work out in your favor es masi cause it is get a work out in my favor exactly right h't i've been othe receiving end of those offers many a time a fascinating conversely what sorts of open erse am do you think established the best reporter and a you'n a benevolent discovery of a topic but when i'm saing corlates real strongly with people i want to do business with if if they fig it out something that they knows valuable for me and they have just done it and thy've just offered it rodt off the bat no strings attached if they found a way to drop something on me that is valuable they did not approach me with their hand out they approach me with some sort of generosity i a av front of mine joe polish runs this i'll fid call genius niht work joe beliet sas life gifts to the giver am i jug that a bunch of favors for me before i ever joined and he was trying to help me out and get my books sold and he asked me to come in and speak and he would he would done up he would emphasize my book on his pot cass and a different conversations and i and i i findly pay te fee to join cause he would done much for me this not much joe could askd me fore right now cause he is done much for me that he gets a blanket pretty much yest right away what h what would want whut hin cause he' just generous and the generosity approach universally i'm seeing a lot of really successful peop ple to lead by generosity and if you start out that ifif you give me five storo e book on amzon no strings attached or anything that goes a long long way to somebody who wants to establish a long tum relationship o collaboration when i first opened my laboratory in a two thousand leven i had a technician at the time who 'd been a techniciam fom a lot o years and there is this culture in science of people borrowing things from laboratories and not giving them back or breaking them these can be little things a small instrument or a a forsteps but as a student or postlicke these of the thins that you cove it a really nice parafore seps is a great thing you drop em once they are not they are not good any more by the way it is ther ther o ant to treat them with respects surgical tools have to be treated with respect that anthese are very fine instruments and people used to come by our lab all the time and borrow stuff from us and he would always lend it out e what are you doing but any time i went to go borrow something he would say do not borrow anything from anybody else because then we are going to owe them right now everybody severyand als that you are running up or budget given away these instruments that come back with the forsteps dentine aven he said just trust me this is the way to do it and i do not recall ever could not quo cashing in on any of that but he was exactly right when i eventually decide to move institutions we would given away much and we would asked for very little may be nothing that it when you leave a place typically there can be a lottle bad blood and all we' got was sorry to see you go conhad it been me i would have been in a kind of a in exchange of o we aske for things we give things itsto have a neighborhood i gor up a neighbourhood where you would borrow eggs or milk from the neighbor remember those days ah o no if people do that any longer a but i think it falls well into what you are describing that when when you just do things for people i'm out of goodness then sure you sort of have a a history where you could return to that they owe you but there is all ja something good about just doing things out of goodness and also not asking for much em an expecting people to provide that i i love that and i actually uem i love providing good reviews for things i youkn on the phone when num the eir line that we do not do the sayme more we book our own flights but whutd any time i get help on the phone and if it is really great help i'll say how can i help unless i would mean a lot if you uld send an emal to this to my business to saying i i did a great job or and i act yul really enjoy doing that o em i love the points you are making because hey're very actionable as many of i've been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that they'r sponsoring the pod cast ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need end it also contains adaptagence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer ag one if you would to try a g one they will to drink a g one doc com slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitemen d three k to again that is drink ag one dot cam slash hubermen shifting slightly into the more em let us call them hi friction a negotiations or ther types ond negotiations where theyre it is the potential for a truly bad outcome rank em i know you have been asked tis before but some of oure listeners er going to be learning about you for the first time do you recall of the many negotiations that you did while in the efbii any one particular negotiation that felt if this does not work out this is really cotostrophic and would you be willing to share that with us well i learne to try to teach us early on that not everything's going to work out and the second negotiation i had not philippines a first one ayoung man o jeff shelling was grabbed by terrace group a abusiv and a enit up walkin away cause we we stale the bag ises long enough that we just some times if you can slow it down youl wait for something good to fall out of sky and it will and that id enough happening in that case ind a bad guy in's o callin the negotiator that i coached on a phone after was over the basically tell em that they still had a good relationship it was not a why is a bag i calld the negotiate a responsible friend losing everything and say anly good a good job which is exactly what happen we roll into a case a and i had not had anything go bad at that point of time e vanic case at burnham some barrel case a by different fashion of the terrace group thirteen months later in's up in am to the three remaining hostages shot killed by friendly fire on along the way a hostages hav been executed american had been executed early on and it was it was a train rack and lots of people got killed all on away and just really ridiculous bad things happening and that that was bad all the way throug a we learnt o learned a lie from it a went back and checked everything we did and we did not do anything wrong that we felt based on a stratagy did not did not miss anything and that was why in it up goin a claborating with the guis at harvard because my reaction was if this if we did everything we know how to do and it was not enough that means were not smart enough we got to get better and that case taught me a lot about the dynamactur really happened on the other side and the difference between you knowt whether ot peopleer really on your side the ase government was not highly collaborative a the philippine government was not highly collaborative the everybody wanted to get their pountof flesh out of the other out of the other side i mean just everything bad that you could imagine earlin on when garmusterbero a was murdered by the ebbusif it was a national holiday in t e philippines and the baguse had a history of killing people on national holidays and we were not fun of philippines and we had no idea that that day was a national holiday and we showed up at a philippine national police headquarters in manilla and it was closed now we got in ont ti got it on going hostage case with bad guise threatening to kill hostages and we show up at the gates and the gates ware closed and wen put the house going on he it was the national holiday and nobody's working today an mi first of all nobody told us that secondly i do not think the bagguise really care that it is the national holiday and nobody's workin our negotiators nowhere to be found we got we got we got a guy there that tham the previous negotiator we worked with philippine national police was not that happy that they did not have him under complete control they give us a gui that we will not tell us anything until after he is told them hes sad n't conversation with the bad guise and we are actually herein about him second hand he did not show up that day and then and of course that day the bagies announce are going to kill a kill a hostage and gibit is a gift to country the philippines cause it is a holiday and then go all by the way they doing this on holidays and an and germisterberry ant of gett his head cut off with the because of all thef warring factions on our side of the table not telling each other what thelse going on i had assumed at that point of time that people tell us the stuff we need to know we didn need to ask and and after that i got look there are not nothing here that i do not need to know i do not yor fitolidies coming oup in you soom i know you got to tell us really learned a lot about collaboration on our side of the table and also the lack of collaboration on the other side of the table juscause wer mest does not mean they got their act together and the bad guise did not have their act together and ultimately the hostages one of the reason sommon idn't come out because internally they they had double cross each other learned a lot about what really fundamental human natured dynamics arn teams and your tem has not got utsact together and the other theam does not either what can you do is a communicator to make up for that really learned a lot about that in that case i had cases subsequent to that involved ing alcito when al cita was killing people on a regular basis but we saw those commin and we did everything we could do to keep the train from smashing into us you see a train coming down a tracks it is coming down the tracks and you do the best you can to de rail itting sometimes you cannot i've heard it said that when people take somebody captive that they either want their money their body or their life or some commonation of those yats that is probably one of those three and it is very true and as the negotiator trying to rescue the hostage is it important to identify early on which of those three or which all of those three the'reafter houe serious they are are they willing to actually kill the hostage are they will they go for any amount of money above axs number of dollars iround jets figure out their threshold right i mean ecause the person is on the other side is gambling right their gambling there the freedom their gambling there u reputation with whoever their reputation matters to is it important to get into the mind set of the personeer negotiating with quickly using the hypothesis a generating method you ham and if a could you give a an example of how that played out in in your previous work at the am the indicators are really there i mean once you sort of a luseyour illusions about how you things iw you think things should play out the a patterns of behavior are generally pretty quick i are not clear and just cause you do not the patterns withoukita we recognize tha patterns and knowin what they are does a mean you can change what they are an alcit and two thousand forese time frim was very clear about kelling people on dedline and we had to recognize that that there there becomes a pattern of behavior and it is usually specificity in what they say and this it this is all this is all human nature if if if you are in a business negotiation and they say w'llcan do some horrible here wer gan a walk out n that is fairly non specific and if they say look if we do not get thi by this pespecific deadline if we do not get these specific things met by thi specific time that is pretty specific that its specificity you'e looking for it i learn to look for it and gednapping negotiation n we are working a case again in the philippins and a bag is say fi if we do not get a ransom for the sun seventeen year old boy at the time is kidnapped you tell his fathey's going to losin egg and at's the you you youphamism for losing a child and early on when that threatening through on our side to the table but he is all my got they ging to kill im and ofis is really bad we got to make sure the family can pay the ransom i'm nonin o now it did not hey did not say when it was going to happen they did not say how was going to happen they did not say who was going to do it the basic specipicity of who wut wen in wear they left themselves an out here a very clear out and we never said we were going to do it we never said when it was going to happen we never said woods child what they just tryng to scare i thrown out something vagu i sai we gt we got plenty of time to play with this we got it we got a pushis all theway through the process and to the end now later on in that case when the family tried to deliver a ransom and it was screwed up by god knows who the bag is came up back on a phone and they said if we do not get paid to morr your son dies and i sat right now that is specific and he is gui sound they mean it and we are goingto have to make sure thi tingoes down to morrow or that is the end o this kid nd at that point of time we allowed the family we were int a position to allow or thisallow we were in a position the awl for thoughts and our thoughts wer they mean it now and you need to do something now or likely something bads going to happen and now that ther tis serious cause you always got a worry about wwe's to refer to his a double dep tdo they take the money and then's and they come back and say now that was a down payment that was not the rant that was just the down payment you got to make sure you do not get double dipp if you let the family pay and you got to give your honest opinion is to wheten at the n at the hoage go if to payn now and our our thoughts were you pantemar you soncs coming out anythin the double dip is a scary thing to hear about a at a much lower level meaning more minor level a people sometimes get shaken down on line that they'r password will get taken thereae people everywhere who go for the click on this lank you get a tax message we have identified that your account has been change verify you click on the lank takes you some place where you put in your logging ind password and boom it is gone and then they try and sell it back to you typically through cripticcurrency because it is not traceable by the way those thise negotiations can be a lot of fun if you' let m i have well i'm hoping that our discussion about this now is going to save some people a the trouble of having thei'r they are accounts hact i've known people whoe have their accounts hact and these are some smart people but what is interesting is that i've also observed those situations where somebody gets to the point where they say i'm just going to gin what they want and i i remember in this one particular instance saying no noo do not give them the money because then the're just going to say they want more there is now there is no guarantee that they are ging to give you back what you want rightan why would they right if you think about it why would they the money funnels in unlec they just can pivot and go to the next thing how do you gain confidence that you are likely to be double dipped or not well first of all i got to find out if ithan a position to carry out the thread or the're any sort of legen position begin with you now for lack of a better tarments proof of life and theyre lot of people ar to try to scam you but they do not really have the ability to scam you she got to find out wo do do some confirmation do they ddo they have access o your count do they do they have you dat of they have your money ddo they have it in a position where they just trying to make you believe that they have that position of an influence on you they are lot of a lot of baguies out there that are just role an a die styling for dollars if you will and if they do not scam you when they have no levere ohn ya they will find somebody else that will give in there is a bit of you do not authenticity or or dare they in a position to do it and the same rule applies in any negotiation the other side is going to give in when they feel they have gotten everything they can kidnappers i'd be asked by an ambassador i asked by anif be i commander whins i's going to be over when the bad guises feel they have gotten everything they could not when they did but when they felt they did our jobs just make hem feel it sooner how how hard you make it innocently on the other side everybody evrbody wants to feel they did e they got a good days pay for a good days work if you let them feel their in charge and you make a mork by asking em innocent how in what questions which are very hard and fatiguing to answer then you are going to get to the point where youre ging to get a solid outcome where you do not get double depth and theyre gong to be happy that it is over cause they felt they got everything they could it could be a date could be your bank account could be anything the other side is going to be satisfied with the outcome when they feel they have worked for it and business negotiations just sellin your car and some you have put a price tag on your car and i goi walks up toe insists i'll give you full amount right now which your reaction i should ask for more i maybe i will not sell my car every human interaction yotherside wants to feel that they earned what they got and the idea of empathy in hostes negotiation is really just to make him feel that sooner con to come back to empathy because it is such a big and important topic but i've heard it said before that if somebody you do not know maybe y also somebody places a real sense of urgency on need the money now or a i need to ou do something right away or else am not a threat of physical violence but that any request for a expediting something is a red flag y that it is likely to be a scam very seldom do you need to click on the link within twenty four hours right i mean how could that possibly be right thbut we but that is one way in which people are exploited you am that some request comes in by thone or by emale or tax to her maybe even person somebody says you need to do this right now or else something bad as can hav capture people's sense of urgence i get them to make a mistake and then there they are left reeling because that request for something right now or else i think hits a fundamental nerve in us iu know e want o help to be a rescuer right m is that a good rule of thumb for people to keep in mind it did not i think that is your great rule of thumb i mean i a friend of mine a soebody got o hold of his fhone number not that long ago and a i gi was getting tac from his number look ma i gotsome r proms lo id i need some money from you now whs a friend friend's number and i remember when i first saw it actually if when i first thought i was really busy and i felt bad that i did not back that dhay and then i did not hear from em again an fatha we w atever was you worked it out couple weeks later i get the text again you got real promme got to get back to me right now i'm i'm i decide if it is really my buddy i am going to help him right now i got to make church really my buddy an i said ay man you did not raise this at all last time i sawin in vagus cause i'd seen him in vagus recently and he is ga i was busy i could not bring it up and something our there is no direct confirmation of the nile we had we had breakfast together vagus then i shoot back a iy and man i got to tay something that was such a crazy night and i still owe you money from them that night when we are gambling i i still owe you money i'm happy to help now it was not a crazy night it was breakfast and i did not o money and his next response was ye i do not worry about it you can make it up from to me with this mi gried cool se now i start makin stuff up and i said and when we were ith those strippers and that dog and the clown and the pony i'll never gget over that and now the guys would he talkin about and i said by the way and then i started thrown in some stuff about his wife and his mother and guy got insult thand calld me names and stop text to me and then i then i sent all those tex messages to the real guy including what i'd said about his mother and he tacted me back he is got a great sense of humoris ays by the way my mum does think you are atractive oh tet i but i sthought i stharted it all by just checking the source if it was my friend i would a help them immediately and i need to throw something at him that is going to confirm that it is him and then i'm there for him but i'm also going to have put a little bit of a curvin there that that if he does not catch i know it is i know it is the tin and then i'm goin half fond weathen incredible knowledge that people hear this an they might think oh you now that is never goin to happen to me but ike a said i am known family members and friends who they make the mistake they take the bat of clicking on the link and then now they are gtting the shake down i'm actually a good friend of mine said that her parents called at some point parents probably in their late seventys now im some one had called their house and told them that their child this woman had been kidnapped rand that they needed to send money and that if they called the police they would kill her or harm her and somewhat they started sending money and they were afraid to contact or and you can see what a bind a a loving parent would be in right they obviously do not want to get this child of theirs hurt and they obviously a willing to do whatever it takes in order to get the bactrine that as total scamp because eventually there was communication that made realized that that their daughter was perfectly oqut and ever even interacted with kidnappers shose kinds of scamps happen pretty often i hathet have not a friend also ye the sense of urgency but should have ben the first flag that is at that is a great point ye absolutely and it look look even if they have got you loved one the secondary issue is if you do what they want are they gon a lothm go which is actually a legitimate question if they really are badguage one of the things we learned in hossage negotiation that i applit of business negotiation there are legenmate question as ket ask ot you not being disrespectful you are not pushin back there is there are fair if you an't usy if bom fairlygenimate questions you can ask under any circumstances which is basically if i comply is jus going to work out the way that you are articulating it anything that adds communication into it which gives you more information to find out what the old timan i' come looks even in kidnappings how do that how do that if you pay the gon alautumgo that is a legenemate question there are example somewhere in between you kow getting your instrogram account hacked your bank account hacke and you god forbid your child kidnappe for instance a there is a whole practice withinthe legal profession of probing to see whether or not somebody is going to give up money to avoid a law suit for instance this is a i shae a lawyer friend of mine recently described their jaw very well he said in his words first person he said i scare people for money the operatyv word being scarpy that is been an ance bionac yet he is being very honest he scarce people for moneyis very good at it and a and heu understands how other people scare people for money and he works both sides a plaintive for defense type situations but nnow it made me realize that you a lot of the legal profession is not ocaye tha law suit slid across the table it is the oquet hears what the lawsuit would look here e all the statutes that potentially were were violated and then there is a probe of what somebody is finances are and we know how much they'r willing to pay and do they have liability insurance to they have an umbrella policy all the sorts of thing thatre thatare really it is not necessarily an illegal shake down but it is a probing as to weather or not t there is it is worth the effort fagnosing the other sensibility to pay your night and that happens really often i can give a specific example where a somebody had a incident at a dog park where their dog a a legidly ran into somebody may be charged at somebody a dog rt people are standing around and the person moved and an and apparently injured their neet but rather than the owner of the dog what they typically do is deliverer some set of documents that say i was a injured your dog was responsible for this am and if you do not settle up for ax number of dollars you can be sued for usually an exorbitant amount atand then there is this question that the the lawyers have to figure out is it puffery right are they saying hat omento you for four million dollars as there are not basis for that and good lawyers will say that is puffery there they are tryin to scare you with a big number but a lot of people see that number ago o my goodness what are they want i i do not even now if they were injured if they were that is terrible i'd want that taking care of if my dogs responsible i want that taking care of but what it what a tey need in order to make to this go way and that happens millions of times a day throughout the country and a good portion of those probably happen here in california because there is a that is gond the way the legal system is arranged that this is not somebody am it could be somebody menitlaying the law could also be somebody who is being entirely honest about the're experience of being injured by somebody else's dog under those conditions i man soundslay the same set of rules apply you want to know how serious they are do they have a case to speak thus the work of the lawyers but in te cessing how serious somebody is you said sit is fair you called at the eff word i that i'll never forget that it just ask a fair question that how much money do you think you deserve or a is that would noat be a good example of a very direct question a or is it am how likely are you to walk away if we do not give you the money it it sir i because i could imagine thre's all sorts of reasons why people would be dishonest about about answering those question well tenthen i how much money you think you could deserve a you deserve is is a really good questi in not necessarily what the answer is but how they answer it i yyou ging to get how quickly they fire back and whether not they stop and think about it how and what questions typically or best to judge the other side to reaction andy answer is secondary caus how or what question causes what we would refer to is a deep thinking slow thinking dannyconoman behavorleconomics thinking fastand slow slow thinking is in dept thinking you ask how or what question make the other side think first and judge ther reaction to how they think about it and do they actually do they actually think about it whor der they fire right back at you they give you a clearer picture of who you are dealing with where the outcome is going to go how much money do you think that you deserve if they immediately ou ten million dollars i tis is i get a shape don artist on the other side or they say i if they stop and think about it and they give you a thoughtful answer that is a completely different person on the other side you askin a question to get a to dig knows how they respond first the answer is second and sometimes i if it is a cut throt on the other side i'm an to start papron em with how an what questions just to wear am out that is passive agrestion if i if i got a cut thrughoat a gressoron the other side i'm ant to drop into passive oggressive behavior to slow em down and wear am out mone of my hostage negotiation heroes a going tome johnny piko was john to minico piko not not johnny johny rockets itanian johnny john to menico got all the a western hostage is out of bayroot n midage what a book called man without a gun i yunegotiated in person face to face with his bulla the only gang that ever did that got everybody out and in his book he wrote one of the great secrets to negotiation is learning how to exhaust the otherside and when you have got a really dangerous adversary on the other side of it ted we y u do not go knos to knows you do not argue you dn't you not combat if you wear m out exhaustion and if you get somebody really combative or cuthroat on the other side start papperin on with how on what questions cause it even think about the answer tiresom out and it is passive aggressive and it is deferential and it really works if the person on the opposite side of a high friction negotiation is aggressive the goal is to slow things down fatigue them ye and get them to just either relent or to reveal something that is that is a loopo ye ye if if i have to make tho deal then i'm going to wear am out i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endy and eh to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals

give away go to fitness fuels longevity dot calm to enter that is fitness fuels longevity dot calm to enter i'm interested in drilling a ltle bit further into this process of wearing em down and the passive aggressive way of reducing the aggressors stands and i want a highlight for people that what we are talking tout hear is i manipulation to extract something were aftyou tind abyu the reverse we are talking about a bad actor who is aggressive an trying to am defang that bad actor what is that process of of wearing em down look tere sound coul you give us a couple of examples of let say i'm the bad actor we could play this game i will not be very good at this am and i am saying lok i want ex number of dollars why this date or you are not gingto get what you want they are going to die ore disappear is that simple and i'm you no a stone wall kind of rapproach what is the approach that you take to wear that person down well what what a they aregoing to be hownd questions that a mostly hound what and there going to be teginimate questions which is how do i know you are oing o follow through what does it look i could fi do what you want how d i know your going to follow through get them to talk about the alternative o case if you were to whif you deliver by that date i'm in to pass them to you without fail if they are just getting kind of brief ansers where the person is just again this kind of rigid sto on wall approach yet well and there is a phrase at we use all the time vision draws dedecision if if you are really going to comply if i if i give in and when i say how do i know you can you going to follow through i'm not tart about the threat not trying to get you to clarify the threat trying to get you to clarify what implementation looks i need to know i'm based on your reaction to that if you plan on following through if i comply you will already have that in your head or be open to it vision drives decision you have fought it through in advance what thos letting the hostages go look if you would if you have no intention of ever release release in the hostage if i follow through then you not can to be ableto answer the question or yuan you polagno throw back on me really quickly and then now i know ourt you got no plans on complying if i give in you not got a comply i but you still want the money then i man ask well i must post to pay if you do not have any plans for complying and if you willing to entertain a conversation about what compliance looks there was a kidnapping that the my unit worked just before i was in it in venice a whaler where they were not entirely sure that the bag as rea the fark i think had had the hostage they agreed on an exchange point to let the hostage go that was some distance from where they had a prettgood idea the hossage was being held they figure then i gon to drag the hostage all the way this river crossing if the neck i'l let him go just too much effort and then it it was one of the few times i was going to be a signable theoretically a simultaneous exchange buth tegannaff sond e money across a river before the hostage was let go if we agree to this right sut an not can to drag this this guy all the way to this river crossing if they do not plan on letin em go and if it is a long way to drag em and they got their money do they want to drag em back even if they'r ambivilent once they get there if they have gone through all the effort to get to the meeting location and the hossageis there we have now just increase the chances significantly they gon to go aheadnt comply cause its pain in the nack to take m back this is all human nature stuff human nature and vestment how do you get em to engage in actions in behaviors and then verbal commentments that actually mean something to them when i was workin kidnappings the very last thing we would always have the family get the bagies to say at last not first but last wes we would actually get a verbal promise to let em go again at the end because we have been talking to em long enough at this pont of time we got a pretty good idea what they sound when they are lying in what they sound when they tell in the truth if somebody tells the truth they pretty much ten to tell the truth the same way every time if they tell the truth you talk to somebody long enough you got a lyine on do they ever tell the truth and if they do what is it sound people lie twenty ways they tell the truth one way we have been coach in a negotiations wit the kidnappers long enough that we know what they sond when they tell the truth whwhen they ask it the very ind if we if we pay you promise to let em go it is not that they answer but how they answered t and that that will be the last thing to seal the deal you now howd hy continually stack the ods in your favor for implementation do you have a bodily a sommatic senseor for lying of the reason i ask is years ago i had the experience of on knowing somebody and they turned out to be a generally good p erson but i sensed early on that something was off i could not relax around them i just could not relax around them and and i could not tell you why but it was as if my i couldnt even identify the nero an adomy of it you ame i say it was the vaguest nervous laynd but i teaching or anatomy and i cannot point to one pathway in the body there was something about my autonomic response that would just start cranking up when i was around them something as off as anything is of somethng us and iand i kid you not five years later five years later i discovered a series of lies that all rachetid together that we are actually pretty meaningless in the total context of things but i remember thinking at that moment oh my goodness my my system knew the knew and it for all my knowledge of narrow science i i cannot tell you to the sday what it was and in the in my biology but it had something to do with my bodily response it was not just a thought that does not quite at up wher i feel can gain the run around or or this it was it was a physical sensation are you familiar with that experience yeh well it is a little bit what you guise in your college are still discovering the science behind the got and what we actually teaching my company now were teaching people learn the difference between your got and your amigula for lack of a better time your feere centers and know which one is which and listen to your got your got is ridiculously accurate now where where does that information come from when your potcash recently i was listening to wo talking about ola factory tocuse rite the smouse i co never thought of t hat course yt ther e thum was a term for the u ther the molcules are you putting off that that oh fari myel a farmots what a poamo molli you ten 't get kicked out of course and that is why some of the great investigators i new would say i can jut smell it i can smell it what all is feeding you are got and what what are the senses that the science has not yet discovered you cannot you cannot make me believe i i will never believe that the life force stops at the surface of our skin that there is a energy and it we can pick up on the energy i mean our got is being fed by all these different in puts that we are aware of or that we have yet to be made aware of the tone of voice does not matchd their their words thethat the head telt youve got a super computer in your brain you are got is incredible if you listen to it instead of your fierce centers and as soon as you start listening to you are got you cannot explain it at the time but you got you ot a bad feeling in you'r got and later on then you saw it all at all came together where your brain was picking up these cues your your brain was probably when you 're in their presence there is got o be in oder somebody gives off when theyre when they are intentionally deceiving you do not you did not know that that anhat was dismoll and maybe you could not have consciously smelled to be you still picking it up long answer to i'm a very big believer in in the got i think there is science that we know and yet to discover that tells us that the got is just ridiculously accurate if we listen to it instead of our fierce centers i completely agree that there are on energetic exchange is that noro science cannot yet explain the field of nor science that is is starting to explorer some of these things on there is basically a three apex journals ththe most competitive journals to publish in science nature and sell and a i only mention that because there was a series of articles written in science magazing about magneto reception in humans the idea that humans can detect magnetic feeld sounds wuackery right turtles can detect magnetic feels they migrate by them actually long distances but the ideas that humans cannot do that and yet there are some well controlled studies where people have to guess about the orientation of a magnetic field and they do it better than chance not everyone can do it but some can do it better than chance in a way that cannot be predicted by anything else except some inherent form of magnetil reception in their nervous system there are capabilities of the nervous system that are starting to be revealed for which we do not have a lot of evidence but there is enough evidence to suggest that these things are really happening m the other example which you might find interesting is a lobit a were little less esoteric but there is a beautiful paper published in one of the sell press jeurnals a couple of years ago showing that when people listen to the same story the distance between their heart beats tends to be very similar now does not mean that ther exact heart rates are similar but if you look at the distance between their heart beats they all in train to the same rhythm the same song get this there in completely separate rooms the exexperiments are being done on complete separate days and yet if i were to line up just you that the distance between the the heart beats for you they would line up a set of columns or dozens of individuals listening to the same story clearly there is a passage of energy from we hear and things we see that goes into our nervous system at a level that is below our conscious detection here is the last thing i'll say about this we have a series on mental health coming out not mental illness but mental health m by the a wi think to be among the very finest psychatris in the world a doctor palconti and he said we all think that the forebrain is the supercomputer he said no the subconscious is the superethat is where the real knowledge processing is happening that is the iceberg below the surface where all the real heavy lifting is taken place and that people who learn to tap into the subconscious can learn to use that information in ry meaningful ways and i think that is what wy inscriving he is been on with you before right he has to talk about trama in particular and he was on lecx freedman's podcast as well the series that we are doing with him is not about trama per set it is really about the subconscious and the self i think you will find the series really interesting oand has a number of very practical questions that one can ask themselves about they are subconscious and and can work the process of psychiotry we are excited to release that series but it cause i do not know of anything it that is been put out there into the public but but i was pleasantly surprised to hear him say we all hear that the forebrain is the supercomputer it is what drove our evolution as i none non on know it is it is the subconscious that is where our real wisdom resides and the forebrain is just the implementation device it is i i an we can convince ourselves that ther were in charge i i' i cannot think of a time that my got told me eh and it turned out to be b neere often than not though i've suppressed my response right agot i override it thinking i think i made the mistake that you guos train your negotiators to avoid which as i thought well this is making me anxious in the anxiety must be me but this must be my fault r i'm not able to call myself in the situation im not sleeping well et cetera and and therefore this much must represent some deficiency on my part and then and lord knows as your shirt points out i'm i'm a very flod person i have many flouhs i always have three thousand petpeves and at least as many flaws to match hes i want to one at least relationship but i the point being that i think our bodies really do know they know ye yo ye i agree when you are doing negotiations and you are hearing somebody is voice on the phone they are lot of cues when you are face to face they are additional cuse there is their face and then of course if the negotiations are being done by text over a computerr of phone it is a very diminished environment f re information maybe we could talk about each of those because we live in those landscapes if t w're face to face and we are negotiating am you are listening of course to what i want what i'm insisting on you are working that process from your your side what ar you paying attention to visually it is more than are things in a linement there is laymon's data o ther words the way it' said and look on people's face and how are they weighe and how they play out there is a raso out there tha very un scientific seme thirty eight fifty five seme per cent word thirty eight per cent delivery fiftefi percent body language people ont argue about itall the time whether not that is accurate ie's a rule thom we throw that out there but i tell people the most important issue is do they line up i'm not going to look for whend you raise your eyebrow or wen you look up into the left i'm rely just going to try to get a got feeling wether i think these things are lining up whether there an alliement whether they are out a line and then i'm n to be real careful about what meaning i assigned to that kno a affective cus changes in your tone of voice changes in your movement wen that is one of the reasons why we do not teach reading people's body language because it is completely contectual to you and the moment i if i convince myself that you do not raise o the eyebrow means this it is out a context i was in a negotiation once whough i throughout a figure to somebody and i some con look off to side and look back and accepted my offer and i'm made the mistake of not saying to them the proprite thing for me to say at the time would have beend seems something just cross your mind cause yoeu only completely true observation if they looked to the side and look back something cross their mind now i read it at the moment of saying that they had more money and i found out after the fact that was wrong they were stretched to the limit the look of hesitation did not mean that they were holdin stucp they were holding step back but i read it wrong and i did not bother to check on the affective cue that i saw wone ar my babbling about what i'm babbling about is if we are in a negotiation and whether not i'm listening to your tone of voice or watching your body language or your words if i see you shift at all i should pay attention that there was a shift in your affectiv behavior but i need to find out what was behind it as opposed to make an an assumption as to what it meant see i'm going to watch only get my gut feeling and i'man to say sounds thar's some hesitation or it looks something just cross your mind or even if i cannot attributed to specific affective move i might say if feels to something in the way that is me listening to my got i'll threw out an observation on whatever any of those might be just to go back over the ground the little bit and double check cause the other thing about negotiating in person is you are going to give me more information physically than i can actually process and if you say something that is thought provokin i'll stop and think about it and while i'm stoping and thinking about what you just set i missin all your cues all the skills that we teach the labels the mirrors the opening to questions which seemed were going back and ploug on the ground again we are because i did not picked up all the information a first time there just more than than i can get and i need to go back over it a couple of times with you just i get it right without making you feel interrogated you actually feel hurd and you actually get to go back over it again it becomes what seems to be an inefficient process but it is actually me just doublesheck in my information for face to face i'm goin a but ask you to repeat but i'm not got to say would you please repeat that i'm an to gets you to repeat without asking you to repeat is the same true in an onliner text communications the same thing is truly tha the problem with on line of taxas people try to bundle everything into one communication the best analogy i can think of is if you'r plain chess by text would you put seven moves in your comyour text no you would only put one moveint only try to get one point across in a text do not explain do not throw a whole bunch of stuff an texter emales they are all almost always too long and it is going to come off is cold do what you can to soften soften it im is a documentary

done we go through this whole conversation in less than ten minutes now thing of the normal negotiation ay nick how are yo what is going on to day are you in a good mood ha hay ha how the kid's doing all this time wasting conversation fi to set him up with that normal he would also he could have legitimately said are you ote ind we have been working on this for year you did not bring this up in a year not only that you already told me two days ago at the ete showing and an vagust that you loved it and now a year you are and a half into this project you are bringing up all these new promis that would have been the normal negotiation but since i since we got a highly clabt of relationship i two line text we done in ten minutes now since next te very generous gy when he gets done and he says by the way you understand how much this gun a cost me is tis three weeks atuday this is three hours as shooting in three weeks of edity agr he goes but i'mhappy to do it calls him back the next day it is got a favorite ask or me you got does not matter what it is because we would gone through what would have been a very complicated negotiation it started on taxt and i sent him a two line text on a sunday and we get a salve that fast if i understand correctly by setting the context in a very direct and sussinct way wright he goes into it in a problem solving mode with you whereas if you do the the tour of all the things that are going well in life yee ye hav the sort of the well keep this a p g the the u the mud sand which approach now they teach you that when you get a lavri trit you' ol most scientist at ran skill running af business right you get a laboratory all you done is experiments and then suddenly yoar in charge of people managing budgets and all this stuff i m mean most scientists ninety nine present a sciencis a completely unqualified to do the job they do at the level running laboratory when they start you learn it on the job and eventually you end up having let somebody go and toy and the typical thing they teach you in these online training things is you tell some that hy something nice then you give them the bad news and then you tells something them something nice on exit ra it is granda ta the the mud to speak sandwhich right no right am this is not that what you are talking about is saying hey this is the problem you are nok in a the problem or there is a problem you are not in a it that they show up with the context of solving a problem i suppose to giving them the tour of all the things are going well and then the the problem is really in contrast to that and then it is you now say you what i love about what youre describing is it is it is it is direct it is honest you are not doing the a the tour of the garden before you take them down to the u to the sceptictank it is what i would call the difference between being blunt and being a straight shooter a strage shooter tells you the truth they just tell it in a way that land softly let us talk about break ups business break ups romantic break ups right you break in up with me nono am but thanks for the hypothesis test no a in fact i'm enjoying this conversation much as i always do i'm learning its one from you that am if anything i'd to expand and deepen our relation ther yala knowledge at am a platonic and an professional but expansiv am what is the process of ending a relationship and again this could be romanticallytiip could be business relationship could be employer employ could be individuals could be telling a whole group or an entire group telling an individual the reason i raise this as a particular example is that i'm assuming that both sides do not want the same thing one side wants to continue the other side wants to end i am i'll avoid the use of the word winwi n wored the words winwind excuse me and just ask is there a way to have that conversation in any of the contacts i just mention in a as you beautifully described it a straight shoot or manner where it is direct it is honest but it lands soft because what we are talking about here is feelings of rejection and nobody likes feeling rejected i doft know anybody likes being fired even from jobs they do not people's egoes soffer rain is there a may be at more specific way of asking the question is is there a way to encourage the person getting the bad news to get there ego out of the way and see that if both parties do not want it it is best for everybody involved i almost want to say no a but first hone of the caviats most of a time when pupilis struggling with this they not trying to save the other side tho try to save themselves o you really tryi to save by post poning at softin and try to ac a it is it is something that is not there i do not know that anybody has ever been fired that did not have a sense that it was coming the person that was getting ready to fire m opens up by saying how are you ithey know how the other person is and in a person getting ready to get fired has got some got instinct that things are going wrong you said the guts very powerful you got you got a lower the boom as quickly as you can but also as gently as you can i was involved in a non profit a number years ago filiated with church and we trynt struggling whether not to let the executive director go or go to the minister of the church norman vincent peals protege got i gy name arthur calliander one of the best human beings i've ever met my life phenomena gri and i'm struggling with i thought firing letness woman go was going t be bad and i thought arthur was going to countil me away out and and he look to mean he said there is there is no gentle way to cut somebody is head off and i thought ye ad the humane thing here is howdy to to bring it to conclusion as quickly as possible cause there is no humane way to cut somebody is head off there is no humane way in to terminate ther relationship now what o the caviets maybe there are first cavyad if yo cannot fire somebody never fire somebody on a friday fire him on a monday fir hem on a monday they got a work week to work their way out of it you fire him on a friday they got a week ind to be miserable an to feel horrible and they cannot do anything about it caught off guard or not on a monday they can pick themselves up they can start looking for new job no matter who you are fi em on a fridy they cannot start looking for new job on a saturday it is two days on misery yet you ging to fire somebody fire him on a monday not on a friday you got bad news ter give somebody warnament's coming the people are ridiculously resumiant to pain if warned and then that you lower the boom and i cannot what i have to say is gon to be heart breaking you canta hate me hesitate no more h'n three seconds they got their guard up let em have the bad news that is the humane way to cut somebody is head off do not make do not linger do not make em think that how the kids howare you i care about you your great human being note o stuff at the beginning warn em bad news is coming and had him with the bad news ripp the bandate off the pain is not if you try to rip the bandate off slowly that is excruciating you trying to save yourself if you ot to terminate a relationship regardless or what it is the quicker it you do it the less painless it is the sooner people can move on stop tryg to save yourself realize how human beings handle pain if anything human beings are incredibly resumin if givin the opportunity o brace themselves first i agree thank you for that there is a concept that a lot of people have not heard of and i'm confident in saying that because i had not heard of intil recently in despite spending a lot of time an the literature round dopamin and motivation and it is a term from psychology that it is being used a little bit more now and it is ego depletion yet it is an interesting concept and i've been wing to run this by yu for a while but i saved it for our discussion today it turns out ego depletion is a lot decision fatigue we'v all heard the steeve jobs thing he wore a black turtle neck every day because it he would nenhoue to when that desision we had more energy to make other decisions i've been accused of doing the same becaue of my black long sleeve surs but there is a whole other reason for that that u'm some people might know but hey way it is unimportant in the moment but ego depletion is a little bit different than decision fatigue or deecision but it u the idea with ego depletion it is prety simple it is that the molecule dopamean does not many things in the brain but one of the things that it absolutely does is it holds us to gol directed behavior that is associate with our sense of self i want to accomplish this i want to get to that and the whole notion of ego depletion involves the the idea and this has been a data substantiated observation that when people have to fight to be right or to defend their position for a period of time eventually that depletes and it seems to be at least in part dopamen mediated because defending one's position takes work you earlier you talk about running somebody down wearing them out and i wonder as i just throw this concept out youd a cold here am whether r not that calls to mind any a examples from your work where you felt ocate this person could really hold but if i just kept pressing eventually theyd tilt i and it is different in the kind of fatigue that comes from a conversation that starts at three in the afternoon and ends at two thirty in the morning we have all been there i've been in those conversations usually they are not very pleasant and at three on the morng everyin's pealind apart you just i've learned over the years yeclipit at nine thirty and you trying shift right he kno one of the worst pieces of advice i've ever heard am is you would never go to sleep angry bu no atually a actually get sleep wake up and then revisit the problem if the situation allows that is my a that is my i'm verym ya a try to stay up all night trying to work something out is just counter biology ego topletion am i've a feeling a lot of what you did in your profession was am running down there dope men to the point where then they are operating from a different place where they are not defending the ego they are actually thinking more practically about the whole situation is is have any kind of texter of meaning to ye no i would ii would agree and i would draw the distinction a first of all in hostage negotiation there is there is two kind of hostage takings am if there is a demand a an is going to be contained and uncontained which is just literal definition contained is bagases in a bank at the chasebank in brooklynd way back when you can n'm surrounded they cannot get away an uncontained is a kitnapping you knon't now where they are uncontained on a location we are going to try to get our way and i contain situation probably by ego dopletion were 'n amount gettin to the point where they just i just i just going to givankas i are tired cause the goin to come out were oingto put handcuffs on which means that if the egle gets recharged they goig o go back in tor think theyregong to think back over the deal wherein somebody out o business negotiation it is basically uncontained because even if you come to an agreement there is a whole implementation phase they gong to g it did you did you get you agreem toyu warm out cause they get tired cause he just gave in at some point of time they aregoigto get recharged and theyr going to get recharged where you'e in implementation they either going a nockon o follow the terms of the deal or it is the slightest opportunity they aregoing to deviate and yet i think egle depletion is is a real thing and it is a bad way to get a business deal that is going to stick cause they rest and than they come back ye i different person yeye're they going to be recharged they are egle's going to be recharged and if you get the if you gt the agreement based on a depletion of their ego that battery's going to get charge back up again well it is a business deal with its personal negotiation you do not you have disagreement we the significant other who and you you follow that bad advice do not go to bed angry and you stay up till three in the morning and you think you come to a resolution but he gets a good next sleepn next day they feel completely differently about what they said the ight before i might have heard of that happening once or twice its ought to move your yes hnte tim of ya a friend explain that situation to me u earlier you mention approaching a conversation in a playful way rang all right this might in't be life or death but let us play thits a game because you can see more opportunities now we know that when we are relaxed we see the big picture when we are tense everything never ons wat is your tunnal visan tunnel thinking tonnel everything we lose occess to the full tool kit im you always see take really to carry yourself you are fit youre in shape you alway seem calm i'm sure ou have your moments anybody else but what are some of the things that good negotiators do all the time that when the bell goes off and they have to respond they are ready and the reason i ask is is because we have been talking about negotiations in kind of a vacue it is happening and how does one handle it but any athlete any teacher any parent any kid everybody has to be ready for real life circumstances and we do not always get the warning we do not get the memo that it is happening in two weeks and a sometimes the conversations around courtroom drama or the big day it implies that we we get the warning but more often than t od it is a phone callor a taxon that comes in in bon it just hits us and suddenly we are in negotiations and we did not get time to prepare may we could talk about readiness and then we could talk about again maybe the as sounds trivial to you but for me i' be verycose to know whether o not you have any practices of stilling yourself what those look what you have seen other people used to to be able to get themselves into the moment of being able to show their best self yet well readiness a small stakes practice for high stake's results i i will occasionally find myself in a middle of the negotiation that i did not expect i if i've been thrown out stuff on a regular bacis on my way during the day am furbal observations what we referd to his labels ciuzle of the label seems something just cross your mind is a label in a middle of the negotiation when i see you hesitate or look to thi side how are you ready for that now ii'm i'm on my way over hre to this interview i'm both talking o my lift driver the whole wag in him to talk also being careful about not happen te gas tank out completely that i'm fatigued when i get here lik i talk i talk up the lift drivers on a regular basis i am osinteractions teas agas and eairport i'll throw a label at him seems a tuft day tuft day seems it in a good mood and whether right or wrong i'm i'm getting in i'm trying to stay loose i'm trying to keep the mental muscles limber and it just becomes a bit of a habit on a regular basis a occasionally i'll throw something out an ii'm talking about lift drivers i c fim in a bad mood i get into a lift couple of weeks ago on my way home lift driver is not helpful i mean i'm coming ou the airport i'm struggle on my bags not lift in a finger does not open up the rear i got open up the rearo the vehicle myself or got a load the bags everything i get in and he is just seething unhappiness now i know that if i say what o you love about what you do for living i immediately trigger what tony robins would call a state change and i'm annoyed at this gy and o you knowr are farmons ar combative but i'm thinging ijus ijeston need this and i go what you love about driving for lift this gi proceeds to unload on me on all his personal struggles then i feel a complete jerk for being anger at him everything that he is going through and i'm just trying to get myself out of bat out of a bad mood and to keep from sending him a really negative vibe the whole way that he does not drive forty five miles an hour and a sixty five mile on our lane and make it inflict me with longer and more expensive ride because i'm annoying is a customer but i've got a habit of small stakes practice for high stakes results and who do i get a practise on the lift drivers on a regular basis to guy behind the konare at the hotel o the t sa gai i am going through t say the grocery store clerk the starbooks person the only way im mat my best on my negotiations is is trying to keep my negotiation mot muscles limber i interacting with people throughout the course of my day and an ideally you do not leave him better than i found him an i'll try and trying not to leave negative carma an my way tryng to leave as much positive carma ind my wake as possible i love that u and i'm very familiar with the feeling of needing to concert my boys for podcasting or energy for things and yet i'm somebody who is he think genuinely curious about what people's experiences areself i the question how is your day going it is pretty open ended it is i suppose if somebody was really upset that would be perhaps the worst question i could possibly ask from what you just described but we do not put a fine point on it too because i'v manipulate him with what he love about because there is it you watch them change in the moment to immediately to shift into this concept of love which is more than woutd you about driving frt lift woutd you love about drivin folift i i can trigger a staye change in you instantaneously no matter what kind of moodment cause this gy was in a very bad mood plus additionally the download from that typically is quick i mean to get a real clear picture on who you are really really fast i'm talking to a see you of a company couple of months ago there there the for lack of a better term than deliver in clean water to the world and im ie that is a cool mission i dig this is an auntro penoore an aunt youe been more want to make a dent universe i dig that i i'm trying to make a difference in the world i say to him what you love about what you do for live he immediately fires back o me i love leading teams i love leading teams and i love given sherehold is a great return on our vestment it is really important for me to give sherehold is a great return and then ye we deliver water and then he set a for thing and i thought this guyt could be doing toilet paper he does not care about the mission of a company at all he is a great see you probably because you want to see you to lead teams you want to see you deliver a corporit s ou to h deliver a returnol vestment for shareholders but that is what he is a great corporits y and not a great antro pinorlsy by him givin me that download ro quick that was blatenly honest i do i think this is a great guy yeh do our cor values line up my mission is more important to me than his mission is or his mission is makin money now i making money but it is not number one it is a strong number too but that quession instead of how are you to day to what are you love about you immediately put him in a better place plush you get some ridiculously candid answers that tells you who they are real fast what is the best way to approach our response to somebody whois asking to be heard perhaps they have got complaints a theybe about us maybe about somebody else ont people are venting people seem to very on the propensity to vent espectrum somepeoplee just they vent all the time this happen that happened and you knowhen they want to complain the a the way it is sometimes describeas they love to and take other people's inventories they love to take inventories of everybody else's mistakes they did this they did that m it is it is a lot easier some often than taking our own inventories ofof what we could be focassed on and do better that is that t's the universal truth in my mind but you non't people approach other people that they trust and they want event presumably to get over whatever it is that is bothering them but all too often it seems to just amplify the feelings of frustration what o you do when somebody care about n that cares about you comes toet event is it just you let them you let them vent or to u do you try and let them negotiate with themselves little bit in a way that can help them more than if you were to just let them vent i'm really leory of letting people vent because a lot of times it us they never it seems to be aspiral that ju spirals out of control howto why somebody venit they do not feel heard they feel ignored if yoe tove been wasting er time talk they are frustrated that is the feed back im moingto give you feed back on what i'm guessing cause is causing you to vent in just an observation i it is sounds this is is to trive new crazi cas nobody listens to you sounds i geven struggling with us for a long time sounds this as very frustrating for you what is the emotion the particular negative emotion frustration is about somebody being denied a goal in future angeris about somebody is upset about some happen in a past the type of negative emotion begins tha focus you win on where they is it forward thinking or is backward thinking and frustration and anger can be too very different versions of the same negative emotion but their focused on different points an time i'm going to try to intuitively if i don'i do not know from what you have told me i min a start take an educated guesses on making an observation on what it is to drive in you if you need devent youve been talking and people been ignore ng you or you have been taking actions and people have been ignoring you ts at you need event because you communication roactions have been ignored there are some cluse here and the sooner that i get at the heart of what is bothering you the sooner you gen to be able at at of i'm goin to encourage letting the steam off without trying to have correct you without giving you advise without frustrating you by not listening to you by trying to recognize verbly with some emotivators are which will deactivate the anger much more quickly it is the whole basis for crisis hot line to begin with people are venting and how do you most effectively vent somebody that instead of going on a ran for an hour and the rant introduce toxenton to their system rather poisong themselves i think negative emotions put toxins in our system you knw how to i deactivate that is quickly that you not hurting yourself as much and and you you feel hurrd you feel relieved you feel listen to m in inthin involves me if it is a close friend who is venting to you you are involved in a situation to some degree and i might even say but it feels you probatly frustrate because i have not listen to you to now yoau omin a tart start taking some emotionally educated guesses on what i think is driving you and i'm at put in the form of label which is just an observation seems sounds looshlike then if i get it wrong and you go less not at at all i can say well that just a way it seems it just seems that way ou put you in a position jo tojust let somebody know you see em an you are doing your best understand i'm i'm not a fan of venting i if if i go on a rant personally i always feel worse i want to deactivate that negativity an get get my feet back under me emotionally very useful now lege i intershared with us do you meditate i tiny little bits i mean a in trying to make my day more effective i have a gratitude exercise that i do almost every morning other ways to make myself effective actually i'm looking at the non sleep deep breast practice or the because i you n i i to make use of my time and and iam spiritual umi'm talking to the almighty on regular basis you pray i do ye the morning and night when you need to both yet both i mean i think you knont whether not you believe in one god or a the universal whatever it is i think spiritual spirituality is an important component of health whatever you spirituality is you should recognize it and you should you will be better off if you engage in some sort of spiritual practice does not have to be in either three major religions but spirituality is component who we are ye practiced or regularbises sense of higher power or to better defind higher power it could be as you said with alined with conventional religion or just a lined with the idea that there are things outside of us that are important to pay attention to that we can all do better by being in recognition of our service to or were both esomething i ve do pretty much that and and an leaving is is openi is as possible cause er i think there is a spiritual answer to us purit i agree what about your physical training i i must say yeur you are an excellent shape imagine that when or along with the f b i thing i and i saw silence the lambs at the beginning shes running around a with other on agents h a shooting targets and running and lifting into an their sit ups in there that was a it was nineteen eighties film says wat dated now proly now that they are do another stuff as well am but nothing nothing worse the basix im was the ef be i the first time you got serious about fitness or prior to that where you are and were you and athlete and into fitness and what you doing now adays to maintain your frankly impressive shape am bu thank you for the compliments am i wul a sports athletics fitness was always a part of my life i was he indisports but not particularly good atam a football basket ball a the i'm a last century gui what long before the condition is i invult is avolved as it is now with interval training and an arrested a stuff which is phenomenal you kno waiht lifting was introduced in my high school my senior er i lifted waiht some continued for college a little bit of time in a marshal arge rit my knee apart and college in the marshal arts but ye have fitness has always been a part of my life is much for liking to be in condition and in o spiritual regeneration of it whether i knew what it was or not om these days aund on looking for every hack there is i know you do not te term a hack well e lat we mechanism scientis mechant yes ye a hack sort of implies that we are using one thing to cal for something different i mechanisms but the end of the day if speople want to call something a hack because it gets them the result they want or that they are mere it is more appealing to to apply the tool that is what matters to me ut tools sitting in a boxdon'e do anything people using hem that i'm good with the term yea what these days cold plunge son a principally i'm struggling with issues with a couple of joints that i know since will eventually help me regenerates in the meantime good diet yoa the basic pillars diet a not a a ye not a perfect diet but by an large over all my diets pretty good am and then o thathe little little things spiritual keeps me in shape physically a itn a cold plunge ais is challenging psychologically and physically and a sultao shifter there ads for sure and you do not need science to know that a three seconds or a minute in that cold water is gong to change your chemistry for a long while afterwards and for the better i believe yeonce you get out people forget thas they i hate the coltheult the point is not how you feel while you are in it you can feel proud of how you navigate that portion but the point is how you feel afterwards wy the old the old sang why do you heat yourself in it in the hand where the hammer as it feel good when you stop i that that a spoken somebody worked to new york city for a long time a out here we prise say something different am hea a crystals in lava lamps or something althoug ther are many lave lamps any more i think that the idea that california is all hippy dippy that that is not true any more i think it is been overrun by by other a different yethels in any of that am thanks for sharing that because i think that we cannot separate the physical from the psychological right o me we have been talking about the mental and fatigue status of the people you are negotiating with oftentimes during this conversation but then of course there is how you show up to the job imean if you are run down three days and you have been in a fight with your spouse and that is still in the back your mind and your am an your hungry tired sick what m not connected to your higher power all that sings that there is no way you can be as effective at any job it it is great to here and not surprising to hear that you have a bedrock practices that you you implement spha's interesting point almost everybody i knew t it was really good and ything they did for living they probably took pretty good care f themselves yew i agree there is this that the language around self care yet i think get's really distort it i'm an editorialaze for a second o i think it but i'm an editorializing line with with what you just said you ni think self care sounds naval gazing where people think that it is all about self but it is actually taking care of oneself that we can show up better for everybody else a more energy more capacity more staing power to have those hart conversations with the people we care about and that move our life forward it is really refilling the the fuel tak in my mind i sopposed to the kind of a egocentric norsisistic stands tat a lot of people take towards that they and and i understand whyt they do you kow people scroll through insram an they see people self being every every muscle and in all the scuffin s ant i'm not disparaging what people want to do but but the end of the day self care is about being more ready to do better for the world if youre or if your missionary anto agree completely agree do you think there is been a change in the am f b i a over the last three forty years around that i have this image in my mind of agents sitting in cars for twenty hours eating hogy sand which is and an now looking through bynoculars and running themselves into the ground with this kind of bull dog persistence to tto solve the puzzle m put differently i imagine there are some negotiations that were very long and fatiguing am did you recall one of the longer negotiations that you had and how do you sleep at night midway through a hostage crisis long as one then i was i was directly involved in on almost they to day and ourd our one when when about three ish days morsinids a two thousand three start of th second arac warkind an dwy wats and roll the tract ins the med se and claim to et fourbombs and le fourbomb scattered around the city had he actually done that er he was just calmed he was bluff he was bluffin he he had not done either ant start on saint patrick's dane gont interesting a cot yono i the the thing in e that you said in was in of the philippines slike national holid and holiday riht interesting a for whole bunch of reasons now i and an i had to go home go to sleep a when one night and when we arein the middle of that and then it was jus i do not remember having trouble going to sleep because i felt a did a good job and at we handed i handed the shift off to another hostage togotiate for the bureau was effectively the team leader vine staffon and vince was brinning negotiator and the team that he was with i everybodyw's in good hands is matterfact vince almost kicked me out of t scene cause i do not want to go when he just kept hand go and get some sleep go hone get some sleep and finally the fifth time he said at the man went home i felt i was leaving a things in really good hands and we work in kidnappings we expected them to go for long perids he time ans just connagot a it if you have faith in a process and you feel that you are doing the best at can be done and then i think he could sleep at night i ges to answer that question you you have to be careful whether you are working a a case o siege or anything n in in the bureau that you do not run yourself into the ground and there was some cases at worke in a nineties where i mean we we knocked ourselves out we would we worked harteinebody we ever saw but we occasionally we took time off too and i worked with guyse tat realized that sometimes you had to go out and have a beard kick back and blossome some steam i think everybody that i ever worked with we are occasionally cautious enough to recharge the batteries and then depend upon the nature of the challenge in front of you ire was a siege in saint martin's parish and wen six days i do not think those guyes got a lot of sleep that the nature those sieges in that particular thepesiege only last five or six days anyway you just got to got it out were there ever instance his where you just try to keep the person on the line they can just rad i i neve i never had to do that personally you had to be prepared to do that from the very beginning of any siege that you might have to get some ouyou might have to orchestrate on assault of some sort i was fortunate enough early on of my training there is kind of a famous siege in if hostage negotiation history in london called the princes gate siege where o alegendary british hostage negotiated david veness had the bad guyses on a phone while the sa s was hidden hidd the building and remember that we were shown look there mayb come a time when you have to keep somebody on the phone when swat comes and that goes with the territory expect that is a possibility from the very beginning and it was a great siege the bad guy salene the photoes of him after he was shot the phone is within his reach david kept him on the phone i've heard the tapes the a breaching explosions were going on and il slimp says i got to go i got to go their suspicious noises and david venic and his classic british accent said salene there are no suspicious noises now let us get back to talking about how many people are going on the bus to the air poy ban and and he went in and and i caught up with david a number years later a had if pi pri had presidential intern from the white house in turnil with me in the bureau we are drinking in a bar with david vanass i had a lot of stories where i'm drinking to bar with somebody and in turn walked around everybody and tap david on the shoulder and he says a chris says you kept the taraston a phone up to the moment that the essayis came in a door and david says yen i kept em on thephone even longer if the essay issaid had not come in ssoon why my telling that story if you'e going to get into that line of business you got accept all the things to go with it and realize that it is not you that made the decision somebody else did you get implement the stranegy do you remember it case a in sacramento where a i think it was a youth gang they a took over an electronic stored guis seech yet i remember this when i was hid and i two things that rink that stand out of my mind from when i was a kid one was the good g guye was the name of the electronic store right good guise is lectron store and a bad guise us to speak went in there took them hostage and i must been a kid this must haveben late at les a late datysa ey something that u i remember that case ims aabout nineteen ninety welate or eighty nine or ninety i knew one of the negotiators i was actn was morning seventy five and as i recalld they ended up opening fire on a munch of hostages who were laying down on the ground i's that right they they they knew that they were getting ready to execute the hostages because they put bags over their heads and that whenever the bad guide do any thing to dehumanize the hostage it is ease you to shoot somebody with a bag over their head then it is not you cannot see their face and the bad guise had begun that process and they knew they needed to assault god forbid any one should ever be taken hostage i realize circumstances s differ but you just mention putting bags over their heads there is this notion of sheeple that people will describe am post talk after something about how somebody walks into a building tells people that put zip ties on their own ankles who are going to a back room that nobody resists and that in ratrospect had somebody cause a commotion they might have caused enough of a commotion to either run out or be let go am and yet of course there is a very logical part of everybody's brain i would hope the things listen this person is an aggressor there is a gun in my face do not be an idiot right cause it i we also have heard of the case in new york city that read about this in the newspaper presumably it is true a ware some one was held up a gun point in one of the women in the group that was held up sowhody can do shoot us and the person shot rangs out that happens to im i do not kow if there is it a fair and safe answer to give people on this but if you are told to do something by somebody and it is t all happening in real time i mean you have that ask do they want my money n my body my life or some commination of the three in real time while under presumably significant do rest im but for hostages buk if they if they disobey cause a commotion is that extending their life or is it shortening their life i guess it it is very context dependent t o the only thing that i coan without knowing the contet anything you could do to humanize yourself and comply with what the bad as want i increases you chance of survival let us see gat order to go in a back room you could look at the hostage taker and say i'll do whatever you say i'm cruss you do not drop your name on them in a way that you go from being a faceless person to somebody with the name that increases a chances to survival humanization whatever you can do to c ply simultaneously become more of a human being because it is the opsettle what i was talking about before if you are easier to kill if you have been dehumanized youre harder to kill if you have been humanized you are harder a harm may be then i can to kill you theye just goin they are just gone to hart you they are less likely to harm you if they know your first name how do you get tis a hostage negotiator if they if they talk about a hostage i i'll say yyou know you mean you mean sheeler dyou mean raxs gan i i'm i'll find a way to drop the person's name into the conversation soon as if if you can humanize just by giving them to know your name you increase the chances of survivability increase the chances of being treated better it an'd comply i'll do what but i'll do what every sampcress i's going is going to start te move the outs in your favor t at what you descript described extends to a science im i've talked before about my stands on animal recearch and a why i choose to no longer do it i i do think it has its place in making important discoveries that cannot be made on humans but that eventuall extend to but you do not want to do it i do not want to person i do not want do it and i do not want to primate work or large carnivor work or small carnivore work but on the point i was going to make is that when you do primate work im they strongly discourage your forbid you from giving them names frang geve numbers right riht right right right it is t it all falls in line with what you ere what you are talking about cause the moment something has a name it moves from being a research animal to a pet of sorts and that makes it a relationship right interesting how a name turn something from a you kow it elevate something to a relationship however insignificant it it is up a notch and into our empathy circuitry dh which is a perhaps they appropriate segway to talk about ampathy this is a topic that a you spanlya las yeu you a you mention tactical ampathy right ocument hou by the way when is that going to be out or do we have some sense my guess is a we will finish jump an throug all the hoops and probably have out at the beginning next year were a i'mcurrently working with ln morse en deavor on a couple of different projects they have been enormously support of and we have asked for their guidance on how to haw to the best time to get the doctormentary out and very happy with the people on dealing with their and actually stroke of te universe was looking out forme funny sat o circumstances and just really enjoy with the people onn working with their probably first partof next year fantastic what is your take on empathy i think of empathy and the pop culture sense of somebody is feeling pain and we feel their pain but of course empathy extends way beyond that ye ye ye and that wasem a rramalanka ye my you olli get stamford yes i was i as really fastening by the conversation a you you had with him on that recently and n he seid a lot of people you ympathy a lot of different ways sort of for their own meanings my take on empathy tactical empathy also to keep tron names out because people give me thoughts and i'm one a sorce amount ian i'm very close to stephen collers prospective on it stepheno say empathy is about the transmission of information compassion is reaction to the transmission i that and by the way i'm afand of stephen's work i think he i think he is quite a stut and a boy is he a hard work he writes a beast i ganly help it for in the morning els has fifty chawa was or something crate bat he is awayin the doors ye ann arly t will ium fit more chaaas in he room then others got ya stephen ey as a and and that was when i was with th p i was started collaborating with harvard because the harvard definition om was empathy was not liking the other side it was jus demonstrating and understanding their perspective a bobmanucan's book beyond winnings chapter the attention between empathy and assertivness he says h empathy is not agreeing disagreeing or even liking the other side which sort of falls into what stepheng talked about un it is about the transmission of information now impathy is very compassionate thing to do but it does not necessarily equate to compassion itself if i'm imif i if i let youif i make you feel heard by me saying to you what you are perspective on something is you gan to feel cared for you can a feel understood it is gon a land with you really well i do not necessarily have to feel compassion for you i know it is a precursor to compassion i would separate it from sympathy clearly and i would even sympath separate it from compassion although i know it is a very compassionate thing to do it is about tactical empathy is about me actively demonstrating verbally to you that i understand where you are coming from tactic from the experience han hosses negotiators bact up by nor science is hit people largely react negatively the smarter move for me instead ofe trying to reinforce a positive is the first deactivate the negative by symply calling it out calling the elephant a room out do not deny the elephant do not ignore the elephant call the elephant a room out say it probably gan a sin i'm greedy if i expect that you are goin to think i'm over reaching and i can say i want you to think i'm greedy n i say is probably in a scene greedy simply well educ ated emotional intelligence influence got instinct influence on what the other side is thinking and feeling if i can define it in that way then it becomes an unlimited skill if it requires me for to have compassion for you when i do not then that limits my ability to use ympathy and i'm not interested in having that ability to be limited i wanted to be an unlimited skill if you just if you disdefine it strictly in terms of transmission of information then it is not sympathy your compassion or liking or green it has a very powerful effect it at least feels compassion to the other side it reacts with the emotional circuitory the nerro chemicals that everybody has to some degree if they are alive even if there on this the spectrum they have some of that going on inside and of what i've read uneven even a mental illnesses a in my last century training i saw people who re paronoits gets aphenic is a effectively be more of a wiring problem tan a chemical problem for for a layman's description and a lot of what i've read said empathies even effective with parnoits gets aphenics people regardless of how disarray the circuitry in their head is it is a it helps them on some level to feel understood empathy is just about maning somebody feel understood example when i'm i'm workcin terrism we had a lot of arab muslims testify an open civilian chord against a a legitiimate muslin cleric who was also a criminal wo also committed crimes and i would sit down with him and i'd say tom run off the bat cause i know where they coming from you believe that thereh's been a succession of american governments for the last two hundred years that have been antize lomine and theyd look at me in a go y i never said i it was true i never sat ir greed i never said i disagreed by me simply articulating with their prespective on the inter action was they were startled by it it was ympathy and and av we were good at that impathy frequently in at in that time frame they would say are you are you muslem and itsi know i respect a religion if you need to know at i'm a christian but i respect your religion and i i got no problem saying to you where youare coming from that is ympathy from my definition and then it becomes an unlimited skill i i do not have to feel it i do not have to necessarily one to do anything about it goman says there is cognete of ampathy me just recognizing what your emotions are coming from there is emotional ampathy me feeling your emotions and there is empathic concern me want to do something about your distress my version of tactical mpathy probably brings those into play and seek whence on a continuum of sorts but none of them are precursors it just me showing to you that i understand where you coming from and it has a phenomenanlly favorable impact on the interaction tell me about mirroring as a tool yet mirroring is a one of the simplest easiest o and most effective of the skill tat takes the least amount of bran power it just repeating one to threeish words of what somebody 's just said a can be one it you should never usually be more than five hostage egotiatoers learnit by repeating the last one o three words of somebody is just said it does not have to be the last one o three words and a mirroring is not the body language merits not mimiking anybody physically and it is not mimicking their tone of voice or their affact or anything about him it is just repeating one o three ish words we found that accesses for whatever part of brain you a that you got energize to do it it is it is a different part of the brain than labeling people are usually the good realy good labeling ii label imust everyon my team labels a lot sounds this is bo than you sounds seems you just not redy sure wore this is goon and the mirror i get a consciously make it a point to mirror and what is a mirror use for it is in place of what did you mean by that or would you please go on or i do not understand could you repeat that again i'll listen for stuff that either i do not understand or i need you to talk more about and instead of saying could you say some more about that i'll just mirror of the words now for whatever reason it connects the thoughts in your hat the message the way that lands is i heard what you said the words i got the words cause i just repeated im and i still do not understand i need a more indept explanation without using the same words that you jisused because of you say i think actual prass actual prass is em is useless and i might say would you mean by that and you go i practivs them is useless you repeat the same words only lotter you figure that saying at latter will make it penetrate my cranium that does a work i need you to read to explain to go into more adapth to expand using different words and for whatever reason we found as hostes negotiators and i find i business that if i mirror you you will expand and you'l connect it is if i use it in that context i might use it to get you to hear yourself out loud iff what you just said does not make sense i'll repeat it back word for word wen to three words and all upward and flect i'll say that it does not mexcense oukno use use my tone make at land with my tones you can hear yourself out loud somebody else just pointed out to me the other day that if you talking to somebody and they are in mid thought and the kind of their voice trails off because they sort of lost their train of thought if you mirror them there that helps them get their train of thought back and expand wit is it is a ridiculously effective communication tool to get people to expand and feel heard it is simplicity put some people off there is some people that say i ans ont stupen o onc see what good that will do i always notice if somebody is really wants to know about mirroring my description is thare both high iye cu and hi eqe you and why does that work a hi eye you guyse on o wante nor something thit is really simple that does not take any effort to do and that is what a mirror does it is really really effective it is almost no effort on your part at all interestin i must say that narrow science has a an unfortunate dirth of knowledge about how brains interact this is starting to change but most of what we know about how brain's work is from putting people into functional magnet ac presence in maging machines ill call them or i i'm exposing them to move ease or games that they have to play et cetera and then looking at brainstated activation there are a few laboratory starting to look at how people interact in real time with both people in separate em ori machines that hopefully will be able to par r some of this and im i'm certain that somebody hearing this will im use this knowledge to go do the experiment if not al ala run up the flagpuld o som a highly qualified people at stanford who could who could do this because be fun to see what is happening but have the sense that what is happening is that there is a real merge of cognition when one hear's their own words spoken back to learn that am wat's at you gen now got two brains processing the same information and that has to lead new places a i do not have any am on insight as to where what exactly is happening but a certainly that something is happening there evidence by the real world results that you are gettin we do not adal serments to tell us that a at to be interesting to to see and learn a bit of what is happening if there is a fusion for instance of a coactivation of emotional centers coactivation of re there is something bout hearing our own voice it is very different then hearing other people's voices most people cringe when they hear their own voice on recording am most not all am some people are in love with their own voice a i do not know these people but we know that our auditory system cancels out the hearing of our own voice did that as we are talking now our auditory system is suppressing our own voice we do not really hear ourselves speak the same way that when you speak i hear you speak yet a it is an active nor a chemical inhibition of the response and it is amazing too because as we grow up our voice changes purity and forth tand other ways too that the vocal course change in thickness et cetera and our voice changes but we always know self from other in terms of voice and we cancel out our actual auditory perception of our own that is fascinating and breathing and heart beat we shut down our response to self actively within the brain hat's fascinating maybe hearing back some of what we just said allows us to actually hear what we e just set ye what true an a asked why people yousometimes all somebody needs a sounding bor they can they can somebody else can hear hear they can hear themselves out and get a repeated back to im and an te go way men didn i just say that e intereting interesting useful indeed pro active listening tell us about proactive listening we are all told that we need to be better listeners the other day one that we got two ears in one mouth as if that is wleft to remind us a must pel of two ears in one mouth am but i get the point they were saying hey there is value in listening and more often than not we default to broadcast but no reception we are mostly broadcast less reception am hence the a to call for nasal breathing it is useful in a lot of circumstances a cause it keeps us it gives our mouth shut a what is proactive listening how do we do it well thy what is it goud i'm really trying to get people out of the notion of active listening just because active listening has been overused a people of lost track of it and a most of uts taught poorly and it is interactive for its proactive and we learn to hostage negotiators first of all just a label to presenting emotion and we just assume that in t presenting emotion was always anger of some form anger upset on certain rerinstances tagi was under control but they were almost always negative emotion we just assume that it was adefined to what was a confined to what was driving hossagetakers was negativity now if i may as i i feel an an impostor talking about norg science to you your knowledge of nor sciences is is spot on avos i must say numerous times you you have asked me about things in nursience in you you have never been off the mark ye yea you you at you clearly done your homework kno we keep trying to learn about t but a wlaymon's terminology the survival brain is largely negative ballpark i would say seventy five per cent negative your reactions are ging to be negative number one i believe that is principally backed up by the experiments of norl science the f m our eyes if if if you's alluded to and then an hostise negotiation we re taught to basically label to present the emotion and then i'v seen from experimentation a reporting of experiments i think that first time i read about it was in a book called the upward spiral and that book is a good ten years old i think which means the norl science is evolving but primarily the experiment there that remember reading about and read about inother places that if people were of undergoing of a negative emotion in my a laymon's paraphrase of the experiment is a there shown a picture that induced the negative emotion in their head and then the asked people to simply call out what the emotion was and when they self labeled then the emotion diminished now the degree of diminishment varies but the percentage of time that it diminishes by simply by calling it out iis just dar near all the time for largely seventy five per cent negative and we can deactibate the negativity by calling it out well let us be proactive if you are human being and were engagement in a negotiation there is going to be certain very predictable negativity that is going to be there and i should be practive in calling it out anticipating the negativity's goin to be there based on a circumstances highly predictable and you got instinct before yu referring to when you want to say look i do not want you think im being greedy you gots telling you it is highly predictable you gon t come off is greedy let me be practive and say it' probably in to seem im being greedy and that is the diling over to what is eminently predictable in the in irraction and just being poractive to deactibate the negative emotions that either are taking place or what are experience is found that i have not seen any science that is yet that has hat the opportunity the back thits up at inoculates i can create a barrier if i call out a negative thatt's not there does not plant it it actually inoculates you from it if and i done this impractise i'v i was at given a lecture couple o years ago anybody askd a question i try to find the value in the question no matter how bad the question is this poor god asked me a question that i just cannot find a single component in his question that demonstrates that he was listening or paying attention there was nothing about it that i can congratulate him on and i said this going to sound harsh because i know the answer i'm getting ready to give him is going to make it sound to the group that i think he stupid i just i cannot think of a way to respond to this without saying effectively what do you thinkon about that is got nothing to do what worth alking about s go this is going to sound harsh and i answer the question and his kind ot goes old kay and i start answering somebody else question and he goes that was not harsh now if i had not said this is going to sound harsh and answered the question i guarantee you my answer would have embarrass him and embarrassment is one of the worst negative emotions you can inflict on anybody and he would hate me to this day for embarrassin him i got a moment coming at me that is predictibly negative and i can let it i can let that train run me down or i can call out out in advance and get a reaction were the guises i was not it bed and that is would be improact of about the emotions is about i love it and i'm recalling an instance turn graduate scor my graduate advise her who sadly as passed away but was a phenomenal scientist i'min just pure insisted on getting the answers could emotionally detach from the answers whe she is just was it was a ningia she used to come into the laboratory when we were working on a paper and she would sit down and she would say you are ging to hate me for what i'm about to ask you to do and i think oh no come t have to redo all the analysis or i w i some you'na monumental thing and then she would said you got a change the faunts ind figure too im i godly when you mean ont ate you but itbut was relief i wanted nothing more than to make her happy with my work because i i respected the standard that she held greatly i me she could have asked me to ouno stand on my head and do do the experiments fifty times i would probably would have done it if i thought they would make the project better and as a consequent she would have been pleased i because she was the standard for me and a many way still is but i'm wonder if she read your book because i she is to presage these i'm request we you areging to hate me and then she would asked me for some le now i hate you that is nothing but now i i wonder if iif i would have been taken aback if she had just said i i' hay by the way figure too needs redoing i might have been kind of bristle by that 'm maybe she read your book these are great tools mirroring and pract of listening tan thank you for suring these course did you ever employ the family members of kidnappers friends of kidnappers as a means to i'm tap into a different aspect of their psyche you because i think that we are all as human beings very context ri in i can imagine that the person who kidn ap somebody or whos am trying to steal somebody is resources is in a particular groove of t a person and and i i do think there are people in the world who are just evil but i also know because i've read about it and i trust the sources that their people who have done harandous things who love their dog and genuinely love their dog and would not harm an animal but i'm not trying to give these people a pass but i could imagin that i' those other fascets to somebody represent really good entry points for allowing them to see the kind of incongruents in their behavior i'm or is it the case that when these are high stretsed situations that you just have to pasically noeftic attack the you do not disarm the aggressor and you are just foxing on the person as the bad actor not considering the other contects of their lives id let lis draw distinction between a hostage takers in a conained situation and kidnappers uncontained unon location you probably asking about somebody in a contained situation a badgas in a bank d why watson in in his tractor in washington d s very contrentutively if theren a contained situation there is u saying out this is system that your employing is perfectly designed to give you the outcome that you have badguy d why watson is on is tractor and d sie the family's part of the system tho put him there the blunt harsh reality of that is now at that siege that went on long enough and was high profile some of his family members showed up now we can we could and and did try to use them i'm walking i'm walking from one place to another from the negotiation operation a sull component on a way to command post hossas negotiateo stops me a couple of people with hem it is watson's family and they see i'm in a hurry and then i'm not interested ot bein stopped andthey got to say to me something to stop me and get my om tettention and they go look our brothers just hurt in in his heart he is just hurtin you do not things have gone bad for a whole family and he is just hurt in his heart do not kill him over it and i looked at the negotiatin i said get that on tape and we will play that for him because if we can get that on tape exactly the way they sat it thato land but if we put him on a phone with them they'e gong to try to reason with hem andthey gan to say stuff to em that did not help buch they do not very well intention but it is going to be conentutive and it is probably ging to make it worse you have to understand family can be extremely important if you get him to say exactly the right thing and it is probably going to need to be highly orcestrated because how it is gon a land and unfortunately think if you get him in a direct conversation it will probably renew in old wound you do not family members have herd each other in ways that they have no idea even happened and the other you no family member my sent that to stay remembers when i told him santa claus was not real and i have not tin ou i have no memory ot y the i say r kno alryr way we get one legules ute family members have hert each other over the years that they have no idea which comes up in these live conversations and you do not know what would wound you do not even know what wounds are there that you cause and in in a contain situation a family member can be extremely helpful but it has to be it is it is a surgical shot that you have to be really really really careful with otherwise you can go the other way because wounds in pupilon even or there sas usa psychologically a stute way of viewing it because i'm a big fan of the calle family system's model of psychology im and you cannot look at any human being psychology positive meaning adapt if or mal adapt o psychology and not look at the family system which that evolved im which is not to say that some perfectly healthy familyes occasion y do not have hissues with a child having mental illness and and that happens but i'm told that ninety nine point nine per cent of the time you can identify a family system organization or a lineage a gyrnetic tie et cetera that that makes thingstart to make sense when somebody is really struggle and and as you point out a sadly oftentimes that that involves pains of past well what thanks for sharing that because i think that am in my mind the movi version of it is they bring the mother in and it is billy do not do it t as he sayd yoard mi ike that might be the time when billy's really gin to let his mother know isact ri an ats not what you want egoness what a complex job what a complex high stakes high consequence job what did you do to unload some of the heaviness ond i'm not just tarting out getting a good night sleep or having a a beer with your co workers after although those things sure important rolvs for m for people i realize a do you think we can dump the hard stuff in our head in our hearts in a way that allows us to be functional cause you knont people in your line of work and i think just any one in the world you you live long enough you can you are gon experien t's loss yet you are gong to get kicked inand a got yet and you aregong to see people you care about get kicked in they got therit that is there is much beauty to life as well but but that is the reality did you you have tools processes that you use to kant do not the baggage that you can lean into your relationships an your relationship yourself with with rerestored sense of optimism im yet i think mostly most of people that i've always worked around we been very re enforcing of one another commedically i motionally friendship wise you do not been able to laugh with each other taken it easy on each other can people etin a laughter and genuine understanding with witha without thm you now somebody tryng to tell you that you did wrong i've been lucky enough to te find myself in those groups most ot a time or we would we just evolved it that is just the way that we were we were attracted to one another emotionally psychologically because of that that is probably it mostly i mean i've tried to par some o these emotions out recently i'm not particularly proud of anything i've ever that done but i always felt it was a privilege i you must be proud of your accomplishments i do not know that it is pride but there is there is other fatisfaction that i get out of it and thinking about what drives me also now ou no tat i'm running a company and i'm and i got people also ontr panewers that are trying to do the best for the employs whatar we encouraging one another that whatever were doing people feel good about it and i tried to take a lot of that from what i learned is not ifpiaage and and a hostage negotiator and people that i was around and we did joke with each other lot and we did a play tricks on each other good good natured humor avoid the people that are running you down but be able to you do not take take care some good natured ribbing every now and then i and i think humorous is a one way another combined with hard work and an appreciation for what youre doing a most probably been most of the mental health long a way occasional burbon love it a we did a whole episode on alcohol and people er can hear me say love it and then away here i'm supporting out edisen but day to say as long as you are not an alcoholic as long as you are of age a probably two drinks week as or last is safe a make em make em good high quality drinks if you are gan to have them consume them in the right context or do not consum them in all but a that is what i said le of it i i i support your your love of burbon a i'm not burbon drinker but a tell me a little bit more about what you are up to lately you alluded to it a moment ago tat youre running teams thetter doing a lot say you are you are in charge of a lot of people now helping people help people a providing lot of service in the world through a lot of different channels a first of all i want to say that your book never split the difference one of my favorite books thank you a i do not say that lightly i do not endorse books very often but the books i do indorse i love love love i also have to say that it is a tosse up between your book never split the dis difference and the body keeps the score e the award for best titles of any book those is amazing titles amazing amazing titles tall ras a wria co writer came up with the title yet it wase phenominal title that in the body keep the keeps the score just because it is there much contained in in the title and then the book a exceeds expectations a really amazing book people should listen to it read it if they have not already you are doing a lot more right now than i'm been just writing although i will not hear about your other book projects as well but before you list off the number of things you are doing tell me first about fireside cause this sounds a really interesting i'm endeavor that frankly aven heard of before i'm what is fireside a brand news social media platform a it is essentially an interact of potcast it is a subscription service founde by follen fateme and mark cuban founin i've been friends for number years she was gugle's youngest employ she is an antropanewr dynamic smart hard charge in parson and it is sorto grew out of what is inadequate in some of the social medin ap set her out there trying to combine the best ideas of a few different thanks and found suggested it to me and i thought i'll jump in because she is a visionary and what is turned out to be as it is effectively weekly interactiv group coachon and you you get the ap off your iphone or your androyd whatever platform your phone is on and in you log in we do an hour once a week and it is you are getting group coaching and then you get ask questions and it is got of vidia component to it if you want ask a question we we are ging to bring you up on quote stage and i get to see you and talk directly to you en you get a see me and talk directly to me or a i interviewed marked huban a couple of weeks ago when people got to come on and a ask mark questions or ask me questions and what it is turned out to beas is one of sort of a a the thut the next level of how to get better at negotiations after you have read the book and probably taken the master class where do you go next one of the people that came on the potcast here the day th the the fireside am episode they said well i donnot have enough money yet to go to your in person training events casoles are expensive and this is tw im going to get better in the in a meantime and work my way in that direction and the monthly coaching if you were to sign up for group coaching from us on a regular basis on a monthly basis it would promptly easily cost you for what were providing twenty five thirty thousand dollars a month and this is a thousand a year at scale it is an opportunity interact directly with me and the members on my team once a week an get group coaching and it is and it is just kind of fun we are getin o kick out of it and people that really really care about interacting well with people guy comes on the first episode i did and he said besides the fact that you help me make a lot more money you help me save my marriage and he just needed to know how to talk more genuinely and honestly with his wife in a way the mele mader felt hurd and he did not really have a good way to do that beforehand and i was just that is a lot i do not i don i noknow how to respond to that or than just be grateful thit people can say stup that to us the fireside things contical were still experimenting with it it is an interactof potcast group coaching it is fun grate i mean i would say a te changing lives there i mean the saving o marriagesmo i no small deal and i think that the ability to communicate am directly with people also imagine gives them the opportunie to implement that the tools that you are providing in real time it is one thing to here about something and and try it but then a you can give fee back in real time or you on these these fireside chats directly or members of your team now i i do we do one every week and i'm once a mon and the other thing too i can explain something one way and if for whatever reason it does not land in your contact you cannot quite get it that is what we found about the inner act if nature of its somebody comes on and ask a question in their contact and that i'll answer it an go il oke ri that helped you get you get to hear people you who is struggling with it the way you are but i have not put it in your contact yet and that is the other thing that is great about a cuan i live une we at a guest on here who told me that there are amazing data supporting the fact that people follow the medical and health advice of doctors that they can relate to far more than they follow the medical and health advice of the physicians that they feel are not them im and oftentimes this can include the physician or health care provider being someone that they would aspire to be but oftentimes it is just some common report they both baseball or they both to cook or to garden and that sets a bridge rwhere then the patient is willing to do all these things that ordinarily they would be resistant to r and and therare really good data to support this and i i that that really stuck with me cause it says that it is s not just about the information or the the delivery rout of the information that the contact and that reports even along something is o you youra a'm not a major a a a major sports fan on most things but all ouro bills fan or somehling me too that can be the difference between somebody doing all the things to lower the blicprashure the day and changing their die al all those things verses not making the changes report is a magic yes kind of a magic component could changes thinges ar will fireside sene lake a great opportunity for people to not just ask questions but to build report with you in members of your team a i'man a check it out lord knowsi a i need help impru my communications and cerai certain domains o life believe me i get the memos a fact a what other writing projects are you involved in if any a were weve been toing with this a companion a operations manuel for tactical empathy which getting it right is important it is sort of companion book that never spit the difference that is probably at least a year and a half out from being done in the meantime we just do we do a lot of online training you knon we got a we got a news letter we put out weakly for for people to get our latest cunning edds application thoughts as much as possible we would put an information out that we charge for a lot and we put out a lot of free stuff i'm i i'm thrown out ideas on instograham but we are constantly trying to put information out there that that people can colaborate better specific we just finished a book for residential real estate agents a friend of mine steeve shoal we put that out last november that is sort of niche but it is mostly the black swon method for real estate agents cause every conversation therein is a difficult emotional conversation sen sele of a house as oll most trustful moments of anybody's life samlon or buying we just put that out in the meantime we are spread a gospel as much as possible iwill certainly point out the various places people can find you and and the different venus for for learning more i want to say that am numerous times throughout to day's conversation you threw out the words sounds it has not opener and i have to say i've jhis cant crazy idea in the back of my mind i i believe that am simple feel tested tools ar immensely powerful not just for resolving negotiations but really for changing the way that people into act with each other ind themselves and eu noug if i have one wish a for the world a on the basis of our conversation it how amazing would it be if kids learned early on to talk to one another from that sounds perspective because i think that would naturally a orient them toward listening right or at least offering a hypothesis of what they heard and how poorly they might be listening and then getting a defensive stance response that informs them about the act accuracy your lack of accuracy a and on and on i fee that the sounds a question sounds you feel blank or sounds you believe blank just seems to me the a one of the one of the most potent tools in the universe and i sure wish that all adults would implement it but that kids would learn about it to yes that yatits that is oa great thought and io how how to we teach him at a younger rage that that listening is actually an effective thing to do sactually way to think things through also igt i gree o me we have magic wandright exactly well cris i wane to thank you much for your time to day i am

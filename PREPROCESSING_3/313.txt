welcome to the hubermanmacon tans a science science pace to s fr i'm enderhuberman and i'm a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing working memory working memory is a spescial category of memory in which we are able to hold small amounts of information in our mind for short periods of time working memory is also very closely related to attention for any view that are interested in how to develop better focus and attention understanding what working memory is and some of the things that you can do to improve your working memory can be very beneficial to day i'm going to talk about what working memory is including some of the underline biology although i promise irrespective of whether not any biology or you are an expert in biology i'll make the conversation accessible to you in addition i will talk about tools to improve working memory and i'll also compare working memory to other forms of memory long tern memory in short term memory and through that understanding i'm confident that you w'll be able to develop better focus as well as be able to commit certain forms of information to your short and long term memory stores before we begin i to emphasized at this podcast is separate fror my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leef and ready to drink yerbamate i often discuss yerbamate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar its high and te occident content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible nero protective effects i also drink yerbamate because i love the taste while there are lot of different choices of yerbamate drinks out there i love matina because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their looseleef and their can varieties are of the absolute best quality much that i decided to become a partial owner in the company although i must say even if they had not allowed me to do that i would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and bessierbamate you can find i love the taste of brud loose leef matina yerbamate and i particularly love the taste of matina's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which i personally help them develop if you would to try matina go to drink matina dac cam slash huberman right now matina is offering a free one pound bag of loose leef yerbamte t and freeshipping with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerbamate again that drink matina dac cam slash huberman to get the free bag of yerbamate looselef te and free shipping to day's episode is also brought to us by better help better help offers professional therapy with a licens serapus carried out on line i've been going to therape for well over thirty years initially i didnt have a choice it was a condition of being allo to stay in school but pretty soon i realize that therapy is extremely valuable in fact i consid er doing regular therapy just as important as gtting regular exercise inclin cardevascular exercise and resistance training which of course i also do evory week the reason i know therapy is valuable is that if you can find a therapists with whom you can develop are really good report you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you allso can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insites that can allow you to better not jus your motional life in your relationship life but of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of correer goals in fact i see therapy is one of the kee components for mashing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters if you to try better help go to better help dock calm slash hubermen to get ten per cent off your first month again that is better help doc calm slash hubermen to day's episode as also brought to us by helick sleep helic sleep makes mattresses in pillows that are of the absolute highest quality i've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the kee things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress matches your sleep requirements the helic's website has a brief two minute quiz that if you go to will ask you questions such as you sleep on your back your side ore your stomach you tend to run hot or coal during the middll the night as well as some other questions that allow you to determine the optimal mattress for you when i took the quiz i personally match to their dusk mattress tu s k which has allowed me to significantly improve my slee if you are interested and significantly improving your sleep go to helic sleep dock calm slash hubermen take their brief two minute quiz and they will match you to a customize mattress and you'l et up to three hundred fifty dollars off any mattress order and two free pillows again if youre interested in trying helicks go to hlic sleep dock calm slash hubermen for up to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows ok let us talk about working memory and let us start off this discussion by comparing working memory to other forms of memory than most people are more familiar with or at least when most people hear the word memory the typically are thinking about long term memory one's ability to re memor the capitals of states or countries the different continents directions from one location to another even one's name all of those things are examples of long term memory i wane to emphasize that long term memory really has two components there are what we call declarative long term memories these are the things that we can declare things facts about ourselves are the world or others and then there are procedural long term memories procedura long ter memories as the name suggests our aspects of our memory that allow us to perform certain procedures they are literally action steps that we take to for instance ride a bicycle or drive a car which by the way we might not be contress of ourselves doing after we learn that is after we pass information into our perceedural long term memory but even once those things become reflective they are stored in our long term memory now a discussion of long term memory is not the focus to day but me being a nerrol scientist and i to think you all tenmerally being interested in the underling biology i'll just mention that there is a key structure within the brain that is part of a larger nerrl network that is a collection of structures which is absolutely essential for the formation and storage of long ter memories and that is the hippocampus which in latin means sea horse and it does look a little bit a sea horse but we actioa have one on each side of your brain we say hippocampi plurel and what we know is that if people have damage to their hyppocampus of any kind that people have trouble accessing or forming long ter memorie sometimes both and there is a lot more that we could say about long term memory indeed i did not entire episode of the huberman labpodcast about the formation and storage of long term memories including some tools to improve long term memory will touch on a few of those tools later today but you can access that episode if you go to huberman labdok common just put memory into the search function and you will find it there in the meantime if we want to understand working memory we not only have to understand how i's different from long term memory but also how it is different from short term memoryes short term memory is a capacity that we all have that as the name suggests represents a short term memory bank for information that may or may not get past into long term memory for instance if you have learned anything and of course you have if you can understand whan i'm saying you have learned english language if you can write you have lean how to write et cetera well in order to learn those things and to commit them to long term memory the information require to do those things tand to have that knowledge needed to be held in short term memory and short ter memories are the sorts of memories that we maintain for somewhere between a few minutes and potentially a few hours may be a little bit longer but only a certain percentage of that is past into our long term memory for instance if you listen to this podcast or you go to a course lecture o whether not that lecture is about cognitive material or whether not it is about learning a nw physical skill regardless of what you learn you are only going to learn a certain amount of that information but were we to examine how much of the information you just heard or that your hearing now you remember immediately after this podcast episode as compared to say a week later we know based on gosh a millions of scientific papers and studies that you are going to have more information in your short term memory stores shortly after being exposed to now information than you will later in other words only a small percentage of what we perceive what we ceive what we hear et cetera gets passed into short term memory and then only a fraction of that gets past into long term memory now the nerral circuits for short term memory and the passage of short term memories into long term memory involve a lot of different braind structures but here again we can implicate the hippocampus be cause the actual passage of short ter memories into long tern memories occurs in part within the hyppocampus and then a lot of people do not know this some of the memories that we think of as long term memories are actually distributed into the neo qartexts which is the outer portion of the brain now the point here is less to fill iour mind with different names of things and nominclature but rather to get you thinking about what is involved in creating short and long tern memories and equally important that even though the hyppocampus is critically involved in the formation of short in long tern memories that the formation of short and long ter memories is really a network phenomenon in fact among the more important themes that comes up again and again on this podcast any time that were talking about neur science rachy biology in any case is that rarely if ever is there one location in the brain where something happens typically it is a network phenomenon meaning it is the collaboration of a bunch of different brain areas passing information from one location to the next and storing it in a kind of distributed way now another keathinged understand about working memory and how it is different from short and long tern memory is that the formation of short and long tern memories almost always involves neuro plasticity neuro plasticity is the nervous systems ability to change in response to experience now theiare different types of neuro plasticity often when we heare about neuro plasticity in the popular sphere people do not emphasized that their different types of neuro plasticity and it is worth paying a little bit of attention of what those different types are there is for instance will we call long term potentiation long term potentiation or el t p as the acronym goes is the strengthening of connections between nurons as a consequence of their repeated firing very closely together in time o get there is a lot more to it but if you have ever heard the phrase fire together wire together sometimes that is misattributed to donald hebb who did talk about neuro plasticity by the way donald heb was of psychologist up an canda who talked about neuroplasticity in the contexts of lots of different forms of learning but that fire together wire together phrase was not actually stated by donald hebb it was stated by carlaschats my cholligue at stamford and she was referring to ell t p but other forms of neuro plasticty that occur mainly in development when nurons fire very closely in time and thereby strength in those connections which can include ell t p o ki for now think of l t p as any time that some small group of nuurons could be two nurons could be to thousand nurons are very active closely together in time and they have access to one another physically and the consequence is often not always but is often el t p that is the strengthening of those connection such that after that berage of activity subsides those nurons can speak to each other they can communicate through electrical activity and chemical activity much more easily their communication is more robast is removing a wall between a conversation such that the conversation can take place more fluidly now there are other forms of neuroplasticity including l t d long term depression which unfortunately the name often calls to mind ideas about depression as a psyciatric or a psychological symptom but has nothing to do with that long term depression is simply the inverse of el t p its actually the weakening or the removal of connections that we call synapsis between nurons i want to emphasize that both l t p and el t d are both critically involved in lots of different kinds of learning and both of them tend to be involved in the formation of both short term memories and long term memories and this is very important in the removal of short term memories and long ter memories literally forgetting of certaint things because as we all know there are many things that we will never forget and there are also things that we almost always forget now there is a third form of neuro plasticity that is involved in the formation of short and long ter memories that is important for us to discuss just briefly but i do one to emphasize that there are not just three forms of neuro plasticity there are many other forms dozens if not more things spite time independent plasticy piller pared pulse facilitation and on and on but the third type of neuroplasticity that id to mention now is neurogenesis neurogenesis is the formation of new nurons now neurogenesis is robust in the developing nervous system we know this it is robust in the developing nervous system of animals and humans however neurogenesis the literal formation of new nurons in the brain is a very exciting idea and it does occur and it is very exciting in a way that has motivated lots of popular press outlets to talk about or to discuss papers that have discovered neurogenesis in the adult brin because let us be on us what is more exciting than the idea that your brain can add new brain cells later and life and indeed that has been shown even in people well into their eighties and nineties however it is very important to know that the total amount of neurogenesis that occurs in the adult human brain is infintesimely small as a mechanism for neuro plasticity and learning as compared to the other forms of neuroplasticity that we discuss such as long term potentiation and long term depression i do not want t o throw cold water on the topic of nerogenesis it is incredibly interesting and important topic but all too often they tend to eclipse the much more common mechanism for the formation of short and long ter memories which are those other forms we just talked aby el t pelt d et cetera the point here is that yes indeed there are new neurons that can be added in the adult brain may be even in the adult human brain and there is some evidence that some of those new nerons are added to th hyppocampus in fact a particular region of the hyppocampus called the dentite gyris of the hyppocampus the is been a lot of controversy about how much neurogenesis occurs or does not occur and whether not occurs after puberity or not there is all field of people battling over this now for several decades but one thing is very clear neuro genisists while it is very exciting and intriguing is not the main mechanism by which the formation of short and long ter memories occurs when you learn new information as you are right now the storge of that information in your short term memory networks which is then passed on to your long term memory networks and that can be recalled that allows you to state certain facts about for instance the existence of this in call a hyppocampis hopeuly you wilv remember that going forward or youre ability to perform any kind of motor movement that you learn now or way back in childhood most of that is the consequence of the strengthening of particular connections and the weakening of other types of connections those of the two major forms of nerrow plasticity okay i do not want you to get the impression that there'e something wrong with my memory and that ie forgot that this episode is not about short or longter memory but it is about working memory and indeed i have not forgotten now is where i tell you why i've been talking about short and long tern memory and the mechanisms of those because i want them to provide a stark contrast for what we call working memory working memory as far as we know does not involve neurl plasticity or at least if it does it is not a particularly robust aspect of working memory rather working memory is the reflection of a particular neurl circuit running an algarithm over and over and over for different types of information but the information is in stored it is actually intentionally discarded now what sorts of daily activities and life activities would require working memory the answer to that is basically everything that you need to do but that you do not want to rememory now what types of things woul those be well let us think about it most all of us learned at some point in our life to tiron shoes presumably how to tie your own shoes if you do not perhaps you should learn where weare well crow or slippers i do not know but assuming you can tie your own shoes that is something that how to do when you can do it as a procedural long ter memory can do that action you do not have to think about it too much working memry would come into play when say you wake up in the morning and that you need to head out for a jog but you also need to make a cup o coffee first and you need to remember where the coffee is where your shoes are and perhaps you are making a phone call or youre having a conversation while you need to tie your shoes and on in forth working memory is basically the taking in of information that is critical for you to sequence your actions over a short period of time and then forget that sequence for instance i'm willing to bet that you put your shoes on to go running before you go running that sort of a dov and if you are me you drink your water your coffee your yearo bymante before you go running the point here is that if you wake up in the morning and you caffeen before you go for run there are certain series of action steps that you need to carry out to hydrate make that cup of coffee or tea drink it put on your shoes head out the door you need to sequence things properly but you do not want to commit you are long tu r or even your short term memory stores to carrying out that sequence you simply want to be able to carry out that sequins and then discard that information about the sequence and focus your attention on for instance what trajectury youre going to run through the park or around your neighborhood then you want to discard that information and you want to lean into the next portion of your day and on and on in fact working memory is involved in essentially every activity both cognitive and motor from e point you wake up in the morning until the time you go to sleep at night for every single day of your life and we know this because there are in deed people who have diminished working memory or even lack working memory entirely although the latter is somewhat rare it has happened and as you can imagine they have a complete failure of ability to sequents activities and their lives are extremely difficult they need a ton of assistance from other people even more assistance then do people who have minimal or no long term memory ca this is really high lighting just how important working memory is working memory is pasically the way that you navigate any immediate environment and as i mention early or it is very closely tied to attention because in order to know whatk to do now and then what to do subsequently and then subsequent to that you need to be able to hold your attention to the things you need to do working memory in attention collaborate literally at a nurl circuit level an at a nerrl chemical level in order to allow you to move through your day in an adaptive functional way and people who have challenges with attention were focus we are working memory and sometimes it can be hard to dissociate which one theire having challenges with really have a hard time moving through life as compared to people whose attention and working memory is more robust now the good news is to day workging to talk about working memory some of the nurl circuits involved and some of the nor chemicals involved that can augment or improve working memory and we are also going to talk about what one can do to directly increase the amount of narrw transmission of those particular chemicals within the circuits the control working memory in other words to improve your working memory now i can talk about working memory in the mechanisms et cetera all day long but as is often the case sometimes it is better to not just learn about concepts but actually to experience them in a real time what we are going to do now as i'm actully going to give you a working memory test this is the sort of working memory tests that you would take if you were to go into a psychology laboratory or nurl sins laboratory and they were studing working memory in humanse now there is another advantage just doing this in real time right here as your listening or as your listening and watching and that is because you are going to get data youre going to get information about what your base line working memory capacity is and you are going to wnt to keep those data in your short term memory stores maybe even your long ter memory stores but certainly your short term memory stores because shortly later in this episode i'm going to talk about different ways to improve your working memory depending on were your base line w orking memory starts which by the way turns out to be a pretty good proxy for the levels of a nurmodulator called dopamine within the norl circuits that control working memory wriht now let us take a working memory task we are going to do this purely through audioform because i realize some people are watching and listening to this on you two been others are just listening to this episode there are not going to be any visual cues or slides that i present and that is perhaps what distinguishes what were about to do most from what would happen in a laboratory typically in ae laboratory there would be some visual presentation of what i'm about to say but here because of the format that most of you are consuming this information by we are going to do this purely by audio the first test of your working memory is very simple i am going to read off a series of letters and your task is to remember as many of those letters as you can the first string of letters is g k z p i o k just to make this really easy umisay it twice although typically in a working memory task it would just be said once but imn to make this extra easy g k z p ok now you in your own head can try and recite back those letters if you o k second string of letters r o m k l e i im oing to make this extra simple and do it again not typical for working memory task but there are some working memory task where that happens r o m k l e now a third string of letters this once can be a little bit longer ku p that working memory an attention w c ku v d n i'll repeat that again w c kcu v d n how many of the letters i just read can you remembory o k depending on how many letters you can remember perhaps you have a lo moderate or high degree of working memory keep in mine that some of you are perhaps doing other things you are attending to driving or other tasks within your home or your office and perhaps you were enable to pay full attention they be some variation there but none the less after reading each of those strings of letters you were asked to recall those letters in your mind and if you wrote them down in youre ree reading them yes that is cheating but how about this what if i were to ask you now about the simplest first string of letters the one that consisted of only five letters how many of you can remember any of those five letters now i i cannot here you if you are shouting them out ai cannot see you if youre raising your han but chances are most of you av forgotten the first series of letters even though it was quite short and you could remember it early on that ability to remember that string of letters when you first heard them and indeed i read them twice i'd be very surprised if any of you could not remember that string of letters after hearing them twice but i also read you some other letters in the intrum o k that now just couple minutes later i'm asking you to remember that first string of five letters and assuming that you did not write it down e our not cheating chances are you remember anywhere from two to z ro of those letters in that first word which is a perfect example of your working memory nothing got committed to short term much less long term memory rather your working memory was able to work with that information hold it in mine for just as long as you thought you need to know that information but then thank goodness that information was discarded you did not know that i was can to ask you for that first string of letters again after reading you the longer string of letters but i did that deliberately to show you how your working memory works in some sense the working memory task is a bit unusual in that it is a test of yes memory in the very very short term but also a test of your ability to forget to discard information that is not critical and that gets us back to the original definition of working memory which is our ability to a tend to specific small matches of information re member it for just as long as we think we need to and then to discar that information and by the way if you want to know wit those first five letters were they were g k z p i i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptigons i started taking a g one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all of my quotas for vitemens and minerals and it insures that i get enough prebiotic and probiotic to support got health now got health is something that over the last ten years we realized is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mune system and for the production of nauro transmitters and uromodulators things dopamin and ceratonent in other words got health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are nmber of things in a g one including specific micro nutrians that are hard to get from whole foods or at least in sufficient quantities a g one allows me to get the vitemens and minerals that i need probitics prebotics the adaptagens and critical micr nutrience any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a g one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash hubermen and you will get a year supply of vitemen d three k two and five free travel packs of a g one again that is a drink a g on doccam slash hubermen now's where we talk a little bit about the nerl circuitry and the neuro chemistry of working memory now it is important that we do this because in a few minutes you'are also going to learn that people generally fall in to two broad bins of having a high or low base line of a certain ar achemical in the brain that affords them either high or low working memory capacity now in reality its a distribution in fact it is what we call a normal distribution it reallies 't to bins but during to day's discussion an i fact in a lot of laboratory studies we can actually bin people into these two groups the nural circuitry underlying working memory involves a lot of different brain locations that is a lt of different neural networks collaborating to create this thing we call working memory however there are a couple of key hubs that is locations within the brain that are especially important for working memory the once that i to focus on to day involve the prefrontal quartex this is nerl real estate that resides just behind the forehead and the nurons in the brain stem further back in the brain that manufacture dopamine and that send there little wires that we call acs ons up to the prefrontal quartex to release dopamine dopamine is a neuromogulator many people are familiar with dopamine and familiar with it in the context of motivation and drive sometimes people mistakenly think it is only involved in pleasure but dopamine is ivolved in motivation and drive when dopamine systems go arigh that is if there levels it too high that can create manic states it can create addictive states when dopamine levels are too low you can get movement challenges such as in parkinsins which is a depisit where a literal destruction of the nurons that manufacture dopamine ther bunch a different areas of the brain that those dopaminerons in the brains ten project to but for right now weare going to focus almost entirely on the dopamine projections from the brainstem to the prefrontal quarte which is called the mezo cartical circuitry i'm not gong to get into the origins or the meaning of the mezo quartical verses other dopamine projection systems i did that in a couple of episodes about eightieight tey and attention and dopamine in particular and can find those at hubermanobdot cam just put dopamine and circuits into the search function and it will take you to those particular timestamps arei describe that but since we want to keep things fairly top contour at the level of narrol circuitry here just know that there are bunch of nurons that manufacture dopamine back in te brainstem that send their acs ons those low wires up to the prefrontal quartex and that the amount of dopamine released pur unit time in a certain amount of time strongly dictates the extent to which working memory capacity is going to be high medium or low now i want to be very clear becaue i 'm ging to come back to this a libet later again and again it is the case that when doamine levels are lower that is either their fewer nurons that have the potential to released dopamine in the frontal quartex or for whatever reason less is being released in the frontal quartex that working memory performance tends to be lower as compared to conditions where dopamne release ere the availability of dopamine is higher however it is not the case that more dopamine is always going to equaite to improve working memory this is important that i'm an a say it again it is not always the case that increasing the amount of dopamine transmission in the frontal quartex leads to improvements in working memory there is a specific criteria that allows us to predict whether not it will improve or maintain or actually degrade working memory performance before you head to the end of the podcas to tranfigure at ways to increase dopamine to improve working memory please keep that fact in mind do not just commit it your working memory commit it to your short and long tern memory because thatit is very important if your goal is to improve your working memory with that said i do want to describe just a little bit of research showing the relationship between having a low working memory span as it is called the ability to only remember a few letters or numbers or short batches of information as compared to a high working memory span meaning longer strings of letters longer strings of memories which of course in the real world translates to being able to carry out shorter verses longer action sequences as described earlier in the senario where you getting up in the morning ar making coffee and hear hanout for run et cetera et cetera people do differ in terms of their working memory capacity and there is a classic study done by cools and despozido and colleagues this is publishin two thousand eight where they had a way to label the amount of dopamine that is available for release in the frontal quartec inhuman subjects they did this by the injection of a specific die that digets taken up specifically by the nurons in the brain that manufacture dopamine than they were able to image the brains of those people while those people were ride awake using something cupositronamission tomography again the specific tool is not necessarily important but since some of you to know and what they found is that for people that had a high working memory spand that is could remember long strings of numbers or letters or other information they tended to be the people that had more dopamine available for release in the frontal quartex either because they had more of the dopamine nurons themselves or similar number of nurons but those nurons had more dopamine to release ke and they also found the converse individuals that had a low working memor span and ability had less dopamine available for release that establishes a correlation but it is not causal a different study which is also a classic was carried out by brazaski brown rosvald and goldman and this is a really important study because in this study they were able to introduce small amounts of dopamine directly into the quartec and a valua working memory capacity now any time a working memory test is done the same pattern always a merges this is regardless of any dopaming being infused into the brain which is people and animals for that matter are very good at remembering short spands of numbers letters or other types of information suc you tell them one thing the letter a than you aske them dou remember letter almost everybody remembers that but if you give them a string of ten letters they remember fewer of those ten letters that is sort of obvious but its importanpoint emphasized none the less and there is a and of a dropping off curve of performance as one progresses from fewer to greater number of items to be remembered in this study when dopamine was introduced to the frontal quartex the number of things that individuals could remember simply increased it was a very straightforward result more dopamine introduced aloud longer letter number and information straings to be remembered and of course forgotten because that is what working memory balls remembering and then discarding of information shortly thereafter now the findings t i just described complement what i said before which is the naturally occurring experimen bring people the lab measured the working memory span look at how much dopamine they make hier dopamine better working memory lower dopamine lower working memory the experiment i just described was one in which dopamine is introduced showing that dopamne is very likely the rate limiting or the capacity limiting spry the btter way to put it the capacity limiting neuromodulator for improving working memory that is a fancyg nerd speak way of saying more dopamine allows for better working memory but a critical feature of this experiment is that they did a number of experiments where they did not introduced dopamine but instead they introduced other neuromodulators to the prefrontal quartex such as nor epinefran or seratonan and the interesting fining is that the eddition of norepineferan or seratonan which of course are other neuromodulators that can change the firing patterns of nerans in the prefrontal quartex but elsewhere as well sjust that in this case they were at its the prefrontal quartex had no effect on working memory it neither improved nor degraded working memory when those neuromodulators were introduced in other words dopamine and perhaps only dopamine seems to be the dominant neuromodulator for regulating the degree that is whether not you have small medium or large amounts of working memory capacity in the prefrontal quartex and of course there have been of bunch of other experiments that are worths mentioning briefly in this context such as taking people that have a highworking memory capacity and ind indeed have their brains image and one sees that they have high levels of baseline dopamine especialy the dopaine projecting to the prefronta quartex and then they are given a drog that depletes dopamne within the prefrontal quartex and their performance drops and its nice about the literature around working memory is that while i'm not covering all of that literature exhaustively it all tens to jibe at all points in a direction whereby the levels of dopamine being released in the prefrontal quartex juri ng working memory tasks correlates very strongly with capacity to perform working memory tasks lower dopamine lower working memory span as it is called hirdopimin hie working memory span o case an next we are going to do another working memory tasks different thin then one we did earlier and we are going to do that with a specific purpose in mine which is for you to be able to determine what youre working memory capacity is and by extension youre base line levels of dopamine or at least the levels of dopamin that are likelye being released into your prefrontal quartex while you do these working memory tasks in other wrds we are going to try and figure out whether or not you are of the low medium or high working memory capacity and oef course we are doing that in part to try an establish whether or not you likely have low medium or high amounts of dopaming available for release in the prefrontal quartex of course we are not putting you into apositronomision trermography scanning device we are not able to do that for obvious reasons but keep in mind that what we are about to do is very similar and in some cases identical to laboratory studies where the researchers were trying to determine what peoples levels of dopamine within these particular nural tat works weve been discussing the meso cuortical pathway are likely to be in other words performance on the working memory task that we are about to do is a decent indication of what the dopaming levels that are available forelease in your prefrontal quartex perhaps might be now i say perhaps might be because i do not want to cause any unnecessary alarm if for instance you fall into the low working memory span group in fact if you fall into the low working memory spn group there are actually some terrific tools tat you can use to improve dopaming transmission in those pathways and improve your working memory i also do not want people to get the impression that somehow performance on this working memory task is reflective of some larger dopamin issue in the brain and certainly it is not i repeat it is not dignostic of parkinsons or any kind of nur degenerov condition although i will say that defisits and working memory are common in patience with parkisons for obvious reasons those patients have defisits in dopami nuron not only production but the number of dopami nurons t's one of the hommark features of parkinsons but also in things tramatic brain injury at cetera but the working memory tasks that you are about to take when given to a general population or group of undergraduates or yo called normals or typical control subjects which all of you are moke unless youre a dealing with a dramatic brain injury or you have parkinsons we know that the data that youare goingto get back right now is very similar to the data that people get back when they do these sorts of studies in a laboratory that is its typical for some people have a short working memory span some people tohave a medium working memory span and some peopletohave a high working memory span and to day we are ashyou tust going to divide into twobins short working memory span in high working memory span and we can have some degree of confidence that quarrelates with the amount of dopaming available for release in the frontal quartex but and this is a very important point as we progress alone this discussion of working memory the narl circuits dopamine et cetera i want to make clear something that i said earlier which is that it is not the case that increasing the amount of dopomine that is available always increases working memory spent in fact the is a common circumstane whereby people with a relatively high degree of working memory capacity increase their dopomine levels even further using pharmocollegy or other methods that will discuss and their performance actually can degrade ok if any of that is confusing now will make it all very simple going forward that if you decide to implement any of the protocals discussed in this episode that you are aware of what you can expect and whether not you are in the category people that should or perhaps should not incorporate those protocals o k let us test your working memory again this time the working memory task is going to be a little bit different than the one you did previously this working memory task involves me reading six different sentences to you and your job is to pay attention to these six sentences because you aregoing to be asked some information about these sentences in a few moments the firsth sentence is realis state costs are going up the second sentence is the atlantic ocean is warm in summer the fhird sentence is there is a lot of interests now in electric cars the fourth sentence is some reptiles eat only once a year the fifth sentence is kids nowadays look at screens more than sixty per cent of their waking life and the sixth and final sentence is football can mean different sports depending on the country o k i read you six sentences they were moterately long i confess your job for the working memory task is now to recall as many of the final words of each of those sentences as you can i'll give you a few moments to do that now before i tell you what the final word of each of those sencences actually is i want a remind everybody that working memory capacity follows a normal distribution some of you will be able to remember the final word of perhaps five or even six of those sentences although i must say that is exceedingly rare some of you are going to be able to remember three to four of the final words of those sentences and that is more typical that actually represence the average or the mean as we call it and then fewer people although still many of you will only be able to remember one or two of the final words of those sentences o k now i am assuming that most of you have tried to call to memory the final word of as many of those six sentences as you can and may beu've written them down or you have typed them into your phone or you have some record of what you recall those six final words of those sentnces are now i'm going to tell you the actual final word of each of those sentences the fin al word of the first sentence was up because as you may recall the sentence was real estate costs are going up the final word of the second sentence was summer because the sentence was the atlantic ocean is warm in summer the final word of the fthird sentence was cars because the sentence was there is a lot of interest in electric cars the final word of the fourth sentence was year because the sentence was some reptiles eat only once a year the final word of the fifth sentence was life because the sentence was kids nowadays look at screens more than sixty per sent of their waking life and the final word of the sixh sentence was country because the sentence was football can mean different sports depending on the country o case o be honest with yourself and tell yourself and you do not have to tell anyone else if you do not want to how many of the final words of those six sentences you could remember correctly importan that you remember them correctly again the number words that you can recall that is your working memory span is going to vary from person o person but we can take the normal distribution of those scores it sort of drawl line down the middle and say that if you could remember three to six of the final words of those sentences correctly you are going to fall into the high working memory span group whereas if you could only remember one or two or maybe zero of the final words of those six sentences than you are going to be in the low working memory span group again i do not n't alarm anybody this does not mean that you have any global memory defacits or dopeming deficits but it is impordant especiall ifo you plan to apply any of the protocalls to improve working memory that you faithfully that is you accurately report your working memory performance at least to yourself now as you recall whether not you have low or high and here we are just binning into low and high there is no medium we have divided right at that line we are saying if you remember three to six recalling that high working memory span at least for this discussion and if you remember fewer than three even down to zero of the final words of those sentes that is low working memory span we are dividing into wee divided you into two groups and we do know when this has been done in large numbers of human subjects and some in some cases all of those subjects have their brains image for the amount of dopeming available for release in their prefrontal quartex that short working memory span correlates with lower amounts of dopeming whereas higher working memory span wer longer working memory span what every one call it correlates with more dopamean available for releyse in the prefrontal quartax now this is where things get really interesting and frankly really ex citing for everybody especially the folks in the low working memory span group work from martes bezito and colleagues at you see birkly as well as other laboratories have explored the consequences of increasing dopoming levels in the brain of typical p opulations of individual these are not people with parkinsons or t b e but undergraduate students which we do realize is not completely representive of the quote coled normal population outside the university but also people from the community people were not university students and on and the ways that they have increased opeming in those individuals had tended to rely on pharmacology these are prescription drugs that most often have been developed for the treatment of parkinsons in order to increase dopaming levels but for some other purposes as well drugs beromo criptine which we know are called dopamine agonists an agonists is a drug that has the consequence of increasing the amount of a given nor a chemical in this case dopamine whereas an antagonist is a drug that either blocks or prevents or somehow lowers the total available amount of a certain chemical such as dopamine or ceratona et cetera bromo criptine is he drug that increases dopamine when human subjects came into e laboratory didn' take any drug nobroma criptine yet and of course they were being valuative for whether not they were taking any meds for eighty eightt either cafine consumption et cetera there were certain rulins and rule outs for that study but certainly people that were taking any kind of prescription medication for eighty eight t were not included in the study were reliminated from the study because those drugs can indeed increase dopamine as well as some other nermodulator such is nor upan efrant an epanefrani covered all that in that two eighty eight t episodes that i did which again you confinement human lab not come just go to the search function put in eighty eighty in any event in the studies they took people that had not taken any drugs to increase dopamine had their working memory measured very similarly to the way that you measured your working memory a few minutes ago with the six sentence business that we did and then they took bromo criptine and they either took a low a moderate or hydos of broma criptine and ninety minutes later they took a working memory task and what was observed was very interesting you can probably predict what it is based on everything i've set up until now individuals that initially had low baseline levels of dopaming and therefore shorter working memory spin they only remembered zero to about three of the final words of that six sentence series their performance significantly improved they were able to remember for and in some cases up to six of the final words of those sentences now that is in complete agreement with everything we set up until now simply says that dopamis import for working memory if you start offor lower dopamine stores or dopeming availability for release in the profonto quartexs lower working memory performance increased dopamine through ingestion of broma criptine which is a dopmeine agonist all of the circuit changes that we want and would expect to improve working memory occur and indeed working memory improves very straightforward that is interesting but the even more interesting part of the study is that ind ividuals that already had high working memory span when they took bromacriptine at a low or a moderate dose their working memory did not increase further now if somebody was already getting six of the final words of those six sentences well then of course they could not improve their performance any more but many of the people in the high working memory span group of course only remembered for in some cases three typically wou be four five or six of the final words of those sentences when they took bromocripting at low or moderate doses their working memory did not improve significantly there was either no change or a very modest change and here is where things get really interesting when individuals who already had a high working memory span took the highest dose of romacriptine and by the way studies verified that the amount of dopeming available indeed increased that was important to do and they did that well theiremorking memory performance actually decreased such that now they had a short or a low working memory span what this tells us is that the relationship between dopeming and working memory follows an inverted ushape function o imagine a you and there is flippit over meaning if you have low dopaming availability in the prefrontal quartexts working memory span is short as you increase that amount working memory becomes greater but if you increase the amount of dopeming in the prefrontal quartex too much working memory span actually drops significantly below the base line that you started with now this is important for a number of reasons not the least of which is the known relationship between working memory and attention now this is very important understand in the contects of eighty eigh t but also for people who do not have eighty h t and are struggling to maintain focus and attention and carry out working memory tasks throughout their normal every day life not in the laboratory ba jus moving through life because these days we hear a lot a lot a lot about people struggling with focus an attention perhaps we do not know perhaps in part do to over use of smart phoned social mediat settera although there is not yet a direct causal relationship that is been established the data that are emerging suggests that indeed over use of those things can cause problems but regardless of the source there does seem to be more eight h t both in kids and an adults and subclinical challengeis in focus an attention and here is were things get really interesting as it relates to the nerl circuitry work from desposido in colleagues and other laboratories as well have shown using the similar paradime that i describe before o giving people drugs to increase their baseline levels of dopemine above their initial starting point of short or long term memory span capacity and then had people cperform different types of working memory tasks that tappened to two different aspects of attention in working memory up until now we have been talkingabout working memory con just one thing but working memory actually involves two things or at least two things the first is that in order to carry out a working memory task an to attend to something really focus we need the ability to rule out distractors we need to be able to not pay attention to things that would otherwise distract us in addition to that we need to be able to swhitch from one contact to the nects right making the cup of coffee to putting on one shoes and heading out the door and in some cases lairing different contects together talking n the phone while tying one shoes and on and forth what this work shows us is that the ability to tasks which and contacts which that is to shift around what it is that were paying attention to an interleve diferent thngs that were paying attention to something it is critical for moving throughour daily lives is largely dependent on the dopamine projections to a structure in the brain called the basil ganglia which is a structure i've talked about before on this podcask but if you did not hear about it we can just broadly define thes structure as being involved in movement generation and stoping movement generation in fact it is often discussed as the nurl circuitry that generates go as in du commands and nogo do not do commands the basil ganglea are involved in tasks witching and theyre involved in tass whiching in part by sending certain commands to go do certain things and no go to not do other things itasks witching stop doing this start doing that start doing that stop doing this and sometimes to varying extentright iman we could take any real world senareo of tying one shoes while talking on the phone nd we could michroanalyze it in the contects of this but i thing a if you think about it just a little bit you understand that in order to perform daily tasks we need to be able to tasks witch and that is not always a start one task end start a new task and oftentimes were interleving different task of varying degrees now the other aspect of working memory in attention is to eliminate distractions to not pay attention to the irrelevant stuff in one's environment or even the irrelevant stuff on your own body you cank at distracted by a button that mi do not be only partially buttoned or maybe some little something on your sleeve if you are trying to do something else at that moment gan people with ghty h t and people who have sub clinical challenges and focus really have a hard time with this right the the sort of stereotype is oknow the o look a squirrel that whole thing but wreally this typically exists as a more subtle and challenging phenomenon for people with they either cannot remember what they were doing or there simply drawn down different trajectories different thought trojectories or action trojectories and then they have a hard time making it back to the original thing that they were trying to focus on and we know based only studies of dopaming and orimaging that eliminating distractors is largely the consequence of dopaminerons projecting to the prefrontal quartacs o kag now why am i telling you all this neral circuitry stuff well yes there are a bunch of studies showing that you selectively activate the nurons that send dopamine into the basel ganglia you improve tasks whiching ability without an improved ability to rule out distractors or if you selectively increase the amount of dopamine from nuron's projecting the prefuntoe quartaxts thatyou are able to selectively improve the elimination of distractors without improving tasks witching ability for practical purposes in this discussion we want to pay careful attention to whether not the data tell us that those particular protocals those particular approaches ar globily increasing dopomine that is increasing the activity of dopamine nurons projecting to the basil ganglea and the prefrontal quartec or selectively to the bazil ganglea or selectively to the prefrontal quartex and when i can tell you now is that fortunately there are several protocal some of which are behavioral some of which involve specific over the counter supplements and some of which involve prescription farmicology that can tap into each of these systems independently as well as globily increase dopomine to improve focas in working memory at large i to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratioes of the electrolike sodium magnesium and petassium and that correct ratio of electrolites is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve sells your nurons relies on electrolites in order to function properly when your well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolites in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved i drink one packet of element dissolved in about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water when i wake up in the morning as well as while i exercise and if i've sweat aloturing that exercise i often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water after i exercise element comes in a variety of it from flavors all of which i find really tasty i the citris i the water melone the raspberry frankly i cannot pic just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate ment which i find taste best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up i tend to do that in the winter months because of course you do not just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you to try element you can go to drink element spelled elemente docom slash hubermen to try a free sample pack again that is drink element docom slash hubermen ocaso let us talk about protocals to improve working memory specifically by way of changing levels of dopomine in the brain now i've discussed dopomine many times before in this pot cas in fact we have entire episodes devoted to optimizing and regulating dopomine and of course dopomine comes up within the context of the ght h episodes and other episodes as well and again if you have specific questions about dopamine or any other topic for that matter if you go to huberman labdot com that webside has been engineerd that you can put one words such as dopomine but also multiple key word perhaps dopomine exercise or dopomine cold plunge et cetera into the search function and it will take you to the specific time stamps of multiple episodes where those topics were discussed as well as news letters where some of that imformation has been condensed into short pedia form et cetera we certainly are going to cover some material about improving dopoming forsake of improving working memory now but if you are generally nterested in the science and pharmocology of dopomine and protocols to modulate dopamin levels all of that can be found at yuverman labdakcom ogesto let' say you have a short working memory spand or a moderate working memory spand and you want to experiment with increasing levels of dopamin forsake of improving working memory now there are a lot of different ways that one cand imagine doing that let us start with the behavrial tools known to increased dopamin stores that is shown in purevied studies to increase dopomin stores within certain circuits of the brain that are relevant for working memory performance and the protocal that immediately leeps to mind is the use of certain non sleep deep rest protocals now non sleep deep rest or anesty ar is at she a term that i coined because there is a practice that is been established for many hundreds of years called yoganedra which actually means yoga sleep whereby individuals potentially you if you decide to do them lie down listen to a script that is listen to an audio script which generally instructs you to do long exhal breathing to deliberately relax your musculature of your face and of your body and yoganedr typically also involves doing certain intentions and the instruction always given at the beginning of yoganedra is that you should try to not fall asleep now some people sometimes fall asleep om people do not fall asleep but the idea and there are data support that yoganedra puts peeple into and of a shallow pattern of sleep om certainly not deep sleep and not rapidi movement sleep but it is a very interesting and unusual brain state for which we are starting to understand more and actually o i've some plans and the not to distant future fto collaborate with matthew walker the au thorg the book why we sleep and some othercolligues to try and figure out what exact patterns of neral activity are taking place in the brain and rest of nervous system during yoganedra end this similar protocol which i call non sleep deep rest the difference between yoganedra and nonsleep deep rest is that non sleep deep rest does not include any of the intentions and removes tha lot of the cand of opake or sometimes called mystical language from the protocal now a great thing is that yoganedra scripts or protocols as well as enesty are scripts or protocols are available totally zero cost you can find them certainly on apts waking up but also on ou tube for instance if you put and e t ar and my last name thereis a ten minute and astiar script there there are lot of yoganedr scripts if you prefer a female voice there lot of different excellent female voices out there one in particular that i very much is kelly boys for same kelly last name b o wy s she has both yoganedra and an tr scripts of various durations of anywhere from eight minutes all the way out to i believe forty five minutes why am i telling you all this well there ben several studies but in particular one and i do realize for talkingment only one study but the results are really intriguing as it relates to what we are talking about to day in the study they had individuals du effectively in anesty ar protocl they call it yoganedra and the protocall they used was essentially yoganedra script they had people lie down and listen to a yoganedra script and to perform yogenedra and they avaluated the amount of dopamine available within the brain both prior to and after performing this yogenedr script and what they discovered was that after performing a yogenedra protocall the base line levels of dopaomine that is the amount of dopamine available in the bazol ganglia and a few other structures of the human brain cor these are humans was increased by as much as sixty per cent as compared to individuals that did a different protocal not yogenedra not an estiar now did that study evaluate lots of different durations of yogenedra ak a anestyar no they looked at fairly long hour plus yogenedra sessions however there'e some other data that have explored yogenedra ak a anestiar in the context of cogna performance and a few other circumstances all of which point to the fact that cognive performance and in particular cognav performance task that have a working memory element to them they were not the exact workumemory tasks that you did earlier but they have a working memory element to them that is subjects had to keep certain small matches of information in mind and then discard that information in order to be able to perform the task well all those show significant improvements in task performance while something enestiar yoganedra might sound kind of mistical or kind of wisouashir igasas a the kid sa weak soce a to some of you it is anything but weak sause it is really powerful stuff and its powerful stuff as it relates to the very narrow chemicals and neral circuits that are involved in working memory if i were to take a step back and jo sayca whater some zero cost very low if any risk protocalls that one could perform in order to improve dopamine levels without having to injest anything take anything really do much of anything at all except lie there do this progressive muscle relaxation there are few other things involved in anastar as well which you will learn if you decide to try them and improve or increase the levels of dopomin availability in the brain significantly well then enestiar in yogenedra really are the first line tools if one wants to do that i think it is reasonable to say that as i mention before there is no reason think that there is any risk of doing an estiar yogenedra youn provide that you are lying down a safe place on suppose tolike in the middle the road or something but assuming you do it in a safe location i would encourage you to try it for really for twenty to thirty minutes when you first explore it perhaps you do longer although i personally have a hard time doing long yoganedrscripts regularly of full hours of big commitmen i do not generally have that much time i often will do a ten minute an astiar have there been brain imaging experments done for each and all of these yoganedrscripts to determine the amount or if there is any dopomine increase within the brain no but i think that we can safely extrapelate from that wonderful study out of skin an avia that showed that when human subj icts do this yoganedri protocall that there is a significant increase in baseline dopamine levels within keeneral structures that relate to working memory now many of you perhaps heard that getting in a cold plunge or taking a cold shower or provided you can do it safely getting into a cold ocean or a cold lake can significantly maybe even double or even triple you are circulating dopamin levels and indeed that is true it has been shown that when people get into cold water typically up to their neck and that cold water by the way can range in temperature anywhere from low forties to low sixties depending on how long you stay in that there is a significant increase in the called circuling catacolamines what are the catacolamines the catacolamins are dopaming nor up aneffrnt in epan effrnt now the evidence for the catacolamean increase in response to cold water mainly stems from two studies and in particular one and in that particular study they had people get into i wouln't say super cold water as in the low sixty degrees an by the wy an speaking ferenheiht here and they had those human subjects submerge in water up to their neck i think they i should have them sitting in long chairs on the bottom of pool a but again their heads where above water they could breathe and they stayed in for quite a long while ou forty five minutes are longer and it was observed that there was a big big statistically significant increase ind epan effran nor up an effran in dopaming that lasted several hours or more this is one of the reasons why if you have ever done deliberate cold exposure as it is called it often is uncomfortable when you get in but then when you get out you feel different you feel really good in most cases provided if you are m you take a warm shower afterwards yes i to do that i realize if you will not increae your metabolism perhaps it is better do not warm up afterwards i an ice warm shower or to get in thes on afterwards that is just me but none the less deliberate cold exposure clearly induces a state shift of mind in body that most people provided they do it correctly and they do not go into water that far too cold for them for too long they report as pleasant and i think it is reasonable to assume that some of that is the consequence of these increases in catacolamines which is why many people ot for a cold shower which if you'r me col shower followed by a warmer hot shower er a cold plunge in the morning or maybeven just once or twice a week many people them typically people getting out of them and the feeling that they have after they do them although some of you sicos really the feeling of getting in and being in it but not me the point here is that if we were to take a look at the landscape of zerocost behavioural tools in fact behavrial tools that could protentially save you money meaning reduce your heating bill that are known to increase the very nerow chemicals a c dopamen that are involved in improving working memory i think it is reasonable to assume that a cold shower about thirty te sixty minutes prior to doing any kind of working memory task or any kind of activity that were to require increased focus could be oce we do not know the specific studies have not been done but could be in theory imake sense mechanistically it is logically sound could be done after deliberate cold exposure and indeed many people report not jus feeling bit of mild you fory or feeling good after deliberate cold exposure but also an increase capacity to focus in fact much that a lot of people who do deliberate cold exposure say that they do not require as much caffin in order to maintain their elertness and energy which should not be surprising to us at all right i mean it is increasing catacolamenes we know this s that is another protocal that you could explorer as well is there an important difference or not between deliberate cold exposure done my cold shower or deliberate cold exposure in a cold plunge or the ocean frankly there have not been a lot of studies comparing those but i think it stands to reason that if you have access to a coal plunge or col body of water that yo can safely get into up to your neck for thirty seconds to a minute if it is fifty degrees or less right if you get in colder water we know for instance if you get into say forty five degree water and you only get in for thirty seconds you are going to get a big increae in the catacolomeans perhaps as big as the catacolamean increase that you would get from being in sixty degree water for forty five minutes most people do not have forty five minutes to sit around in water up to their neck most people ot for thirty seconds to as much as three minutes deliberate cold exposure in a shower or coal plonge or other body of water can only do this if you can do it safely never ever please for the love of god please never ever do any kind of hyper ventilation breathing or breath holding while doing delierate cold exposure because you can pass out you can die do not combine breath work and deliberate cold exposure just do not separate those two things completely o ki but deliberate col exposure we know is a very reliable way to increase the catacolameans which includes dopomen if you want to explore deliberate cold exposure protocals get into the new ants of temperature and duration et cetera you can find that completely zero cosco to hubuman labdok calm go to the manutapscroal down a news letter and go to the cold exposure newsletter where it details all that in short pet for now some of you are probably asking hey what if i was in high or long working memory spand group i ought to have high baseline levels of dopamine should i not do oganedra or anesty are should i not dou deliberate cold exposure well there you are just going to have to experiment again tere's essentially zero risk to doing yoganedra and esty are as i mention before it deliberate cold exposure there is always some rists getting into water cold water peoplealways wone to kno how cold well the news letter gets to this but i'll just tell you right now as well the ideal temperature is the temperature that you can safely get into and stay in for a duration of thirty seconds to three minutes before getting out some people off to go longer but i think thirty seconds to three minutes is a good duration to work with for most people especially for going todo it frequently that temprature should be safe for you to stay in for that duration but uncomfortable enough that there is some impulse to want to get out the yeft work to stay in there the if to can a overcome that a drenal ind release and the impulse to get out it is for some people that is going to be forty five degre ese for some people be forty degrees defends on how cold adapted you are depends on how rested you are there is no specific temperture you have to really gauge for yourself and ere on the side of caution and you can experiment provided you experiment within the margins of safety if you found during the working memory tasks that you took to day tha you have a very good working memory i donly there is any reason to avoid yogenedra and estiare and deliberate cold exposure in fact tor may be reasons to increase your dopomine and other catecolamines by way of enesty ar yoganedra deliberate cold exposure perhaps for working memory performance maybe it could increase further perhaps it would decrease performance in which case there you got your answer you do not have to do those protocals again and you certainly woen want to do them before anything that involves a lot of working memory in attention but of course those protocals have other benefits as well there is no reason to avoid them entirely just perhaps avoid them within the contect of trying to improve working memory however if you are somebody that has challenges with working memory challenges with attention challenges with focus when i think that the protocals have been talking about up until now would be an excellent first for a into the sorts of things that you could do to increase dopomine and of course those other catacolomines as a way to see whether nt it agments youre focus an attention and working memory capacity now some of you are probably shouting shouting shouting what about exercise does not exercise increase dopomin it does yes there other things that increase dopomin its not jious exercise there are activities t increase dopoming some people are probies in weigt does not plank vidiogames increase dopomne sex increases dopomin chocolate increases dopomin yes yes indeed those things can increase dopomine what is interesting and important about the protocals i've been talking about however enesty ar yeoganedra deliberate cold exposure is not just that they increase dopomne but the duration over which they increase dopomi et this is very important if you want understand more about the relationship between dopomine spikes as the'r called and dopomng base line and why am emphasizing these tools that cause large long lasting increases in base line dopomine check out the episodes i did on optimizing dopomi we have got a link to them in the shownot captions now before i talk about other ways to increase dopomine for a sake of improving working memory think over the counter supplements eltire seene mcanapurine things that i do briefly want a mension and i promise briefly i know sometimes o say briefly n than i spend twenty minutes telling youabout something but very briefly i just want a spen two minutes telling you about protocals that we do not yet know whether not they increase dopomin levels but we do know that they improve working memory because after all this episode is about working memory not just about dopomin in working memory it has been shown that the use of bynoral beats oca byneral beats being the preasentation are the listening to sounds of different frequencies in the two ears typically by headphones thing that is been shown to work best and there is a subtraction between the two frequencies such that the brain tends to intrain or start to follow or particular frequency within not the entire baine but certain neral circuits if you have heard of say fifteen hurts byno ral beats are forty hurts by noral beats that does not mean that you listen to a fifteen hurt sound or a forty hurts sound you listen to two different frequency o sound it hurts is just a measurement of sound frequency in each of the two years and then the difference between them is forty hurts or fifteen hurts and there are several studies that show not enormous oca on to be clear small to moderate improvements in working memory performance but in some cases significant improvement and i'll provide a link to these two papers in the shownot captions but i'll just briefly describe them by way of their titl and their major conclusions the first is a study entitled the effects of by norl and monorl beats stimulation on cogni functioning in subjects with different levels of emotionality a really interesting study published in twenty nineteen it was a relative these small number of subjects only twenty four participants sixteen males eight males between nineteen and thirty one years old listen to these forty hurts by noral beats and by the way its very easy to find aps and other sources of forty hurts by noral beats tat zero cost or nominal cost out there ah you simply look for forty hurts by noral beats and looked at performance on working memory tasks as well as some other cognim tassin found in some cases a small to moderate but significant improvement in cognive performance on working memory task the aspect of the study looking into motionality did not find a significant effect does not seem the emotionalitya a impacts things there but none the less that study pluss the other one entitled the effect of by noral beats on visua spaceshoal working memory and cortical conuctivity this was a study posion twenty sixteen found generally something similar in this case there were using fifteen hurts by noral beats and here im on peraphrasing produced net work activity characteristic of high information transfer with consisten connection straints what the really talking bout is changes in noral activity patterns within the brain that led to or at least were correlated with improvements on visuospacial working memory visospacial working memory tasks are different than the working memory task that you performed earlier visospacial working memory tasks involve the cognitive generation that is within your head of the called visiospacial sketch pat it is this idea that you see something and then you have sketchet out in your mind youto know the relationships between things in space patention to what they are keep those in mind again cause its woring memory just as long as is necessary to perform a task that is what visospacal working memory is as you can imagine it translates to an enormous number of every day activities required for foks and attention and learning and performance and indeed fifteen hurts by noral beats was able to produce a small but significant improvement in that sort of working memory task i wont emphasize again we do not know the relationship between by noral beats and dopaming at least not from these studies but i felt i be remiss if i did not mention these two studies that show that forty hurts by noral beats fifteen hurts by noral beats can indeed improve working memory performance and in these sorts of cenarios individuals are listening to the by noral beats while they are doing the working memory task an in some cases before they are doing the working memory t ask either seems to work it depends on the study their much of other studies but i thought i'd mention by norobeats because i know a number of people are interested in them again nonparmicalogic zero costs because you can find tools for by noralbat generation zero cost out there approaches to improving working memory oket what about over the counter compounds that are known to increase circulating dopamine that canpotentially improve working memory and that indeed have been shown im pureviewed studies to improve working memory by way of increasing circulating presumably brain levels of dopamine well i can think of to specific categories of supplements that is over the counter compounds that at least at this point in time are legal in the united states that can increase dopamine levels those two are el tirosine which is an a menoacid precurser to dopamine and macuna purings which is a believer ore not it is the a velvety being or the ouder component of this velvety being that contains or is a quivalent to ninety nine per cent el dopa el dopa is a key component in the bchemical cascade leading to the production of dopamine in fact el dopa is often pescribed for parkinson's pationts as a means to increase the dopamin levels therere at least three studies that i am aware of of the use of macunipurins to increase dopamine for the treatment of parkinsins in other words macunipurines increases dopamin levels and yes it has been shown to improve some of those symptoms of parkinson's pationts were not talking about treatment of parkinsons to day i wan a caution people o gainst any sort of use of supplements to treat parkinsins or other conditions without consulting your doctor are at thits very very critical to point out for talking about ways to increase dopomine for sake of improving working memory by way of supplementation they we should start with eltirosine because el tirasine unlike macunipurines is a bit further up acch its way further up the bi chemical cascade leading to dopaming production however it has been shown in several studies that el tirasine supplementation can indeed increase dopamine and moreover and hereim quoting the title of a study publishin nineteen ninety nine which i realizes a few years back but course their some excellent studies from a few years back or more tirisine improves working memory in a multi tasking environment now this particular study from thomas at all has some interesting aspects and some aspects that made me go a little bit wide eyed but not assurely wide eyed because the results are dramatic in fact when when looks at all of the date in this paper what you find is that supplementing with el tyrasine as they did in this study did indeed lead to improvements in working memory under multitas conditions as the title suggests those improvements worse significant but they ware not enormous okay the were statistically significant but they were not enormous increases now what was enormous and the reason i got wide eyed and still get wide eyed is that the dosages of a vil tyrasine used in thes study are really big they had subjects take a hundred fifty miligrams per kiligram of el cristaline tyrasine i have them take it in apple sauce for whatever reason or placibo and they did a number of different control conditions to make sure that whatever effects of altirasing they observed were in fact do to altirasine supplementation why am i going wide eyed when i see this a hundred fifty miligrams per kiligram of tyrasine well i waigh two hundre and twenty pounds that is about one hundred kiligrams if i way one hundred kilgrams and it is a hundred fifty miligrams for every kiligram that means that if i were a subject in the study that they would give me fifteen thousan miligrams that is fifteen grams of altrasine prior to doing these cognave task now fifteen grams of tirasine to me seems a very very highdose and i frankly cannot in good conscience recommend that why well maybe i'm just hyper sensitive to eltirasine but i've taken one thousand or fifteen hundred miligrams of altirasine and ive definitely experienced an increase in alertness from taking one point five grams not fifteen one point fivegrams of altirasine and in fact at a subjective level i can feel a meaningful increase in alertness an focus from five hundred miligrams of altirasne i cannot in good conscience suggest that people replicate the exact doke's protocalls within the study none the less the study as the title suggests shows that supplementing with eltirsine can indeed increase working memory capacity especially in a multitaskiheg environment which in many ways carries over to the sorts of requirements for working memory in attention capacity to get through life in a very focus for lack of a better word way in a very regiment od do this do that tasks which multiple things interleve that is what moving through one's day or at least work day or anything that cars cognition and focus in tails first of all i'll just say what i always say when discussing any kind of compound or prescription drug never add or remove any supplement from your supplement regiment if you have one without consulting with your health providor first to make sure that you are safe to take that particular supplement now many physicians emdees are not familiar with most supplements your pobling me to bring some literature om to the phone caller to the visit but of course there are many health car providers including some emdies that are open to supplementation especially these days om as supplements have become a whit is a generally more accepted i'm in their certain ones vitemende three that and fishal oils and things that that are more common than altirasine but there are many physicions who are open to discussions about supplements such as altirasne if that you can supplement with altrasne safely and you ought to do what dosages would you patentially take well here we have to look at the dosages used in these studies i think it is only fair s only safe that we acknowledge that these dosges are really really high and i think the logical the safe thing to do would be to start with the minimal effective dose if you way fifty kiligrams rather than start right off with the equivalent dosage to this study maybe start with two hundre and fifty miligrams of eltirasine if you way a bit more me you are a hundred kilegrams or seventy five kilegrams maybe you take five hundred melegrams of eltirasine and see whether r not you experience a significant effect on working memory attention and performance the idea here is to establish the minimal effective dose i should also point out that some people not all but some people experience a bit of a crash after eltirasine supplementation such that they feel more alert more focust better ability to perform working memory tasks move about their day but than three or four hours later experience kind of a drop you need to be mindful of that infacting yon to be mindful of any kind of parm acology where youre increasing dopamine this is one of the reasons why a the behaviour of protocals that we talked about earlier because they are known to create big but long lasting and slowly tapering off increases in dopaming another catacolamines now for those who are curious about and perhaps you want a tri maccunapurians please absolutely talk to your doctor first mccunapurians is essentially the equivalent of el doby el dopa is a prescription drug as i mention before and macuna purins potently increases dopamine what dosages of macunopurins can increased dopamine well typically in studies of parkinsins pations but also studies exploring typical people who do not have parkinsons in cognive tasks or in sports performance have explored anywhere from one to five grams of macunapurines macuna perins again is a very potent way to increased dopamine and here if youre healthcure provider approves it and you decide to try it i would suggest starting with a very very low dose again to find the minimal effective dose maybe even just five hundred miligrams not even going to the one gram dose maybe even two hundred fifty melegrams and really evaluating how much macuni perience can produce a meaningful of impact on working memory and attention for you mccuna purians is kind of a bridge between over the counter supplements and prescription drugs i say it is a bridge because it is o similar to that prescription drug el dopa and of course there is a long list of prescription drugs that are known to be dopamine agonists several of which many of which in fact have been shown to improve working memory you already learned about one of those before which is bromocriptine now you need a prescription from a physicion to get bromacriptine but broma criptine we know based on that work from despozito in colleaes that i talked about earlier increases dopamine it does in about ninety minutes it achieves peak levels of doping about ninety minutes and improves working memory in individuals that start off with a low working memory span and we know from nerimaging those of the individuals with lower base line levels of dopamine should you run out and ask your doctor for bromo criptine maybe most doctors will not prescribe romo cripting for that reason i should mention that work from dispozido lab and other laboratories has shown that one of the hall marked features of tramatic brain injury especia fruntalobe injury as well as certain nergegenerav conditions parkinsons but other forms of dementia as well as eight h t involved dephisits an working memory and attention which make sense given what we know about the symptoms of those conditions and that bromacriptine has been prescribed of label for the treatment of those conditions to some degree of success however those are off label circumstances right now as far as i know bromocriptine is not prescribe specifically for those conditions at a kind of whole population level it is not one of the drugs on the look up tabel for eighty eih t or t b e but certain well informed neurologists and physicians do prescribe it for that reason there are other dopominagonists that are relevan in this context the ones that i think most of you will be familiar with are the drugs that increase dopamine and norepinefran for the treatment of eight gh t and i did not entire episode to the human labpodcast about those compounds things aterall things riddlin which by the way is quite differnt than aterall in terms of how much dopamine relative to repineferan causes the increase of i cover all that in those episodes and you can simply go to hubram labdocom put eighty gh t aterall or eighty eigh t riddlin and i talk about other things as well also tuckalobit about modapinil which is a entirely different category of drug known to im prove cognave performance in some cases and eighty eh t but in everybody there are lot of different drugs that can improve working memory most of those do by increasing transmission of dopamine or availability of dopaming somehow changing dopamine levels in the brain by increasing them if your somebody that has challenges with working memory focus and attention pleas see those episodes and please talk to your doctor about potentially using pharmacology to increase dopamine however and this is very important many people who have challenges with focus attention and working memory and fall under the category of sub clinical levels of eighty eigh t and even some individuals of the eihty eigh t young and old manage their symptems and some cases improve their focus through the use of behavioural tools nutritional tools supplement base tools in ways that either allow them to reduce their total prescription drug dosages in some cases come off them entirely now i am definitely not saying that people should come off those drugs entirely and in fact i want to take a really firm stand here cause i know this is a bit controversial but i'm just going to tell you having avaluated the whole literature several times over now i do think i personally believe that there is a strong case for certain children and adults to take these compounds th increase dopamine and epineferan yes those compounds are different forms of imphedemine but those compounds we know can increase nerl plasticity the rewiring el t p el t d et cetera within the neurl circuits that control focus attention and working memory and they do have their place for certain individuals we do not want o rule those out are they over prescribed my feeling is that yes they are probably over prescribed however there are number of individuals that strongly benefit from them s well if you are going to explore te use of those compounds for sake of improving working memory certainly if you are going to explore them for sake of improving working memory in focus in young kids please please please talk to your physician because their prescription drugs you would need to toctraphysician anyway but regardless of whether not you trying to improve focus in working memory in a child in an adult some one with te b eye some one with parkinsons i think it stands to reason that you would arrive to that conversation with some knowledge of not just the prescription drugs that a are potentially available but also some of the supplement base tools some of the behaviral tools because as we know and as a good friend of mine whois an excellent physician says better living through chemistry still requires better living meaning yes prescription drugs can have a positive impact on these aspects of brain function in a way that can really improve lives but that behavioral tools also work in fact they can collaborate in a very synergistic way to increase the amount of neuro plasticity in their relevants circuits i'm of the mind and i think more and more people out there i to thinker of the mind that behaviors nutrician supplement base tools and prescription drugs all can have their place to varying degrees depending on the circumstances and the individual o cs to day we talked about working memory this incredible capacity of our brain in fact a specific set of brain circuits design for us to absorb information that is perceive it in our environment youuse the relevant parts and then chuck it just get rid of it forget it very different than short and longter memory which we also discussed and we talk about a few of the mechanisms as well i think you will agree that working memory is one of the more incredible aspects to brain function of m if you think about this is a a set of neral circuits that engage the same algar of them over and over in different contects in order for us to be able to navigate new environments familiar environments to interleve different activities different strategies to tass which to rule out distractors it is o cridical to every aspect of our waking life and fortunately there are also zero cost and low cost behavial supplement based and prescription drug approaches to improving this incredible thing we call working memory it was a pleasure to share some of those with you today as well if your learning from and your enjoying this podcast please

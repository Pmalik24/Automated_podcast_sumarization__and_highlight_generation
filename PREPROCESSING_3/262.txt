amd in the office of doctor elja drake ofitch who examined the dead bodies for the police and ponyac mich again and hes running tho this caracell sides all of the murder victims ther closips of body parts to say as he uslake through these things i ithe grislie sledge oer sen lik every side is some and there is another story yes every crime scen is a story of it to is a novel and it opens up in every direction ndtillustrate he does me this story back when he worked in the wing county coroner's office and detried there is young woman thestory by the way probably is not suitable for younger children okanyway this is young woman she apparently killed herself by taking her boy friend's gon putting in her mouth and firing iws roe a suicide that is of the police thought that is whit the other medical examiner's thought buet doctor drake ofitch wondere this woman did not have a history of depression ino note my collings teas me is being baronoi in the seeing things where they were not is the examination ncoulding the inside of the woman's mouth and this particular case the tongue sho to hols two holls he says is very strange in this cimming case tas usually toll me this gets a littl explicit again usually he says wen people shoot themselves in the mouth to kill themselves the cont of point the gun upward toward the bran the tongue does not get invoped at all does not get interd the only way this couldhave happened he realized is it the tonge was all bunchedop con of pushing against the tip of the gun the muzzle of the gun whin the gun went off but why would you do that why put your tongue there if you were killing yourself in my as sessiment o this this was a homiside no to i know for sure no i did not but that is to the logic to i told the dectives the tebt was my finding they went theck to interview the boistren and they said we know that you shoter i sid no i did not sid yes we know the doctor told us is sid what doct s is the doctor that did the audubsy said what audupsy i call the corner's office two weeks ago and he told me they never did autufseson suicides e cors yin ner why call the coroner's office to ask that question if you are not panting on killing anybody it did not take very long after that he said for this gy to confess s doctor drakeovitch says every crimescene is a novel rredanerate your programe we dive into those crime scenes and the novels that led to them from te bybe easy chicago its this american life m myrglass and you kno the thing that makes a crime scene such a strange kick off to any story any detectives investigation is that the crime scene is filled with details but it is totaly a queer which one to the important ones yours back i was talking to this former friends that criminologist recotoniary about this and hes as surer at a crime scene there is all the stuff you would imagine from watching crime shows on tv the way the blood splattered on the floor a broken glass fell and give helpful

about a boy who would be handy to have herat at lots of crime scenes af to say this wormy favorite pieces of fiction we have ever put on the redio shop her story was read frs by acter matboy once there was an oriphan who had a nack for finding lost things both his parents had been killed when he was eight years old there were swimming in the ocean when it turned wild with waves and each had tried to save the other from drowning the boy woke up from a nap on the sand alone after the tragedy the community adopted and raised him and a few years af or the deat of his parents he began to have hi sense of objects even when they were not visible this ability continued growing ind power through his teems and by his twenties he was able to actually sniff out lost sun glasses keys contact lenses and sletters the neighbors discovered his talent accidentaly he was over a jenny sugar's house one evening picking her up for a date when jenny's mother misplaced her hairbrush and was walking around complaining about this the young man's nose twitched and he turned slegtly towards the kitchen and pointed to the drawer where the spoons and nies for cap his date burst into laughter now that would be quite a silly place to put the brush she sad among all that silverwhare and she opened the drawer to make her point to wave with the nife for brush her hair with a spoon but when she did poom there was the hairbrush madded with gray curls sitting on top of the forepile jenny's mother kissed the young man on the cheek but jenny herself looked at him suspiciously all night long you planned all that did not you she said over dinner he were trying to impress my mother well you did not impress me she said he tried to explain himself but she would hear none of it and when he drove his car up to her house she fled before he could even finishe saying he would had a nice time which was a lie anyway he went home to his tiny room and thought about the word lonely and how it sounded and looked lonely with those two ells in it each standing tall by itself as'news spread around the neighborhood about the young man's skills people reacted in two ways there were the deeply appreciative and the sceptics the appreciative ones called up the young ma n regularly he would stopped by on his way to school find their keys and ha'd give him a home made muffin the sceptics called him over too and watched him a halk he would still find their lost items but they would insisted was an elaborate scam and he was doing it all to get attention maybe declared one woman waving her indeck's finger in the air maybe she said he steals the thing we think its lost moves the item and then comes over to save it how do we know it was really lost in the first place what is going on the young man did not know himselt all he knew was the feeling of a tug light but in sistent a child at his sleeve and that tug would turn him in the right direction and shome where look each object had its own way of inhabiting space and therefore messaging its location the young man could sense culd small an objects pressons he did not need to see it to feel where it put its gravity down as would be expected items that turned out to be miles away to much harder concentration tan the ones that were too feet to the left when missus allan's little boy did not come home one afternoon that was the most difficult of all leonard allan was eight years old and usually rived home from school wat threeo fide he ad allargies and needed a pill before he went back out to play that day by three forty five alone missus alland was a wreck her boy rarely got lost only once had that happened in the supermarket but he would been found quite easily under the produce tables crying the walk home from school was a straight line and lenard was not the wandering kind missus allan was just a regular neighbor except for one extraordinary fact throug an inheritance she was the owner of a gargancuin emerald she called the green star it sat glass cased in her kitchion where everyone could see it because she insisted that it be seen sometimes as a party trick she would even cut stake with its bevelled edge on this day she took the green star out of its case and stuck her palms on it where is fy boy she cride the green' star was cold and flact she ran weeping to her neighbour who calmly walked her back home to gather they gave the house a thorough search and then the neighbor op believor recommended calling the young man although missus allan was a sceptic she thought anything was worth while idea and when the phone answered she said in a trembling voice you must find my boy the young man had been just about to go play basketball with his friends he would located the basketbal an the bath tub you lost him said the young man missus allan began to explain and then her fhone clickt one moment please she said and the young man held on when her voice returned it was shaking with rage he is been kidnapped she said they want the green star the young man realized then that it was missus alland he was talking to and nodded oh he said i see everyone in town was familiar with missus allan's green star i'll be right over he said the woman's voice was too run with tears to restid in his baskopall shortsind shirt the young man jogged over to missus allan's house he was amazed at how the green star was all exactly the same shade of green he had a desire to licket by then missus allan was in hysterics they did not tell me what to do she sobbed where do i bring my emerald how do i get my boy back the young man tried to feel the sent of the boy he asked for a photograph and stared at it a brown haired kid at his kindegarden graduation but the young man had only found objects before and lost objects at that he never found anything or anybody stolen he was not a policeman missus allen called the police and one officer showed up at the door oh it is the finding guy the officer said the young man dipped his head modestly he turned to his right to his left north south he got a glimmer of a feeling towards the north and walked out the back door through the back yard night approached and the sky seemed to grow and deepene in the darkness what is his name again he called back to mis sus allen leonard she said he heard the policeman pull out a pad and begin to ask basic questions he could not quite feel him he felt the air and he felt the tug in side tho green star an object displaced from its original home in asia he felt the tug of a tree in the front yard which had been uprooted from virginia to be reglend in hear and he felt the tug of his own watch which was from his uncl land an attempt to be fatherly his uncle would insisted he take it but they both knew the gesture was falls maybe the boy was too far away by now he heard the policeman asked what is he wearing missus allen described to blue shirt and the young man folcust in on the blutoner he turned off his distractions and the blue shirt came calling from the north west a distant radio station the young man went walking and walking and about fourteen houses down he felt the blue shirt shrieking at him and he walked right into the back yard right through the back or and sure enough there were four people watching toe including the tear stained boy with a runny nose eating a candy bar the young man scooped up the boy while the others watched surprise tay did nothing and one even muttered sorry man co for fourteen houses back the young man held leonard and his arm an e brie leonard stop sneezing and looked up at the stars and the young man smelled leonard's hair rich with the memory peen at bynerhe helped leonard would asked him a question any gruc but leonard was quiet the young man answered and his head son hesind to in sel and the word rolled around a marble on a marble floor son he wanted to say when he reached missus allen's door which was wide open he walked in with quiet leonard and missus allen promptly burst into tears and the policeman slunk out the door she thanked the young man a thousand times even offered him the green star but he refused it leonard turned on the t v and curled up on the sofa the young man walked over and asked him about the program he was watching but leonard stuck his thumb in his mouth and did not respond feel better he said softly tucking the baskeball beneath his arm the young man walked home shoulders low in his tiny room he undressed and lay in bed had it in a naked shild with nothing on no shoes no necklace no hairabl no watch he could not have found it he lay in bed that night with the trees from other places rustling and he could feel their confusion no sno heu not o arain where am i whis wrong with this tir crossing his hands in front of him he held on to his shoulders consentrate hard he thought where are you everything felt blank and quiet he could not feel a tug he squeezed his eyes shot and left the

bring you different kinds of stories on that theme to day show crime scenes in the stories they tell to day's upised first tair years ago an i someway we realized heure ad a programe that we had a question an actual question about crime scenes something wondered about watching the news i a om banat amol oa sic acologist o yearop acologist a question was about always shootings in the way the crimesen evidence could be in terpreted after the fact differently by different people s for example after stuff on clark was shot by sacramentapliese back in twenty eighteene conny coroner did an official otopsy for the state but in addition to that the family also hired a well known frencs is tathologist this man ou're hearing right now then it a mawo whto doan altopsy for them he announce his findings of theis press conferenc and on't if you remember that case but stuff on clark was twenty two years old unarmed shopy police multiple times doctor mais and alicis came out before the county corners iand he was definitive about a number of thing e we a tol te lo eit con sho once mem go he was heat i e fole the first shot amawas said it stuff on clark in the side witen spun him around his back was to the officers then six of the eight shots were til his back yuthat is a different story thin the police had told plesa said he was advancing towards them when the fired the caasishi tat hosce i sen a a he was a silly the fi sers is a co sisto wi i fit filly fora sic abit weeks later the county reesed its report it was different doctor malwas report in some significant ways first it said there were seven bullets not eight it said only three shots were to the back not six and as for the first shot the county said it was probby to his thide and the clock probably was walking towards the officers when it happen nd we wondered here to show how could something basic be in dispute the number shots whether they entered from the backer from the front dos that inticate the one of the autopsies was deliberately spinning the results or these actual honest scientists we disagreeing about the evidence its in front of them hi asked doctor judy melaneck a vetteran friends oc pathologists who performed autopsies in the baarea for fifteen years and she said these kinds of discrepancies happen all the time when they were two autopsies of the same person said in these kinds of cases the official autopsy the coroner's office usually happens first and then the family gets to do their autopsy after that at's true even though the family usually goes public with their results first as happen in this case doctor melaneck says picture oka two autopsies by two doctors the first autopsy down by the corners office alters the body and changes the evidence it makes it a lot more difficult for the second pathologist when the second pathologist gets the body it is already been watched cueen doesnt ofe any blood stains or trace resido the first pathologists arready cut open the body it is already removed the bullets when doctor molo got the body he did not have the bullets any more they had been taken out by the first autopsy and he did not have access to the exrace of the body from the first autopsy wech ways shown him where the bullets had been he also did not have the organs in their proper orientation in the body the organs had been taken out by the previous autopsy pathologist and slie stop two identify the wound tracks and then put in plastic bag inside the body cavity the first pathologist has that advantage because they got the body pristin and it was not altered in this way doctor melaneck says there cun be lots of disagreement and it can be honest disagreement between pathologist they are people looking at different sets of data they come to different conclusions and with that we have arrived a dact three of our programm act three wer turn to the scene of the crime in o this is some true is im in detecti fiction that a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime it turns out in real life that actually is not very common at all except among arsonists arson isapparently to see the fires they have set and then some of them are actually caught when police look at pictures taken of crowds at fires and then i con ave this is rare may be not nobody really keep track o this kind of thing here e the people who circle back to the scene of the crimes to undu to race something ear least a promise that it is never gon o happen again katy davis discovered thet one of her own neighbors in washing in dce an old friend of hers was

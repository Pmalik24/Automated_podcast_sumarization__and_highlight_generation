a quick warning there are curse words that her unbeeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beaped version you can find that at our website this american life douto work started is something that she was doing in her spare time and kind of took over her life lisse yellow birds searches for missing people people nobody else is looking for people the police have given up looking for a reporter sera crane murda matlesson twenty fourteen wone sierra was looking into the disappearance of a young white oil worker casy clark hed vanished couple years before on the reservation wlisses from in northtocoda lissa was investigetting it to she had just gotten out of prison she was looking for a distraction awaitis stase ober and and she bisly opened up her files to me and allowed me to see the degree to whit she had involved herself in this case and she had actually spend years and she cracked that case through really re not traditional means by busily waging this campein agains the perison who she believed hen murderd casy clark she mailed tens and tens of thousands of fliers around western north the coda the fire sa beware with the photo of the guy she thought murder casin car and his wife in they did turn people against him but at the same time listi e friend of the one they were texting each other almost every day and they were talking on constantly and she had this really intimate window into the lives of these people she was trying to investigate and through that window she was able to see their owner abilitys the same time that she was maintaining this fo friendship with this womand she was also completely under myning her and her husband and the case brok open serra spent years with lissa watching this play out an ended up writing a book about lissa in the case they got close sierra would staylss's apartment for months they drived through the bad lands running down weeds talked for hours every week when sierra wasn'nt a north tocoda andurng thise years this thing happen native american familys started asking lissa to look for their loved once liser's a ricora remember the man dan ho dots a rikeranation member lissa was just kine of inventing how she did this wor for this she would been a welder a prison guard social worker thidsm warm forcement work and study criminal justice and college but she would also been a drugdeiler lissa has lived on both sides of the law which is what makes her good at what she does and she is gone to prison she she knowis how lon forcemen operates from a perpetrator's point of view as welf in dozens of cases now somedimes an around sometimes with lown forcemen lissa has deployed the same doggedness and resourcefulness that she marshalled in that first case lik were example when a woman amed o livia alone bere when missing from liss's reservation in twenty seventeen there was this national search for her buliss's theory was she might not be far from home wher she was last scen one day she decide to take a boat out on the near olivia's house was the fishing sonar that she bought years or lier thinking some day it might come in handy to find missing people she just launched the boat and yat within about ten minutes her younger relative spotted some sheepe on the fishing sooner and said heanty what is that and a with tha looked at it and it was a truck and and a bulivia was inside tonce we were this liss a and livia's family thi tried to convince lon forceman authorities to look in that way loto nam f americans co missi and i never found but even have good statistics on this hes her cases are under reported and poorly tract big part of the problem there these federal laws that limit who can investigate cases and how they can investigate them on reservations which leads you a jurisdictional tangle it is often not cueer which lan forceman agency is supposed to take a case if you do not know if they disappeared from onor reservation or offer reservation it is really hard to say whose responsibility that cases o the reservation triabll police wot the federal authorities off the reservation sidy your county or state police but because it is unclear those cases can become a lot lower priority or those cases can be ignored by all juristictions and and that is where lissa yellow bird comes in she searches for the peo who slip through these turs ti tional crafts wis tis ture you bot to tell son't two thousand sixteen lissas own nese went missing and this was the first time that she when searching for someone who was not a stranger she just never expected that it would happen to her own relative am but this caseis really remarkable for a lot of reasons a for one she figured it out in just five days am she also recorded all of her conversation which is something that was at does a lot she saves everything she photocrafts everything she records everything and less ha gave me these phone calls that she recorded over the course of these finve days and they were just incredible a because they really showed con how she was able to break this case open an a meed it by minute way shere says another thing about this case she enless a talk for hours all the time about everything but after this five days when listle was work in this case she just come went quiet about it we did not talk about it for years which jus really unusual because lisa is always talking about her cases am she just never talked about this case again though and i i knew that i i knew because she was quiet about it and i knew also because it was own her own relative that it had affected her in a way that no other case had am i but i did not really know why entirely i thought there was something else going on and three years passed am and that was when she finally said oki ye i'm ready to talk about it and she wanted to talk about it shres it gess to doing a story lis is said yes she wanted people to hear it and that is what wee bringing you to day we this tan and on thi ex ceptional investigator liss a yellow bird thes som cous to they are really amazing she just knows how to read people and how to pool information out of them that other people cannot get we hear a crack this case in five very intense days o be beasy chicago whichs this american life i mir a glas and efore we get to this story heads up the streammage ins violenc including sectual violence her sera crane burdock the last time i saw lisa we were at her grandma's house on the forebirthold in in reservasion this was in february her mamma called her over to find their missing cat not something wass i usually searches for it but she drove over right away in her hot pink pajamas and whele everyone is eating breakfast lhe walks to the window stares out with benoculars lissa thinks some cyotes got the cat a few days earlier her mam bought a hunting rifle and everyone is cracking up at the idea lwiss is mam ertired professor who does not to be outside and whos never had a gun taking to the porch with her rifle lissa asks her nephew mercury to teach her mam how to us it ye it is is ury icurrlissa goes to the bedroom to get the rifle she comes back holding at the tar case an hands to mercury rugret aato ea ten i can i aas a girl et was a fender da tar ao el ter wit thi chair jo seee my b ocae woeld get the last o day the yello birds are really close at any time you will find four generations of them just hanging out on thiss is gramma's house for days on end and i was at this house every one eating laughing watching tellovision whet they last saw lis's niece carlah yellow bird before she went missing thatlas an august of twenty sixteen at first they were not that worried carla did not live with a yellow birds she lived about two hours away off the reservation but she was always stopping by sometimes stayed the night she was twenty seven had lots of energy confiden she would walk into her family's house flugger iphone into their speakers and start jamming hippah and it was an unusual for carlah to take off for a few days not answer when they called when she stopped coming around her family told lisa do not worry nearly will she ju sell doing a thing i publy to wink som she should not be sol an i shall come on lisa was starting to worry though carlah wass the daughter of one of wis's favor relatives uncle chucky he died a few years earlier when of the last things he would asked lisa was to look out for carlah then one morning lisa had a dream about chucky it was not long he just kind ofe appeared and he said you need to go get carlah now lis called her family and found out the night before they dosed a holy woman to come to the house and pray for carlah they had not wanted to telllisa and oll it woulde mean you an a ceremony if you guyes tidn't think anything was wrong what would you be having a ceremony for and i should look somebody needs to come clean with me and tell me what the hell's really going on harmam told her they actually were really worried at this point no one had heard from carlah in weeks and i wid you gi is lighte me well we did not lie wes do not want you to put all lhis stuffl on sociamedia an we kno let us probably what will happen lisa's family told her they did not want it on social media out of protectiveness for carlah carlah had been in some legal trouble she was addicted to math they din't want to make things harder for her lisa thought may be they were also embarrassed in the yellow bird family our professors anthrapologists social workers all very aware of the stereotypes used to shame native communities being drunken being filthy being all these labels at the give us that when something of that nature takes over hene of our family members the last thing we want to admit is that it is hid us rat i think what it boils down to is chiny keep a good reputation i think that playd a majjor roll of shame lisa seen this first hand withow the family treated her she was addicted to math spent three years in prisone for dealing cor a while her family avoided her even now lisuspensover fifteen years and they do not to talk about it lisas mam does not even use the word preson she callsat lisa's other college lisa could not disagree more with ti satitude she believes that when some one goes missing that is the worst possible time to hide the facts often the thing some one is trying to coveher up can be part of what let them to go missing in the first place lisa called carla's mam loretta loretta lived a few hours away on another reservation and the yellow birds did not know her very well carla's parents were not together lonl lor ttold lis as shed reported carla missing a few weeks earlier lhisa offered to help find carla and loretda caid yes solisa got to work one of the first people she called was the officer responsible for the case april josie a detective for the city of manden where carla lived aprilsaid she learned that in the days before carla disappeared carlo was on the forperthold reservation and she might have gone to a second reservation called spirit lake but april did not have jurisdiction on reservations she was a city cop this is another part of the jurisdiction al tangle in these cases april was trying to follow every lead but she could only go far to interview suspects on the reservation she needed the cooperation of lon forcement there it is parta of the bureau of indian affairs but no one was calling her back she did tell me younol this spands five states and three reservations my hands are tight and i should my nar holl go wherever this is my nease solica did exactly the thing her family did not want her to do she opened face book and wrote carla yellow bird has been missing and i want a no andy and all infa related to her disapperance before i take this to the next level peopril in the broader native community no lessa the work she does when she put something on face book people respond gibre leeds they might bee more cautious about giving police she started getting calls rit away and she learned carlo was last seen driving around with two men on

nice still when carlaneeded help she often called thesa anlisa tried to help her as best she could tbecause of carla's dad chucky hes a big card of wiats taken less as long to talk about carla and why it still hurt much let me just tell you what happened a ew years before carlo an missing chucky moved him with his ma less us grandma lisa would visit him a lot spend hours in his bedroom they would flip through books together and talk about them chucky did not have as many graduate degrees as others in his family but every one said he was the smartest yellow bird it made liss i feel good to keep up with him she liked proving to herself and to chucky thuat she had not totally fried her brain with drugs they spent lots of time debating this mass of book he kept by his bed the code of federal regulations title twenty fibe it spells out how the ues government is supposed to fulfil its obligations to tribes in exchange for taking their land how would suppose to always act in their best interest for ther walpeen obligations the government has ignored in all kinds of ways both lessen chucky witnesst themselves chucky was four years old during a major event in their tribe the you as government bilt a diham flotted out most of the reservation forced every one including the yellow birds to relow ca they were farmers self sufficient but the land that government move them to was unfarmable they was huge an employmen a lot of people left the reservation for cities chucky and most of his generation were sent away to boarding schools where a lot of them were abused in his room chucky also had stacks of articles about an emerging science called epiganetics that shown how tramatic stress can change the way upper sons jane's behaves and how those changes canaffect your kids cans make it likelier that they develop illnesses depression or pitiasty chucky put into words of pattern less i had observed her whole life that she and the people she would laid her help had been delivered into his sistem where they had no chance a sistem that kept taking from them until they died and their bodies are dragged behind bushes or left to drift at the bottoms of revers and lakes and few people bother to look for them to fish them out chucky himself was not doing well he was an alcoholic he was in his early sixties and he had serosas one night when chucky was drinking he got violentand his mom kicked him out of the h ouse lsa called him and told him to come to fargo where she was living she did not think he would come but then he called her one night from a fargo hotel he would not tell her which one you's i been i've been drinking an i know yourinto brity i know your doing well i do not want to bring that to your house os well that do not make no sense cause i told

waiting for her with several investigators on his family his mam thank to lissa they had led together as soon an made his confession lisa was watching soona his rapid speech she thought he seemed tromatized she also thought he was telling the truth and when he was done he came up to lissa he sa hits orself selfish buty really wanted o i ging to go to deel to day and e unot he that question

da ther i put it seger down for carlo smo bonear ela another reason liss as still hardly tells any one about this case is i reason wit still hard for her has to do with what came afterward lisa went to carlofs funeral loretta carlos mam thanked to lissa honoured her with a star quilt but then what happened lisa kind of unraveling prosecutors began builting their case against soona and the two other guies responsible for carlofs murder and liso became the main point of contact for carlofs family she started going to all the legal meetings helping carlos mam understand what wa's going on and at the same time lisa was still talking to soon constantly a a ai a a ar a a a o i a a o o i a i a a a ye ather les slee be wellether e a i o i a a ye praly wel fi had out to mit o oly ciis for tis ro aa e a ne at first lisa had a pragmatic reason to keep talking to soona she needed him to follow through to testifying carlofs case against the two other guises involved lisa worried for soon as safety he wanted witness protection she started calling around on his behalf lhen the prosecutor found out about this that lissa was advicating for soona she made carla's mam laretta the spokes person for the family and stopped inviting liss at a meetings thisically icedlissa out the court stopped notifying lisa about hearing sin carla's case court officials told her we only do that for the victims immediate family csoona pled guilty to fellany murder meaning he committed a crime that led to carla's dath even if he did not intend to murder her prosecutor said that soona did not plann to murder carla he did not have the gun he did not pull the trigger wut soona plann to do proscutors argued was to rob carla of drugs the other two men involved in carla's murder they plut out after soon informed on them they got fifty and twenty ight year sentences for a list of charges that included use of a fire arm conspiracy to commit robbery and second to gree murder at soona sentence ing hearing was a sap behind carla's mother sister and a few of arla's kids lisa gave a statemen and she actually spoke on soon as behalf she had wanted him to get probation on a lesser charge lissasaid i was the person who brought carla home and it would not have happened without soona she said i can tell you a lot of our people are still laying in fields and behind bushes all over this country and nobody cares she told the judge it was rare for people sooner to come forward to tell the truth she asked him to show compassion tas soona because she said he showed compassion to us the rest of the hearing carla's mother and sister would not even look at lisa lisa kept taping lareta on the shoulder bulortta just stared ahead ignored her loretta was piss how did you knowlaretta wase pisst because they all got out face book right outside the court o r lake lise yellowrig is over her taking the side of the murderer against my daughter you knol an then that cann wennel how did you feel when you saw those posts leis slake well there is been a few families since she is one of em where just one hunder her said ungratefulness but i delivered soone did not kill arla i do not have to explain myself to anybody they were there he did not have to negotie with any body to get ther love one back loretta would not talk to me for this story i reached out to her several times she did not respond soona was senens to fifteen years which has actually a pretty lenient sentence for fell any murder but lissa was furious i never heard her as angry at any one as she was at the prosecutor in this case a woman named jan morley lisa called jan a slithering snake who was out to get soona typical of federal officials who fail tribal communities i called jan the prosecuter she is retired now ima i need not merican wi that ground oh really right grup an do not needin reguration dot eer tocot it an my ancnedian border well it did not rearlife a lisa did not realize at ethere i asked her leater she sounded surprise lissad told me that in her conversations with soona she had begun to see him as o vulnerable adult maybe with a cognitive disabiliti but jan did not see him this way who id not a it him in hat ona hem forward becaus fona wanted te fate on i gan do you think he said he was scared how do you feel about that i do not believe it i do not think he was ger he did not leave immediately he f there the went throug her teff he wanted to be part of the te mek he spent a lot of time right after carlo was killed with them you are saying he a he the cean te car they te fold of their cloving he wanted ded the e te fone e o te e ona fona us renew in he wanted tuted tie cu fold off an burni shou tho becaus hon emough to have fom blood on is sho but you would not burni yo o i bit was that from tex messages were you seeing soona writing tex messages being no i do not want to burn my sharr ha hold about tit oh interesting yo tid the shoe knew al with e can a bur many shoe theso was right actually shan had made up her mind about soona even before carla's murderer she had prosecuted his rape case fifteen years earlier shan said it was violent she remembered this when she began prosecuting carla's case e very an i man i wanted toa he and carcurated after he pee but he ca he ought of it and cannot believe he cat me ou but he fed if i gona tegot ham ifi i'll the hin alwa call me by ma for thi yo call megan on af te ga an he i on mo untruthful people i have ever run across he he lie heli ta tyour faith in an yofl continue ad ar you actually apte a the evident put it in hi fat an tey te o the evident the evidence in carla's case is this in the days before carl was killed soona exchanged hundreds of tex messages with to go to charbenau planning how to rob carla the prosecution argue that the murder was an accident the other gui with them that night tried to threaten carla with a gun and the gun went off but afterward soona endicota trated more messages about how to cover it up chance at i did not ged to see the evidents but the story jan told me seemed different from the one soon a told le a i did not know if lis i knew all of this i shared it with her does not change anything for ye wel now it does not i mean is not his any new information being presented here i'm sure soonet did wone his money i'm sure he did want drogs is not that what he was therefore in the beginning do i know that soonis is sucual leaving i do does that make him a murderer the abit he was at weast partially responsible for carla's dath right does not that matter u my position is i'm i'm unmoved i am toldly unmoved lis us now helping soon as lawyer prepare an appeal when i talked o soona he told me that he now looksto lasa a mom he still calls her leesa but they speak almost every week meanwhile le son an carlas mother laretta they do not speak any more as ere any part of you that understands fi there angry this is what i say to people every single time when

a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in to day's episode of the shou if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our websight this american life dotawork no you theasy chicago is this merican life m yr glass iam joined in the studio rate now by my coerca to ben low hether to been i ra a and am just going to say that this sor you abet to tell you acknowledge the existence of sex but if tits truly all that you acknowledge that it exists o tell me tell me would happen i yet a case this guy paul this happen when he was in his early twenties and he arranges this houckup with a guy he meets on line and i should say the guy his profile does not have that much infoul it says he is closeted that if they are gon a meet up it it has to be very discreet he said i could not go over to his place and han i also had a roomate he would have been difficult for me to host him is well he told me i know a spot i know a spot that we can go why do not you just meet me at these cross streets at ten ofclock and i said okat worse for me and i drove over at night to where he told me to meet him i get to the cross streets and he is not there there is nobody there and i think ocey knowwhere is he is runningly i'll just hang around for a bed and finally he sees the sky standing on a corner and tmy guy bec kans for him to pull over and unlike oka great confirmation it is him perfect and i lower the window and i say to him oh sorry about that i just was not sure if it was you and he was do nots what it is all get and he gets ti my car paul asks him where we going im the guy strarts to direct him to the hookup spot you make a left up there turn right of this corner things started to feel a little weird when several minutes passed and we were still driving because i had been under the assumption that this secret spot would have been around the corner or something then i ask him welwere a we going and that he says glendale now if you are not familiar with alay i' mean the place where i picked him up was in franklin village and glendale is not supersuperfar but it still close to a twenty minute drive something must not be adding up here and then i start to second guess everything that had happened on that ride far whyt why was not he at the spot when he said he would be he was a little bit further up than that was also weird and then he realizes this must not be the guot there is no way that this is the guinse was to be meeting it is as e scared a did he think the scanmi rob him or heard him in some way he actually he does not have time to be scared because he pretty immediately realizeis exactly what is happens wyat gui would wave you down and and get into your car this was a total stranger to me who was there waiting for his rideshair driver 'se will not you say that he seems toldwy obvious i know you would think right that can i present to you paul's defence of himself please first of all this was twenty thirteen if you remember that sort of early and ride shair calchure sond the whole dance that happens where you waved don a driver you get in and sort of people know what to say to each other that just was not in his head in the same way back then exactly a the other thing is that the guy that he was spest to me up with his hocup the photo on the pro file was kind of grainy and he was wearing sun glasses in the photo paul actually did not have a clear picture in his mind of what the guy was spposed to look oh ok yet ah though there is one marthing that is a little but marvanovious give away i always feel little bit is silly when people point out that he got in my back seat oh he got in the back seat tof the car he got in my back seat but i invite you to look at it from my perspective because i thought that in a matter of moments iways going to be joining him in the back seat i did not think it was that weird he was just peremptively getting in the back and oh he is just he is very he is the is thinking a had he is taste i thinhink i had yet's the more it is the more spacious part of the car and i did not even know the name of the person i was meeting it isnot i could have been hay are you andrew or whatever oh you did not have a name to go i did not either ye he could have gotten in and been hay are you here for daveand i would have een i guess iam now paul has to make a decision li is he going to say something i have no idea what to do because part of me once to pull over and say to him therehas been a huge mistake but then i realize that if i were to do that i would have a lot of explaining to do because i he would have he would have wanted to know why did i let him in my car also i should say by now they have been driving in the car together for several menutes it is way past the threshold for a light hearted ups is eerstand mak ah ye and then paul he has this more alarming thought if this is what i think and this is somebody who as in fact just waiting for his uber then the actual driver ie going to be pulling up and trying to find him and he second now not even two seconds later as soon as i had that realization his phonerings oh my goh my heartstofps because i know what it is going to be before he haven picks it up i know it is kinto be's driver telling him that he is here and i feel foolish and i feel embarrassed because i i thought i was about to be out id i paniced and my heart was racing and i did not know what to do and then he picks up the funk and why and what does he say he is saying things har what do you mean a understand wouldo you mean your outside oh my god and he was ah that is wearied i i am already in the car and then paul has this total perspective shift cause now he is thinking about howis this gon a look from the back seat of the car that would be frightening to be sitting in your uber get a caul from your driver saying that there outside and then you look at the details of what car you are supposed to be looking for and what your driver looks see that your driver is not that person and the car is not that vehicle if i were him i would have thought oka on being kien out or what what is happening right now uso the gui hangs up the fown and it is at this point that paul gets this gift from the gots he says to me di they ever send to drivers immediately i was just yes sometimes there is a glitch sometimes eres a glitch and they sent to drivers that is what happened i cannot believe he gout saved i know and for the rest of the drive he commits to the part he is paul the uber driver which means he ays along as the guy in the back tries to make conversation oh how long if you'v been driving doye it you get paid well doyou meet interesting people ti things that and how are you answering i was just making things up yo ap and dra not to not too long it is it is all right i got paid all right the people are nihce i was just completely making it all up thenthe funny thing is though that because i did not know whether he thought i was uber or lift or some other ri share i had to be kind of vague because i did not wone to say oya uber's grat when he would be wet that this was a lift in it na that is what i me the lucky thing for pauls that because he askd for directions when the guy first got in the car the guy does not only notice that paul does not have the ap open or the ge piazopand he is just comfortable con him directions all the way to glandale eventually they do and up at his house and then as he is getting out of the car i did pard of me a tiny tiny part of me was thinking still is this the guy to see about to invite me it is a trying to hold on to any glimmer of mthis making sense and then incredibly the guy does in vite him up he does he does and actually they are still together to day really no of course not the guy just wishes him a good night en coes int at's at and in the next day paul out an from his actual hook up and an turns out the guy juscot and scared an deside an not to come that to this day paul still stands by his decission what i think it is for the best that i did not set the record straiht caus in that case he just had a totalin onal night he had a totally normal night and hat he gt a free rite i ihe dos hardyo deside to set the record straiht the world usually does not wone t hear it i's almost always an in convenient truth to dant a programmme we have people who step up tell the truth the rest of us have not heard and sometimes do not want to her an let the chips fall wer they may say with us he he ithat one homtest he began to day with a kid twelve years old he tring to figure out the truth to sething straight for himself this boy ill ye his family had recently escape fror mary uple and you craine maupel was a city that you may remember back in the spring everybody was trying to get out of he was underseech from manths food was running out the russians bopped ha maternity in children's hospital than a theatr the people were using as a bam shelter soldiers in cphilians made a long last stand at the steel pan the lots of failed attempts to set up a humanitarian corridor big parts of the city would destroyed ily and his family manage to escape all that they made a t poend and then last month incredibly thi sad they wanted to go back to marry upl to see if ther old home was a place they coud still live puticia valloy kipness talked to alia about what happened i meant illy awill li was volunteering at ar refheu e senter and worsof this past frant one renydangn i was showing a couple cands had he was a camera and interme one another when ill yo walked him to the room i could tell you his interested wut tho shy to sam much i asked if he wanted to toin us and one of the younger kids asked if they could interven him they were eager to try with some one mal he trot and pouped himself in front of the camera he could tell that outside of mortimes and he was a cool kid it was something abou the way he carried himsop ia that oi remember thinking about how dark the rings ere under his eyes i double checked as he sat in front of the camera you sure you one to do this why not he said yes o julia was sevin asks his name and how old he is ilia replies as et yet wat a ab bat you my name is ilia and i am twelve years old my city is mariuple i was born in mariupoy i've lived there for s pan of twelve years all of them i lived there until he orks fell in us that is that is hong going to name such unpleasant characters the orks are his way of sayng russian soldiers then he tells the room at that rusr i abl yer second quession is probably going to be about my feelings about the war and then he went on to answer his own question he described watching asav stall the massife steel factory near his house that the russian's bomb for months as it burn for days on end about how he had hid in a basement whilst niprs fired at his home right into their windows codee bi taaus sa just o boy the cdeve shol bosi a do not beilia says the scurious feeling was when he finally made it to his grandma's house i house he spent a lot of time in and it was completely burned down there were corpses of people laying outside all around he did not ow of his grandma was alive or not we bish bok cas he gimbut umished a dobles an medl we came to my grandmas and we could not enter because the house was completely mine it was not until hours later he found out his grandmother had survived e hes a here jana the eleven year old filming him stoppe recorting ilia covered his face with his angry birds teashirt it was remarkable to me that he had made it out of maruple and all the time i was in poland i did not meet anyone else from his city ilia and his family made it to one of worseas nice or refuge e centers which offered them long turm housing doctors lawyers teachers and sychiatris wud come in to help on sidte there was food and a playroom for kids it was safe well run orderly the day i met ilia he aske for my number right away that is just the kind of kity is a little business man sometimes in the mornings if i was late to my ship he would call me to nature i was still coming and then confirm a time to be e xact he would then informed the others and i would arrive at the shelter he would be waiting for me outside billia was all mar rserve than the other kids he could not always break out of his quiet when he did he would get into long conversations with me husing phrases listen here val or you got to hear me out how a to after months of hanging out with ilia in the other kids i had to go back to the states on my last night working at the shelter as lea walked me to the tram stop which had become our daily tradition he chased me with the water gun and la he seemed to be getting used to paly o but a few weeks later he called to say that his family him his long dad and sister were making plans to go bad back to marupole i had not heard of any families ilias who would managed to escape mariapole and make it all the way to safety in polland to then try and return after all the city was badly damaged and now under russian control nd the shelter they were in it was one of the better ones the one's most wanted to get into i called ilia's ma o wat ot cuch out ting a sto she told me that last week it was illyand his sisters birthdays they den't want birthey parties she said they dy wont anything no present the only thing that they wanted for their birthday it we are take its home awe pethites hes but i asked her have you been trying to prepare your children for the fact that things may be different a he ecross the book of la n h's not in wudeto she said wea i tell them look how beautiful warsi is what could everything we have here when we come home it is not going to be beautiful this she sais she tells them that they are nock an have ice cree and they could say we do not need any of this e ready to eat whil we have you just h want to go home ont w et im towoy o the truth is iliasmot felt the same way as her kids she told me she would rather wake up in her own home than sane pollen they been on the run for monce she would had told many temporary places and she felt no relief for comfort and also this was a big part of it she felt an iobligation to her own parents which she left behind but she also worried about what it would be for kids to see the city change they will have to come to their own conclusions she said i talked to ilia farewell about it he said he wanted to go home because that is where his grandma is he said i'd rather be home were sure conditions are in grated tat i can do as i than just be a little cat here not knowing my place prior to the war il he had spent most of his time living at his grandparent's house because his parents work much when han his parents fled mariupole it was the first time he had left his grandma ind his entire life a i worried about only one thing when he said i really do not want to go back to school he said he was not worried about anything that might happen within the class room he was worried about actually getting there he had heard that there were minds everywhere he said a freaked him out e abalya he did not his parents leaving him to go to work at the factory for the same reason and told me he would come up with a plan to started business there they could all work together selling back packs and naknaks that the fleemarket or something illia actually expected home to be different he was aware that rush had fully occupied his city and saw in social media that now even the sign at the entrants that s ad mariupole had been changed a at's what ei get a is yo oki now now look at the first photo that is that is what they'v changed it to i now look at the second photo it says maripoll and instead of a oucrani and e they hdded a russian e s they have already renamed it o i las mariuple used to be at mariu wunow it is madu wud a a wa yo enoa he hellia told me in his sister been fighting about that his sister thought that when they got home they just make peace with the fact that mariuple as they knew it was now over t the russians had one but this was their new life ilia re fused to accept defeat he russians were the one who destroyed the city he figured you cranians would keep on fighting all an all he had makes feelings about returning ye cu t a i want to go when i do not want to go he sang fifty per cent one way fifty per cent the other ye t a this is the thing you's trying to set straight for himself was mariuble stillkin to feel home two days later mid august illiattexted me from the road by the way he wrote the're already on rut home i do not knowhan i'll be able to write to you again and then radio s ilence i could not get a hold of illia or his mother i stated up into the morning hours scrowling through you crany an telegram channels made for this exact reason ad there been a bomming an miss ill strike that i had miss but then a couple days later hillya popped up on my screen he wrote to me of bad news the border gards had nant let his mamm and sister in tw crane because of a document as su the family decided to split up his mamen testo returned back to worsal while he and his dad continued to mariuple and then a few days later another tex message came through ll you had made it he wrote me nd op date the way he always tecs it and long run on sentences theire partment had light and water though the intrinite was spotty and there was no gas but they bought an electric stove yesterday no more of that on the first day back he made sure to see his grandmother they hugged and drank tea together just old times he walked her on the neighborhood with his dad he told me he was nervous about filming outside because the soldiers did not it when people did that even he insisted on sending me at least on bilia illyis hand is shaky as if he is trying to keep his phone hidden but i can still make out the image a large collapsed building next to a bustop illy his favorite super market the only thing left of it it is men on bens yewi tewor a y ne later we talked on the fon he told me i lived in the city for eleven years and i got use to certain things and now nothing really works it used to butus be o o the anonjo i te lopo story t it is all broken down he said but there a new house is being built i mean you hear shots being fired from the distance they are de mining a laty now and then to day at eight we heard machine dun rounds being fired se does not ot scooldavia wherefrom i asked ee did it well not from far away neareby when he went to the cemetery with his dad to visit some family who had been kill during the war he was shok he go bes which oo m u he told me i went to the cemetery and there ware many craves i cannot even describe it to you you cannot even count them it was many and this is only at one cemetery ae go geo beshaky we left some flowers some candies some cookies a drink and some cigarettes because my momm's cousin ind her husband they used to smoke and that is the tradition you just you leave them metwon cigarette publise according to local officials the russian siege of mariuple kills at least twenty two thousand people and may be a lot more ham illeand i talked a lot over the pasoreves and as time went on i began to notice something in our calls wut the things that once bothered him the soldiers a minds his sisters attitude about the war we started to describe them differently yes lots of the city was amess but did not feel as bad as it had looked on hi spone from poland he had lit and electricity and when i asked if he was still nervous about those mines on his walk to school he said y ec sotoye no i' already been walking and there is nothing there the russian soldiers just told me where to walk and were not to walk i' been listening to them illia was now taking advice from the soldiers that occupied his city i yesiliav yu are there lots of russian soldiers there di it os kec gens ye and on there is chetchens will you and what they just walked round the city i asked w ye they just walked round the city whought to shops to different places noc ok on yeu see bevy lgurd and how do they behave themselves a bit a excellent polite honestly when the chechens are here in the kits come up to them they give you moneyso you can by candy his mam told me the chechens give him sod as nan chips anything that cids ask for ewhen i asked illy if it was weard for him that there are rssian soldiers everywhere he told me do not i already got used to it you think they will stay there forever or for now los forever ill y told me he would even made friends with some of the russian and chechen soldiers it felt strange to hear him say that he knows it is russia that started all this but there are the ones in charge now and he told me people get killed for being proeu crane there are all kinds of things that do not make sense inalia's life right now there are parts of town that are destroyed and parts that are fine schools in session but there are mines along the way when you are living through a war there is only much you can set strait you have to hold a lot of contradictions in your head at once ilia is getting pretty good at it valley canness one of thepuors of oursha aways momen sis to finally did make it marriable and surprise the grandparents allyou is ther to fillmentthere as regression present in fine amere prudent side dcree to made four regions of you crane into part of russia officially icooding what alia is right now the nignation secretary general said the move went q against everything the international community is meant to stand for i to oh what a hangled web we weave quickgets up before we start the story that dimensions part of the male and atamy they that under advisement pro and con deside what you ging to do it is not what the story is about the str is about a creepy and dangerous creature that is all kinds of terrible things this aus about somebody who takes issue with every word i just said about that creature lily ellevan met up with this person to hear er out this person is my friend kelsy patchet and if you run in to her at a dinner party are abar maybe you happen to be standing behind her in the security lying at the air port she mght askyo this what do about black woo o spiders what o k i know that they are very poisonous they have a really bad bite a bite that can kill you he and dam and i know that the female after mating lake kills the male and eats him fantastic that is exactly what most people know about blackwood of spiders and your totally wrong and this is kelsie's mission te expose the lies about the spider being a wanton murderess correct the record and restore her good name kelsie s to work as a park range er in new york by the way she elsie is to report science stories and over the years she is a mass and absurd amount of information about these spiders let me it let me tell you i'll start with tha the black widow name the idea that the black widow eats her husband or the spider they just mated with that she is a is a murderer drestall in black morning a husband that they just killed kelsie says the female eating the male ok this has happen but very rarely and it is barely a noticeable trait if you look around about the rest of spiders are doing many species of baby spiders which are called spider lings often eat their ibblings right after hatching and some species of spiderlings even eat their own mother after hatching and sextual cannibalism which is eating your mate after he has done the deed with you is very common in the spider world but whose who is not common that much for is blackwood ow spiders they only do this in captivity it practically never been seen in the wild in the northern hemosphere meanwhile the male spider here is no mister rogers check ot what he does the male black widow will sometimes go round to the the females web and sort of clip off little parts of it that she has no extit routs and then he will go up next to her and calmly sort of caress her and then he throws a web of his own over her to then copulate with her and the scientists have called that web the bridale vele which is not what that should be called are you serious oi cu this it strikes me as a very weird behavior and if i were a person naming spiders and saw that sometimes the female eighte the male after eating but also that the male does this crazy thing and ties down the lady basically i might name the spider after that but why did not they because they were men he thought it was exceptional that the female killed the male my gush cannot have that a lot of species of spiders do this bridal male thing wone theory as thehone celcy lays out that the male's trapping the female there is another newer one to which is more accepted by scientists nle tete it is more as seduction than a trap as scientis put it when they explained it to me it is bondadge yet spideis ty bondage nit number tai that her bite is fatale from nineteen fifty to nineteen fifty nine the data we have says that the were sixty three deaths in the uess from blackwoidow spiders interesting way most of the black widow bite vicims backman seem to be male in an older stady they were eighty per cent male here is a theory as to wy most of the reported a black widow bites from this time happened in what were called outdoor privies a outhouses h black widow spiders they enjoy dark lode the ground sort of places they especially love to make their cob webs between two objects and because bugs stinky places you knowe imagine flies right this flies in outhouses that it makes a great food supply right ha and to get to the stinky stuff yo got to go through the bowl right ri putting your web there is excellent imagine this is nineteen fifties your dud you need to go number to you make your way out to the outhouse sit down and you junk tangles there hangles yet that is but she said and as it does it hits the cob we and the usually nonaggressive black widow it stinctually runs over and bites down on the new creature that is landed on its web my god oget that do not cenn terrifying now it is is not it ye yet theres i not even you cannot even imagine a better situation tailor to getting bits by this plike usually very nonagrossive spder they do not come after you and the statistic that you saw yet how many bites were on penusis the majority were on on petusis on't wit dot she thinks all these penist spites happening regularly might be one of the reasons there were many deaths spack then the skin there is less thick and there are lots of nerves there right and this is a narrow tolks in venom oh oh oh perhaps being bit on the genitals sins the venom going into your body a fast or stronger way than say if you were bit on a callous on your foot anyway the point is once more people had indoor plumming along with improved acks iste matical care the number is which were not that high to begin with they have gone way down and in the last several decades there is no record of any one dying from a black wood ow spider no one in fact the blackwood has usuall a pretty shy spider scientist iv evens and tests where they poke and prowd her trying to less at a bite and she turns to other defences pirst tries to run away curls up into a little ball n ta bigger than a quarter sometime she those silk at the danger to try to escape the bite is her last ras ort ye i think that the world should know that they have been lied to and that this this the black wotd o spiders not the bet celsie has a proposal to set the record strahte schange the spider's name easy get rid of the name that mires her and all this twisted loer she does not deserve i think that is what it looks re naming her blackwood of spiders were not always called laers s they have had many different names some of the name ar the hour glass spider the tea bar spider the me walk people intigionistoc california called the spider bocol mo the one she likes best though the shoe button spider ku the shoe button spider yet she looks a button after all little round one i decided to test out this new name on the people i thought were the best suited to judge it was my whole chest was in a wic scrip i spoke with eight people who would been bitten talkd to leven others over yemal here is some of them and not to the worst cramp it you' ever had in your wife a carley horse inger but that being my hole back bit ar really bad sharwy horse at doesn stalk and en vops youl chasstray qui ting at my body and i would holding on pou the bie pannele oth the vehicle and brathing myself when it woul happening and pri it rerely enot i cannot rendered i wik but if yeel to go in waver not every one whose bit has a batd reaction this and again bites ere very rare and a lot of the times there mild but when it is bad it is bad i ran tells his idea by them do you thnk we should re name the black wood o spider the shoe button spider thirteen people wait in no one was into it why got i not i do not that at all no no that bu e name that the shou button fider back me ol tey but ba the very ma name this is gena she got bit eight years ago in a portaboty a cocella i roer ben black wit a fider terit me bo ol no ti ar tort o ort a pider you cin tat wen on and they probably have that bat but o black wit a wi it it it un' come bowr and and i think tho pider that on have bor some one else whe would been bit told me honestly i think black widow is an excellent man where i a spider i wond feel really qual an coy sellevan is one of the beos of our show calcy paget is hosting an up coming podcast all about big rival res ant history and got to be petty feuds it cons onect's mon keep youriyes out icoming out democrats an republicans in congress on doing such a great job coming to thoughtful by partisan solutions to our nations problems let us see what they do with you fous that is in a minute chicago bubgredio when our programme continues to smaran life amira glassd to day's programme setting the record straight storyes to people who feel very strongly that they have to clarify what is true and what is false but something very important to them weavarrived to dact three of our programme at three you f no fiderday with hor to bunch of people setting the record straight on something and now it is my pleasure to introduce oure senior editor david cestonboun who is usually very measured somethinghe wants to get off his chest the thing i'd the record set straight on you fos are not real they are not aliens from other planets come to this at us yes i know the panagon recently announced the new programm to study weird stuff pilots are seeing yes i know there was that superolong new yorker story or maybe you saw the sixty minutes piece we have trackled many strange stories on sixty minutes but perhaps none this it was pretty good teethy s what youare tilling me is that you in fools unin dintofo sling objets or real bey'll a seep wer beyond that ready unidentified does not mean alien space craft it means unidentify or maybe you saw these vidios the navy rs and even even thi sky what is true mesry besers or resident orom ers corte and record o objects in iscis that we o no exactly what they are wecan explain ow they move heyr trojectory ey do not a un easily esplainable particularly maddening our conversations i've had with people i know about this and midway through i realize oh i have to be polite because it is clear they think this is real no more polite i have reasons for thinking all this is bullshit science reasons for aliens thot actually visit us if they exist in the first place they would either need to be insanely patient or be able to travel faster than the speed of light cause the nearest stars are crazy far awaght i was a grads todnt in physics i worked on one of those giant particle excelerators i can tell you you can try to make those particles go as fast as you want they get very close to the speed of light but they do not go faster we got to ninety nine point nine nine nine nine five four persent tof the speed of light you can double the moun of energy using and it does not double the speed it just gets you a tiny bit closer to the speed of light the universe really does seem to have a speed limit that is what the aquations tell us i mean maybe there is some way around it but it really really does not seem it and think about it for a second in the fifties it may be made sense that all the ouovoters were blurry and hard to decipher but to day every single person with a smartphone has a superpowerful camera in their p ocket that is billiens of cameras if alien spacecraft are here should not we have better pictures and the fact that basically kno scientist seem interested in this at all and prefer to dwell on say detailed questions of howe soldar systems form it tells you something if any these photoes are rade our blips or whatever really were alien craft it would be the greatest discovery of all time i cannot think of a font big enough for the front page but basically every scientist and every university is sitting it out as kneel to grasstison the astrophysisist who runs the planetarium athe american museum of natural history put it hofs talking about the people who believe these things are spaciips quot the fact that you do not know what it is is not evidence that what it is o k you knowiy science exists he says cause the human sensory systemsevs unfortunately with scientis ouf doing science there is almost no one left to try to set the record strys no one to quote in those new stories saying think that is just a weatherballoon if they do quote some one it is often this gy mac west i've looked a literally hundreds if not thousands of you focasis people send be them old time and is always new one's coming up mac runs a websit called medabunk where he anothers tread are really run these things down sometimes they figure out the object in the photo or vidio was a plain by finding the actual plain from maps in flight records or one of my favorites there is this photo some one on a vacation took of these mysterious lights up in the sky over the water mac thought it looked a reflection off the window is taken from inside he found the actual rental house based on the position of the mountains in the photo called the home owner conmincter to take a photo from the same spot by the window and confirmed yes a reflection of te living room lights most you ave for cases are really really simple a boring occasionally da you get an inan interesting one and the most interesting ones thet ones that you get ye from the government i called mack up earlier this year because something exciting was about to happen there is going to be a congrestional hearing on you ofos the first in fifty years which meant finally the experts were gen away on the record in front of congress this stuff unexplained things seem by pilots ar on radar is usually secret but now we are goin to hear from the people actually looking into these things presumably with the help of the smartest sciencistss i wanted them to set the record straightand in these partisan times when red and blue america seem to violently disagree about everything under the sun this is one issue neither side has ta taken come on america maybe we can agree on something i would that i really would the morning of the hearing mac west tan i got on azume together to watch at live thes on the west co sos little before sixay in this time we are waiting for it to start hayou feeling about this thing its cann't be very interesting ei suspect sr scin bian mixed back i mean to for me for me i think unless they have a scientist their testifying iit could be very hard fror me ye well ei think what the gods look about is setting up the programme and proseed an i can talk about the evidence and i can agleal there i lhink i think they are i i heard this morning the youe this is can new that they may be showings from vidie and talking about their analysis of to viie which you quoely superinteresting from me because ' well about mbe you analysis the feet of the hearing started the some committee will come to order tha big formal hearing room on capital hill couple of large american fl ags in the bact more than fifty years ago you es government into project blue book that is the chair of this house intelligenc suid thcommittee congressmen andray carson democrat fom midiana e theas kind of weird and also delightful to hear a discussion of the offois wrapped up in the formalism of a congressional hearing fr it turns out the government sorts tho the question of whether we have been visited by aliens the same way does any other problem there is a task force this one sat of last november call the euroborn object identification in management ecranization group or aim saw tr thats sho your pronounce it to day will bring that organization out of the shadows yes ring it out of the shadows there were two very high ranking officials there to testify and answer questions from the lawmaker son i di under secretary of defence for intelligence in security ronald multry and scot bray deputy director of anaval intelligence we also me bray laid out whath the new task fors was doingthey now have a formalized system for sav pilots to report things they see and currently a date abase of four hundred incidents in i reporthee going through them tring to figure out what they are brmany as i hoped working with all kinds of smarchinally subject matterects wors from a wide variety of fields including physics opjects medalergy meteorology you apose by the way have now been regranded ju pens unidentified aerial phenomena me we ma n i think pilots will not be embarrished to report sayings and now the military does have real concerns incursions in our training ranges by unidentified objects represent serious hazards to safety of flight bray said there several categories of what these things could be s the airborne clutter a n atmospheric phenomena in some weather thi unknown your they could be something of ours may be a drones something from one of our adversaries i which might pose hae national security ty bor one final categry a been he called your other which quot thelows for the possibility of surprise and scientific discamery or he did not seem to want to sa alien savy in te partment oens then things got interesting word bray turned to a screen in the hearing in this fhidio you as navy personel recorded what appears to be triangle some flashing recorded several years ago off the coasto instans this is a vidio that ha bn leeped to while ago but never explain number small it is wild eins the footageis green because it shot with night vison goggles vidioand wat you see are these very clear trianglesthey really appeard to be some sort of triangular craft linking oour mack was not impressed this is this w put this bidiais polissit thes sare this issentiy is a camera out to factlys proply a plan a cameraart of fact mac claims theire not realat triangle shaped he thnks it is a kind of optical illusion crated by the camera itself next bray shows a still image with another mysterious green triangle just the ones in the vidio several years later and off a different coast you ass navy personel again through night vision goggles and an ussell our camera a recorded this image but this time other youescnavias ats also observed an manderial systems near by meaning drones or something that bray says there what the camera was saing the triangular appearance he is a result of light passing through the night vision goggles and then being recorded by an essol our camera sank her excellent haw d you feel about that he just showed the vidio an and it luxurially bad and then the actualy explained ye that that is gright thats something o ha ot being tooking byut that be erfor i ma well every year now and right from the yet ten seconds after the vi day was posted i recognized what he was and post of the vishes a cameraocy fact and no one in the government has said that now now said e and the persono leksit tis being veemencely insisting the in tis actual pyramid shape craft flying around and thi s im im completely wrong an o se her thet the scobraas just explained that i was correct which is a which is grit put that once to rest one record set straight one unidentified fying object identified it is coprashowed another vidia which you said was more tirerilyn this as one make hadn see ample it was new the firstit had not been previously released which shows an observation unreal tonk ar it is this this one is from an ef eighteen itified it is shot out the window with what seems some one's fon you eorand for the tiniest fraction of a second limitet something flick aby ait is there and that it is gone there was what was i to this that is in many cases that is all the report may include dakito say to sherit agarom mak t gets throug the wis mister bri can you re run that first image it looked it was outside of a plain win a congressman adam shift democrat from california chair of the house intelligence committee and if you would not mind going up to the screen and tell us what were what we are saing explain why we should be looking at in that first image absolutely it turns out the technical capability of the s military has its lemeds theve rial hard time stopping te vido at the exact frame where the thing flashes by they try for four minutes if you could stop that fram ti something his is terrible midia terrible example 's almost certainly a belen at bon cluster s not demonstrating anycn se at vanc me ne ring or ais en what you see here i is and a aircraft it is a operating in the a any us nabe a training range a that is observed a spirical object i in that area and as they fly by it they take a vidio you see a a it looks a reflective in the vidio somewhat reflective somewhat reflective cuss is a my lawbeli and it quickly passes by a the cocbit of the a of the oograph and is this one of the phenomena that we cannot explaind i do not have an explanation for what this the specific ga object is and is this one of the situations where is that is that is the object that were oking aiter thank you a and is this the situation where it was observed by the pilot and it was also recorded by the arcraft's instruments we will talk about the multicensor part a in a later session later session meads the behind closed doors parte where they go over all the classifieds taf translation they have other data rad ar some advance incing that who knows maybe givesthem a pretty good idea of what this is e or what it is not suggest yu fbut because it is classified they cannot talk about it not heltful and then this happened mister multre ma galliger republican fon wisconsint ask the bunch of question is o bray and also under secretary moltre and he seems to be in prosecutor mod lake is trying to get something important on the record other basically do of any other programs currently looking into u a peas answer no cr any ones from the past decades we do not know about you do ract then this it is also been reported a that there have been u p observed aan interacting with and flying over sensitive military facilities particulary not just range is but a some facilities housing our seticic newclear forces at one such incident elegidaly occurred aat mamstram ere fore sface in which ten of our newclyrice beams were rendered inoperable at the same time a gloing red or was observed overhead or not commenting on th actiy of this obsiisi big cotchic to you afin methology have any comments on the accuracy of that we pass after mister bray looking ape a threyors that that is not a within the holdings of youa be desporse ook at but are you aware of the the report i have a i have heard stories i have not seen the official bat on why ime is pretty high prophile incident ii do not claim to be an extra on this but that is out there in t ether you'r you are the guides investigating it i man who else is doing ti something was a fistly brought to our tenon we uld look at it a ther're manythings er out thou anethoa officially brought to ourtons how would have to be officially brought yur couse i'm bring its your corsio is prettificial forso wo bak tig look at it but thronly there is som a authoritative figure that says thereis aninsnt that occur we would you to look at this wl i do not claim to be an authworts at a figure but for what is worth i would you to look in into it for nother eas now there was something that needed explaining a red orb newclear i se bems becoming inoperable i firgere the must be dat on selphon vidio rade our computer records but nic explained that there would not be this incident it allegedly happened in the nineteen sixties trecess this hering a returnd in the cold session at noon other ar then it was over the first you afol hearing in congress in fifty years mack and i had different reactions to the hearing he thought it went fine i i i felt this hering was good and that we did get om utaur at i think it was fairly well balanced and the toch lot about the process to the cing to sess up i was pretty frestrated i'd wanted some one to say look there is no reason to think any these things ore alien space craft or we do not have definitive evidence of anything that violates the laws of physics macke wanted that last one to actuallyt we did not get it have you fel about the unendig nature of this you do not ot mean everone's going to walk away from every one of these hearing yet believing exactly whatever they want yer yet people who want to believe in alients was the look we had hearing this reeal and people lake yourging to say look they showed the vidian actually explained what it was see yet ye t you neferencs but it is the topic thas impossible to ad because this always going to be un identified flying objects this is a horrible thought that i hadnreally grappled with there will always be blurry photos of things in thi ky probably more now theverone has a selphone with them all the tile there really is only one way the record will ever get set straight bat we will get an answer to whether aliens are here on earth and that is if we actually find them in other words the believers can win my side canp you can never prove aliens arent here donm tellin you they are not the

welcome to the hubermanlaponkans science scien spacs to i for i mander huberman and om a professor of naurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor robert malanka doctor robert malanka is a professor of psychitryan behavioral sciences at stamford university school of medicine he is both a medical doctor and m d and a researcher a p ht his laboratory is famous for having discovered some of the key components allowing neuro plasticity that is the nervous systems ability to change in response to experience in addition doctor malanka's research is considered central to the tex book knowledge about how reward systems in the brain are organized and function indeed doctor malanka's research over the last ten or fifteen years has merge what was once too disperate fields the first being the study of nauro plasticity again the nervous systems ability to change in response to experience and the other field being the field of dopomine as it relates to pleasure and eddiction his laberatory is shown for instance that when we seek out particular forms of pleasure regardless of whether not ther healthy for us that changes the way that our reward circuitary works and actually changes the way that dopomine is released and how it impacts the brain and his work has also informed how we seek out healthy pleasures including healthy food and social connection to day's discussion explores all of these topics and by the end of to day's discussion you will have a rich understanding of how nauro chemicals dopomine and ceretonan work in parallel to reenforce that is to increase the probability that we will engage in certain types of thinking nd behaviors if you are somebody interested in neuro plasticity that is how the nervous system can change in response to experience and are you are interested in reward systems what motivates us and what we are likely to pursue in the future givin our choices of past and if you are interested in things social connection and empathy or lack thereof to day's discussion incompasses all of those topics it is worth mentioning that doctor malanka is a true luminary in all of the fields i just mentioned as well as several other fields in fact when you look out on the landscape of modern narow science what you will discover is that a very large percentage of the top laboratory studying narrow plasticity and reward systems and on all stemmed from having trained in doctor malancra's laboratory it is a real honor and pleasure to be able to host him today and i'm sure that our discussion is going to greatly enrich the way that you think about brain function narrow plasticity and reward before weu begin eye to emphasassat this podcast is separate from my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero coss to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is roca roca makes eye glasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was found by two all american swimmers from stamford and everything about roca eye glasses and songlasses were design with performance in mind i've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly roca understands those challenges in the biology the visual system such that they' design sun glasses and eye glasses that always allow you to see with crystal clarity now initially roca eyeglasses and su glasses were designed for sports performance and as a consequence all of their glasses are designe to be very light weight end to not slip off your face if you get sweaty however the design of the glasses include some that are specifically for sport and others whose thesthetic really alows you to use them for sport as well as out to dinner or to work et cetera and that is how i use them if you would to try roca eyeglasses and sun glasses you can go to roca dot cam that is ar o k a dot cam and enter the code hubermen to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is roca ar o k a dot cam and enter the code huberman at checkou to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a programe that lets you see how different foods enbehaviors affect your health by giving you real time fee back on your diet using a continuous glucos monitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucos or sometimes refer to its blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood gluco steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food comminations as well as food timing and things exercise combine to impact your blood glucos levels i strarted using levels a little over a year ago and it give me a lot of inside into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my over all energy and in doing it really allowed me to optimise how i eat what i eat when i exercise and on such that my blood lucos levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you are interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucos monitor yourself go to levels dot link slash huberman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link elli and k slash hubermen to get two free months of membership and now for my discussion with doctor robert malanka doctor malanka rob welcome te thinks for having delighted to have you here both for sake of your medical knowledge an training as a psychatrist and of course as a luminary in the field of nor oplasticity dopa men in reward systems social systems your knowledge of autism and social interactions a newer interest in or perhaps old interest in psychodelics and what they are doing in potential for mental health and theyre jus many things that a you have done in this field i've been a long long time fan of your work since your days as as assistant professor i've tracked your career i' learned a tremendous amount from you by observing you end from being your colleague really delighted to have you here you are making me bless and i do not blush easily well it is all true and and i willa as well you have also trained an enormous number of incredible scientists on carldiceroff the carldiceroth on on alempki always speaks incredibly highly of you as a mentor and i'm somebody she is learned a tremendous amount from and pretty much anyone that is worked on nerl plasticity on dopamine and reward systems addiction and now in the fields of autism and soon psychodelics as well references as you often and you have been mention many times before in this podcast if not by name by work again thank you for being here i'd love to kick off the conversation by talking about something which is very fundamental to everything we are going to talk about but certainly fundamental to our daily lives which is dopaming and we hear much about dopamin people toie by dopaming hits people ing tat dopamin as pleasure donpamean reward for the novice how how would you frame the dopamin system i mean it but does a bunch of different things in different areas of the brain and body but to you what what is dopaming represent as it is major function in the brain and could you give us a general conteur of the nerl circuits that allow this chemical to more o less put value on our experiences yo that is very well put om as you point out dopamin is one of the major what we term nermodulators in the brain a chemical signaling messenger that the brain uses to mediate a complex array of actions ofm it is best well known function is in what we call the braine reward circuitry this is a circuit in the brain when we use the term circuit what we really mean is one part of the brain communicating with another part of the brain because the brain is this very complex an ow it is the most complex organ is organ in the universe with lots of different nerve celles talking to each other simultaneously in is ner scientist we try to parse what different brain arrears are doing in what different nermodulators might be doing and dopamen whas discovered i should know this many decades ago and it is it is as i said the major chemical messenger molecule in the called brains reward circuitry and when you are talking that' but what is the brains reward circuitry this is a part of the brain that tells us something is reinforcing in our environment some stimuli or in quotes is rewarding makes us feel better or good although that is a gross over simplification a and before getting into the details of dopamin an its function in the reward circuitry i think it is useful to talk about wwhy do we need a reward circuitry why do we need something in our brain that tells us this feels good or this feels bad and it goes back to evolution i i am a biological scientists that means i believe in evolution u and if you think about the evolution of our species everything is driven by developing mechanisms that increase our survival and it is really useful you need something in your nervous system that tells you some stimuli in your environment is important for your survival or some stimulus in your environment is dangerous it is not magic that sur gery high fat laden foods are highly reenforcing and rewardan rewarding it is not an accitet there has to be a mechanism in the brain that tells us that it is not an accident that most of the time for most of us a sexual experience is pretty reenforcing is pretty rewarding it is not an accident that warmth feels really good when you are cold that water taste much better when you are really thirsty there hath what evolved is a mechanism to tell our nervous systems and tell our brains this feels pretty good i should repeat the behavior that leads to that rewarding experience and similarly it wat's really important when you yethere is an evente in your life that is highly dangerous for somes mechanism in your brain to say woe i do not want to go back to where that lion was than we can get into that this was a long winget way of saying what the reward circuitry tells us is this it event this stimulus that could be an external stimulus i saida i a crispy cream dona which i happen te love that i have to be very discipline i do not eat to many of them i'm if im it could be a drug of abuse and maybe we will talk about that a little bit all of these stimuli seem to activate and cause the release of dopamine in this brains reward circuitry now we need to get into a little bit of detail 'm nur scientcist use these very unfriendly terms to describe different brain regions the home of dopamine cells or brain sells are called nuron the home of dopaminnurons i'm are in a part of the brain sort of what we call the lower mid brain i'm he dopameanoranswered a part of the reward sir catri are found in this area called the ventural tegmental ary which i'm sorry to have to use such technical jargon and we call it the vite that is the acrinem andgo the roof of the midbrain is the tectum it means roof and the base of the midbrain it means floor which is tegmentum i think that is th there is a rationalbut it does not help much at all to know the name and in fact you are absolutely correct and i always forget it is o thank you for pointing that it is a it is a side effect of teaching your onan and i which i once did back in the early eighties but i've forgotten everything i taught com anyhow these dopamenerans and we can talk about other types of dopameanerans they send messages what we call projections i'm using telegraph whie iwas that we call axons they send projections to many different brain regions the key one in the brains reward sir catry being an area again with a very complicated name called the nucleus ecumbens and maybe inter i actually do not know how that name evolve the nucleus accumbens i done i'm sure i should know because i've been studying it for thirty years but i have never looked up the agenesis of that name well the fortunate thing about this podcast is it is both on audioplatforms spotify an apple but also on you two been now we can be absolutely sure that somebody has put it into the utwo comments underneath this episode and therefore everyone will learn including us i do not know the orition o the er nucles om and if it is it is a gross over simplification but it is the activity of these dopamenerons in the ventural tagmental area i'm that then cause the release of this powerful neromoguler tid moneromodulator dopamine in the neuc lios e cumbents which has a is part of another brain structure with a tough to remember name called the ventural straatum u and then magic happens and when i say magic happens even though we have been studying how dopamine modifie the properties of sells in this nucleous occumbents the truth is we do not have a deep mechanistic understanding why when dopamine is released in the nucleous eccumbents we experience that as i'm being very cautious yere the simple way would be to say as highly rewarding but it is a little more complicated than that what what it tells us is that there is something really important happening in our environment dan could we say that accuse the arousal system it it it gets the arousal system going there is close ties to our memory systems which hopefully intuitively makes some sense if something really important is happening in your environment because again we i think what is helpful for your audience sys to always be thinking about how these system sevolved from an evolutionary perspective and if dopamine is signaling something really important and salient is happening in your environment you want to remember that it could be a highly rewarding experience a source of food for me it is a cri all donit i do not want to i do to emphasize any one manufacture of one dont adverses the other i i sugar laden fat laden foods that is why i never eat them because i them much an i use that as an example but because that was an important events for my survival this reward circuitry yes it stimulates my arouser system it gets me to pay attention it also has very close tize to memory systems i'm an to go off in a little bit of a tansion i think the one uim i do not wat to say it is a misstake i think perhaps somewhat over simplification of how people conceptilize dopamen roll in the brain is even though it is a major important roll is for it to be active and released during highly reinforcing experiences sexs really good food drugs of abuse it also can get activated subdivisions of this system during painful stimuli en during aversive stimuli im which again a really important for you to be aware of to say oh my god that is really bad for me im and the dopamine system this reward ircuatry and its subcomponents that may be perhaps signal more salients or reverse aversion in the environment are closely tak to arouso systems and memory systems im i gain hopefully for somewhat obvious reasons you want a remember powerfully reinforcing events in your life as well as powerfully emotionally or physically painful events in your life i hope i answered ym your question to a modest degree no im far better than a modestery that that is an excellent description of the dopomine system from a true expert and the question i have is about some of the context and nuants of the system but in in sort of real world terms how how should i think about this even in my training is an nurlsine just i know nurans can be a little active a lot active everything in between that can be active over long periods of time or shortly i e time but let us use the example if the dona i'm i'm i a glazed old fashion dona i actually do not have a craving for sweet things donat is is is an exception i the gle's old fashioned don'a but if i were to see just a little piece of a glaz's old fashion do nota verses a full glazeal fashion donta could i expect that more dopamin as released to the anticipation of the complete dona and then the other question is how does context influenced the dopaming system for instance if i'm very full a glaze ol fashion dona might be aversive to me im wereas at i'm just a little but hungry im or if i'm actually more on a schedule of rewarding myself for abstaining from sweet fadty foods than abstaining from the food might be its own form of reward ye i me and to me the dopeming system seems incredibly simple and yet incredibly prone to immediate context and the kinds of nuaunts that ame wore constantly juggling i'll interrupt myself to say that we are constly juggling a bunch of different reward contingencies we want to im myou i have good health matrics and may you have a certain aesthetic qualities try body but we also want the donta and how does a simp a system as simple as a one neromodulator system and the vitie to nucleas accumvents and with some connections to the memory ar how does it balance all of that information in real time to me that is just staggeringly complex but also incredibly interesting i'm ii think you beautifully put fou very eloquent description i'm you just said it it' staggeringly simple simultaneously staggeringly complex and yyou ask several different questions context makes an enormous importance and that is one of the reasons i became interested in the dopamine reward circuitry is as as a colleague in the ecademic nor science wor but your listeners probably do not i started out my career studying very basic mechanisms of plass ticity how does the brain modify itself and what makes the brain different then compute the comcomputer hardware is art the physical connections in the brain are constantly changing the strength of the communication similarly for the dopamine reward circuitry its highly plastic and its highly contextrally dependent im and you gave the example of doughnuts in feeding and i'll answer your question about the cues i'm yes it is i i used to give the example of thanksgiving let me give that example in the morning of thanksgiving all for most of us in in the united states i'm the morning of thanksgiving if you are at home visiting your parents the smells of the apple pie the smells of the turkey cooking are highly appetitive highly reenforcing your anticipating that fun e then your anticipating uncle joe coming to visit you for thanksgiving and that is all because these cues the smells the anticipation of uncle joe's your previous experienceis are part are part of your memory system sort of talking to in a simple way your rewards or cuitry to your building up this anticipation one could almost say this craving which maybe well talk about in the contects of indiction and thend make a longstory short think about that evening at the end of thanksgiving those exact same cues the exact same smell of the apple pie turkey and uncle joe himself at the very least they are no longer appetitive meaning they might actually be aversi the last thing you want is the piece of apple pie you cannot wait for uncle joe to leave your thanksgiving dinner and i always argue that does not happen magically that happens because your brain has been modified by the contet in which it sits and this very important modulatory system this reward circuitry is responding to the exact same stimuli with a very different response that i'm just telling you ofm repeating what you said the phenomenology and and again my other favorite example is any of us who have been in an intimate relationship knows that the love of your life can turn to the bane of your existence in twenty seconds am and again that does not happen magically this person who you crave who you love does something and two minutes later your brain is saying o my god i you i may have to break up with this person or this is not an incredibly painful experemotional experience and what fascinates me about the brain is how does the brain mediate that rapid change now back to yes context makes is everything about how this powerful nermodulatory system that uses dopamine works and the truth is we do not know it is because the in puts on to these dopaminerons the other nerve cells that are driving the activity of the dopaminerons a i've actually studied this in my lab at stanford university with ha colleague well leechon lewo whos a an a world class nero scientist i'm wive studied the complexity of the neuro anatomy of the dopeming system and these dopaminerons in the ventualtegmentalarea this the source of the reward circuitry dopamine are receiving inputs from all over the brain the receiving indirectly directly in puts from visual areas from sematiccensury areas i'm and i'm not giving you a really good answer because that is one of the goals of my research to try to understand how context how the history that you have had with these cues which we are to get back to of the dona or of a drug how is that modified how this neuromoduloratory system response on similarly the the nucleus occumbents the the target of this powerful modulator dopamine is receiving communications what what we call inputs from all sorts of brain regions that about andrew your audience may not they receives inputs from an area called the hippicampus which you may have covered in previous podcast which is very powerfully very important for memories both establishing new memories and again remember that makes sense you want this system the stopoming reward circitry to be very connected to memory systems that the nucleus occumbents the activity in the nucle occumbens is modulated by dopomine while it is receiving information from the hippicampus which helps in code new memories while its receiving information from a brain area called the emigdola which tells is a part of the brain involved in our emotional experiences the accumbens also receives in puts from the prefruntial quartex which is this brain area as better than me antrue is important for decision making for planning our activity and i cul go on and on co will not talk about prefontal quartex ar moment on because on it always wat surprising to me that prefruntal quartex is talked about as this higher executive functionaria but then when you look at the noranatomy its as we say monosand aptically asan i know wit one connection away from structures the miggala one connection away from structures the the nuclea sicoments in other words prefrontal quartex to me is every bit as ancient as some of these other structures that we think of as more ancient and really the whole ancient evalve thing gets a lioebit dice because certain areas ar the prevon oe quartex are more elaborated an humans but but to me the prefronta quarte seems to be especially important in the context of this thing of scaling the reward response or context of the reward response because it can set rules it seems to know a o k were recording a podcast now and there are certain rules are certainlhy t tin te do and not you but what is fascinating about the and i'm glad you gave a bunch of different examples because what is fascining for instance about the athe relationship example is that yes at one moment am we can adore somebody in another moment later if they do something or do not do something we can be incredibly frustrated with them they can even become in aversive to us i'm hopely that does not happen too frequently but i think we have all had the experience of adognat an event or a person actually looking different to us in it from one moment to the next hopely not at random right and to me it seems the prefrontal quartex is uniquely position to really say ok right now we are in a mode of for lack fy bitter word love and loving bein the in the verbtents of loving a bein the vertens of arguing we are now arguing werein the ertents of of a reconciliation con' somewhere in between or something of that sort and how a structure in a circuit as simple as the dopamings asm right one mollecucould suddenly say oh it now getting over my anger is rewarding whereas five minutes ago being right and te most angry was rewarding and then five minutes be wer that again were accelerating this movy but five minutes or five days or five years before that this person could do no wrong and the dotoming system is just crat and whatever you do i 'm just delighted iincredible an to me i cannot think of a more interesting system in nerasiwell i mean that was eloquently put im i agree with pretty much everything you said i do not have much to add because you wat you are pointing out is the challenges of studying these systems the importance of tudying these systems and the challenge of presenting how the brain works to this pod cast audience because on the one hand you have done a market of fantastic job over the last few years in your podcast of making complex subjects accessible to allay audience im and get them to be thinking about how our modern view of how the brain works may could be used to enhance health could inhands mental well being but as nurascientist academic narascientists ourselves we we know you are over simplifying things and the actual functioning of a system the dopomine reward circuitry as you just eloquently point out is much more complex im it is modified by these prefrontal in puts which are simultaneously telling our memory systems caunol pay attention here m am repeating what you just said the context makes a big difference the history you have with the person or stimuli with whom you are interacting to bring this back to your n which i never iv the initial question is a small piece of dogna actof tey the cue that that small piece of adogn and activate the reward cir catry and cause release of dopamin to the same extent as the fuldona depends on your experience with donats i mean i think for you and me because we seem to both have you white doats there highly appetitive for us im probably does it matter beuse we have learned even a little piece of adogna actovates all of our memory system saying man that is an old fashioned ways dona i want to eat that i want to get one or i want to have the discipline not to eit i'm i hope itm anseryour question its and i'm i'm shifting topics completely but that is why adiction is challenging lit isen ot o that im let us talk about it because you have done at a ton of important work in this area f addiction i mean one of the basic questions i have about addiction is yan we hear that certain drugs are more addicting than other drugs were ceren behaviors we also hear that erwe can be come addicted to anything when on alemki was on this potcask im misaid what is the most am unusual addiction you have ever seen in she talked about a patient i'm who sadly i'm committed suicide at some point later that a she told us had been addicted to water to drinking of any kind first alcall but then water eventually im and my question about a diction in the dopamine system is fort let us pick a drug iam coquane im i've never done coqane im but people who have done coqane tell me that it feels very good im and one of the more salient features of the coqane high as that it comes on very fast and it ends pretty quickly too is the rate of dopening increase related to the addictive property aof a drug or behavior im as much as how much dopamean is realeas that is a very sophisticate a question and answer is yes and that is usually the thelecture i give the way i think about addiction i'm an obviously my friend and collegue on olempke is one of the world's experts and terms of the understanding the human experience of addiction i have studied it as a sullular molecular nur sciencis trying to understand how addictive substances modify reward sircitry modify the connections in the reward circuitry modify how dopame nerons act and the way ilike any what is appears to be a simple term it is layered with complexity i'm addiction is somewhat of a continuum and i to think about whether you are talking about substances coqane and i will explicitly answer your question soon or opioids as we is whe're going in this country there isnan opioid epidemic i'm i do to think about addictive lability and it is in my view it is pretty clear that when we are talking about drugs they have different degrees of addictive liability i'mang i had a cup of coffee this morning am i and many of us listening to this pod cass it is really hard to start our day without getting that hit of kathine but are we addicto to kathine that is a tricky question because i've never heard of anybody robbing a bank to get kathene destroying their personal life to get katheiene 'm i would say kahiene causes tolerance but i would not say it has a particularly high addictive liability i'm whereas drugs psycho stimulants cocane i'm have a very oropio it is have a very high addictive liabily to answer your meca is to question there 've been some famous studies done im by the director of the national to undrug abuse nor volkov i'm simultaneously there've been studies in animal models of ediction where you nailed it the in a rough way the addictive liability of a substance is directly correlate it with two aspects of dopamine how much dopamine is released in the cumbents and the conetics of the dopaminy says you sait how rapidly it is released to get a little technical even with the drug cokane or opioids it is not only the drug itself it is the root of administration because the root of administration influences the conetics meaning how fast that drugs gets into your brain influences the reward sircatry and how fast it causes a big rapid release of dopamine and some of your podcastlisteners may be old enough to remember the crack cokane epidemic or freebase cokane and cokane does have methampheta mene a very high addictive liability i teach the nerbi id give lectures to students that standford about nerbilogy of ediction is part of a team course team taught course i have kids im who i had to deal with and whantyou know what i always say is youno you it is not that if you use this drug your automatically goingto become an atdict i'm but you are taking that risk and it is impossible to become addicto to a substance if you have never used it by definition but back to the root of administration i i went off that ta tanorsor statement om because i think we may have heard that in high school though i 'm to be ois was not the must attentive i an ire ret that etical students be on't co entually o u i there was not no battle om but you that you cannot become addicted to something that you have never done which a i just want it you remark that because i think it is a profound statement because it points to the importance of the memory system but also plasticity and i i want i maye sure the ventsury we get around to talking about how am the amount of dopening released in the conatics how that might influence plasticity the o wen asking youre cuing up in the back your mind is whether r not addiction is just related to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior or when we are under the influence of a drug or whether or not it actually modifies neral circuitry in a way that makes a broughter range of a drugs or experienceis attractive to us it is probably the latter but let me get back and i will answer that in a second to the point i was making it is not only the substance it is the root of administration ino as i said you cannot develop a problem with the substance and develop as substance ribues problem if you never take it but snorting cocane is a different experience then smoking it or injecting it and ont of the reasons the crack cocane epidemic was powerful is it it gets into when you are smoking it or injecting it at gets in and people do this now with methamphedami i ming methatics most of them and that is another epidemic in our country most of them smoke it and that the danger of that is the drug whether it is cocane methon phedaming gets into your brain almost instantaneously causes a very rapid powerful s urge of dope men in the accumbance in this reward circuitry and that the feeling you get which and we areging to get into this is not necessarily a happy feeling and it only last it can last for ttensive seconds or a few minutes and it is a feeling that for gives you this overwhelming compulsion and urge i want o do it again butso yoeven no it may not actually feel all that good it is it is it is r and and again this gets into you knon we did not have in edyction problem for any substance other than alcohol im ouno for most of humanity's existence because these substances cocene methemphetomen synthetic op bouids vential they did not exist and our brain the truth is our brains are were not are not designed to handle those kinds of very powerful substances as many of i've been taking ag one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsering the pod cast ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundation al nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitements and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with ag one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need and it also contains adaptedence to help buffer strests simply put i always feel better when i take ag one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste grigt for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer ag one if you would to try ag one thoy'g to drink ag one dot com slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitem inde three at to again that is drink agy one dacam slash hubermen whend you wane to go from here you asked a question about the the neurl mechanisms of of what we call ediction yei to know about the roll of neroplasticity and ediction i i do want a highlight something you said in i apologize for interrupting a moment ago an no a that iverefrybodyoto wis an interruption based on real excitement because a a a person i know quite well who is a recovered coquane atic told me and that by the way folks this is not i have a friend anomicia i truly have never tried coquane num and this person said that the first time they did coquane his thought was i hate this and i cannot wait to do it again exand and that is exactly how you described and i think that is a fairly common experience with people suffering from an ediction disorder were not supposed to use the word atic any more because that is a little bit judgemental and not an you knowing claa as something along thos long o on a onl an atic as must a being indicted you being o and that is abeautiful description i hate it but i want to do it again and again it just shows the pa the power of this system which remember evolved for our survival a very simple way of thinking about it is these drugs are tricking the reward circuitry to say this stimulus this experience is really important for my survival i have to go do it again and again and again a side question is the huge question is why to some people develop an ediction problem and others who have used the substance just do not and is again as a world class ner sciencist yourself the answer it is always a complex combination of underlying genetics the environment in which they find themselves the environment in which they grew up and how that modified their reward circuitry to get at your question am one set of experiments my lab did which other labs did tu i do not deserve the sole credit for this is showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity in the nurons that make up the cells that make up the reward circuitry and in fact drugs of abuse cocane methemphetamine opioids morphine heroine change the what the synapses the synapses are the connections from other nerve cells on to dopaminurons on to the nerve cells in the eccumbens and these connections these synapsis con change and drugs of abuse cause powerful changes in those connections and therefore powerful changes in the activity of the dopaminurons and the nurons in the in the ventural in the in thenuclious ceccumbents and in fact the types of changes that occur appear to be similar to the types of changes that of evolved for good uses for adapted forms of learning and memory ofm again this is an example that this asuperficially simple dopamine reward circuitry is changing all the time as is highly plastic and can become more sensitive to certain experiences et cetera et cetera could ask a question about some of the general contours of the plasticity in the nopening system on the usaid before and i love this statement even though its very simple but in its simplicity its really elegant that we cannot be come addicted to a substance oour a behavior that we have not i'm taken or partaken in is there data to support the idea that just one exposure to coquene or one exposure to some sort of behavior can lead to a lasting change in the dopamine system such that one's propensity to be addicted to that substance again if one were to indulge in the future or behavior again in the future is increased and i've a very particular reason for asking this but 'm very curious with the answer i mean an in the work my lab and other labs have done in preclinical rodant models i'm the answer is yes a single administration of a drug of abuse coquane it morphine can cause relatively several days several weeks of changes in the connections on to dopamenorons and on to i'm the nurans in the nucli ceccumbence those changes that does not mean these changes are permanent or i'm or irreversible but the changes last a long time i'm and again the big question for understanding the nerbiology f ediction is what you now those changes are probably happening in most people who take the drug in this case and we can talk about other stimuli non drug stimuli that can become in quotes edictive and again why in certain individuals to be honesti it is not a big deal yet i did coquane at this party it was nice but i do not feel any craving or urge to do it again i'm whereas other individuals thit sets them down a a very bad path and really badly effects their life and that is a huge question in the research field the s obviously if we could make predictions on which individuals are more susceptible i'm and not to get to political here i'm but it is also whether you become adevelop a problem with e diction or not is influenced by the other parts of your life you have other ways of getting reinforcing stimuli getting satisfaction scaving an outlet that other ways of activating your reward or dopamine circuitry hel oisis your healthy ways i youknow as you have articulated i thinkin in your podcast getting exercise you and i both to get exercise i feel really good sometimes at painful during the exercise but afterwards i feel great i'm very day almost in th universe in on of the colcanrs mone im yetim the desire and then that i hate this but i cannot we to do it again an seems l exercises off in the opposite yes i hate this i do not want to do this and then aafterwards gosh i always feel better and i'd be happy to do it again i man yes i mean i to exercise chasing a ball that because that gets me off thinking about this hurts madam anyhow back to adiction i'm yes these drugs can cause w i dononce definly not permanent changes from a single exposure i'm are not know and and the types to studi some talking about were all done in experimental animals how that relates to what happens in our brains in human subjects prains is it is not completely clear but i think there are parallels the changes might last a few days a weaker to i'm but one can see if somebody there have been studies done where in an animal model if you give repeated administration of a drug cocane the changes get stronger and they last longer which is kind of intuitively obvious but again the big question is why in human subjects there are people who can use these substances and not develop a serious problem in their others were theyre theire very very damaging and youand then that is why i still make the point if youare a young person if yu yure do you want to take that risk is it worth it im to have that experience and that is an individual decision we have got we have done some potcas uphizons about alcohhol canabas atgetter and there jit seem to be a pretty wide variation in people's response to the anformation i think because there are people out there who while i've i've got friends who a e recovered alcoholics yes who i who will tell me the first drenkth they took ythey use language it combined with the chemistry of my body in a way that nothing before ever had and they felt it was this magic elicir that has not been my expan an i and i have heard the same stories and it is it is hard for me to relate because you alcohol does not have that effect on me and that is where that is it is hard to believe that kind of immediate response to alcohol is due to their in the environments in which they grew up obout that can have an influence that jus feels almost more genetically incodeit and there is evidence that issues with the use of alcohol and developing alcohol use disorder does run in families im an obvious of it runs in family yo have to worry about how the environments of that family influences an but there is a lot of study saying there is a genetic component i'm maybe you if i have a drink cuto in the aftern i just fall asleep yein it does not have that effect on me ian ya and i'm and any one can imagine similar things for other drugs of abuse there are people who have used coqane of use methemphetamng who find it modestly enjoyable but it is not the be all an end allit is not this incredibly powerful experience and you just talked about i think a friend or a colleague who said i hate it i hate that but i want to do it again and that is fascinating and theyare now i recovered a i'll call i in coqane attic and thife they have abstained for many years but still get a little bit of a glean in their eye when they talk about i'll call heir cone in a way that i just cannot relate to i'm in relate em can i tell you a little vinette about me which i love to tell im here and it gets in to how the reward circuitry is closely associate it with memory systems and how cuse associate it with powerful experienceis develop their own reenforcing reverse of quality longstery short when i was a young and i cannot remember in my twenties maybe twenty i spent a few weeks in paris i started smoking cigarettes meg this is a long time ago and i got its cigarettes are very interesting niccatine is highly addic to as are as the tobacco companies were fully aware of high addictive liability very high adjictive li teople wh rob people for the money to buy cigarette i'm they may not rob because although they are bemy understandings have become quite expensive but s not devotesign how mny how much our fit cigarettes are uge markit for organized crime the ere are thirt parts of are of ore in the world third world countries where organized crime produce countefit cigarettes and are making hundreds of millions forbillions of dollars i'm and i think nicotine as it is delivered in cigarettes as i mig tobacco companies put in a lot of work to figure out the exact dose of nicotine that will make you get that kind of feeling that only last for a few minutes you want to do it again and again i'm we can talk about theand nicotine what becomes an a problem in a specific society with the diction is not only based on the nurobiological actions if we are talking still about drugs or substances of that substance it is heavily influenced by the availability of the substance tant but my my little story as i smoke some cigarettes in paris i i ia i i learned why people to smoke it was very satisfying to have a cigarette in a parisian catajust in ow it is very interest me s the first few times you inhal tobacco if you get dizzy it is kind of aversive and it is exactly what you articulated despite that you want to do it again i i it was just a lot of fun for me i enjoyed it and i was disciplined and at some point whenever this was i came back and itsays i did not smoke i'm because i knew wit was bad for you but to this day forty years later every time i go back to paris i get cravings i actually just one i get aback o cigarettes i wanted im te have that dealing again of inhaling the smoke but the point is of how no powerful these rewarding experiences can be or reenforcing experiences and for your audience technically iu know what i have been taught by some of my psychology colleagues is we use the term reenforcing in a very behaviorly defined way something is reenforcing is if it the behavior that led to that stimuli it makes you want to do that behavior again rewarding means it actually felt in quotes good am at's an important they ad sulely can be different again as you defined by your friend who his i forget i think it was coquene coqune was highly reenforcing but it was not necessarily enjoyable or rewarding and is not that fascinating i have a some colleagues in the ediction feeld am i one of them mis retired now cannot berrage in terry robinson they they coin they distinguish between the terms twanting and liking and think about that liking something means it is something you you enjoy am wanting means you wanted but you do not necessarily t or enjoying and that is a description of your friend's experience with coqueing some of us have been in destructive relationships where you want that individual but you are not sure you are necessarily that aniia som nice people will be in relationships wer they actively dislike the other gang is not that which is a bit forn of a concept to me but will it is intreting thiss this separation of reenforcing and rewarding wanting and liking because one of the things that is very prominent in twelve step programs is to create rewards around abstaining from the dryeter behavior and i should mention that programs twelfth step when followed seemed how very high successorace at least that to at onalempky tel lls me ium that in some ways they are modifying the wanting and liking their splitting the wanting and liking of ou o i'll call for instance creating a a liking of sobriety more than the wanting of alcohol therins that is beautifully put im and i think that is right m how that plays out in the nurrl mechanisms that is a nur scientists om interests in man that is a tough one im but i think that is wise those programmes are pretty successful it is helping the person make those dissociations im and i i do not know that much about those programmes bees i have not seen patience myself for whatever it is been twenty seven twenty eight years but i think part of them are to help that individual find as you both other sources of liking and reward im getting some sadtics fash satisfaction and reward from the actual abstinence being able to cognitively teach themselves that i deserve a pat in the back i deserve credit i feel good that i did not take a drink at that party that i did not use that substance again and how that plays out in our brains is a really tough one yet those ere the way you described it is exactly right those those programms are highly reenforcing for abstinence behaviors everything from the social connection which we were goig to get to social connection as we know ium to the way that people start to conceptionalize their attic self for sas other self its actinvalvs a a splitting of the self in an interesting ways as longs we are talking about doughnuts cigarettes o longcokin i'm curious a before we move to a bit more o neuroplasticity is there anything that people ought to know about how different substances an behaviors that are addicting might impact the dopeming reward circuitry differently for instance m weh tock about coqane is having this very rapid ons that big increase in dopening and a crash as we know a certain pattern of canatics as you describe it the opoid crisis is is incredibly serious problem right now ah as is met them fedomin u but it somdsthing met them fedoming functions a bit coqnean in terms of its canatics ust an opioid is a very different chemical than cope cocane but it sounds it impacts the dopeming system is the dopum annurgic activity caused by opoids responsible for the addictive properties of opiods or do people also the feeling of being under opioits i personally hate it coming out of surgery they gave me they gave me vicidin once and i i hated it i'd rather have the pain most operative pain then take something vicadinor or valium or fentinalor anything that to me is just completely aversive but i realize that there are many millions of people that feel quite differently it is a great question i think all the studies both then human beings and preclinical animal models yes would suggest that the c the addictive liability of opioids and psycho stimulants which are coqne and met them fenamine have the common final action of causing massiv release of dopamine in this target of the dopemenerons the newcly seccumbencs they do it if you going to get a little scientifically technical here the avery different mechanisms cocane and methamphetaming what the drugs known as psycho stimulants i'm actually bind to a protene in the brain are a molecule in the brain that is responsible for sucking up it is a vacum cleaner bsucking up the dopamne after it is been release and cocane prevents that dopamine from being vacuumed upso the cocane hangs around longer methnononly prevents the dopamine from being vacumed up it actually causes the reverse it actually causes the direct release of dopamine from what we call nerve terminals from the sight where dopamines release opioid's work very differently they actually primarily not solely work we are the dopaminurons live and it is a little complicated if it is not that critical but they indirectly it increased the activity within the dopaminurons themselves causing a big massive bigger than normal release of dopami that is one comminality i'm but anybody who has used these drugs youe read about these drugs the subjective experience of the drugs are dramatically different and that is because of the actions theire having not only in the reward circuitry but throughout the brain in it it is interesting you talked about vicadand i've taken viken in because i've had several nesurgeries and things you i did not it i've t i've gotten other opioids for pain releaf that were great i mean they took they took away a lot of pain after my ligament repair i'm and that is a different question that even when you are talking about opioids all drugs are not cret are they are not identical thentinel has a m ch big larger i'm addictive liability because of its molecular properties and how it is intracting with the opioid system in our brains and the recepturs the actual protines in the braine that it intracts with but the subjective experience of opiits anding it is interesting a some people lof it that is you if we go back in history as the're wore the i'm opium dens throughout im asia i'm there were wars about opiitsing the the the famous opoit wars between china and the united kingdom im showing you how powerful im the availability of a substance an opioit can be ii'm going off in its hansion no i alwasrise but commonality is dopeming release in the accommons but it is of if you remember what a vendiagram is all these drugs have some common actions usually on directly or indirectly causing the mass of release of dopamine in the accomments but then they have their own individual actions because obviously when you take cocane or meth them that amen it is a stimulator you are enough people are grinding their chieth their hyped up for most people opioits of the exact opposite youre i mean in opium dens from the movies i watch in watching narcos and all those chievies shows you are often you are lying down you are youre kind of in almost a dream state very different subjective experiences i to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolite drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium an potassing the called electrolytes and no sugar owsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerves ls also called nurons and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to electr elike ratio of one thousand miligrams that is one grahm of sodium two hunder miligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolits and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i'v been sweating lot and certainly i drink element in my water when i'm in the sana and after going in the sauna becausethat cause is quite a lot of sweating if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc cam slash huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element dot cam slash huberman i had not experience with the opioyd recently a no a voluntarily over the christmas holiday we went to visit friends and before going to sleep i wanted some tea and i asked if they had any non calfna to te they gave me this ta and u a that night i had the most bizar dreams i've ever had and i slept for fourteen hours the next morning i what was that tea and i fell off in the morning and i went is ashally a blue lodis flouer tea that is actually illegal in the united at it is sold and it has morphine compounds in it i am one of those feel its very susceptible a to even low doses of any kind of novel drug an the anotsoso interest i a ever takin cofgsirp with dextera mthorphia no i anwy that stuff why i ha n i have a tendency what i get a cold i it gets into my long as i cough a lot and i think this has been reported this is my anitotal exp m confirming what you said dextera mothorphan is a different sort of opioi then actually some people develop a problem with it for me it gives me really bazaar dreams i really was similar to what you he was a very unusa maste holds different conversation about what makes us dream and what e whatar the meaning of dreams fascinating and i hope you coverd may be you have coverd thatd we have not yet but we are intending to do a whole series on sleep in dreamly that would be ald madin get in ti started out in sleep researts i have a fondness for it drug research in sleep research hav a long itry of overlap with allan hobson's work on now i worry with allan hopstoke but by the way folks if your interesto hi relationship between a hallucinations in dreaming allen hobson is a good name to start youre a your ratit nonot see at amal bri nineteeol my god i'm dating myself nineteen i oh seventy i canmemver was seventy six or seventy seven i worked with allen hobsoness and underground that harven ma no i asn't undergraduate at harvord he was at harvory hadical scholner i may e i mof his writing and i hat a lot ot on it very really ahead of his time yes he was i will get i was i should nobody would anybody who knows me will not believe this but i fact that i was a very shy insecure twenty year old would not have guess who o i and even he medical schol i ought i litelly was not confident of my opinions at all i was very shy wasn' thought all of the ideas i had must be obvious and i should never save them outloud do my fask on as as ice you raise us i aninsyule in portant i min you you have this incredible a creer track record i your adored by your college es here highly restracted you one just by a reward a word there is to win an ur sience to wery something in particular that on ike was in an overnight thing or one day you woke up and thought i a canly manly van myself but if you would not mind sharing that cause i did not before we tal get back into some of the science i this sciencis a human endeavor and and most people listening or probably not scientist but i think everybody deals with these issues a of of self doubt and people appeared out vering levels of confidence but a what whald happened iav to thank you for asking im it would enough for me it was a very gradual process and im 'm not as as an undergraduate as a medical student even as a postocc ye i was very unsure of my ideas of my intellectual abilities of whether what i was thinking was really in a worth while as a very gradual process i think it the increase in my confidence i think began when i was a postock which is a training period after you have received a ph dar and emdy where you get additional research training and i worked with gy name roger nicol at you see as f an roger was a very for intellectually intense very forceful individual and i got involved in a field where i'ming people a little bit of a tansion your your your listeners may think that science tist are these gek individuals wearing white coats with no passion or emotion and nothing could be further from the truth the most successful scientists i know a pretty passionate in pretty intense about what there working on andriven im an then this is a grocialization anyhow during my postoc i started getting involved in a topic were there were vigorous arguments about phenomenology we were studying i had to develop a tougher and thicker skin i had to be able to argue my side of of the hypotheses we were genering i it started developing as a postc and then it slowly evolved as an assyst e professor i'm in for your listeners who do not know i do not to admit this but i'm in my late sixtis ihave been running my own lab for almost forty years i'm soi heveen i'm gradually as an assistant professor i realized hey i can do this i can do science i can write papers that my colleagues seem to be interested in and then gradually w over then the next ten twenty thirty years i et i gained more and more confidence i fom me i was this very gradual i'm build up of many different experiences were i developed some confidence that ye not all of my ideas sir grat of course they are not but it is o kayed avoice o my opinion it is o k to state my ideas and why i believe this and why i do not believe that that was my experience thank you for sharing that shous i think a people struggle with the that very issue and i'm clearly showing up again and again over a long prte of time is helpful but as he said hou'd tre learning to trust one's ideas just a brief anecdote o when i was i'm coming up in narrow science a few years behind you i noty years ni not too many i mean si bacates i i rerecall the incredible number of high profile papers monnero plasticity and long termitentiation on turn depression tese are terms a related to the modification of synnapses i'm that romolinka and roger na coal pioneered a big segment to that work and as i remember seeing your names on papors and i thought roger worked for you sarry ri not li love to hear i lii i inly later did i learn that you ere a his post ox an an ad then we collap berated as yuyou make ham peers very quick very quickly i soyou' had and rog and i rogers wonder i i did have the confidence even as to postthough any actually even as a grads don even though i was a little insecure about my ideas i wanted to be treated as an equal that is the one thing i did have i never felt that i was working for somebody else i always felt that i was working for myself and that we were colleagues i'm even though my menturers or had more experience and i could learn from them but i ith you are working for yourself even though you have mentors ii think there is there' some real gems in what you just describes to thank you for ciriking the time to do that sir i'd to discuss one aspect of reward circuitry that i do not think most people think about igt fairly straightforward i nowadays i i to think no more people know what dopamean is and understand it thanks to your work and hones work and some discussions have taken place on or poncasts other podcast but you knows all too often we think dopamin reward wanting liking drugs oca all of that is great but what about the truly adaptive stuff right because it is it is am easy to fall into a discussion around dopamen of the things that are bad for us but what i'm thinking about here is social interaction im clearly we are a social species and a lot of your work in the last im decate and a half or has focased on the relationship between the reward circuitry which you beautifully described for us and social interaction and connection and where i'm going with this is ultimately this has huge implications for autism and otism spectrum disorders i do not know nowdays is it ocae you not specicalotism a disease is that right you hear bout naurotypical and neuroatypical but is but i have friends who have children who are severely artistic and a i do not know many parents who w d elect to have a severely autistic kid and those people often wi talk about it as autism where a child having autismsm first all before we get into the social piece maye because i justable that what it howe resuppose to talk about autism nowadays i i i am very interested in the pat of physiology of what the medical profession terms autism spectrum disorder as you points it out the individuals living with an autism spectrum disorder are quite heterogeneous and it can range from individuals with severe intellectual impyrment and quite severe impyrments in social intractions impairments in censury processing impairments and in lots of different aspects of our behaviors that ar importante and i think nobody would say would argue those individuals on the severe spectrum do not have some sort of in quotes disorder the issue we have to be sensitive to is it is it is a heterogeneous disorder many brain issues that psychiatrists deal with depression we all obsessive compulsive sorter various anxiety disorters tit is always on a continua man aspectrum for aughtisinspectrum disorder there are individuals who are high functioning who one could argue have a different style of intracting socially may have a different way of processind sentury information but who have who would prefer not to be viewed as having an illness but rather would be viewed as having a different style of living and interaction and i think we need to respect that the challenge is againd not oversimplifying a complec heterogeneus disorder om and both being respectful of the people who do not want to be defined as having a nur psychatric or brain disorder while equally being respectful of people your friends with severely impaired children who deserve help who deserve research and it is a tough one because my understanding from tobeonust just reading articles in the lay press and going to websites from organizations that philathropically support research related to autism with in that community of individuals who are not researchers but who have family members are are themselves dealing with some degree of augtis inspect rom disorter there is disagreements about how to what terminology to use how to deal with them and it is complicated i think we just have to respect everybody and if youre interacting with individuals ui think it is appropriate what do you prefer om i do know as a medical professional ther and especially when you aredealing with children there are children who need help and i iiwe are not doing them a service by saying they do not have an issue that we should be helping them with in working on i hope that answers your question beautifum i think it beautifully answers it and encompasses all sides that we can move forward and i think is we use the term a autism or children are people with autism om that is wil referring i think people are very sensitive especially those individuals who are neuro a typical who previously might be dognas as aught tos inspectrum disorder but would prefer to not be labelled as having a brain illness that that is fine it is kind of once you are an adult you can make that decision for yourself we certainly have colleagues at stamford and elsewhere nd ii my nniclenical assessments ome tural somewhere on that and again it is in continue of just ou know the experience of depression is in a continual but n as we depression you love a child or an adult any less because they have depression nor would you the other child are adult any less a because of a expression of some artisms wy i di know that when i people do not and we have we are being trained in the medical profession to be very for and our societies going this way to very careful with the terms we use and the labelling of individuals yeouknow i've been taught you can say individuals living with an artism spectrum disorder some people do not using a term of that individual is artistic because that has some can have some i doft wan to say derogatory meaning but some labeling kind of but you done sometimes thits gets out of control too as we are oth now and forsake of fluid conversation we will do our best we will acknowledge from the outset that we are well meaning but far from perfectn and how i handeliss wel p welits an think about social intractions ind leaving us ide anything relate to outism for the moment it appears that the circuits in the brain that mediate the desire to spend time with others of the same species maybe even with other species lik a are fairly hard wired but modifiable they we were born with the capacity to build them up and that social behavior is highly rewarded is it rewarded through the dopening system and what if any involvement is there of the ceratonergic system and we have not talked about ceratonian iet but id love to bring up ceratona at this point may you could educate us sa lilbit about ceratonan because am kush if dopamean is fascinating ceratonian is at least as incredible am you great quession i i think for me these thist way for me to answer it is actually just tell you my resurce history and how a la mine at stand for that at one point was studying what y what you and i would call fairly hard core molecular mechanisms of neuroplastecity how to connections between nerve cells change and what molecules are changing and pretty hard cor molecular stuff how did i end u studying social behaviours in mice and what i hope we will end up talking about even developing behaviour models of what i will define as empathy in mice the answer is very simple my lab was working on rolls of classic dopamin reward circatry and how it changeis in models of ediction we have not talked about depression models of depression because just intuitively hopefully your listeners can understand if one component of depression is what we call antedonia the inability to experience reward eating adona is no longer satisfying having sex is no longer that much fun which is a component of depression if there is a mechanism in the brain that tells you something is rewarding my definition that is not functioning normally in severe depression we were doing models of depression to figure out how the dopamin reward circati was changing as were many other labs we were studying addiction those were the obvious ones and aving it might be entertaining to to your audience to youlearn how academic scientist think i was thinking those or fascinating topics they are pretty competitive 'm lots of other labs were working on it ance i started thinking what other experience is might be modifying the reward sir catri i actually made some attempts to look at feeding behavior but i do not want a emingwe actually never pursued that for variety of reasons and that is obviously important because of there isnan obesity epidemic in this country i'm and we can talk about how the reward sircatri and some of the things we'tve learned from our studies of a diction may be helpful to understanding o besity but back to social intraction i started thinking well for most of us awhat i call a pro social nonsectual experience is highly reinforcing i'm andrew your pretty social guy am a pretty social guy most of the time i'd rather go to a movy asporting event a dinner with friends i'm it is no actually for me the most meaningful component of my life other than spending time with my children is spending time with my close friends 'm and i started thinking whet why is that why do i have such a good time going to a ball game with my best friend or going out to dinner with another couple i'm and interacting it is because while it is highly renforcing and if it is highly reinforcing it must involve the reward sir catri and then i started thinking evolutionarily it makes a lot of sense because if you are part of a social species there is a lot of evolutionarily a lot of advantages for your survival to be hanging out with other members of your species in a non aggressive way it can increase your likelihood to fined demate and reproduce it can protect you from preditors i mean that is why any of your listeners who ever watch wild life shows or national geographic shows there is a reason all these animals hang out together it is for protection from preditors o therre all these reasons about whenever it was thirteen or fourteen years ago my lab decided to start looking at how the rewark circuitry may play a rol in what i am gon to call positive pro social non aggressive interactions another word we used this just sociability m and for variety of reasons that back them this is got this is at least thirteen years we may be fifteen years ago a postock join my lab named gul dolland she is now professor john's hopkins and she had an interest in oxytoson and as your listeners kno oxy cosen is this evolutionarily can serve narrow peptide that is very important for parturition the having a baby born fom milk being produced and it is gotten a lot of attention as a potential love narrow peptide is something that is released in our brains during a positive social intraction there is a a well known researcher in social behavior and bonding research called larry young and he did some very important ow somewhat classic work studying a species called the voll in particular the prairie vol and prairie volls or a species where they mate for life it is called perbonding one voll will find another voll they basically get married they have kids and there they hang out together for the rest of their life o divorce i fiftyu no an we are no rifty the per centiv orstra and what larry elegantly showed in part in early days in collaboration with the kindintom insul who is tha famous academic psychiatrist they showed that oy tosan action within the neucly secumbents within this reward sir catry was required and really important for this monogamist perbonding having said that there was just a paper that called into question that but b ut that is but there is thirty hors of ersert yeir to that and and i'm glad you brought that out iis tat willkeep this contemporary and the that the reality is that that recent paper got a lot of attention wo nother papers yet an any oxhe tosin is not playing as prominent a s thar boding as people ae thought and yet folks a that could be true we haven to be scientific about this in the open minded but there is yo three decades of o work that that speaks to the contrary i think we want to bein liwe want away the otit and we went yo exactly and again the the investigators who presented the work saying oxitos may not be as important there are limitations to the manipulations they did which they would agree with i'm just telling you gouldolin was ta postoc in my labe and we just tight we formulated a project to look at the actions of oxy tosen in the neukly secumbens in mice and the reason we study mice is you the're what are known as a genect genetically tractable organism we have all sorts of really cool and sophisticated tricks we can do to probe brain circuitry the actions of nermadulators dopeming and ceratonan an oxy tosen in ways that we cannot do in other species and i'm weng to get back to dopemine in a second and what we f ound was that oxytosen action in the neuclesa cumbents was indeed important for promoting sociability probably for promoting the reinforcing component of a social interaction and that surprised us it was wow its its oxy tosan seems to be causing enhancing the release of seratonen in the nucleus of cumbents and that will will i perhaps will get to this that led me off on a whole series of experiments trying to fingure out how seratoneand works studying this drug we may talk about called m diama which is ecstasy or moli which actually causes release of seratonum we did that work and that gotis working in seratone simultaneously there were some other papers reporting that dopamine release in the accumbents that dopamine is released in the accumbens during a social interaction a positive nonaggressive social interaction truth be told may also be released during an aggressive interaction some people leke to fight some people to fight and the difference here is the dopamine released and its roll and social ntractions its not specific only for social intraction as we have talked about but nevertheless that led my lab and other labs to do a series of papers iam talking about the field now showing that and i'm giving you a lot of information here how my dopamine release happened during a nonaggressive social interaction it turns out that oxy tosen is not only released in the nucle ofcumbens its released in the home of the dopaminerons in the vitie my lab in another lab from north western showed that oxy tosen can actually magule dopami n er on activity in the ventural tegmental aream i hope i making sens here i do notwant to c lo tecte to i thut it just shows how we discuss these neurimodulators dopame i just brought in oxytoson we are gong to talk about saratona a second unfortunately for your listeners they do not work in isolation they communic they influence each other in ways that i think it is important for us to understand and e lucida that is not too much technical dear ter and i think it is wonderfully rich with there eas for us to discuss and i'm very glad that youve brought up that neither dopamine nor saratonan nor oxytosin work an isolation because all too often and admittedly sometimes even on my podcass i'll talk about these things an isolation as a way to try and simplify them a bit but there is just no way that the brain works that way frence is turning on doamine and turning off saratoneand it is a waiting of of imputs and i think that seratani perhaps i should frame it this way just as often as dopamine is framed as this reward molecule and pleasure and dopaming hits all too often i think in the popular press seratonan is discussd and oxytosen to for that matter as this kind of warm feel good everything's mello not really associate with reward in reenforcement and a of course it is not that simple when it comes to social interactions it sounds oxytosan and saratone an are playing a prominent roll also in the accumbents and that dopamin is is activated to you has that right ok i do not want take us too far down the rabbit whole of nurl ccircuit function but that to me makes at least a brief discussion about the nucles accumbent itself interesting the o case i'm thinking neucleous i know that means a pilin or an aggregation of yros its talking to this ventral striatum we geat a clunchin hard of dev ntral strne arlet it a subdivision amusime ya i mis spoke am yet it is partheventral stritum and its im and and then rons there can be active and communicate with other brainareas but we are talking about a lot on new ants of fona maan i'm not m a smiling out with your audience an an seemin soilbis it is i sometimes go to bed feeling it is complicated my god it is yetcould we say that within the nuclesacomments there are nurons that are acting as u'm accelerators and breaks anes there a simple analogy that perhaps while not exhaustive can still be true suat always the goal on this pot as here is no enger cin be exhaustive but we want to be as accurate as possible a very influential hypothesis which has guide at my thinking and again the trick aingna you have done a wonderful job of communicating complex scientific topics to your podcast audience and i congratulate you on that imin its reali its o the really important role im but as it is always more complicated than we want it to be a sciencists especially when youre dealing with brain activity issues and how the brain mediates all it is amazing functions m historically we have thought about the nucleous cecumbents and other components of this ventural stride old brain area as primarily being composed of two different cultypes and as you point it out one being soratofe and accelerator something that promote certain behaviors im and the other sul type somewhat being a break saying do not do that behaviour do not perform that motor action and it it is true that there are these different saltypes it is true that they are modulate it by these modulators jopening in seratone and indifferent ways ofm an that simplistic hypothesis or uristic we call it has been very useful in making models about how the accumbence does all its wonderful things what of leading up to its it is it unfortunates a little more complicated but yes it is there are two different saltypes and at least for your audience we can think about jopamin driving the activity of one promoting certain behaviors and inhibiting the activity of the other saltype and being a sort of break on certain behaviors as long as you and i a scientists appreciate it is not quite thats some curites a little more complicated using that as a frame work to think about social behavior as you said it prosocial nonaggressive nonsectual interactions involve the choice of a lot of behaviors but also the suppression of a lot of behaviors and om ance maybe your sarriness anse what iam doing here im i i think for people to understand how a single structure the accomments could mediate social interaction and reward it we it sounds its doing is rewarding a certain categaryor and catalogue of behavior aloptions and punishing or at least reducing the probability of the occurrence of other behavior lactions as when i go to dinner with your ends if i know them really well i might hug them i might even say something mildly and appropriate if i know the contact to be safe an i but at a dinner interview or discussion with somebody i barely know i might watch my words a little bit more yon for instance and i think the accumbents and its associated ciri love the way just put that probabilities it is my probability of having this behavior in a certain context is increase my prod the probabilities of not doing certain behaviors and i think there is little doubt that this brainarea called the nucly uccumbente and all of its associated circuitry play a very important role in what behaviors you choose to do pursue play a very important role in these making the decision and performing these prosocial nonaggressive nonsensual interactions i actually also think it playsa role an empathy andan leading you there i want to have a discussion about that elam again the as a mechanistically driven neurscientist what is frustrating for me is i i know a lot of the connections its making and the other brain areas its communicating with but i cannot give you a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens o yet yet yet youre still anowhat i can say is even at our current level of understanding it is leading to novel hypotheses that are allowing the developyont of perhaps tu if we bring it back to osism that are allowing the development of novel at the at the moment farmichologic theraputics that might be helpful for people who are not having normal prosocial intractions and would to have them would to be abut funct function in that domain in a more adaptive and productive and meaningful way and that is the important of the kothe importance in my view of the kind of mechanistic work my lave an many other laves around the country are doing even if we do not have a detaile understanding of how it is all happening we can identithy drugs and drugable cargets or even behaviorl interventions that might actually help people for for example suffering from autismspectrum disorder of the sort that they actually want and meed interact needs the repuic help i think looking at a the social connection circuitry a through the lends of autism is going to be very interesting for us to do i do have a question about what is being selected for in rewarding social interactions because obviously am we are living a time where you do not we do not have to aggregating groups necessarily to protect ourselves physically am it helps in certain ways am and certain circumstances but certainly to support our selves in each other emotionally now having people that we can call on when we are not feeling well that we can look to a for resources and that they can look to us a but when we go out to dinner with friends or we go to a ball gane with friends or we interact with friends i'm very familiar with the feeling o well that felt really good it just elgo to gives me energy it actually gives me energy to go back and do other things spend four days alone am with a bunch of papers and lectures preparing for a podcasts which i also really enjoy am but when i do that when i go out to dinner with friends or sea friends i'm not thinking about buffering myself against loneliness when i do it i just the interaction am what sorts of at am evolutionary hypotheses can we come up with as to why the human brain is tuned for these social interactions whyit is rewarded by not just one dopame i also seritoriton and anocsjus in three prominent nauramodulatory a the chemicals in the brain are devoted at one sight in the brain and others that it is connected to of course but to making sure that we do this as often as possible without giving up e rest of our lives why may i again i th i think the answerment o be able to give i hope it is not tried and it may be a little bit obvious is and in some ways it is its its analogous to why drugs of abuse and addiction are also a problem is that the circuitry that is telling us a prosocial positive intraction is highly reinforcing evolved over millions of years or hundreds of thousands of yours whatever tha that is and i the only hypothesis i can come up with in and o you may be able to come up with better ones is what i alluded to earlier is it it was very adaptive when we were more primitive organisms never mind nonuman primates but when we were whatever we were to be a social species 'm for basically primarily to reasons for reproductive purposes it increased your likelihood of reproducing if you were hanging out with other members of your species and a nonaggressive way i'm and for protection against preditors i'm ad there may be other reasons i'm i child weary you ar loid a thingin in your absence and one of trusted friends they can watch your off yet i thank you ata very good point the circuits the modulator to use that evolved over milennia and as you pointed out i'm eventually idepending on the society in which you live you did not need those social intractions for protection against preditors i'm although if we look at our world now one can make arguments both ways if you are in a war zone is a better to be off by yourself as a better to be with a group of people i'm but it tay the m echanisms evolved for one purpose and they do not just disappear because there is no disadvantage to having this mechanism that tells us of social intraction is reenforcing and i would still argue there is benefit for reproductive purposes you cannot have kids if you are buy yourself all the time well nis is ithi think it is impossible ileacurrently and hand fine to partner with whom to have kids if you are socially isolate or makes it much harder i hope i'm answering your question i think and then and then as you points it out youo for many of us there is a lot of positive aspects to having friendships and hangingu with your friends emotional support hemotional buffering and feeling connected it suling tonect is notion a feeling connected i a and later will talk about psychadelics but i this notion of feeling connected has a lot to do with buffering loneliness when we are alone the memories and the and energy for lack of a better word that we feel in recalling social experiences and anticipating social experiences is really powerful yet you mention the that people cannot have children if they spend all their time alone it is actually i realize you are not on social mediaim more power to you but this actually a prominent discussion on social medi in or there is a entire culture of young people in particular young men these days who at least from what i understand in the the researchliterature about this are socially isolated spending another time on line maybe not even on social media but er spending a lot of time on line vidogameis hiding in electronic landscapes disional landscapes and concern about mental health issues there a et cetera i concern about porin over u senediction there et cetera but social media itself is an incredible phenomenon to considert in light of everything we are talking about am i cannot say even though i am on socha also shal media platm and i quite active there i cannot say that i've ever been on social media and experience the kind of delight and thrill and persistent energy a increase that i experience with in person interaction and yet social media i have to assume is capitalizing on some of these same reward mechanisms in presumably the nuclia seccumbents are there any data i relise as hard experiment to do in my may be imposs a there any deeda that you are aware of that am it shows that social media has a high addictive liability or do even need an experiment i i'm not sure we need an experiment i think it clearly does am i agree with the point you are making othough your our podcast audience probably does not know who i am i am in my late sixties i grew up but they know you are noerup before computers before salphonds am i still am a believer perhaps in an old fashioned way that physical interpersonal reactions are really important obviously there are advantages to being able to interact over social media and i eming for for all sorts of reasons there is a lot of positive and good from that back to your question can we get addicted i i cannot speak to social media i cannot speak an analempki i think can is much more able to eloquently describe the issue surround or i can just talk from my own experience that myself phone is am and chetnan i this is not social media but checking my email messages checking my text to my text messages has a for me has a compulsive edictive qualityi caeverpress ince a lever press for a mouse and i iiand part of that is my own personality part of that is the immediate theed back you get from a social medior post from seeing your nam mention getting a message from one of your friends sure i'd getting messages for my friends it means their thinking about me it means on part of their world i have no doubt it is activating my reward circuitry not nearly to the degree that a hit of coqane or an ope it would do ama am an o what else to say about it i a i i think as a society we we have to be aware of these issues and it is really comcomplicated how we manage especially onesure an adult you make your own decisions for better or worse but it is a you tissue obviously for anybody who has choldier and aris planning to have children anomults on social media ino i see lots of accounts of of people that are eighteen and older who they spend a lot of time on there and and i'm not necerly saing that is about thing a lot of people t of entire careers that exist on socia meya it just seems to me that om inseram face book limpton twitter have capitalized on this hardwired circuitry ap the release of ox having to make it really reduction as the release of ceretone and dopeming an oxytose and by virtue of someone saying something to us maybe not even a positive thing maybe 's a a a negative i i as you said they are thinking of us there' something about being recognized by others d maybe this is a good say we are hading towards empathy here ashion about him i think that is very well put the it is capitalizing on mes more primitive neurobiological mechanisms that evolved for purposes of reproduction and survival i think that is certainly has to be the case i and i think it is important n having thank you for bringing them up for i says o society to be at least aware of this and it dot it does not me it is many things tit is not all good it is not all bad it has there are positive uses of social mety i can see but yumostly we read about hthe dangers of it we read about these kids who are socially isolated who make bad decisions based on what their seeing with social meeting but anyhow back to the neurobout nerscience your absolutely correct i an capitalizing on these mechanisms m that evolved for physical interpersonal reactinteractions because the or evolution did not anticipat i just at nography is as apalizing on the sexual rals amp's reward circ as here r or another question about it and yet just as the gambling industry does i mean this that you kow the vaguest casinoes have full time people developing algarisms for how frequently should a slogt machine pay off what you k ow what is the perfect amount of pay off to keep certain individuals keepcoming bass oprnisios yeton i you coan tell i been spending a lottime around attics and former attics have been researching some somethings for the hodcast a an a gamling attic a ton is something interesting i said ye that the real stinger with being a gambling attic is that the next time really could change hav as no acoholic says that that the next drink could change everything for the matter or that the cocanatic does not the ono the next line of cocane could could make all of life better now and whever whereas the gambling attic actually holds in mind the n fentistimally smaller and yet am real potential that the next time really could wipe out their debt and perat perhaps wen in and yet we know they would lose that to rigt whatever winings and the casinos are fully aware of this i have been told fy friends who know theathat they employ in a full time quantitate for lack of a better term wi i what is going to say computer gik i do not mean to that the and nnobly ros iis tot and nurt i would be amazed if they do not have nur sciencis to have experties in what is called nurro economics for behaviourl economics im i ninety five per censure that has to be the case i occasionally sit down to the rulat table cause i just ast have ban easy and not long ago actually i had the experience of winning i fairlit not a large sumbody but a meaningful sona my fime and i'll tell you my sole mission at that point was to get up and go back to my room and not stop at another table i and i confess i pulled one brief sto an other table play o one hand and then and lost it and then just got back to my room as quickly as possible and then left lost fagus as quickly as possibly i gambling is diie at me the next time ye abling is again its all gets back to this reward circatry and the m intermitten reintermittent rewards are very very powerful well you mentiond earlier that the the reward system is powerfully tune to remember what were the behaviors that led up to the rewarding axariancei and and nobody nobody ever wont on the at the ruletto or craps table are poker table an by getting up in leaving yi a i got my t rain was just think it will how did i win i one by sitting down and putting chips on the table not by going back to my room exactly exactly and yet i have a ther number of degrees and i think my provental quortexis working and yet it was still challeno in that moment gambling is really in aving yet another human activity that is quite complicated it can be enjoyable and or can be incredibly damaging and now im all oregoing to think i was that gambling atic ayou at i swear im not fortunately ve very blessin that is not my ddiction i'd to talk about empathy and use that is a frame work for eventually returning to our discussion of lotism but you have this perhaps longstanding interest but recent research interest ind empathy tell me about this work i'm not familiar with ay i am go i'm git a i hope it is look a dragon the some work i've done on the strug called emdiama because it is to related we were working on in my lab social behaviors positive prosocial behaviors that stimulated me to start thinking about what ere components of a positive prosocial nonaggressive interaction a a a common key component of that is having some empathy and compassion for the individuals you are hanging out with and it is a topic i'v bean interested and for many many decades i was once te psychiaterest and to get on my whatever the word is hobby horse i look at the world to day i try to be optimistic i again i am a child of the sixties and seventies when i look at the world and i actually just did a trip to israel to give a series of lectures and i look at these railly palistinian conflict what always enters my mindis i've felt this way for decades as what is more important for the survival of the human species than empathy an compassion than actually being able to look at another human being even if they look different than you even if they have different belief system in you what is more important than actually understanding that ninety eight percent of your life is very is is is very similar if you have some differences and how you look in the beliefs you have but there is much in common what is more important than understanding that when another person is suffering their suffering is the same as your suffering we i'm and having compassion for somebody i av started thinking what is more important and i'm not apoligician as andrew i have no social metia presencs i figured the only way i might be able to contribute to efforts that might help you the human species inhands empathy and compassion is by studying the neurobiological under pennings of it and i did not realize i might be able to do that until i started studying sociability or prosocial behaviors in mice and then i was i'm able to h have a young woman scientists and i want to give her credit monique smith i'm you might wot have monique on your padcas she says she is a dynamo she is now an assystent professor at you ce aste i weare you weret eserus and monique introduce me to a series of behaviorl asses that i to use the i to use the praise they are measurements te a behavioral antecedents of empathy because in the world of psychologists and people who use the term empathy it has a lot of different meanings to different people i'm using it basically to men one member of a species manifest some behavior that indicates it is being influenced by the emotional sta a or what we call the effective state effective with an ay of another member of that species in its immediate environment im in i i for human intractions i just think of any we were talking about friendships any of us who had watch a close friend suffer it is hard you want to do anything you can to help the mat's empathy a mother with tyour child a good mother hopefully when you have a kid who is sick there is nothing worse as a parent you just want to take that pain and suffering away that is how i'm defining empathy it is my belief that any complex human behavior there are are evolutionary reasons why that has been adaptive and important an maintain and if it is evolutionarily evolved there are ways of studying it in more primitive organisms mice i'll tell you some of the behavior lassays we are doing one is and as i get a kick out of this uobviousit its pretty new for me one asand we we published a paper in a journal called science about this im which is if you take one mouse and in a ethical way you put it in pain you make its hind paw one of its paws one of its feet hurt a modest amount and you take another mouse and you let that what is known as the bystander mouse just hang out with the mouse that is in pain for one hour just one hour the by standyour mouse who has experience no physical injury whatsoever will manifest behaviors indicating it is now in pain and at last may befor a twenty hours but think about that a mouse just hank a mouse that is normal hanging out with another mouse in pain starts feeling and matpain itself en k and the mice are able to see one another and here one another good points an youre getting to how is that communication happening and a lot more work needs to be done on it im monique and her previous colleagues and others one component of it is probably an al factory cu or what we call a farimon there is assenc in panis secreting a and probably probably because you can take bedding from mice in pain and expose the bystandrmice that is one thing and i ha never heard of these behaviour lassays we developed our and this is pretty colan that i'll tell you two others and that i'll tell you how it connects to reward circuitury i'm we developed a novel assay which is the social transfer of pain relief pain relief is called anal jesia and i thought this was pretty cool you take and this is in this paper that was published in science a year ago you take too mice and they are both in pain modest pan i do not want your listeners to get upset we are not hurting these mice too badly i'm and it is a trickey issue is aid is it okay to put a mouse inpaince you can the goal is to develop better treatments for human beings in pain obviously i'm you have to mice and modest pain you give one mice mouse morphine it is now anal jesic it is no longer experience in pain you take another mouse that is in pain and you just let it hang out with the mouse that is no longer in pain and the mouse that is in pain will show behaviors indicating it it is experiencing anal jesia it is no longer inasmuch pain now think about that and there is actually evidence from human studies that i cant speake too in any comprehensive way were i mit is called social buffering of pain if you are me to be on this i've been having somenect pain just because of an old guy nd i woke up on the wrong side of the bed and if i'm by myself i focass on that pain and it bothers me more if imin the social socially engaged i i think it is not only that im not paying as much attention of the pain but i think there is actually some relief from what is known as the social buffering of pain ll i'm no hippy but i actually think that all species including humans are secreting molecules mainly te odorance that are perhaps even acting directly is as anal chesacs and i can make that statement with without worring too much that people think i'm completely crazy because we had a nome sobal on the podcast from the wiseman who shared with us not one not to but at least a dozen ways in which humans are making molecules typically odors an communicating those to one another to powerfully in fact the're thestasteron levels the're tes opressin levels the're mu hem all at goes dow and and of course i none worse on all factions he is going to be bassed ward that is us to that is just one slice of the censoryarray than what about the the the way that somebody can look at us in a way that makes us feel good on a normal day whele one were in pain just even the touch to a shoulder can mean alive i'm nover going to meetings when i was a a early narrow scientists and i'd i would probably that point of of not been thetype tos walk up and say helo toy because i was not in your field than you'r the sluminary an stuff by at i remember as i stargy gand gy byi you are m i always say hi every i i know you arethat statement was a reflection on i not reflection on you but as i advanced through my career what i found was you would give a talk or something in some one in your field more senor to you who you respected i would give a n od or something those nods not alie after the leter ods could carry you along distance and the ovice we want to be intrinsically driven to do the work we do abwrei social communicat on social speece i think there is a whole landscape of thing what you are describing an is incredible but i think makes a ton of sense yet we have the social transfer pain of anal gesiar where working on and there is a little bit of evidence in the literature suggesting this might work and that al talk about reward sircatry and may be emdiaman is not an impatagen or not and how that might influence therputic efforts for otism were working on behavior o models where we are asking the question will one mouse behave to give another mouse a reward it is the mouse that is behaving that has to press a bar or nose poke or even experience a shock will the mouse do that simply to get give one of its buddis a reward pure alta prand ye it is pure iit is it is what we call it generosity a generosity assay and early days at looks it might be working yeti do not am and that is a generosity assay we can also ask the question willa mouse work another mouse does not get a shock does not get hurt which is compassion and i think these things are going to be working and whether you want to call that empathy i would call that those who behaviors i to use it frm behavioural antecedente of how we define empathy in human beings nd the connection to reward sircatry and in the little bit of work we have done on this is we presents an evidence that these behaviors we call the social transfer of pain one mouse experiencind pain just because it is hanging out with another mouse the social transfer of anal gesia a mouse in pain getting some pain relief from hanging out with another mouse in pain who has that pain relief it seems to involve one component of the complex brain mechanisms seems to involve a part of the brain called the intur singular quartex which human brain imaging studies suggest ar is actidateit during empathic human responses and the projections of that area into the nuclious accumbence that is the connection i'm and where interested in weather neramotulats jopeme in ceratonen may influence these circuitry these connections that are involved in these in quotes empathic behaviors im et cetera et cetera and we think drugs can be used as probes of those kinds of neromotulatory mechanisms i hope this is all making sernative excellent saton is fascinating a i'm not one to suggest experiments to a e collegues and areas where i do not work but i i'm going to anyway pleom one you are really smark i your suggestions youni love the demotivational backbone to what you are describing here because i agree the world has a lot of issues and what it could be more important than to increasthe amount of empathy and compassion in the world m but one thing that we know inhibits empathy and compassion is one's own challenges and struggles and i'm wondering if there is a way to introduce something to this behavioral paradon such that the working to provide another animal relief from pain one animal workingto provide relief of another animal in pain or a animal working to provide pleasure reward for another animal if it could be skilled with how inconvenient that work yes at i laiv i am very hungry i ma wer all tought to put our own obigon mask on first a wa too that we do not all die to speak but i grew up for instance with a one parent my mother it was the kind of person who would see at that time there were far fewer homeless people on the street maybe they were all institutionalized i do not know i'm but if she saw a homeless person on the street of the town we li dn't she would literally pull over give them money mine hotel she had homeless people living in hotels all over the town and liverer it was crazy and we could not get anywhere that was the promise we did never arrive anywhere on time and that is my case for always being lad o thinlye inforce er benlat u i alwa aray and i ways run incredible right just a very strong sense of a social fantastinaction that kind of thing but in any case some people are that she could not experience any a even modicum of inconvenience for helping others you were as i think most of us feel if i'm rushing to catch a flyg and i see some one whos struggling i'm probaing in to help them if they are in acute pain or it tuns a dire circumstance but let us be honest y most people ir probably gin a priora tize their own stress and and priorities for lack of better word when the situation often calls for us to set those aside and and tend to people that her suffering if there was a way to introduce the on the intera a probe of the interplay of circuitries that iinvolve how convenient or inconvenient it is it were well fed it is pretty easy to go out and gather in distribute fit for others but if we are hungry we tend to focuss on her own hunger iweak first i'm in full disclosure even though on studying and pathy in compassion i can look in the mirror and say i probably do not practice it merly as much as i should i'm thinking of your example if i was laid for a plain i'm not sure i would stop and help somebody and i'm not say depends on on what sort of suffrd exactly a ti amerging on the si o reorse we all would of course i amtire right you might think o goodness a d i have time for el ye exari and s i'm not proud of that statement but back to your question yes i think absolutely we can design experiment swear afterwards establish the basic phenomenology than we can take our subject animal or mouse and put it into ture certain circumstances if it is hungry itself will it work is harch to give another animal iming it is a good question is i'm not sure what the outcome will be and one could predict thit might work harde because it understands the hunger in quotes more lowr wherer could be of course it is not going to work hard for another animal aget o food reward because it is starving itself and it needs i take care of itself first it is a great question were also asking questions about you have to know your budy mouse right do you is it are you more likely to behave in a generous or compassionate way if you grew up with that mouse in the way our mice grow up in academic environments and if it is a stranger how will you behave how will you behave if yu had a fight with that mouse previously and what if you had and and it also matters did you win the fighter did you lose the fight right youre prot youno intuitively as we probably wout all gess i'm more likely to help somebody i defeated in the fight previously because ofm the cerpuno i'm the hierarchy onm the dominant one i'm probably less likely if that person beat me up all these are great questions i think we can study them i'm i also think there are ways we can study these kinds of interactions in human subjects i'm out not that i am going to do that myself oone it stampreel yetyeso i think there is also an opportunity and i'm happy to discuss how normodulators in particular saratona but also perhaps dopening an oxytos and may in fluence the brak the circuitry in the brain mechanisms that are mediating what i turmempathic behaviors let us return to autism ri does autism involve a lack of empathy does autism involve a restructuring of the reward system around social interactions maybe considering the second question first i could imagine for instance that there are variations in brain wiring that would make it such that a kid who then becomes an adult gets a tremendous amount of reward from i do not know math of designing mugs any number of activities but that through some variation in brain wiring social interactions spending time with friends is just not as socially rewarded it just does not feel good in the in the moment does not necessarily feel bad but it is not selected for and is there any evidence that that is the case in children who are classified as autistic or having autism i i am i want to declare i am not a world expert on pathethysiology of individuals with aughtis inspectrum disorder i have read some of the literature i do study mouse models of genetically base ought tosimspect rum disorder the answer is yes there there have been imaging studies and again jso your audience to certain members are onits do not get mad were remember our earlier conversation we we we made the point that ught to inspect him disorders a highly heterogenious set of behavioral symptoms with wide variation in how these symptoms manifest in each individual we cannot make blanket statements that individuals with autismspectr spectrum disorder are this or that but there are studies both in human beings and mice that suggests that the reenforcing component of a social interaction is much less or lacking in are models of autismspectrsm spectrum disorder and certain individuals and important point is is that just genetically wired was that because in their early experienceis they are not able to get the century stimuli that is tell them tisis ar reenforcing social experience unknown am at least those are topics that i think are worthy of investigation do individuals or mice with autismspectrum disorder lack or do not have the capacity or the same experience of empathy again a very complex topic in question and its very likely for some individuals answers yes meaning they they they do lack some of the narrow mechanisms that allow them but that probably does not apply to everybody i what i can say in or mouse models of social intractions and are mouse models of inquotes empathy in these m are mi amice show defisits and those defisits can be rescued meaning improved upon by manipulations of certain armotulatory systems in this case the seratone and system by giving drugs including a drug called emdia mayor ecstasy i hope of answering your question i i think these are worth w i subjects for investigation i think there is a lot of value in studying them let us go back to siratonan in the necles aconvents am we will get into this in a bit more detail hen we discussed emdiame but i' now spent a lot of time with a recent paper of yours tha really relars one amm tema a that partisoris hititsyea the door that that roharst the relative rolls of dopomine in the newclesigaens verses sartona newcleacomens by the way am okhsa by time this episode comes out in episode all about emdiama itself and its a modes of action will have already erred and you can find that but even if you have not heard that am you emdy amazin amazing molecule because it profoundly increases am dopomine a and that is why the word met them pedamine is ashally in the emd ama a still a surprised to many people to hear that but it also robusly increases a sir tone an transmission and what i love about the paper from your lab that explored this is that it at least by my read of the data it showed very convincingly that it is seratonan released in the newcles acomments that is responsible for the prosocial effects of emdi ma whereas oxy tosen the singwe talked about earlier that everyone assumes is the peraboning molecule the molegole of love both in humancs now if there is a studying humans and in the mouse work that you have done does not seem to play as prominent a roll in the social a enhancement that emy ama causes and the reason i'm asking this in the context of utism is that for a long time there was excitement about the idea that oxytosan nasal sprays might make otisticates more excited about social interactions a more tuned to social interactions first question is is there any evidence that increasing oxy tosan in a child or adult with autism makes them somehow more social or desiring more social connections i'm not aware of any i do not think the i think it is a it is a worth while it has been studied i i do not think we can close the door on the potential therapeutic uses of oxy tosin from thte people i know who are much more expert in this than i am i think most of the clinical trials have been pretty disappointing with a in a lot of hope that intrenasal oxy tosen would promote more positive prosocial experiences i do not think the door is shut yet there may be different ways of administerining it administering it there may be ways of making a different type of oxy tosen that might be beneficial i have a colleague at stanford whose actually looking at ae related narropeptide called vesoppressin and sheese finding some potential benefit from that and vesa pressing an oxytosener closely related to each other they can even activate some of the same what we call receptors in the brain i do not think the door is closed on the possibility of oxy tosin or relatit thyraputic agents having some therapeutic potential the evidence as far as i am aware is not there yet in terms of m gy ama u again complicated story as you pointit out m g ama it is it is major molecular targits dont get to technical here are the seratonan vacum cleaner that the molecule that is vacums up seratonen and the dopamine vacum cleaner the molecule that rei'm vacums up and excuse my language sucks up dopamine when its released and because it is an amphetemine derivitive am as you point correctly point it out it not only prevents these protines we call them these molecuse these vacum cleaners from vacuming up the dopaming in ceratonand when it is release it actually causes it how to i do not want to use the term th the terminals to vomit torpeminin cerato that is what i say on the r tha i o i es a acriles i'm known for when i mysel upsets for when i ti whatsnapticallys ala i say that they omadol o o what emtedeming derivite yo ot an afti yu en wen omitan insect o o on oti gon mpt n a does is that it actually calls what is known is a reverse transport it actually causes it not only prevents the vacum cleaners from sucking up the dopominin ceratonen it causes it to spew out jopominin cerator imagine if your vacum cleaner start it the the pressure n your acum clean a reverse and all the dirt you collect ed start at being spewed out now the one difference for emdima andm it is te fascinaing ind topic i hope we have time to talk about is why does emdma gqualitatively for most people giv give human subjects a different experience then cocane or metham are especially methamphetam presumably its the fact that there'e much ceratone exactly and if you actually gen in and this is why for your audience is this is why hard core molecular science can actually teach us something about complex human behavioral phenomena such as social interactions and addiction at least the hypothesis we propose and others in the field it is not just science is not done in isolation i want to give credit where creditis do we did not define the following that emdyma taffects the seratone an syste em more than the dopeming system it is not equit is not fifty fifty maybe it seventy thirty eighty twenty and that is because the molecule itself of emdiama again i'm trying not to use language has a it binds to it has a higher afthinity it likes to bind to an influence the seratonean bac cleaner more than the dopeming vacum cleaner it still affecting both but it is not fifty fifty it is more whatever seventy sara seventy per cent seratone thirty per cent dopeming im and then it does influence oxy tosen in very complex ways im which is o further technical discussion m it was just a nice paper that came out that report it that saratoneand release in a hypothylamic structure which again the hypotholymis you can explain to your enless n eh a verablalish ithe for your mouth responsible for a sex temperature control a feeding and sotiety in a munch of other things critical am and a yand it is a home of oxy nurons that produce oxy tank you this paper report it that when sratonan is release in the hypotholymis it activates and causes the release of oxy tosen that is in the hypotholymis our work in the reward circatry suggestiv oxy tosen that is saratone and upstream of oxy tosin e hypotholymis in the where we were looking in the ccumbens it was the opposite oxy tosen cause the release of seratonem the point to your listeners is the brains unfortunately complicate it yeweactwe the tract but we to come up with general hypotheses an principles but sometimes the devils in the details wen we really need to probe deeper back to your question about our previous paper and jopomine and seratone and wet we are what we propose which is far from nail down is that m d m a because it is an mphetamine derivative does influence dopamen release an dopamin the dopamine system and some of my colleagues in the m d m a field who i respect enormously do not me to say this but i m a say at anyhow remember earlier in the podcast we talked about different substances having a dictive liabilities does it mean tha substances automatically addictive does not mean it is automatically not it is a continuum and i would argue that mdma does have a some addictive liability because it is an mphetamine derivative if yulan good and it feels good and there are individuals that especially at as your listeners may know m diamas has gotten a lot of attention because it is an atheraputic trial that looks very promising for as an adjuncto psychotherapy for postdramatic stress disorder and the the f de the part of our government that approves or disapproves the legal distribution of theraputid drugs mand up eproving m dma for certain uses om the point being is that once it if it gets approved my personal feeling as it will have some addictive liability it also has this very powerful what you and i my term andrew approsocial effect a some people even call it an empathagon that is a little controversial meaning it enhances your capacity for empatheta to experience the emotional state of another individual to want to understand that persons experiences an emotional state om an are what we suggested is that the eddictive liability is mostly although not solely being mediated by its actions on the dopamine system whereas it is positive more prosocial effects and perhaps it is in pathogenic effects are more likely to be mediated by its intractions with the seratonean system and in in this reward circuitry and weare actually doing a lot of work to test that hypothesis whereactually testing emdiuma in these behavioral models of empathy in mice am and it looks our hypothesisis being supported the other thing tos to drive your your listeners crazy about sarry listeners how complex the brain is if you think it is any neither you nor i were consulted at the design phasem an hat av at opologizemen brains eosity because i do not look trust me as a scientists i wish i could keep things as simple as possible that is what good sciencis it turns out the seratone seratonan is produced by nurans in another part of the brain with this wonderful name called the dorsoraphe nucleus and it turns ot the seratonan nurns talk to the dopaminerns that is and influence the dopaminurans and am it is again the point we made earlier in your podcast even though it is fun and useful both for your listeners and as scientis to think about these powerful chemical messengers in isolation because that is how we can make progress scientifically it is how your audience can understand some of the concepts that have been elucidated from brain research over the decades but they do not work in isolation tay influence each other they communicate with each other ractually doing study showing that seraton in release in thei commens actually modul ates dopo mean relyse o gets crazy complicate it but you can still develop simplistic hypothesies as i was saying about m dma were abuse addictive liability and some of its reenforcing qualities which you just mention emt ma a lot of people find it fun to take it is probably mostly ve m in medativ o the dopamine system and some of its social effects of enour being meeted by the ceretonen sistem were actually doing studies to figure out whether the reenforcing component of a social experience requires that dopemin release probably does that is whwhat i'm mos imested in really in the contects of m d ma we should just mention cause we we do a to mention these coviats a yestiks and i can say this cause i participated in a trial with m d m it it is a very pleasant experience it is certainly not for everybody it still is a schadual one drug at this moment absole don you can go to jail for possessing and a we are selling in fact it was a big bus recently in canada and another one in brussels a large aamounts of em d may collected those people are polian going tprisen for a long period of times ar you you do you do not want to take it or possess it it is illegal am which ring my clinical trials here but also the pentinel issue there is a lot of at and i was just in aatention to your peleaving remess if we did not i shal lot of people are dying thinking that they are taking one drug when they are taking another ata we are not encouraging the use of these but i will say that the unsubjective experience of m d ma provided it is done in a the appropriate clinical setting it is actuallym d m does not contain other things am dost correctly et cetera is a pleasant one for sure and min my sense is that a the dopomine release a is reinforcing the experience that the context to ceretonan is providing the social context and and the word context there becomes important when we think about back to the ninies when they re lot of raves and people were also getting o i guess positively back from the interactions they were having dancing all night parting with friends et cetera i may i think that om returning to the issue of autism an the role of ceretonent in autism there seems to be less of a a reinforcement pathway for certain kinds of social interactions om in some individual pedotism om and i am aware that there are some prescription treatments for autism that capitalize on the ceratanurgic system and opening system om is it fentome to my knowledge the only ftie approved parmicalogic therapeutic for individuals with aucis of spectren disorder is actually o god i'm just blanking iit it is not a ceretonercic drug a i'm i y u have to look it up i i want to say resperedone for agitation i'm there is no drug for for lack of ae better terms the social defhesits there is no f tie approved drug if you look at the literature psychiatrists and individuals with gwith good intention have testit the utility of traditional ceracanertic drugs prosac esesorie there are drugs known as es an oreyes drugs that influence seratone release and another normodulator that well nor apinefran and at least well done clinical trials which in my view as an academic ar very important none of them have showed efficacy having said that there are several companies and full disclosure here i am the founder of a small biotec called maplike therapeutics and i'm not advertising from aplihe im just doing a full disclosure it was found it with carldizeor author you have had on your podcast i'm an unultrproner in samphtus go name caroly nicolach im and we have the thase to trial face to trial means it is a safe drug wive done all the safety work im and it is a drug the chargets a sub type of receptor for ceratoneand i'm saratonan works on many different i inow what word can i use other than receptor no a listeners in this barcast probably be familiar with receptiv ser parking spots for a parling tous on yes that the paper you i was referencing earlier from your lablet talked about saratonan one be receptaatin particularly important and and the point being is you now i do have an interest in this on can you use the type of discoveries who have made in mice might and actually have any relevance to human subhuman beings in particular those who some of which have some sort of sociability defesits im other companies for pursuing this to emdyamay itself there has been i do not no if it is on going there is a well known organization i if you have ever had anybody from maps ontess the murty disciplinary association for psychodelic studies a maps deserves a lot of credit for being a pioneer in saying in particular with em dymay promoting the idea that ou know this drug deserves rigorous an ethical study im that that is at least my view im in maps which was founded by a individual named ricdoblin has deserves enormous credit for their thirty year effort to make it aloud and legal to actually study m dema the point o making is i know maps and perhaps others have done some smalle trials studying m diamae in individuals high functioning individuals with some form of social anxiety am am saying tis becaushissis public there is another company called mine med which is one of the publicly traded psychodelic companies and this is on their website full disclosure i am on their scientific advisery board m they are gearing up to do a trial of a i do not want to get two technical of a certain form of m diame there are two different types of m diam that they have these horrible names called nantiumerse am the m dama that is used for clinical trials that maps mdama is a molecule and has mirror images of itself and one one has the name r m dima and one has the name s m diame and there there called thi har inantimers because theare mirror images of each other and other labs over the year is not my lab i deserve no credit for this have done some studies to suggest that the s inantiumer is the one that has a higher interaction with the dopamine system and the r inantiumer has a higher interaction with the seretonan systemes a if if you look at the the literature on atism spectrum disorder in human subjects there is a bunch of paper suggesting sertnergic systems are ma functioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and if you look at reviews af written or any of my papers we publish psyte some of their reviews it is clear that seratonan is playing some role in social interactions at least in mice and almost certainly in humans as well it is hard to imagine based on data from everything from essessorized o naratoxic leisions of the human gran et cetera that it is not also playing at least a similar rolland i fully agree with that in and as we were discussing theresthereis a modestly extensive clinical literature meaning literature from human subjects suggesting that some aspects of brain systems that utilized seratoneand as one of their signaling molecules one of their neuromodulatory mechanisms may not be functioning in some populations of individuals with ought tos inspectian disorder based on that based on my lab's work on the role of seratone and in modifying reward circuitry atro role in pro social behaviors and the biggest clue which i think you would agree with andrew is this drug m d ma having this is why i am not a druggy myself i am a child of the sixties and seventies i did which means some twenty years older than you andrew i did experiment everybody of my generation with psychoactive substances in the seventies i do not want a ly about my experiences i also would say many ner scientists my experiences with psychoactive substances stimulate my interest in neuroscience how do these substances work why when i get the when i was a young kid the first time i got drunk on beer wh is that happening but more seriously i use drugs in my research as powerful probes of brain function with the advanc sage that now talking sciencis to sciencists with you andrew they have molecular targets that we can manipulate in rigorous ways we can figure out were in the brain they act using the modern tools of nero science wich your audience may not know about i'm saying this to you conditional knock out my rescue experiments we can do all those fancy stuff and we can use drugs to study even things has complicateid as empathy and i really do believe that it is why have been interested in empty may for decades is there is a clue there how does it drug that has molecular targets in the dopamy nermodula choice system in the ceratonan ormodula choice system have such a powerful effect which is relatively specific on social intractions it does not make you want to go eat more doghnuts it does not om i do not know from me there is a cle there there is something really important from that phenomenological observation in the human experiences that we can learn from i completely agree about emdy ma and o we have done a couple potcas about syliciband and by extension elisty because even though there are differenceis there sulcivon elisty as far as we understand largely work through on actavation in the ceratonan to a receptor broadening if a bran network conictivity again that ceratonents or atoneents are atonan but different receptors very different subjective experience on and i guess the perhaps the best way to describe it is that elesty and sylicivon are almost always considered mystical in the in there subjective oeffacts whereas on emdi am ma can be in impathagean an actageand on and seri tonan in acting to through different receptor systems in pacting and creating very different subjective experiences i also agree i thing empty a mas particularly interesting for the nauro scientists o perhaps also because at least to my knowledge there is no substance in nature no plant no mushroom no urgot no o any no mold om that creates this increase in dopomin an ceratoneand simultaneously emdiamaza symthasized molecule and it may be one of the again high lightingall the safety issues and tings we talked about before it may be one of the great at least experimental probes of the brain that humans have developed and it may be one of the great therapeutic probes om that folks maps have are now doing such fantastic work on im i'm very excited about what is happening with the research onemdiamaand i'm glad that your laboratory is parte the some of the relative rolls of ceratona in the receptors involved o it since we mention ceratonan to a for siliciban and eleste we would be remiss if we did not say that that this wonderful paper tht we will providling to in the shono captions by the way folks om that a romalenka heres laborates focased on the ceratonan one be recepter even just differences in receptor subtypes leading to profoundly different subjective outcomes i find that to be a just one of the most important areas that one could even think about little on work on i thank you i appreciate the compliment i will also say unlike everything where it werefinding it is not all about only ceratonan one be but that is as there are again pointing to though the amazing and powerful complexity of the human brain or the memelian brain there are sixteen different ceratonan parking spots ere recepters that a distributed in different brain areas in complex ways and that is d uncting but also offers possibilities for developing very novel therapeutic agents that that activator inhibit these in complex ways it hopefully forh therapeutic benefit before we conclude i am very curious to get your opinion on what you see as the landscape of the work on psychodelics and emdiama which is not really a classic psychodelic but all these drugs that as you pointed out during your youth were you etrecreationally and for mind exploration and expansion are now being probed as potential therapeutics for various a mental health challenges as well as potentially expanding consciousness empathy in all all of that i mean not getting into the details of yof the the legal issues thit have to be overcome not even us early talkin about the clymical trials of the people doing the work in different laboratories which jis have to imagine this is muss amuse tickle surprise you i n how do you feel about what youre seeing now because it is a very exciting time for these compounds im it tickles me and excites me with the appropriate caution im i do think drugs are very powerful probes of brain function i think this class of drug which as you correctly pointed out people use the term psychodelics pscientifically when pursuing their reim understanding their thyrapeutic potential their mechanism of action it is more useful to divide them up into different categories the classicallucinagens which aroelisty and solicibe and the intactor an pathagens which is emdiama which is really a qualitatively different drug there are other substances which we wee not time to talk about ibogan and iowaska which are very complex an peote but nevertheless i amt ckled and excited as the child of the sixties and seventies i'm but i am also not evangelical about their uuse and their thyraputic potential as you can imagine what i am going to say i think they should be the subject of rigorous sophisticated and most importantly ethical research im i i think we could learn a lot about how the brain works and its amazing capabilities i think we could i think they may notice i say may have theraputic potential but i do not think they are going to be miracle cures and i do worry as somebody who live through the sixties and seventies and watched because of the leary im the history with temetheleri and his colleagues and the political landscape of how they were being used and promote it i am cautious that these substances need to be studied scientifically and rigorously im and i hope that is the case and i want a caution your audience that not everybody should take these substances they are not miracle cures and while they certainly may be of benefit to certain individuals who are suffering and they certainly may provide unusual and in quotes mystical experiences for certain individuals i am very concern that there are individuals out there that will gain access to these substances and have very bad experiences because anybody who grup in the sixties and seventies knows all about bad trips and truth be told i have had a bad trip or two in the seventies and i'm gla ad i did because it made me i have no idea what a suicidal depression feels where you are experiencing such a darkness such a lack of hope that a rational decision is to end one's life but and i think the closest i ever came to that experiences a bad trip on elisd and i are not do have concerns that if you look at the clinical trials that have been done the welcould done not the anecdotal i went and saw some psychodelic therapists that a friend recommendit and it did wonders forme but the well controlled clinical trials that are being done by certain byotex some academic institutions they have very strict what are known as inclusionary and exclusionary crycheriar about who is allowed to participate in the subject and may rule out a lot of people i do not mean to be overly cautious but i do worry that if some people take these substances and bad things happen it will slow down the excitement that is currently happening and it will make it more difficult for serious human subjects researchers preclinical researchers to study these substances in the way they deserve to be studied i hope that articulates i think it it it does and thank you for that viewpoint it is an important counterbalance on a lot of the excitement that we hereabout you say as i think the state of kentucky just recently decide to give forty two million dollars from the opioid a lawsuit settlement with a pretty farmer suitacles to the study of i began there is a lot happening you and i i mal just lity clear i think there is no problem with that and i actually would support that as long as the studies of iveagain are done thoughtfully recarefully and ethically ii see no problem with testing it is efficacy uncertain i'm mentalilness's and addiction and it is act it is actually a topic i know a little bit about but we will save that for another time well first off i want to thank you for coming here and sharing your knowledge with all of us for me it is been a real thrill and i also just want to thank you for the incredible amount of work that you have done over the years i know it is still on going you are by no means a retiring athur nos yeii certainly hope not but i'm i'm sure the listeners have i'm now an a clear picture of the enormous number of contributions and erras you have worked everywhere from as i mention earlier nor plasto see at the cellar level molecular level addiction i'm work relating to social cognition and social interactions rather i'm as it pertains to ought is mmodels and now psychodelics and empathy and on and on and again trained many prominent scientists in our field and to take time out of your schadual to come see here with us and share some of that knowledge and stimulate our thinking and as you mention rais it still more questions thneed to be resolve i is a real privilege thank you ever much and indeed as you just mention we would love to have you back again for i nooll i cun say is i want to thank you for having me i was a little has not enter nervous about coming here and now i want to come back you youthat was the blast what i just did with you and i'd be happy to continue this conversation any time i thank you for your very sophisticate at and

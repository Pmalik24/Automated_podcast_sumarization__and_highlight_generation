welcome to the ubermsciencescience baceoi mand dr hubermen and on a professor of nerbiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor cyl gelette doctor gelette is duelboard certified in family medicine and obcity medicine and practices out of a clinic inkansas and viatelle medicine he provides full spectrum medicine including hormon health proventive medicine obstetrics which is the branch of medicine and surgery concerned with child birth and the care of women giving birth and pediatrics i first learned about doctor gelette from apodcast of all things and was immediately struck by the breadthand depth of his knowledge on all things hormons and hormon optimization as you will see very soon to day doctor gelette can teach you how to optimize your hormones using behavioral tools nutrician exercise base tools supplementation and hormon therapies if those are appropriate for you there are many professionals out there including many medical doctors of course talking about hormon health what really sets doctor gelette apart from the pack is his ability to understand how the different factors that i describe before nutritian supplementation exercise in hormon therapies how those interact with one another and the safest and most rational ways to approach hormon optimization during today's episode you will learn how to optimize your hormones notus testostrone and estrogen but also prolactin and other hormon pathways that impact your mood mental health and physical health doctor gelette is also an avid educator about hormons and other aspects of health he does this on zero cost to consumer platforms such as instegram and other social media on instrogram he is cio gelette m d that is k wi l e g i l l e t t no e at the end m d calgelette m d on instregram and he is gelette health on all other platforms including lincton twitter ou to ticktoct and face book if you go to his instergram or his other social media you will learn a lot about hormon health about the latest science impacting ob city and metabolic health he is a wealth of knowledge and again he is providing all that information at zero cost to you the consumer what you are soon to hear is a conversation between me and doctor gelette about all things hormons and hormon health and hormonoptimization we dive dp into mechanisms but we are clear to establish what eh word or set of concepts mean if you have no background in biology or even if you do i 'm sure that you will come away with a wealth of valuable knowledge we also talk about specific protocals related again to leista factors nutrition supplementation and wear appropriate hormon replacement therapy i know there is a lot of interest about these topics doctor gelette is very thorough about addressing both male and female issues and addressing hormon health for people at all stages of life i'm sure that you will come away from this episode with the same impression that i did which is that doctor gelette is a n extraordinarily clear communicator and that he has tremendous compassion for his patients and that he has a deep love of understanding biology and medicine in ways that can benefit you before weu begin with to day's episode i want to emphasize that this podcast is separate fror my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costoc consumer information about science and signcs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens t letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens on th reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer they'l give you fiv free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of datand ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green sdock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before in this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatios of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement doc com slash hubermen nd you will get a free element sample pack wih your purchase the're all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element doc com slash hubermen to day's epi it is also brought to us by inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzed that data from your blood and diana to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work don for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test there are a lot of blood and dean atest out there but a major issue with many of them is that you get numbers back about lobles of hormones metabolic factors lipids et cetera but you doft know what to do with that information inside tracker has solved that problem by creating a personalized dashboard you take your blood and or your dean atest you get the results back and were certain values might be too high or too low for your preference you can click on that and it will direct you immediately to lifestale factors nutrition supplementation et cetera that can help you bring those numbers back into the ranges that are ideal for you it not only gives you information about where your health stands it gives you directives as to how to improve your health if

now for my discussion about hormone health and optimization with doctor cild gelette doctor gelette welcome thank you for having well i'm superexcide to talk to you because i found out about you on a podcast and it immediately became clear that you are an encyclopedi of knowledge about hormone health for men and for women across the life spand i have many many questions but before we dive into those questions i'd love to just get a little bit of your background in terms of your medical training and what your particular orientation is toward treating your patience and how do you think about this the whole landscape that we call hormone health what is a hormone a how do you invision a people managing their hormones you gou just can a filling a few of those blanks for us i think a lot of people would appreciate it absolutely i'm duel board certified and family medicine and obesity medicine i've kind of tailored my training an order to provide what i call a balance to proach to total health which includes body mind and soul ive recently saw a podcast with joe rogan and mister beasts and joe asks a mister beast how do you become such an amazing you tuber and have all these ano great clicbat vidios and how did you become good at it and it turns out hou just became obsest when he was a teanager and that is essentially how i've tailored my education as well i become obsessed with optimal human performance their body their mind and even their spirit i tended medschool at the university of kansas which is i'm one of the few medschools that still emphasizes full spectrom c ere they emphasise exerciseas medicine the emphasize food is medicine of which always active in both of those interest grups and residency i was active in a lot of a mindfulness curriculum and then also things walk with the dalk where you emphasize preventitive medicine that something that we have kind of got away from and that in each led me to hormon health i did not rally start as hormon health but it is a very important component of health in general that many people do not emphasize great well this idea of preventede medicine i think is starting to really take hold an the general population especially givin the events of the last few years people realize that they are showing up to health challenges at a bunch of different levels and with some people feeling very robust other people feeling back on their heels when some one comes to you as a patient what are some of the first things that you want to know about them i' man obviously you on't now their blood pressure you want to know im something about their mental health and family history but in terms of hormon health what are the sorts of probe questions that you ask him and what a you looking for and i ask this because i'd people to be able to ask some of these very same questions for themselves e when you do a physical exam and a history you have a lot of different parts you have your history of present illness if they have a complaint may be the patient does not have a complaint in that case things their social history in their family history are extremely important because that gives you an inciht in teinto their genetics and insight into their ormon health patients will tell me i'm doing o k but it helps to ask them well how are you now what say the patient is fifty how are you now verses when you were twenty and what has changed i've got the question a lot how do you get your doctor to order a better labwork up or to even include your basic hormons and there is no magic answer to that but what really healps as you tell them my energy is not as good as it used to be my focus is not as good as it used to be my athletic performance is not as good as it used to be you do not have to have a pathology in order for a lab to be indicated you just need to have that pertinent symptom this can be really healthful because for many people the the idea of getting a blood has to look at their home hormons just seems such an enormous hurdle to get over many doctors will not prescribe them im and would you say that it is using the approach you just described that it is equally effective for men and women or do you find that i'm for one reason or another that men and women have different challenges in an advantages in trying to access their deeper hormon data yet slightly different im with women there is a lot mor objective data if theire having minstral irregularities or if theire going in if the're not having a period if theire having too heavy of periods than those are things that they talk about very frequently frequently with their doctor men are more hesitant men really one to now wit their testostrone is but they at the same time they really do not wan to tell their doctor how their libido is or how their energy is because it it is almost ga they feel less masculine or they feel less a guy when they say that even if they are just talking to teir doctor about it i think that that rais a really important point which is that the whole discussion around hormon health is a bit of a barbed wire topic because in many ways when we hear the word hormone we think testosteron and estrogen we think notions of masculinity in femininity and of course testosterone and estrogen our present in all sexes right all cromis almo backgrounds a and just ta varying degrees and ratioes but it also raises all tese issues about sexual health that it is kind of interesting cause i surrounded by medical doctors in my lab at stamford and the more physicians that i surround myself with the more open is the discussion around sexual health and reproductive health but in the general population i think some of these topics are a little bit taboo or against kind of barbed wire and i think that people are seeking a lot of this information on you two band through communities that may or may not be very educated about the actual biology along those lines you no we could probably assume that hormones are changing across the life span right a certainly from from childhood a in pubertyin onward if if you would i'd leve to just go to take a snapshot of what you think everybody should be thinking about or doing to optimize their hormon health male or female in the let us ay in their twenties and then maybe we could migrate that to their thirties and forties but before that could you just tell us what every one should be doing for their hormon health from puberty onward em the low of diminishing returns applie doing a little amount of what i call life style inter ventions over a long period of time is going to be far more helpful or efficacious than doing a lot and than doing nothing or doing a lot than doing nothing i talk about the big six pillars the two strongest ones are likely diet and exercise for hormone health specifically resistance training is particularly healpful for diet coloric restriction can be particularly healpful especially with the epidemic of metabolexand drome that is continuing to ongo in this country and in developed countries in general those are the two most powerful number one an number two are diet and exercise for the last for i have a little bit of a literation theire's stress and stress optimization that has to do with cortois all that has to do with your mental health that has to do with sucital health and collect of health of your family as wealt when you are a member of a family or even a very close friend trying to a chieve optical health togetheris very important it is the same thing with nicatins ation same thing with hormon optimisation if you do it as a household unit it is far more healpful after stress you have sleep oftimisation sleep is extremely important a especially for monicondral health as well and then you have sunlight which encompasses anything that is outdoors you move more you have cold exposure you if he would exposure that sunlight and enlast one 's spirit that is kind of the body mind and soul if you have all the other five in howther dial then completely but you do not have your spiritual health whatever you believe and that is going too profoundly impact your body and your mind is well and we are defiling in touching to this notion of spiritual health because i think for some people that might a dra conotations of of certain things that may or may not be accurate but i know a number of academic laboratories that are focust on this an a number of of not just a functional messin clinecs but au research clenex and hospitals throughout the country that are achieving some really interesting data notcust in in people that are quite sick but in healthy people arer trying to further o tor myself we will definally touch back to that it if you a be kind as at maybe give us a lobit more detail about some of these other airs when people here diet i immediately think o ga now we get into the a the combat around vegan plant bases carnivore at cetera but i think that mih general view of this is that most people should probably be eating as few highly process foods highly politable foods as possible which does not mean eating foods that do not taste good of course but what other sorts of things doyou recommend in the realm of diet and then i also want to know about coloric restriction because my understanding is that a cloric curplas cannactualy support certain hormones test osterone how does one combine cloric restriction and still optimize a hormonths but wha would you say is it a really terrific way to think about and approach diet diet should be an individualized approach if you have a a car each cars made different and requires a different sort of fuel whether it is a race car whether it is a decil truck they have different fuels for different performance outcomes if you'r trying to tost something or you have trying to go fast it is the same way with athletes it is a pretty well studied the more intra work out carbs ultra long distance athletes take and generally do better i think they have studied this en cyclists quite often it also depends on yourgenetics you can have a genetic polymorphism and you metabolize carbs and sugar butter even when they are unopposed by fibr how does one tat determine weather not they have such a pollymorphism man i've i'manominivor i i do eat some high quality meats not in huge quantities but i alsoy vegetables and starch as i feel fine i've never done in elimination diet may i think i did a very low carbdie at once and all it gave me was a lot of soriasis and poor sleeps i backed off i probably did not do it correctly a but i know a lot of people hat do quite well on on a very low carbor's eurocorpdiet ye particularly those who are at risk of cancer because you have less a glue cost that can be easily uptaken into cells and then also people with autom un diseases a they tend to do well on our on lower carbdie ats ye but ye as far as the how do basically you can use your bilepheed back how your feeling to guess what you tolerary well or you can just get genetic testing which can be fairly expensive but most of all it requires ey physician or some one who knows how to interpret the test accurately and if someone had the means or th a would you say that getting regular blood testing is a good idea a d if what is regular blood testing is it every three months is every six months of course the back drop of of life is changing to stress levels et cetera ye every three to six months for preventative purposes at times you need blood tests et a faster frequencies than that and then you should also get a blood test when you are fasting and when you are not fasting if you are looking for damage to the beach you want you do not just look at low tide you look at high tie and you see what is happenyin at high tide is well it is a great way to put it and interms of a general recommendations around exercise ivin i'm of the mind based on the data that i've seen that almost everybody should were everybody should be getting hundre and fifty to a hundred eighty minutes minimum of his own to cardio per week that and of could continue a while having a conversation but with if one were to exert any more effort it would have a hard time getting the words out at least that righte for cardy of ascular health in general brain health and musco scellital health plus resistance exercise is that more o less the contour of what you recommend yet tit is more or less the conteur the more you are doing yours own too cardy of ascular exercise the slightly less important a long duration of cloric restriction is interesting and that brings us to cloric restriction it is very clear that cloric restriction can allow one to lose weight rit this is a the classic keico se i see o callories in callories out we are not disputing callories in callories out somehow that always has to be stated fifty times o in any forum because of whatever follows people i think a will anchor to and assume that we do not mean thot but i know you and i both agree on callories in callories out as a fundamental law of therm of dynamics but it is clear to me that base on what i've read that when one is in a slight cloric surplus that hormone's testosteron can be optimize but is that true for somebody who is showing up with excessive body fat how does this all work because body fat is manufacturing insimes that convert to stosteron to estergon another words how does some one know if they should use cloric restriction or avoid cloric restriction ye here is had a parse that out before i dell than ta the details a bit more i should s hey has abord certified o besity medicine physicion obviously the laws of thermodonamic supply and then in addition to that there is nothing special about intermintent fasting or chloric restriction or exercise when it pertains to losing body weight in general when you do lose weight about thirty three percent of that islean body mass and about ten per cent of fat cells atipocells are actually body mass as well because it has protines in water and thins that in it to the reason for exercise and the reason fori chloric restriction in general including interment and fasting is health reasons that is how you increase your health span it is not necessarily going to make the weight on the scale change but that does not matter is much it is been fairly well studied in both mice and human is much easier to study and mice that is a precursur to our six types of people the ones that care about my studies in the ones that care about human studies but a you chlorically restrict mice by forty per cent then am they can have improved testosterom prameters but only if there will be start and it appears to be that same way in humans as well the easy way to think about it is if youreo bes or you have metabolexandrom chloric restriction will improve your tistosterone there has been a study and they talk about all these studies in a systematic review from the mal clonic proceedings in march of last year an a they note that there is a study in young healthy men and they chlorically restrict them and their testoterone does decrease if you are young and healthy and you do not have metabolexandrom than chloric restriction will likely decrease your testosterom that clarifies a lot for me and i i believe it will clarifie lot for other people is well and i'm delighted that you pointed out this distinction about intermittan fasting not being the only way to achieve chloric restriction there are a number of a young a healthy or older healthy a people i know who using intermittan fasting even if they are not trying to lose weight for a couple of reason some believe that it might extend life spend i think there still that still a bit of an open question it is a bit of a hard experiment to do because the controlsione want to be in the control group as i say done mie there right exact afbaudience exactly and the other a feature of it the sylobitrickey is that many people interment fasting because of the mental of facts the clarity of mind that they feel during fasting the increase pleasure in eating when they finally do eat am and here i'm referring to interment fasting of the sort where eating windows ar anywhere from eight to twelve hours a they not extended fasts of twenty four hours or more the question therefor is for the healthy am lean enough person right nonobest a person is intermin fasting a bad idea in terms of hormo own health is oscillating between this period of of confeast in famine within a twenty four hours a problem if one is getting sufficient gallories to make ean weight if the're in a cloric matenance then it is not going to be a it is not gongto be delateries as not goingto be bad forther hormone health there is a couple different hormones that we can talk about we can talk about to stosterone we can talk about d g e which you usually go hand in hand andthen we can also talk about growth hormone which is not a steroid hormone but it is a peptited hormone it is a a chain of protines i meano acids that are put together instead of a steral think of steril hormones is coming from collester all intermentant fasting you do get a little spike in growth hormone after you eat but you also get a huge spike in growth hormone a morse significant less negligible spike overnight and that is improved if you are intermit and fasting it is probably gin a help youre growth hormone and subsequently i g f one levels which will help more in older h groups than younger h groups and i te et dinner for me that means sometime around six or seven ofclock sometimes eight ofclock i can fess last night tofs working late i ate i pretty big i swhy basing my only meal the day at ten ofclock that is a rare thing for me can i still achieve a high degree of growth hormorne output if i luld say i avoid food in the two to three hours before going to sleep where does one have to be very deep into a fast in order to achieve this the increase in growth hormone there is still pretty good growth hormon output even if you eat two or three hours before you sleep it is just the law of diminishing returns the longer you go you get slightly more and slightly more igt and i know a number of people think of growth hormone in the context of the exogenous growth hormone i an the fact that that can in some cases be associated with cancers i've been asked many times before can the increasin growth hormon from things sawnas are interment fasting cause levels of growth hormon that are high that they cause cancers i my impulses to say no that doesnt hos it is not im likely to happen but i i should prouably verify that statement with you yes quite unlikely i think about growth hormone and especially i g f one ndthe is actily an i g f one and i g f to but i think about it in terms of indocrin i g f one mostly i g f one that is a synthesized teliver and released in the in the liver first as i g f one that is released a classically an example of this would be your ig f one levels increase after resistance training or exercise and that is more perocrin or autolcrin and they have more local action that i g f one it is pretty well studied that if you just give people i g f one it is not going to at ta pys eologic levels it is not an improve their body composicion however that igeef one that is autocrine and perocrine just working in those local tissues and muscles is likely part of the reason why you get a improved body composition response after exercise i sy an i'm just to clarify for me and for for others what can we say or the major functions of igiev one an igeef too that are distinct from just growth hormon are they just cive the active form o growth ormon the kound of the thum the pickaxe end of the of the of the assembly lin they have a much longer duration of action i believe the half life of igeef one is several days almost a week whereas growth hormone has an extremely fast half life of only hours growth hormon acts a significantly on the liver to produce igeef one it is a it is around in the serum in the blood long enough to where it is producing an effect a pretty much all the time very interested when then the're other pillars amstress a yeun we have talk alout about stress on this podcast before in tools for managing stress am sleep obviously is a big one im i think a uknowg if nothing else i will eithere put people to sleep with my podcass i'm certaily not this one but my my sol episodes or i'm hofully convinced people that sleep is the foundation of mental and physical health and and performance are there any aspects of hormon optimization that can improve sleep i know sleep can improve hormon optimization but are there any aspects of hormon optimization that can improve sleep and for people that are suffering from this common syndrum of going to sleep in that waking op it three or four in the morning we know that can be associate with depression but are the any horm hormonal indications that might lead to that kind of situation ye there is three big ones the first one is not supercommon but it is a very direct correlation if you have a growth hormon deficiency a true deficiency whether you aren a dull or a child than your sleep is likely going to be effected in a letze youre a child with growth hormon deficiency once that is replaced with therapy you are sleep is gingto get significantly better the second one that is a very common senario is if you are having what is called to face motor symptoms of metapause or f asa motor symptoms of anderpause which are also applicable and that is where you are progestigenic activity you are a promain projestigens are projest rone and then pregnant alone and then five alfa three alfa projest eron jis tose manufactured in the body they are manufactured in a few places in men there manufactured som in the testies in the late excells in women they are manufactured in the overies until menapause and in they are also manufactured in the adrenal glance a if you are in if your pre a drinapauzle where your genal glands are still working fairly well usually still have a decent amount of progest run around and this can be measured to a after benapas women make progsteron from there a overis ther sarry from their adrina glance if that progesterone crosses the bood rain barrier especially if it is five alfand three alfor do it is modified a little bit then it is both a gaba aganist a which help sleep just gaba does gamo minobuteric acid the main inhibitory narro transmitter of which lots of things work on alcohol works on gaba as well gaba penten also works on gaba my grain medicines many of them work on gaba thenzo di asapens and also non benzos of anexample of a benzo a buzanics an example of a a non benzo would be ambian those all work on gaba gab is also helped by the progestigenic activity as well that is why a lot of women and menapaus feel their sleep is much worse es because they have lower activity of those progestitions is hat end for men in called andrepaus a lotestosterone is that also one of the causes of poor sleep lotestosterone canly forsleep but my thirdconario a is actually if a man begins t r t then they develop poor sleep because of sleep apnia it drastically raises the risk that somebody is going to have sleep apnia and then a lot of people especially when they first ar in the first month or two it puts them into this hyper sympathetic state because they have a overactiv andergen receptors especially after a long time of being hyhpoganatle then they have a a physiologic dose of t r t and that causes the sleep issue itself interesting a have a lot of questions about tiar teacsas octron replacement ther be a i shuld just mention that when you say a it increases sympathetic activity a you do not mean a that taking testosteron increases sympathy for others it may in fact do the opposite although it is very clear fom my discussions with a my colleagues in on the in the underchronology side and also with a the great doctor robert supulsky that that increasing testostron merely exacerbates existing features of people the jerks become bigger jerks kind people become even more kind in general a but we will i want to get into tar t in dapth but's very interestingly to hear that testosteron replacement there be a increases the risk of sleep apnia and i onto make sure that i ask that is that also the case on people that are using tar t who are not hypocanattle because in the classic situation as somebody is not making enough to stosteron their below three hundred anigrams prodest leader on the chart they going to take tyarty but many people nowadays it is behonest art ar taking doses of of testostron even though they are in that sort of standard range because the range is large because of other symptomology 's that right ye i do love the analogy that doctor supulsky had about monks taking testosterone and making the more and more generous that does appear to be what testostrone usually does is it exasterbates if you will what you'r previously it is not an a change you as a person but a if you are you ganatle before you start testosterone umeaning meaning you have normal testosterone and then you star t r t or self administer t r t sterroids would avery one a look at it then you risk of sleep apnia still goes up in a dose dependent fashion the higher the dose the more risky with the sympathetic and the pari sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic is the fider flight nervous system the pari sympathetic is the rest in digest if you have too much fider flight and strascan cause that too than you are not can arrest as well at night i wanted touch on testosterone an women because there is testosteron and women i'd to know where that testosterone comes from which tissues i'd to know whether or not testostrone replacement there b make sense in women i'm hearing more and more about women using testosterne and i to know whether or not knowing a woman's testoc for her to know her testosterone is of equal less then are more value than knowing offerinstance progesteron an esterogen levels because i think there alotomous conceptions about the rules of testosteronand women for health opstimization testosterone is just as important to know for pathology prevention for example brescanser ostio perosis estrogen and progesterone are more important to know whn you are thinking about women women think that they have such a tiny amount of testosterone because you cul youtest it most people test a fre testosterone testosteroe that is unbound which is by far the the smallest proportion of testosterone any anrogen is bound by lots of different sterroid binding protins but the one s that are mostpertinent are called s h b g or sex hormone binding globulan and that binds the androgenic sterroid for exampled d h tur dy hydro testosteron it is associated with prostate enlargement sociated with mal paterbaldness it binds that the most strongly and then it binds testosterone nextmostrongly and then it binds things anderson a dione or d a d hydro et p androsterone and then it binds the estrogens the weakest estrodyle if you look at the total amount of testosterone women actually have almost all women not all women but almost all of them have significantly more testosterone the an esterdile but it is because it is indifferent measurements esterodile lot o time is yo graams premil a supposed to nanigran s prodesolater women have more testostron than estrogen and significantly more d than either interesting do women make dihydrotistostro e where does it where does thi testostron come from because they do not have testies most tustostron and women that are premen apozle can come from thecasells t h t thcacells or cells in the overies that can produce tustostrone and a lot of people a have actually heard about hyperthycosis not the term itself but a lot of olympians that ar their cromasones ar exui their females and they are not taking any w their s li but their fm e're sorry their x x o e th their x x theyre not x wy and they have never transitioned or been on any sort of ahormone replacemen or testostrone but they naturally produce a huge amount of testotrone as much as many men and some of these women i believe theyre from bosuana were band from competing in the olympics in certain distances i believe theyre band from the four hundred meter and eight hundred meter tbecause their natural testostrone was deemed to be too high said they mistakenly thought that they were using steroids they actually knew they were not using sterroids they knew it is their thecasells were just genetically gifted i suppose and they still made them change distances one or two these athletes change to i believe it was the three k or the five k and they still did quite well but it was not their best event interesting that is turning out to be a very interesting and controversial area of this notion of hormon theropies and natural variation and hormons on different cromazomal backgrounds fasting we shuld ie do a whole episode about that cause it is very much of the times a men and women both make t h t i'd to ask about d h t in men aso often we here about testostrone in men and fr testostron and ibeing the unbound form of course but di hydrotistostrone where does it come from in men what is the cascade of of events that takes testostrone to dihygrs to stostrne and what ar some of the quoton quote positive and negative effects of of here i'm only refering to in dogenist i a i hydrotestostron in fact i'll i'll make it very clear weather or not ai'm talking about taking something or one's own natural production here we are just i think up un till now we have just been talking about natural production tell us about d h t in men i such a powerful hormonduring development obviously a but what is it what is it doing d h t is a very androgeni cormone whether you are talking about d which is a mile a weak androgen or teststrone which is a relatively strong androgen or d h t which is a very strong androgen they bind to the androgen recepter in both men and in women the a effect of all three of those is mediated by the andrgen receptor there is a couple different bata estradyle receptors and a alpa estradyle receptors but there is only one andergen receptor in treingly it is on the ex cromasol men get there andrgen receptor gen from their mother women get one andrgen receptor gen from there father one from their mother often the one that is more sensitive to andrgens and p people with piecio ess that is the one that is active the other one is methelated an inactive can i just pause you on say a sorry tonthroughout but i have to ask this question a before i forget and i know number of people polly wonnin i've heard that whether not one develops male pattern baldness whether not a a male develops male pattern baldness just to be very precise a you could get some information about that by looking at your mother's father and that would in keeping with what you just described that the excrumizon which of course is handed off through the mother is carring the a gene setting cod for the number in distribution of these d of these andrgen receptors that th h will bine who cause of course i think as you will probably tell us that th h t is a responsible for male pattern baldness and beardgrowth is that right should i look at my grandfather or my mothers side to determine what i'm likely to look in terms of my d h t ness is that a word ye it is the best guess that you can make purely from pheno types than you can measure your geno type and a you knon't get a better idea of that assuming that it is true male pattern baldness it is related to the gen transcription of the andrgen receptor i to think of it as how much of this andergen receptor gene is active ated by any anrgen if you ofe an extremely sensitive gene which usually means you have very fw c g repeats which is basically just a ascertain c g an coats for a certain aameno acid and if you have very few of the repeats than you'r andrgen receptor gen works better think of it as a corelary to huntingten's disease where if you have very few of called tri nullatide repeats then it is not as severe oby the disease but after you get more and more c g repeats which by the way or a in the population you are getting more and more c g repeats a it is a unnatural selection of process that has been one going for a a variety of number reasons but anyway if you have more repeats than that gen activeats in the sideoplasm and movee to the neuclius and causes gen transcription more often and harloss more often sos that mean that we are seen more hair lost now du to elevated levels of d h t than we were fifty years ago a probably not a the harloss fifty years ago not fifty years ago at five hundred years ago was probably more significant because on average five hundred years ago people were more sensitive to androge ns there is a cyndrum called andrigen insensit insensitivity cendrum a i s and that cyndrum is related to when men who have the copy from their mother who is a carrier they are a r gn or andrgen recepter gn is completely insensitive think of it it does not have it it is not related to the c repeats but think of that a receptor as just not wrking at all there is a continuum everybody's recepter works a little bit better or a little bit worse and the better your recepter works the more likely you are to have mail paderbaldness to zum out from this but still keeping a a and i on d h t what do you to c all women and all men do to optimize d h t and here i'm taling about regardless of age we are still in this from puberty onward phase we have not yet a microdisected out decade by decade which we will do but a what do you to see people do to keep d h t an jack but before you tell us that could you tell us what positive things d h t does when it is in the proper range d h t helps a lot for te same reason why tostostron helps it activates the andergen recepter gne it helps efort feel good it can be motivating that is how it is active in the c aness it also is active in cardy of ascular tissue if you look at a some one that has heart failur or if some one has cardiac hypertrop the level of d h t in matter because it is also binding to the anderten recepter in the mile cardiun were in the heart itself you think of tha classic body builder heart it is an easy example to make theyare very thick and muscle their muscle is very strong because their pumping blood often with high blood pressure and that d h t and the testosterone and an d h t derivetis masterone or oxander lone primable and also bind to the heart and they cause even more i perturf are enlargement of that muscle tissue then let' say the person stops in their recovering and they are trying to have cardiacry modelling which is ware you take a very thick heart and cardiacrymodellings important in a lot of different a cardiac pathologies but if you give them fanasteridor u tasteride which inhibit the insime that converts testosterone to d h t making less activity at the andergen recepter gene they have cardiacrymodelling and their heart health improves i see for the nonbody builder the typical women or man or a young younger or older a what sorts of thing support d h t and thereby heart health am presume le d h t is inbolved in some of the other things that testosteron is famous for in both men and women things le bido as you mention a making effort feel goods of motivation drive and a vitality it is a as i gues s be the general phrase awhat what sorts of thing support d h t what sorts of things create problems for d h t there is lots of dietary changes and supplementation that you are probably doing right now that is effecting your d h t m sirtling wele every everybody oall of the listeners because let us say you have a diet high and plant polly fenals many of those inhibit t insime that converts tostostro to d h t could could you give us an example of of one of those im eithere in supplementation form or in food form kircumens certain kirkumanoids depinning on the structure well inhibit t nsime called five alfor a ductse that converts tostostro to d h t tumeric te tumeric black pepper extract a few it is used often to increase bile availability it is also called byo purine it is also a five al for a duct in hibiter a and on top of that people have different genetich to isome people they are five alfor a ductsons ims there is three of them im they are on crom a some two three and four i believe but a some of them ere active in the prosta some of themr active in the brain and some of it depends on which tissue their tissue specific inzimes that depend on how much d h t u convert do you recommend that people avoid kirkumen in tumric for that reason and is there any specific recommendations for men verses women if a man or a woman by the way an women a lot of times if you just aske your doctor for a d h t check it is the same unit dasin men it is essentially undetectable a you have to em especially if they are on oral contraceptives which is the different topic theirt h t is very likely undetectable especially if it is fr d h t you can measure both a d h t and afr d h t but if some one's d h t is already low or if they have somewhat insensitive andrgen recepter the genetics or v li style then i recommend they avoid by what vailable kircumanoids bil available tumeric black pepper extract and they might be a good candidat for cre t creatine creatn monel hidrate and significantly increase the conversion of tostostro to d h t inter shing there is also a lot of really interesting data coming out now about the im the role of of creetine as a brain fuel and maybe ven as a cognivin hancer over time the date are still on going but some o the studies in humans are pretty impressive at least to me i i'm glad you mention the thing about kirkumen in blackpepper i wish we would have this conversation and six years ago because i'd the experience of im jumping on the band wagon of the excitement around tumeric and i took a tumeric supplement os couple capsils of what i thought to be and i think was high quality tumeric and i've never felt as poor as i did in the subsequent few days flat line of less you say everything that one would want to have in life energy itality just it was a cliff and im a friend somehow new a that kirkumen could inhibit five alfor ductics that converts to soceron to de a she as you pointed out i stop taking it was the only new addition to my diet and supplementation and things bounce back within about three four days but it was remarkable a i felt garbage and it was actually kind of frightening to to experience the the a sharpness of that cliff but im i know that some people tumeric for its a anti inflamatory a properties et cetera sounds people either need to experiment or a and if they do obviously to approach that with caution any time you ad or remove something youneeds talk your your doctor you are a doctor and i'm guessing that am if one were to experiment am would you say that most of these effacts of things kirkumen are reversible as they were in me or is here any potential of permanent damage if people have been taking them for a long time the effects are nearly always reversible when you are talking about five alforoductase in hibition what tumoric does but stronger the most common story that we hear is regarding a supplement not a sal palmetto which a lot of oldher men take for their prostate health or finasteride whic you can take for your prostate or your hart or your hair or dotastoride if your heaving side effects on these then it is probably because of a couple different reasons one can be your ratio of andrgens to estrogens is off and that needs addrest another one can be it is inhibiting the conversion of your pogestorown to that other type of progesteron the five alfa three alfa that we talked about earlier that is helping with your sleep and your brain and your calmness and a that is definitely in effect another one is depending on the type of supplement or med they inhibit different i inzimes of that five alforaductaes if it is if thei're disinhibiting one and two then that is goin to be a different effect than if thei're inhibiting two and three finastoride does two and three sal palmetto does one and two and then do tasteride does all three the third one is active in the brain and dou tastoride inhibits that third one a little bit weaker in vivo but strongly in vitro it is really a hard to parse out you can use bio feet back in experimentation i do think with supplements it is safe to experiment the time that it takes to set in is usually about three months the risk of and i anecdotally there is been lots of research published about if postfinastride post finasterides indrom is real or fake and it is real but it is one of those things that is a combination of organic and inorganic disease almost conalike fibra milgo where it is definitely real and there is lots of things that you can do to help with it but it is very unlikely to occur if you stop taking your supplement or medication after you ve sid offects interesting why certainly feel better when i 'm taking five grams of creeting mono hydrate per day i know most yeuill take it for muscle growth and tissue repair and things that sort mainly i think brings water into the muscle tissue et cetera but i i take it for the brain offacts and also because i to think that it gives me a little bit of a th h t bump that i can actually see in my my blood sharts when i've done them a i know many people want to avoid the hair loss that can sometimes be associate with t h t levels going too high and i've been asked many times does creating mono hydrate cause hair loss it would make sense that if creatne increases t h t and h t binding to the engernan receptor on the scalp can induce hairloss that that would be the case is that true or am is are people just really concerned about something that is treveal or non existent each mal and yes it campotentially at it i do not to say it causes it but it is it can be a little bit more fuel to the fire just everybody has a different sensitivity of their andrigen receptor they have a different amount of gene transcription that is going to cause death of the folicl that is an arbitrary threshold you do not really know until you start losing hair and if somebody takes ellbit of creatine for the a to increase their d h t maye for the cogniv en hancing effacts or for whatever reason and they knowice itll bit more har fling o out in the sink and they stop taking it wih you said death of the folical which sounds very tramatic are those folic are those little stemsell niches that residin the folical which her grow from are those then abolish thers there is no going back or can you one rescue tha the hair it takes months if the're still there the hair will come back the loss of the hair itself is i normal part of the hair cycal your have your enag in phase your catdage in fase your teelageen fase and then your hair loss and tin enow o the lemsel nich in the in the hair fall think think of it sharts have teeth sharp loses a tooth than they have a new one that comes through or losing your baby tooth than you have a new one but your hair just always keeps coming through it is natural for it to die and lose that is whay t that is why when you start five out for a ductason ofebitters often you have a big shed what happens during that big shed is all of these cells that are unhealthy they immediately jediscon that hair and they start making am much healthier new folical aut all the hairs that ar it at the end of ther teelogin phase then a they have what is called teeligent affloveium which also happens after pregnancy also happens in a thiroy pathologies you shed it a new one comes in place and you think that you'r having a a horrible hair loss caused by your finasteridor whatever your whatever you are doing and monoxidal does us too but you are rellyjust having a new healthier folical if you go a really long time if you go a year then those hairs might come back and they might not for am simplicity s i if somebody is concerned about or is experiencing harloss male worf female what are their options of a ways to offset that hair loss that are not going to negatively impact other tissue sensitive to d h t an and what i'm what i'm basely saying here is i could imagine taking a d a d h t inhibitor i'm a pill of some sort or an injection some sort and offsetting hair loss maybe even stumuling more hair growth a it is clear that i'm not doing that but but i know people that do but then experience some of the other negative effects of a blunting d h t reduced afact reduced labedo reduce drive am disruptions in a prostate function or or even amsectual function generally what could can people do if they want to maintain or grow back here but they do not want all those other effacts what should they avoid and what should they perhaps consider talking to their doctor about there is a whole host of options i i try to separate alopetia or harloss into two different categoriis male pattern baldness or androgenic alopetia also in is androgenetic alopetia verses other types of alopetia usually teelogenifloveiums and if it is andrigenetic alopetia or m male patternbaldness even if their female perhaps they apieco as something that then you want some sort of strategy to dcrease the activity of that androgen receptor women fonget male pattern baldness absolutely o k t i'm have to wrap my head around that one but e there is a lot of different things that ou can do that are topical the most promising is called du tasteride mesotherapy essentially what it is is it is very localized injections and areas that are prone to male powtern baldness whether there female or male and it acts o locally only and you repeat these injections from time to time it decreases the conversion of testostera to d h t just in the scalp that can avoid prostate of facts and what are some of the negative effects of a blocking d h t in a females in the perifery meaning not in not on the scalpor in the brain but wut where is d h t doing its stuff it is both d h t and an also that five alfa three alfa progestorone which is called a t h p dy hydrope projestorone or tetrohydro try hydrope justurone there active in the central nervous system but it is all just active again binding to the androgen receptor ina female is well causing them to have that effort feel good motivation a lot of women that are sensitive to d h t cause women can be sensitive to d h t is well feel very different when they start in oral contraceptive not because it alters their d h t to a huge amale it does to some degree because the negative feed back in hibition in the tuitarian less produced in the overies but it increases s h b g really high because their ess h p gs are significantly higher their free d h t is way lower how does a woman know if she has picio sk polysystic ovarian indrum what are the issues with polysystic o varian sindrum what can be done about picio s i confess i was naive to picio s am that was not splister rhyme but since it does i do confess i was completely naive to it ask our getting a lot of questions about it in various forms and i think that is that is i shally that reason why initially approach to you i know you ive treated a lot of picio ss a what age women am should be thinking about picio s what is picio s tichas about picio ass please picio s is polysystic ovarian sindrum and this is one of those conditions which is under diagnos it is prevalence is much higher than we think it is there is been a lot of studies in some some studies say prevalence of ten per cent some say twenty per cent it is not completely clinically penetrate most people do not know they have picioss until they have infertility or sub fertility and is is as picio s happening this frequency in twenty year old women an thirty year old women and forty and onward most women find out they have picioss in their thirties especially is't it is on a spectum or continuum a lot of things where you can have a weeker version or very severe version on of the symptoms there is a criteere called the rotter dam cried teria and in the rotter dam criteria there is a couple different ways af you can diagnosit you are looking for andrigen excess insolent resistance and you can also look for polysystic overies you do not actually have to have polysiystic overies or get an olter sound of your overies to be diagnost if you have andrigen axcess for exemple andrigenic acney or hormonal acney if you have hair growth a hair growth on the chin it is called a hersitism or if you have a deepining of the voice am at any symptom of too much and a mail powder baldness fear female that is a a symptom of picioss as well then you can also have insolent resistance this is obicity it is predibedis a high fasting insolen a homa i ae over too a fasting insolent of over six if you have significant insolent resistance and also a andrige dominantce that is a sign of it ndrigen dominance often leads to what is called olego minorea if your having more than thirty five day intervals in between a period or if you have less than nine per year then that can be a signed that you have olego which means too little minarea which means mincies that is a very common sign of picioss if you have infertilities if your under the age of thirty five and ou've been trying for more than a year or if you are over the age of thirty five and youv been trying for more than six months then that can also be it is a very common presentine complaint when somebody presents with piecio es and assuming that a woman is doing it all these other things is paying attention to the six pillars that we you talked about earlyer diat exercise cloric restriction in some cases right not everyone needs to be cloric restricted a stress sleep and sunlight spirit am assuming that theyare doing all those things a what other things in the realm of diet or supplementation can help them avoid piecioes if they have sub clinical piecioas or they have not developed it but do not want to develop because it does not son a good thing ya depining on where they are if their very strong on the insolent resistance spectrum than a optimizing their body composition decreasing their body fat entreating that metabolicxendrum can help a a lot a people ask whal is everybody that is on a does everybody ned to be o atforman as picioes not necessarily but met forman is one of the tools i can help with insolent sensitization other tools i can help or anostatal myoan ostatal is an insolene sensitizer it is acousin d ciroan ostatal is a a weak antiandrogen a lot of types of an ostatal have both of those in it depinion on ifure a female or a male and yofre on an ostatal the type of an osttal does matter yet this is very important point i i just to day i said imtrying this new am supplement an ostatal am for its roll an help perhaps enhancing sleep even further my sleeps generally pretty good lately it is been a womin off for a number of reason i took it for the first time last night and and i said ive i thought it helped and a'm just subjectively and you said a what kind of anostatal is it because an ostas a very portant androgen inhibiter it turns out i was taking myoan ostatal which is not an androgen inhibiter the type the other type that you mention which is an androgen in hibiter is d ciroan ostatal it is usually in a ratio of one to twenty five or one to forty in a much lower amount compared to myo an ostatal in a in a supplementary in the body in a supplement to help induce obulation but for women who have picio as who might want to tryin reduce androgen then they would perhaps want to take a form of an ostatal that reduce the androgen receptor activity graunt they want both furer a woman thand you have ever talk to your doctor about getting on e oral contraceptive or sparonalactone which is also an antiandrogen but it happens to be a potacium sparing diaretic blood pressur medicin as well a d ciroanostotal might be a better optien dim or diindal mething is other another kind of weak antiastrogen anti androgen that a lot of women should consider as well you mention oro contraception a i've done a few posts a o an these les yus call them that they really are perceptual effects whereby it is been demonstrate inhuman several times now and in what i would appear to me to be very solid studies where a women that take a oral contraceptives there is both a shift in their perception of men cause thees these studies only looked at hat arecectual a a the sort of arrangements here am where women who are on oral contraception because it blunts some of the peaks in valleys of hormon a what no longer a experience the same peaks in valleys in their ascessmen of other men's attractiveness it sort of flattens the the their perception to speak they still find certain men attractive an certain men unattractive but the the the that degree of difference is kind of mellowedoubt a and likewise men persi these datas say that men perceiving women's attractiveness they still see women on oral contraceptives as attractive but there a women taking oral contraception eliminates this kind of pike in her attractiveness that men would otherwise perceive in other words oral contraseptives are changing the way that we perceive each other at least in terms of these male female a experiments what is going on with that is that because oral contraceptives blunt the increase in testosterone that occurs just before ovulation or is it because of a complex cascade wtwhat is going on i find this fascinated ye there is differenceis in how your and i would not use the word change necessarily but alter the severity or alter the a pikue as you said it is just tort is not going to change you as a person an oral contraceptive will not change you as a person thit will just change your a day to day peiqes and troughs in a lebido and attractiveness one of the main effects of oral contraceptives almost all of them have a symthetic estrogen and a symthetic progestigen in them one common type of symnthetic estrogen is ethinil estradyal there is another new a symthetic estrogen its out there as well but that anecdotally that seems to have even more side effects this ethenal estradyal is one hundred times more potent than indogenous or by identical esterodyle in the liver it binds to the estrogen receptor in the liver and it is going to increase sex hormonbining globulan which secondarily as you mentioned decreases your free testosteron inespecially your freedy age t that little testostro hump that you get when you are a female is opulating that is really flat line and it is already tit is a pretty insignificant difference it is not negligible but it is a little bit of a hump and you have significantly less of that when you are on oral contraceptive and does that blunthees ociated increasin lebido that normally would occur from that increase in in andregen yes interesting a and what about other forms of contraception right cause there are others copper a ud there is a averse implants theres rings there is a a huge number of of different a forms of these what we are talking about is a as i understand it is only the effect of am a oral contraception that impacts hormon output s za correct yet there is a lot of other effects as well for example your choice of synthetic progeston will alter how higher platelets an es h b g go it appears to be the higher your platelets an the higher your s h b g the higher risk of a blood clot a lot of women know that if there onoral contraceptive and there already predisposed to a blood clot or a venus thrumbo imbolism and ther vain they have a blood clot in either their leg or their long than it can increase that chance you can choose a synthetic progeston that is not going to have as high of a response a but there is there is various prosein cons some synthetic progestons are weak and tiandrogens as well for example t there is one known as slind which is made from spronalactone some women are on spronaloctone and that is well which is made from spronaloc to which probably is not particularly necessary unless they for a diretic or high protensive effect i see ii objeston it a a intentioally interruptan i apologize but am specifically because i want to ask about a there is this notion that am that orl contraception taken over long periods of time can disrupt fertility in ways that are independent of just the a the age related of decrease in infertility is that true it depends on what you mean by a long time six to twelve months it is possible past that it seems very unlikely however the persistently elevated s h b g can be present for quite some time wait i if a woman takes oral contraception for six to twelve months and then stops will she essentially beware she would have been anyway interms of her fertility at that age where you saying that it can cause permanent damage her fertility would be equitable as if she had never taken it if she is certainly twelve months but probably six months on what is she i know of women thayhave taken an oral contraception for many years are in addition to the age related declining fertility that occurs that is inevitable a of course the slope is going o be different depending on am the individual but it it are they a quickening the a the transition to infertility probably not am you can make a case that because they have been in a oral contraceptive they may have been slightly more predisposed to insolent resistance and or lowerling b odymass but that is n probably going to be a negligible difference compared to their resistance training and also their chlori restriction or chloric maidenance i's there are also effects of having children ye yewhy i'm in on all these berameters recons as a severe it is a major life style sheft ri that obviously what people contend with and have fir since the beginning of a human time anyway i will not ask some questions about malhormon there be and malhormone's generally but before i do that i i've a couple of burning questions that i get very often that i'm just goining incertai now mariwana i've heard that it can decrease tostostrone in men and women i've heard that it can increase testostrone alkohol i think there is general consents us that hig alkoholan take hi barbituit an take can does in fact reduse tostostrone what about modest increase of alkol i'm not a drinker that not asking these questions for me i do not smoke pa bi don dis never really the mariwanar alkall ter not my thing but many people want to know the answers these and the the data that i've seen are very confused and conflicting what about mariwana does it reduse to stostrone to significant degree were not cannabanoids itself whether it is t h c or c b d are not going to reduce tostostrone by themself if it smoked mariwana then it is very likely to increase your romataste which increases your estrogen and ayou know that is going to it is romatizing from tostostrone that is going to decrease toststrone when you have an increased estrogen estrodyl that is going to work on your patuitary to make less hormones that cause rethe release of of tostostrones you can have less elhiand less efes age it is almost kind of a you kow opiats are well known to a opiate agonists athey are going to decrease elation effesation subsequently to stostrone smoked mariwan will as well as far as alkohol high alkohl will decrease to stostrone as will any very potent gaba agonist whether it is a barbituatorobencs of disipenor a non benso or alkohol they are definally going to em moderate alkohol i guess a depends on what your definition of that is the amthe aris emony a i i some people i know that do not seem to be alkoholics at least by my a assessiment well have i a glass or two of wine forenights a week which to me seems a tremendous amount only because i do not alkohol i i do not have a prom with other people ing alkol but but i think many peofor many people that would be considered lowr or moderate in take ye i would consider that lown take the american hard association for men recommens bebetween one and two drinks a day on average they wellmond it yeso round one perw w ey i'm making my heart less healthy by not drinking alcohol ye they they recommend a very low amount of alcallan take for men for women they recommend the zerod to one that is gone a hard to interpret the zerod to one am but the protective effect of alkhall especially if it is a red wine a with polyphenals in it always the deliterious effect interesting cause i've seen some studies tat point to the idea that even lo in take of alkall over a prolong period of time might actually decrease brain volume or at least volume of particular brain areas but of course we do not know the consequence of of decreasing the volume wig of a given brainaarea either mean one can imagin its decreasing the size of one's a migdelan making them less strass althoughthere is no evidence to support that i've been told that i need a drink many many times but i always reply that i do not need to drink anything in order to speak my mine again an individual differences a very interesting it sounds smoked mariwuana may in fact reduce testostrone or at least increase the conversion of testostr onto astrogem o and with alcohalan gabaagonists it is important to remember that it should not be daily one drink of alkoholiday is actually very mildly ameto uppressive it is better to have two drinks of alkohal one day the week and in two more drinks of alkhal another day the week and then no alkhall the rest of time the same could be said even for supplements that have gaba in them a lot of sleep supplements have giv o metobuteric acid i occasions take o sart anti occasionally take a hundred to two hundred milgrams of gaba i'm in order to enhanc sleep but i do it maybe every third or for night no more than thre or four nights a week that is perfect there is a lot of sleep supplements that should not be taken daily and gabas one of them a another one of them is trasadon and in melitonin is kind of arguable and a depends on the situation but in general if you are taking a sleep supplement it should not be taken every night the the sleep supplements that i understand or oquet to take every night or nearly every night ore things magnesium three and eight have the gen an if that is not true correct me i o those who i certainly take them every night unless i forget them in back home in i'm travelling magnesiums one of the exceptions ealthiating is also another exception great l then at least i have not put anything into the world i that is i wrong in that category yet and hopely i will not but if i do i'll correct myself let us talk about testastrone in in mals thet you see these head lines all the times now that testastron levels are dropping sperm counts are dropping vina types of men are changing over time and and i cannot quite follow the literature an that because iwe see those are hard controlled experiments to do because techniques change over time and sensitivity of techniques change over time but regardless i'm aware that a lot of pe il are considering increasing theire testostrone by taking testostrone that f a few years ago that was considered sceroid use and was really extreme kind of stance nowadays it seems there is more discussion about it first off i'd to know does testosterone supplementation and here i' pane out prescription from a doctor does it make one more prone to prostate cancer that seems always be the first question that comes out ye and there is a huge amount of mis information about this to testosterone is not going to cause a prostate cancer however normal aging coses prostate cancer and testosterone will grow your prostate cancer if you are a eighty year old male and you have an alltopsy and there is at least sa fifty per cent chance that you have a prostate cancer if your ninety eor a hundred years old there is at least a ninety per cent chance for humans with a prostate it is only a matter of time until yout a prostate cancer that begs the question do you want to take something that is going to grow it for sure once you have it it is an individual assessment and it is important to follow things p sas as well a p sa of of for or less i mean ideal you would not be at fork as tht's ave the uppra threshold is am the simplest redoubt of wheather or not there is excessive prostate growth there is beenine prostate hyperoplasia where the prostate s is growing but it is non canceris correct and then of course there re the symptomologies people have chalenges ourination they r sexual difficulties et cetera i'm always struck by the am correlation that people draw between testostrone and prostate health and the fact that or that i should say the claim that testoter makes prostate health worse because if you think about it young males have high testostrone often if not always em certainly often and you do not see a lot of prostate overgrowth in cancer in young males something is going on here how how should we conceptioalizes if you have a p sa of three point nine and you are a twenty five year old male verses a seventy five year old male and you have a p sa of five point nine the three point nine p sa is significantly more concerning think of your prostate is taking cumulative damage from not only testostrone but also estergen and also growthormmon that is why o bs individuals have higher incidances of prostate cancer as well it is because they do not have those sell check points where a your mean system takes a second says ri stop a replicating as fast prostate cells let us see ifthere is any eight tipical ones and in fines those and it prevints them from reproducing that is why it mean oth theropean cancer is promising uss because they can target these certain things the older male is going t have that cumulative damage happen already and parduably prostate cancer is a normal a eunow it with aging a fast aging is abnoral very slow aging is normal there is a fine line to walk between those two but there is a lot of things that can be done to decrease the turn over decrease the inflammation and decrease the congestion of the prostate over time there is also a lot more than just psays that can be done theie's prostate em orize and things that that can look at the structure in the function of the prostate what should every male do to maintain the health of their prostate and i realize that younger malespd are not thinking about it all although seems nowadays i get these kind of what i call am criptic questions you a i think women are more comfortable talking about their hormone and sectual health because of they they cycl you because of menstrual cycles their used to fluctuations that le it is forgive them the experience of wht it is to have different levels of progester on estrgen tost os ar et cetera i get these kind of criptic questions often in my direct messages where what i think people are asking is m wha what is there something wrong with my prostate what should i do for my prositate these are often indirect questions rather aspects of their life where thei'r suffering but am and i do not say that a in justi i i think a more direct discussion would be great a what should all males do to main to maintain a prosate health throughout the life spent maintaining prostate health can be looked at similarly how you can maintain a good natural optimaltustosteron you look for things that can hurt it you do not necessarily look for one thing that can improve it or boostit for young males those are prostatitus i go hand in hand with epiditomitus different infections of the prostate the younger the male is the more likely it is related to something that could be sectually transmitted but another very common cause is what we call gram negative and anerobic bacteria the prostate is right by the end of the colan if you have chronic constipation or if youhave coitus or a if you have yu know even just an ecol lie overgrowth in the colan is very likely to cause an infection of the prostate as well what should males do tot to prevent that have a diet that has good healthy prebiotic fibr probiotics as well a make sure that ther having regular bawe movements that they do not have chronic constipation have good sources hof dietary fibr which is also a soluble fibre and enough insoluble fibr most people get enough insoluble or non dietary fibre that can help prevent the chance of divertac ulitus which is another type of infection it can also decrease the chance of coitus and decrease the chance of prostate infections as well are there any foods and our supplements that men should take or avoid what about you here about salpal metto am ye supplements for or a supplements that support or cause issues for the prostate a if there is a strong genetic predisposition to enlarged prostates or even just really early prostate cancers that grow fast then they consider takeng salpometto or even kirkuman as an antiandrogen as long as ey re able to tolerate it an individualized pasis and depends on their history as far as a making sure that their prostate is not congested there is an interesting correlation between having girls and having prostate cavins ora ofsa if your if your offspring ar females then your slightly more likely to have prosate cancer there is some a there is hypotheses that link estrurgen to prostate cancer rather than tostofstrone if you hyper estrogenism your prostate a has more a typical cells in general the higher your c reactive protine which is a general marker of inflammation in your body we call it c r p and the test order is h c r p or high sensitivity s ar p if your c r p a raises up very high if you have an automun disease if you have a crone's flare or if you have a lupis or an infection or a secually transmitted infection or even a coites or even the flue your c r p is can a rase significantly that you would detect in a bloodtestm correcta you want to get a baseline se or p when you have not had any of those things recently and if your r p is higher you also have more female offspring if your c r p is higher then your reactive oxtian species which are causing mutations and a typical sell turn over in the prostate or also likely higher you want to keep it very low c r p interesting and a what about blood flow and pelvic floor in general we shuld ride tou a whole episode on pelvic floorit the other much interesting a data coming out of the the fields of clinical and research eurology i realize it is kind of the netherlands of of a biology an medicine people probably are not thinking much about this but pelvic floor is obviously a a a confluments of a ton of bloo a vasculature of nerves and of course the prostate resides there and of course the generals and a reside their as well i would imagine that the one of the six pillars no exercise being able to maintain adequate blood flow to those regions is k what about jus posteral things people sitting too much a not a hydrating well enough a you mention avoiding constipation what are some other things including medications that can serve to support the prostate overtime and maybe even support pelvic floor in general both in males and females overtime absolutely and this is something that is rightfully getting more and more to ction the way explain the pelvic floor is your abdominal cavity which includes your peritineum were where most to your organs are youre retoapperitineum your pelvic space think of it is a box and your abs are the front of the ox your back muscles are the back your diaframe is the top of the box and your pelvic floor that is where your port is to the outside world especially important that has muscles as well and you can dou exercises pelvic floor physical theripist ar becoming more and more utilized especially after child birth but in other situations as well including by men getting care from yourologists you went to bo strengthen that ofpelvic floor and make sure that th tube sit er docks to the outside world ar working well enough but they are not too loose are not working too well there is a lot of medications that can b a positives or negatives for your pelvic floor we cannot talked about your got in colon health in general as far as your prostate health and as far as your a blatter in your inary system health you think it about a couple different classes you have your phosphodastraces you have your tadalafill basically this is goin a help decrease congestion in the prostate a lot of people take it for e d but it can actually healp you decrease your utofine thent a lot of men take to dalifill generic is c alise has a much longer half life than viagra earlevy treds half life is almost to day se e con take a very low dose of it instead of taking twenty melograms you take two or two and a half molegras o they are taking you are saying that a lot of men ta et for erectile this function yes that it at lower dose s it may have serve purposes for prostate healt independent o a erection correct the most common sinareo is if a male is waking up twice at night to p on average it will cut that down to once if the'e waking up at four times at night than it can cut that down to twice at night just because you have easier blood flow eused to use other medications flomax which is tampsyuloson that is an alfa antagonists who at basically binds to a receptre in smooth muscle and at helps relac that there several other alfa antagonists and then you also have your medications that ar hormona fanasteride that a lot of people tate for prostate health to decrease the enlargement of the prostate the perier rethral aria or periorethral lobe your several lobes of the prostate that tends to be especially enlarged in cases of b p h and b p h prostate hyberoplasia or an enlarged prostate and if you are unable to shrenk that area then a et that point is just a plumbing problem and the earn is able to get by easier et my understanding is that now there is a a e growing i mut say a movement a but a take the idea of taking very low dose two point five melegram or f ve melegram to dallifille even daily it is becoming pretty common for many men who do not have erectale this function simply to either maintain or enhance prostate hal that is that correct ye's correct and are there do you see any negative effects of doing that there can be negative effects it can lower blood pressure theoretically i can increase your chance of vasi vagal syncope a lot of people take it as a alternative to pump because it cunt of work similarly to citralline a or a different pump products and pre work out and it can certainly help with that but if you are about to go to a deadlift where you might pass out anyway it can certainly increase the chance of that happens because you do not have that copensitory exercise hypertension response could someone just take it away from exercise they could a if you took to dalifilled and it is that is going to be has a long half life whereas viagran lef eature as just a few hours to dalifille is almost to day some interesting studies on viagara have been done as well it can potentially alter your rays and cones in your eye the usual recommendation for pilets that need have red green discrimination from very long distances with very small indicator lights is to not take a viagra i usually say if you are if you are pilot that your profession perhaps hold off from that for a while there is also studies with viagra that significantly which is also it is sil denipill as the generic now it can increase eyebrow hare growth potentially what it does is it helps vaso dialye and relax the veins especially an oldermen and when those veins are relaxed to you have better bloodflow that is one of the proposals or theories behind wy older men get the androgenetic alipetia more you are having less blood flow in the scalp theoretically it can also help prevent that t it is the unvory increasing blood oh because it increases bloodfloat a systemically throughout the body not just in in a specific tissues why find it incredibly interesting that am yether these online forms building up now around am lowdose to dalifille a daily use of lodus to dallafill again not for amsexual erectile tis function but forsake of of longturn prostrate health is there any reason why women might want to take lowdose to dallifille to dalifill is also it wea androgen receptors sincitizser kind of alcaratine were the density of the available andregen receptors to bind increases slightly there could potentially be a a benefit from that but a most the time it is used in men ere interesting we have not really talked about tostostrone in optimizing tstosterone and mals assuming some one is paying attention to t six pillars there is a kind of a gap as i see it between doing all those things and tart ormon rplacement thera mand again that the are the replacement in tiart is a little bit of a a in quotes nowdays because a lot of people who ahave testostrne in that three hundred to nine hundred anigram predestly rrange opt to take lodose to stostrone anyway my understanding is that a there beens a new out of movements in this area toward for instance not doing big alarge doses in injected infrequently but rather low doseis quite frequently ovously prescribed by a dotor monor by a doctor et cetera im is that generally what you to see in your patience if they are going to take this rout if there a hypoganatlpatient whose benefits outweigh risks of tart then you want to have a nice even steady state it is notking to be exactly the same as producing pulsitile to ststrone release indogionously from your own body when you have a steady state you do not have a peker a troth ndwhen yu have a pek that is when the anrgen receptrgene is overactive that is when you get more erithropoetson or epo release and that leads to a lot of the side effects of thick blood higher hemoglobans an hematocrates and then a when you have a crash you do not feel it is a definitely not optimal there is a lot of ways to get around this when you are doing testostrone replacement if you are someone that needs it you can have different types of esters or you could do topical to stostrone the ester is basically something that is attached to increase the biological laff life e most commonones are sipian and anthate there is also ever short acting proprianate which has almost no clenical relevants there is also very long acting ones to cantowate an undecaniweight and different mixtures of all of us if you are some one who has a very very low es h b g you are gong to have trouble of regulating your cyrum testostrone in the long run h if you do it topically in the testostrone is absorbed hopefully bound to s h b g and then a lot of times you reapply twie daly or once daily but you have lots of variatiens for most people specially for people who cant absorb it well that is not cin to be a great option injections would be preferred most people and up injecting because they have either side effects from too high too low or ts too much of a very dose when they do topical there is also a capsal with a special lemphatic absorption it is not being absorbed through the liver 's not epatically metabolize but it is absorbed through the limph and it is essentially testostrone undecanoweight and then put into a capsil that is taken twi statwly has fairly steady half lifes but you have to take it at specific times day a that bean said an it it is new enough to where there is not a huge amount of data on it but it is f tie approved it is it is brandname now scallgutenzo but a the injectables in general the lower ur esh b g the longer of an estr you want because when you inject it a whether its intrmuscular subutaneous justocked here doctor about the risks in the benefits of those subcutaneous has slightly longer act of half life because the asteraces take a longer to reach that sipianae or an ant the estric cleave it most men a lo people ask me about what a usual dose is a for most people it would be a total of about one hundred to one twenty per week for an octual replacement dose melegrams melegrams one twenty to one hundred melegrams per week administer two to three times per week and you are not you sink dividing that into two or three right as i'm sure ther lunch we lost the or thinting o ou hundred three times a week which is ashly quite hih dose yet there there really does seem to be a shift in a toward am spreading these a dosages out into youdividing them into two or three a smaller doses and then am along those lines a five ten years ago it was common to hereabout inhibiting estrogen through a romatases in hibiters nowadays you hear and i think it is a true at least by my read of the literature that that inhibiting astrogen can distrupt rain function can cause connective tissue issues and even can cause am reductions in lebido a lot of a people think that estrogen if they you crash esgen that basicllybedo goes ut but actually the opposite is oftenter you do not want estrogen too high or too low is that corrects and for that reason am do you a shy away from people taking a romantases in hibitors ya a very few people truly needa romatases in hibiter there is almost always life style in or adventions it can just depend on which gen how active your romataste gen is some peoples are imitaste gene is very active lot of times these individuals have a pupital kind o comasia which is a breast tissue growth in mals even to spite no other risk factor even even if they are lean a some people eet it if they are lean i remember growing else there were a few kids that got a mild cases of gon o comascy that were transient the sort they develop grand comastia and then went away often it is you no lateral on one side tun growth ormon aut a times is the a fuel to that fire o interesting aye there were couplikids aning that they took some teasing cas back then it there was not on line discussions about horins and things that but then t it would seem transient and they were the the people on thingng of were actually lean individual they they were not over wait which of course can cause coni comast ia because a atipos fat tissue can convert to stosteron into astrogen am it sounds except in special cases that a afvoiding a romataste in hibitors probably going to be a good idea there ise several other ways that you can control your estrogen and keep it at a healthy level which you do af the chack there is a lot of patiente to assure me that there estrogensto going to be sky high and it is actually very low and vice firsa but a cawsem eglue crate is a supplement that can help with estrogen control what is a typical dosage of calsum du glucrit five hundred to one thousand melograms but is there the risk that if some one's esterogen is in normal range and they take the supplement that there esterogen will go too low is it that potent it is not that potent it is not nearest potent is in a romatastean hibiter it helps with excretion and also the sensitivity of the estrogen reseptor itself i cannot helps out compete it im some people also take dim or a different cruciferous vegetable a the gim from cruciferous vegetables cale but a or brochly and that is both an anti estrogen and an anti androgen if you are on t ar t and you are on that than you are probably just on too much tar t i remember a few years ago iad o friend and at truly this is a risnoleg i had of i have a friend am because i'm very cautious about which supplements i take i think pe'l might get the impression that i'm very cavalier about this but i'm not i always altor one thing at a time i talk to physicians i i what i suggest other people do actually do an have done for a long periad of time and i recall am a wanting to take dim cause i thought witl you back then you hear oka reduce estergen mig estergen levels were not out of range they were fime bt i thougt well what what would the experience be of bringing those down but some one i know iit is quite informed in the sareos at yet exactly what you said which is that dim can reduce esterogen but also tostostrones i just never opted to try and take it a i do want it were ser arring in this direction but we went straight from the six pillars to t r t or to what some people now call sports t r t which is basically cod language for saying taking exogenius testostrone even though one does not need it to get into a semi superphysiological range or a am i end am nine hundred to a thousand anigram predesoleader range and people always point out i i should mention that oh well in certain countries the high and range is twelve hundred nanigrams per des leader in the you ass it is nine hundred and if you are twelve hundred are you really superphysiological all that aside a i neglected to ask about that gap in between where individuals could think about supplementation meaning non prescription approaches to increasing testostrone and here we should probably also talk about things is it true that ice baths increase estastrone or not am listyle factors that go beyond the six pillars for increasing testostrone if you cod comment on those thatwould be terrific supplements that are useful and i be wonderful a if you can mention were some of these same practices and supplements might be useful for women as well as men to increase testostrone for all the reasons we talk about earlier ye this is where a true individualized proach comes in when you are talking about what dose of t rt you should be on one thing to keep in mind is the law of diminishing returns a quality of life is a subjective thing and it is different for each person some people are more willing to give up a a little bit of athleticism or body composition some people are more willing to give up or not willing to give up labedo or secual health and as we mentioned earlier everybody's androgen receptor is less or more sensitive you can make a case that if somebody is androgen receptor is half as sensitive as somebody else the ont the person with the less sensitive receptr does need a level of one thousand or twelve hundren there is no great weight to know that and you can alter the sensitivity for androgen receptor ar things ell carnatine and to dalifelas mention will defling come back to ell carnatine because i'm a really entrete by the daton al carnatine both for women and men in terms of eg quality sperm quality frtility and a bunch of other interesting effects will come back to l carnatine but a lot of how you feel the bile feet back or subjective i feel this comes from the ratio of your androgen's to your estrogens and a lot of that is life style some one's also on h c g that coun upregulae a romatase as well n g ow you might want to at it human a coryonic ganatatropen a found used to be found in pregn it still found impregnant women still founded are useto be a conbeliever not there was a black market for pregnant women's urein a before it wuld the stuff was develop synthetically another is what we are saying as a men tipically would buy pregnant women's ourein yes through a black markets in order to get the h c g in order to get the testosteron enhancing effects of h c g another words men were using pregnant women's ourein phrase i do not want to know how they i got into their body lass just skip to what you were going to say acts instead e a that is h c g a there is a lot of other things upregulate estrogen alcohol significantly increases a romatise if your very sensitive to estrogen than you probably should not even consume the two glasses three times a week a high fat meals also apregular romatise if you are on a kutogenic diet but you have hi per estrogenism then you should take care without as well all kinds of fats are just saturated fats i'm not sure if it is just saturated fats but fat definitely increases a both fat in your body and consumption of a high amount of calories increases of romaties that it is the racio of testosteron estrin and o want to break your flow but that but since we are talking about fat i have to ast since estrogen and testosteron are both synthasized from the colesteral molecule i've heard that in gesting some amount of saturated fat can be useful because of the way that collester all can i serve as a precursor to these molecules now i once said on a pod cast that i butter much i occasionally eat pats of butter somehow that ot a misinterpreted to mean that i eatentire many pats of buttelit one or two pats of butter he ere and i have no guilt or shame about my bloodlipits are in great shape also i'm feel good but am is it possible that people who are injesting too little of saturated fats could a directly or indirectly reduce or somehow distrup the propar ratio of tostostrone to esterogen in men and women it is theoretically possible but it probably desn't happen in developed countries just its theoretically possible to have not enough i'll make a six fatiasits but that probably does not happen in developed countries i do not need the butter pats but omoi to do it anyway i'm just curious a o g grassfed butter has good 'll make a three content as well a grassfed foods in general it is not the ind i'll be all and everybody does not need gras fed foods but they are one of the only sources of healthy trans fat a naturally occurring transfat comes from ruminants ruminantsi think of a cows and a the the rumination in the different stomachs can change your i'll make a three and 'll make a six to trands lenolinic and trans linalaic fatty asits which are healthy for eso it it is actually i'll ake a threes on 'll make a sixis that just happened to have a trans instead of a sis isomer a and these healthy a transfats would be found in am ruminant cheys and milk and butter from ruminance and an woregof meats and the meats yes and for people ore fallowing a purely plant base diet were s wore mostly plant base diet are they at risk of not getting enough of certain types of fats rother nutriance to maintain that healthy ratio of tostostrone to estergen were not if there vegetarian they are probably non at risk if they are vigan they very well could be at risk most vigans are aware of this a very acutely and they will supplement with a algy or tho supplement with other sources of a healthy fats i see thet take away that i'm 'm drawing from this is that less than getting saturated fat it is key to get these healthy transfats from a ruminance is am or the food products of those ruminance as well as am to get proper a amounts of o maga threes and'l to be clear you do not need any transfats it just happens that those wh'll make a threes ond 'll make a sixis are in a trans isomer i see kess o that is nutrition what other supplements can support healthy tostostrone to esterogen ratiosanything that alters a rumatase can support healthy tostostron to estergon and ha youre testostrone to estrogen ratio think about it as how much estrogen activity do you have at the bata estrodyle or septer and your alfa estrodyle or septer how would i know that a it it is hard to tell but depenion on what you are eating if you have a lot of plant bas stiets or polly fenales many of these are bata estrodyle receptors people know about trcasterone and also batea ecti sterrone which are too ecti steroits that are bata estrodyle receptor agonis thet activate the batea estrodyle receptr if you have a very low mon of estrogen naturally you are probably a better candid for for taking to ta trcasteroner iter emty sir i've never tried then but i know a my understanding is that they work tremendously well for some people and not at all for others and one das simply has to try but in am in promoting the activity of this reestrogen receptor is there a risk that tircesteroner ectos teir own could cause some of the a cordint problems associated with increasing estrogen activity mit reduced libido water attentian am water water attention yes reduce labido probably not a closing growthplates in the bone no because that is the alfa estrodyle receptr i've talked before on a couple of podcasts about am tonga ali ina mich is this indonegion erb i gessis also a men amade an found in malatia but it seems to be the indonesion a variety of tonga ali that is most effective or potentially for reducing sexfor morning binding globulant an there by freeing up testostrone am whether not the effects are through that pathway through another pathway a lot of people report improvements in things libido and maybe a a androgen a fina types right feeling more vital et cetera and of course some of that coul be plucibo correct m but what are your thoughts on tonga ali an please challenge my statements about tonga ali if they are in correct amd i'm not looking for validation here i just really one to know what your thoughts are on it o you ever a recommend it to patience a when a men women one or the other ya tong cat ali or long jack it has multiple mechanisms of action and there have been several a placibo controlled studies on it some of them show decrease in ess age bg at least one of them did not show any change in ess bg however it is it does act on a romatase very weakly probably not strongly that you would have to be concerned of hipo estrogenism it iing it reduces a romataste and thereby can reduce estrgen correct it is also a weak it is not a serm it is not a select of estrogen receptr modifier but it is probably a weak it is probly er as well or a non select of estrogen receptra modifier and that should help with decreasing negative feed back inhibition of estrodyle in various locations and also increasing tostosteron you have the dosage that i've been using for years now is a it is four hundred melegrams taken once a day am typically early in the day cause it can con have a mild stimulan in fact very mild am and i know that some of the products out there recommend dosages that are much higher an come i've taken more than four hundred i do not feel very good i do not know whad to described a the it is a l over stimulatory in terms of they s me kind of am it is dring in too much coffee am that is that is interesting and would women ever wane to take tona aly for any reason ye absolutely there is a lot of women that have hyper estrogenism and unlike a drenal fatigue or andrapasers actually iced ten cots for hyper estrogenism i see t ten cots ya doctor sp i o there is codes to were your doctor can actually diagnosyo with something if you go to your doctor and you say i have a drenal fatigue they cannot dignosyo with that or if you say i have andropaustay also cant diagnosyo with that a but if you say you have hyper estrogenism the most common complaint that comes with it is indometriosis which is overgrowth of the lyning of the uteris and a those people copetentially i think that is one a area where we might see ton cat supplementation more and more because not only does a decrease a romataste lyke we mention tostostrone of females is higher than estrogen an femalesm lot o females get estrogen from a romanization as well a periferal estrogenis sometimes what we call it becuse it is not directly produced in the overis but they could be good candidates for tn cat if that is the case very interesting in it and my understanding is that people should be looking for sources of indonesian tonaaly in particular correctsanother interesting application is essentially a i'll call it a pie c t but essentially what es is piec t mens hu tefinis post cycl therapy physicians love acronam sins is leta ins military love acrnems for weya yes is h pos cycle therrses to be p people coming off wone monthera yy r sterards this would actually be for women that are comming off of their birth control pill ah because perhaps tay can help lower that sh b g back toe normal which is sometimes persistently elevated and thn tit can help prevent the subsequent hyper estrogenism that happens tes tonga aly need to be cycled when i first start taking it i would cyclit i would do fou the three formonths and i would take some time off now just been taking it continuously for years iand my and i should say i do blood work to check my liverans imes and everythingales in it you now i do not see any reason to te sfor me to cease taking it ye probably not there is been human studies on both ton cat and fidosia and full disclosur i did help design derics new testostron optimisation supplement which has both fidosia arrestress and also ton cat ali in it yet let us talk about fidogia separately in a moment but if let us say some one is only taking tona ali for whatever reason but do they need to cycle off likely not but i would just to be safe because it does both effect your romataste and it is an estog estrogen receptor modifier and an what what would be a reasonables a cycle off how long to takin how long to to stop before taking again ya m there is a couple different protocalls that you can do but eleven months on one month off for tom cat is pretty reasonable a thisnit i guess us is we will talk about this late or to but if it is combined with fidosia the protocal t at i would do is three weeks on one week off tat's tonga ali but i'm curious what your thoughts are on fidogia agrestus this nigerian shrub were this a extract from nigerian shrubs that at least in my experience in my read of the literature has the potential to increase testostron and probably other hormons as well by way of increasing lutinizing hormon something that we have not really talked about much up until now what are your thoughts about fidogiagrestus whatever your ideas about the proposed mechanism or mechanisms and where might this be useful for people on were off ormone replacemen therapy ya fidogia agrestus has just reached a point where we have enough evidence to we know it probably helps both with luinizing hormo release which stimulates late excells in the testis to produce more testostrone and probably with aell age receptor sensitivity as well which is good combination of the two am it does come from the nigerian shrub but am there is not quite enough evidence for me to be able to say it is safe for somebody to take this all the time which again poldestro disclosure that is why i recommended that we a recommended for people too cycle this supplement three weeks on one week off that is likely safe the only toxicitys studies a in general are in rats and inhumans it looks quite safe munderstaing is that the toxicity a studies in rats showed atoxasy to the testicularselves amthat certainly concerning but that the dosages that were used am or translating the dosages use to humans am would lead to a situation where the dosages that humans would have to take would be very very large that the amount of a i no longer take fidogia but i i took it at six hundred melograms per day for a long time and i cease taking it because am i was experimenting with other things and i did not want confound am those things a not because i i had any negutive scign of facts if thact i was mandering blood work and and other by biological prameters that would would have told me if those testicular toxicity and there does not lhat's put it that way te i think it is extremely say and a i'm i'm just not convinced that there is enough overwhelming evidence for long term consistend a administration a do you recommend this to people who are not taking to yarty and do you recommend to men and women ya if you have a really high elage han there probably a gonatl issue whether it is hea damage the testes a vericaseal am a history of testacular cancer your elhis a get to be higher of your elhis already very high increasing it even moreis probably not can help however if your lh is low than i'llways you'e ho to find out if is it low is it deficient or is it just a little bit low if it is low and you do not have an issue with proloct an you do have an issue with a op you wuld receptor antagonism now tracson can actually potentially help antagonize that to increase elh is well especially in people recovering from am opiit sir likely eve an alcohol you are looking for a sub clenical secondary hypogananism which is essentially just think of that is low ell ah in people with that lower elh and their estrogen is fine and their proloactin is fine thand fedogia is a particularly good option interesting three weeks on one week off for a for six hundred melegrams fidogia a four hundred melegrams tongaily indinesian tonga aly am could potentially be begoodn of course everyone shouldalways check with their physicion clear this do blood work et cetera i would say we do not ju say that to protect thas we say that protect you am meaning that the the consumer am it is very very important a you do wanto git a you dont wat a fly blind with any o the tuff you want to do blood work right that is the cast twenty to with supplements is most of them are saffor then medications but the only difference between them and a medication is once prescribed and once's not and oftentimes with supplements it is un clear weather not what is listed on the bottles what is in the bottle but am but i think there are a number of reputable brands now am the a the other sepplemen i won talk about interms of testosteron augmentation is bore on a what is bore on thought to do does it actually do that and a do ever recommend bore on y bore on is actually in element and you can find ot on the periodic table it is more plentiful and rich soils frequent farming can deplete the soils of bore on it is very plentiful inthe mediterranearea grease and turkey lot of people will just e dates or raisins that are grown there vher an tell me people e dir a there are people who there are people who e ternd thre's a a phenomenon a called pite right where people am in a and that is not a good thing they they often asson iron deficiency and okta but there ther're eating grapes and dates that were grown in soil that has high amounts of bore on is a e bor on can help regulate s h b g but it is effect is mostly acute it is unlikely to have a bad effect lot of people take bore on because it is probably not can a hurt and a it will lower s h b g even if it is for a short period of time i guesse you make a case that maybe cycling bore on can help too what sorts of dosages are are useful for bore on supplementation three to six melegrams once to twice at o interesting that is higher than the amounts tat a ivum an take it i belong in doing this cocktail of af a tongaali again i stop taking fidogi but a for a long time with fidogia and and bore on i think it was two to formiligrams perday but maybe i could for to go hire although my blood work is where i wanted ly sir circling back to fidogia fidogia was at tractive to me as a supplement because i saw increases in l h testostron and free test osterone my estrogen st in chck but i also did not c down regulation of l h when i would cycle off im whereas with h c g human cortionic canatrop in which am does now arrive in am i informs not from pregnant woman's eurin only but ta centhetic forms at people in jeck that as i understand it cana suppress hormon ou indogion is wormone output if one takes it for a long periot of time why would a man or woman want to take h c g and what are the potential risks and benefits of taking h c g as h c or human corionic can atatropen ois actually very similar to t s h siroid simulating hormo correct awhen a woman is pregnant she produces more h c g especially in the first trymaster when you take a pregnanc test whether it is qualitative for quanitative you s the h c g rise and it actually doubles every forty eight hours a if your five weeks pregnat you have me to h c level and n two days later five weeks in two days you can s r h c g and maybe it went from five hundred to a thousand precipitously increases it does a few things one thing is it pervents hypothieratism or hypothroxinemia of pregnanc which is one of the most common causes of miss carriage it is also why if you are a if you have hypothiratism and you get pregnant in the first trymesture you woun o increase your dose from twenty five to forty per cent to keep your free t four high as much as possible it the reason whly you have to do that a supposed to somebody who does not have hypothiratism is if you have hypothiratism than likely your thiroid will not respond to either t s h or h c g thet increased h c does not compensate for that if you take h c g then it campotentially improved your thiroid function that along with cylinium are likely the two best things that you can do for thiroid health h c g and cylinium by defily a make sure i gon enough cylinium by eating m three to five brazil nuts per day i very much enjoy the taste of also a who should take it h c g and can h c g suppress one's normal ludinizing hormone output itsuppresses l h in a dose dependent manner the higher the dose of h c g ou take the more it suppresses el h a commondose for fertility fertility is usually why h c g is prescribed in men or women in both is ten thousand i s all at one time which is quite a bit that is a tremendous dose in fact some formulation some brandnames of h c g come in autoonjector pins to where you cannot even dose slower than five thousand units at a time well ybu but i know a number of people who take h c g to maintain tosticular function while on tostosteron therap or augmentation of some sort does it does it work to do that ye a some people are on h c g monaltherap it can be slightly better on your lipeds then bin on t r t hostof people are using h c g alone as a kind of a neither sort of a hormonagment indirect hormonaghation some clinecs advertise it as a a non suppressive alternative to t r t but it is suppressive ofa h but it could also increase astersan pretty potently and is it true that increasing ell h a and or h c g can improve sensitivit of the generals and is that true for men and women ey i've heard this anecdotally people say h c g makes am secual activity more pleasurable for people because of a some is it a direct effect on on some of the nerve sells in in the generals y el hes also a an agonist in the prostte an ingenital tissue in general it is a very common a treatment for post fanasterides cendrom or post five alforaductase when you have block to the conversion of d h t for a long time it helps r upregul d h t some one whas been taking fanasterad to prevent hair loss comes off it feels mamay because they felt lausy but then feels even lausier for reasons he talked about earlier and then they might use h c g as a transition treatment to am transition back to normal a on one helth is er it is extremely helpful in many cases now when you come off h g g than you to have a strateg of hawto returned here normal as fast as possible as well but it will upregulate those five alfraduoct sin times you have in your genitle skin both scrubdleskin and p nile skin an paraneum in general you have a i believe it is called stratamolucidum it is a skin layer that is very very thin but it has the highest concentration of five alforaductase you have a lot of activity and after you have been on something that inhibits the in zim the five a areins i 'm in those tissues then you do something else to upregulate those inzimes whether it is waiting in taking time whether it is trying to dafill whether it is trying creating even or whether it is trying o h c g a loltimes those of the go ts for postfanastrade inro any risks for women taking h c g am on their ability get pregnant or am or ris generally e a ovicitoll make any pregnanc test p litive that is risk that some women do not know one could in theory fake oppregnancy test by injecting esigy absolutely interested am i've kno a monivation to do that iuscurous am what about a prolachton t a the simple version of this that i was taught because i was taught mainly from the narrow endicran perspective was oukno dopamin is a kind of close cousin of testosteron and also estrogen for that matter a drives a peditive behaviors including a pursuit of secual partner sex itself a motivated behaviors generally then am postcopulatory a postorogasmic a a states are a company by a prolactin increase thats the refractory period for mading an males maybeven in females as well am involved in milk glet down at cetera what are sort of thet the general contours of a sindrums or things that people could a be on the look out for of having too much prolactin or too little prolactin and i i'm aware of a number of people who take a dopaming agonists all tiracing capergoline things of that to really booster a dopaming levels and that it is not always a good thing as it turns out ovenized people become cand of hyperodopam an urgic and they have the drive to do all these a peditive things ounog fill in the blanks am but they do not always a have the ability because it seems just as testosteron an estrogen need to be in the proper ratios dopaming in prolactin need to be in the appropriate ratioes what what howshal we to thing about a and perhaps act on our prolachtan systems absolutely the way i describe it is the dopamine wavepool if youre increasein your dupi min too much yicen overflow and hn you can have that wave crash too much see on t have nice even waves that are not going too far above the pool of dopamine and prolachton will follow prolacted an estrogen or quite close cousins estrogen apregulates a gene call the por relgine or prolachtingine that directly increases prolactan synthesis prolacton is going to a also in hibit the release of testastrode from the patuitary if you'r using a dopamin agonist then you are going to help decrease the prolachtand producing cells including if you ave a prolac and producing my coratnoba in the patuitary how common er those because i having i hear a lot about these a hypoganat ism or and of course that can be due to an issue at the testacles or i am hyproganizm a could also be of course in elic aoverarian syndrums and then there is of course the brainside of it where the signals are not coming from the rain you'r not enough a ganatitrop an not enough ludinizing hormone nd their ways of teasing this apart through with an entercronologist that are quite elegant in fact right use stimulating hormos too much to dive into here but how often does one actually have one of these petuitary tomers am i have purred a that people that play lot of high contact sport boxing ut ball people that head headed the sacrball quite a lot am sadly a people whose jobs force them to take head blows a for cold be militari an they were firing ou know fifty calber guns and the kond of woodpeckering of the brain inside of the skull am and construction workers were just a concustion can cause the petuitary to go mout functional is that really common or's this something that is is a rare wike one per cent ye it is extremely common it is another mon those conditions were a lot of people never know they have it they just feel little bit more fatigue they have that high prolactan feeling all the time put tuitary macaradnomas can be non producing as well your prolacing can be totally normal your growth ormon an ideaf one can be totaly normal lhet's the second most common producing mycaradnomis growthormon causing neither acromagaly which is growth of cartlege or gigantism this is the the bigbraw ye those are fairly common a causes of adnomas but a lot of people that have a very small a adnoma much less than once in a meater it is hard to see on imaging even if you have a contrast that specifically looks at the patuitary and many people are not symptomatic a it is one of those things along with picioess and predivetis that are much more frequent when it comes to prevalence which is the amount a the percentage of people that have it the general population i'm glad you mention the dopeming way wool i know nowadays a there is a lot of interest in augmenting dopeming a i know but number people to do this prescription drugs a at ar all riddland madafphanil and those drugs of course hit many transmenter systems but dopaming a certainly invall people taking a ente depressons whale butron t' happen to that system and of course people are trying to in hibit prolactan and promote seritone and a reduced her tone and to me it all seems a very delicate dance right i mean to just imagine the arousal ark of for maining behavior for sexual reproduction is such an in in elaborate dance between sympathetic drive and paris sympathetic drive even with across the span a minutes rit om enove talked about this before the podcasset the arousal is kind of more pari sympathetic am orgasm and a itself is is a sympathetic respons at completely different set of norans and where do you see people getting into trouble just trying to hit the gas petal on dopeaming and where do you think there is a place for people who perhaps oure experiencing low drive and motiv ation not just sectual but in general am to increase the amount of dopemine circulating in their brain enbody how doyout howd you thnk about that given this wavepool analogy ye it is importance a parset out and start with the least powerful interventions some one's concerned about topemin or may be they have a slightly higher prolacton than they eliminate things that could be increasing that prolacton a asian or gluton which are mu opioid receptor agonists or any yu opioid receptor agonist an te gut casine milk proting correc can increase prolacton correct interesting in addition to that they should a if they need a patuitarium or and they hould get ap tuitarim ori if they do not have an adnoma or if they do not have a high enough prolaced in level to where they need it im ari a if there haveen visual symptoms or thor having a ull factory symptoms with the nose than it is more likely than they do that they do but a if they do not a lot of times a prolaced an under about forty is not too big of a deal they can take dopeming agonists that agonize that d to receptor p five p which is essentially videm an be six it is puridoxine five pirophosophy and puridoxine is videm an be six that can help fifty melegrams once to twice a day avide em an e can also help especially if it is mixed to cofer alls a lot of people have the a high levels of a vide em any but low levels of the gama form avieemany that can also help a fastening i'm glad you mention vieim an be six and a p five p am i have heard that one can shorten the refractory period after am after orgasm to sentualy to be able to a have sex again and to be quite direct about it by a by way of vide em an be six am blunting of the prolactin response which turns out to be quite potent am but i've also heard that vitim an be six can be narotoxic is specially in in the prifery that can case priferal naropathies if it is taken idosis but that p five p is the safe for form is that true it is pre activated it does not build up think of it as a allegory to how a follate can build up it is not a methel ful late but it builds ap a and it can increase levels of homosistine or if you have too much vidim an be twelve another water soluble b videm an you can have too much methelmalonicasidor immima depenion on what your insimatic conversionist to the active formof the insime often it is just safer to take the activ formo the insime re very interesting o kat well at risk of going down every hormonal pathway and talking about am supplementation lasstoll factors i think touching on t as we have to stosteron and estergen and ow prolactin i'd love to a chap lobit about el carnatine we talked about this earlier and but i want a raise this discussion about ell carnatine not in the contets of our carnatine itself but in the context of fertility because my read of the literature is that el carnatine can be very beneficial for enhancing sperm quality and egg quality and even rates of conception m what forms does ell carnatine come in that people can reasonably am consider again doctor your docter poks am what is it doing and do we know how it is doing it and dou often use this in your patience ye the way i think about el carnatine and i'll try to tie thi sin with creatine and other things as well is if your sell is an energy factory or car thind el carnatine is the shuttle that helps get the fuel into the motor to use the motor the motor is mostly due to livestyle factors your diet in your exercise and the type of fuel itself is in a dplus we don' eed to get into ina d precursors or inamen or and ar anything and then the excessory fueltank is your creatine phosphate creatine is your accessory fuel tank your in a d status which is largely determined by your rimsleep in qualitys sleep an exercise along with supplementation is the fuel the carnatine shuttle is a carnatine palmatil coinsi may and net takes medium chain fadiacids it takes different molecules of fat ye too many energy sources other than keetones y of your glucos or carbs if your fat or faddy acits net takes at a cross the layer of the motacondrio that it can be utilized upregulates that that is why it things that have flegella in general the flegella argona work better lixeerm flegellaping anything a sort of thoug the wavy little tendrsorn seltipes t i which away there everywhere ight in the got too e those are gingto work significantly better and in general your mota condriorgan work better the worst your mota conriar off the bat the better they are going to be helped by the shttle that shuttles them across the it also slightly increases the dincity of the andergen receptor as well is that a local fact if in el carnties injectin to particular muscle will increase the dens of androgen receptors in that muscle likely howare people taking el carnatine their capsul forms in their injectable forms most peopleirin it be taking the capsel forms because that is all ther gan have access to and then we should also ask can you get al carnatine from food ye el carnatine is just the commination of it is actually a very small peptide gludithion is just a three of menoacids el carnatine is the smallest peptide too peptide is just a protineha has a menoacids between two and about two hundred and a el carnatine is just twomeno asit ansing sos a ma micro peptide ye your body senphesizes enough it likes to absorb the amenoacids by themselves and inifit puts them together there makes ell carnatine it is not very bile available if you take it lhate people take el carnatine al tar trate or aselel carnatine and that is about ten percent bile available if you want one graham or a thousand melegrams of el carnatine you can take ten grahams of oral el carnatine is it is the one graham the typical duse you recommend one gran per day for fertility and andergen receptor upregulation that mens tanking ten grahams of the capsul form e that is about fiftine to twenty capsls andwjjus a lot that is a lot you can also potentially increase t mao yei wont to ask about that because t a may o on your bloodchart is that is when that is elevated that scan a cosom concern a you taught me a trick however that one can take six hundred meligrams of garlic capsl afor the alison is aliscal alison is the name alison but with two els oh k u and that had a remarkable effect in reducing t amao that is quite put in also reand they was it just coincidence that it really brought my eldell down as well i am not sure if the eldio is a coincidence but depenion on your gut microbio or your micro bioda some microbio a beneficial bacteria will convert a carnatine and also coaling any coaling precurser alphag p c or phosphos il sering they will convert them more or less te tmao t mayow somethng you can get measured in a blood test and see if i's high or low some people might not not even eed alison ntrne people do benefit from i interesting although it i think i think it was you that also told me that that alison an garlic can have postive effects on un a carty of ascular tone an blood flow generally is that right oki may be its six hundred meligrams garlic and excessive of a excessive amountic and i just eat garlic you must i mo eating garlic ocase o one could also just eat garlic u if one were going to take a elcarntin in injectable form how much of that is by available a hundred persent if you injecto yit is in aquious solution it is a bacterio static water essentially it is not in a carrier oil it reallish it is gan a burn a lot if you inject it subcutaneously its can be absorbed faster and more evenly and also just hurt o less if you inject it into a muscle but one could then just take one one graham per day injected ore divided up into a couple though or five hundred the minimly efficacious dose for injectables probably round two hundred when it comes to spern motility t androgen receptor upregulation it really depends on why you are taking it terms of fertility and in terms of blood test generally y i always say that a if possible am either by way of insurance or by way of sa some other way affording it it it would be great for people to have blood tests to know what their hormone levels and other levels of other things metabolic markyrs and lipits were in their twenties also in their thirities also in their forties i think there is this idea that you only take a blood tests when you have a problem but then of course you one cannot actually do the comparison that you mentioned earlier or stakte the comparison to one's physician that things are changing over time and it it seems to me that esily everyone should get at least a loncs a year blood test is there the hope that insurance will will some day just cover it for everybody this would be standard care i would think that everybody should know what sorts of things are floating around in the blood stream in what they nean more of and less of in life i doubt it will ever be covered by insurance in many cases you can make an argument that it is indicated as insurance begins to cover more of the population for pathologies the a things f says your h says your care credit will likely cover this advanced testing which bece it is continues to come down and down in price it will be a fordable but it will be free ot it i'd to shift years slightly and and talk about social interactions and relational effects on hormones something i just find fascinating we touch on the sylobit earlier with in terms of oral contraception but i'm now that we have the back drop of what these various hormones do some involvemin and oro transmitter systems dopemean and pom prolacting associated pathways proliction course being hormon noted nor transmitter but that there is a phenomenon a in human beings quare people get very excited about a new partner and that excitement no doubt is related to the dopeing system among other systems and that excitement can be maintained or can wan over time and here i'm talking about attraction but i'm also talking about just general excitement in the sense of novelty because that is what dopameans associated with given that a europe you work with human beings and they have lifes lives and relationships and life styles and they have hormones and and all these things interact what are some of the ways that we could think about adjusting our relationships in order to optimize hormones a supposed to just thinking about hawt it optimize hormones forsake of our relationship because it is by directional of course im and this assumes i should say that one is already paying attention to the six pillars talked about earlier is doing that people doing most things right am how shall we think about relationships and hormons friendships romantic relationships new partners longterm partners yow how do you think about this kind of stuff ye if you have a new partner than it is largely regulated by the dupomanurgic system which changes over time people may have heard the saying that you have to go through a full calender year with some one that you are in a relationship tht very good advice pilethat you really know i what to do in what not to do but because they you experience both of your families in the holidays an all the ifferent situations but i would argou until you have a moved in together had a baby and then rage that baby a preferably breastfeeding because that is when you get the prolactan spikes you do not you an't really gone through every stage in life yet now you cannot really do that with every person at youare considering well some people do but it ni be quite a costlying terms of time and finances and emotionally costly a a in the hear of deffling out referring to any personal experience of having done all that many times over but what would you suggest people a do or think about as they enter relationship or it for people that are in long tern relationships where they feel something at shifted and indeed those shifts may reflect the output of different hormont systems and nurro transmenter sise they almost certainly has to be the case right a just a women who spend a lot of time together whether their co workers ar whatever a lot of times there menti minstrel cycles will aline there is a lot of farimonal and hormonal cross talk including prolacton between men and women spending a hundred per cent of the time together this is why people think it is hard to work together and live together there around each other twenty four seven you do not have their reprieve where you let that do not mean settle down and then you are excited when you see them again a alotig ies know that if they have gone on a a hunting trip or if they gon a trip for a long time they come back and they see their partner an it is a new r not quite a new relationship but almost a new relationship they have that excitement again and purposely building that into every relationship can help significantly especially if you choose to have a child there get pregnet or be press feeding because you just plan ahead for both of your prolactans to be high and both of your dopameans to below and both of your testostrons to below a there is a there is a lot of planning that you can do essentially every relationship goes through a a crisis and that crisis is personal between a the two of you and you can plan ahead and figure out a way maybe it is not supplementation maybe it is not even a the amount of time you spend away from each other but plan ahead to have good times if you are about to go into a crisis god and it sounds time apart and time together which is actually built into a number of cultures where man and women will will purposeuly avoid each other for some period of time avoid physical touch and made in proximity and then will re convene and yet those are very stable relationships over time often am is the inverse also true am for instance for people that are in long distance relationships am where they are only seeing each other three or four days a week or two days a week am does this explain the fact that a some of those relationships can gone for a very long period of time without ever actually entering the am thet's calld the hyperprolactin phase of actually moving in together and et cetera et cetera in other words is that a a a way in which people are a spiking and troughing dopenming that keeps them attached this kind of elusive a a puthis sort of what is it called i thing it iscalled a cats string if you play with a cat and you move the string away they will keep reaching but you throw the string on the ground the they are tolly uninterested in it is that that what is going on cos that is a doplemen ergent phenomenon the catstring example we know o this experimentally in those cases the relationship has not really progresse in many of those cases past the dopen mean spike the fun initial stage honeymood stage what every one call it it is almost kind alike a rumae if you are looking fer remade if it was for college or after college or whatever you can fill out forms and look for common interests but until you are actually together a significant proportion of the time you are not reallyng to nowgh yerig in a be compatible aon and is there am a evidence that the appearance of of an infant change is obviously tat there can be hormorna shifts a we know actually it that for ain both women and in men there is a prolacting increase a when one when couples are expecting a child a this is the it is lmost a brooding phenomenon you see this in birds where it is called actually calls called brooding and it is caused by prolacting increase but turns out this also occurs in humans and ah some peopled argue this causes tha the dad bod phenomenon tos it actually prolactions volve in laying down a body fat preparing for sleepless nights and presumebly that spiking prolacting is theyare also to suppress sexual activity because there are periods of time immediately a nere child birst a were i'm secual activity is not advantageous a you see a prolactan spike right after breast feeding you think about it often when you have an infant a you will breast feed put the infant to bed and then immediately go to bed with your partner which is not particularly conducive it is almost trying to have intercourse back to back and that is very difficbecause of inin the prolactin sense y lods open ming high prolacton oxytosen is also increased significantly to help with milklot down as well a yeas far as brooding there is definitely a a human equivalent of brooding a some humans call it nesting instinct which is both helpful but it is a it is not necessarily a bad change in in relationship it is just a change and as long as that it is coming here nid you better with it just any medication aif you are aware of the side effect and that it might happen than when it happens it is not only aless severe it also happens less often very interestyutelipation was a nurou cientists come from the frame work that of course hormon's impact perception and behavior but perception and behavior also in back mormonths i fiund this fastening also really the example you gave of am people taking time apart but also these affiliative bonds that are m non romantic bonds can servace kind of a a reservoir to replenish dope o ming am that is then released upon ix bearance going back to one's partner or some sort of regular feature of home m very interesting and of course is i should exist on both sides onm guessing that a a from both the mailside and female side that there is an interest in kind of separation in reun mian as it is the theme and i gess the frequency will vary for different different couples indifferent situations ye and i doft wan to make it seem prolachton is all bad prolachton does help with a nesting instinct it helps with brest feeding is well a lot of women our dagnosts with ludial pace defects which is basically the fayes after ovulation but before a period or giving birth the pregnancy's kind of a prolonged ludial face and a lot of them will go on progesterone for this prgesteron can also decrease prolochton and prolachton is also helpful for them maturity of lungs and infant it helps the spinga mile in tolechothan ratio it can decree if you if your prolactins too low through pregnancy at spikes a very high during pregnancy then it can lead to increased risk of a respirtory distress of the newwarm the interesting yes we did we certainly do not wat a pain a picture where prolactin is the bad bad warm on to avoid it is it is a without prolactin none of us would be here course am it is vital i realize thet earlier i raise the question about weather or not cold exposure could modify worm one out put in particular wheather not ice baths or i supplied to specific tissues of the body is people are doing i one way r the other can change tososterone levels estrogen levels anotherwards to taking ice basin col showers increase to stosterone end er estergen ye taking a ice bath or cold shower or cold exposure in general it is nok in oug correct divide him indeed efficiency youre emetabolican drome tere's a lot of things that it will not correct that ar causes of hipogonatism erloth er lo testosteron but it will help acutely specifically the application of cold to testies that are too warm aif you have a vericaseal or if you have a little bit of a primary hypogonatism which is were teststerone is not a released by the testes but your elation aff asage signals are sufficiently high then a you will likely respond to cold exposure better and there is actually undergarments that our design specifically to help with fertility and there is probably gan be more or more than the future you just need to be careful not to get frost by because it is a particularly bad spot to get frostbye notid could you define vericaseal you mention if you times is that is a vericos vain ye it is essentially a vericos vain it brings warm blood and the venus flow or the flow back to the heart is not as good just in the legs it can happen in the scrotum usually about twenty to twenty five percent of people have one great o vericaseal there is grades one through four or one through five and most people just have a very mild one usually on the left side because the blood has to go through further to get back to the heart nd it raises the temperature of the testes temperature is the enemy of testy they to be five to ten degrees cooler than the rest the body soarsanais particularly bad for sperm production they can be bat when you say can be a hellong could one safely be in the sana a would you wanto go back and forth between the cold an sona am is there any are there any data if some one is having in fertility then i tell them to avoid all sanas empirically if some one has a if there are not in fertile but they have a low sperm count i also tell them to avoid however it is mostly a warmed water that can raise the temperature of the testes faster than te sana to hosils in things nthat sortheh hot tub and egicoozy those are enemies number one an number to ofsper what about ice baths and cold showers for women any evidence that it can shift hormon output in women tha it can it increases the a activity of debata adronargic receptors sa even in the central lirou system and astrocites as well it can do a few things it can slightly decrease a the drive for food which astrocides and pade o agronargic receptors haf a some medications that are way lost medicines also do similar things but a it it can be beneficial in women to but no evidence that it changes astrogen output in women correct nothin i know of me mether am peptides at a discussion these days about peptides peptize the coursious being strings of a meno asses as you mention the very stral small ones to two menoasses ell carnating all theway up to polly peptides which has been many many a many menoacids there is many peptides that there is weh fide tus do an entire episode about pepties but i think one of the reasons i'm hearing much about peptides these days is that they are not called steroids that the names steroides a i think has been a has come to be associated with anibolic sterods in the contects of achney a testosteron rage et cetera but of course testosexcuse me estrogen as tha steroid hormon right a there are other steroyd hormons am as we both know but peptides are gaining increasing popularity i willing to go on records saying that you can be sure that many of the incredible transformations that you see in hollywood are the consequence of a peptide use and i' put my am my name behind that a because i'm well aware of people that uses to prepare for rolls but athlets use them and then everyday people are using them to for instance am sirmoral and testimoral and ipomoral and to stimulate a the release of growth hormon rather than taking growth hormon a b p ce one five seven which is a essentially a synthetic gastric juce that normally a repairs the got they being used to treat injuries and there are other ones as well what can we say generally about peptides are they safe or they not safe what about sor cing and are there any peptize that you think could be of particular use for people and we should probably also touch on peptize that people should not go anywhere near with a tenfootpole ye definitely peptides are very heterogenists there is very dangerous ones and very safed ones my favorite peptide is the original peptide which is insolen insolen is a peptide and a less than a hundred years ago there is a scientist a studying insolen and at some point they saw that an animal had its dibeds cured by insolent injeccured by inslent injection less than a year later they were injecting insolent into every typone diabetic because it was saving their lives and yet insolen can kill you if you take it at the incorrect ofs ye just insolent should be prescribed by a doctor there is over the counter insolen a rely on or in p h but ideally your insolent is prescribed by your doctor for a your dibeds a as its life saving peptize should be prescribed by doctors as well and there is several that ar eft approved you mention a lot of different ones a let us start with tessamorlane tessimoralan was recently ft you prove for something called lipo distropy at happens where body fat is displaced into abnormal areas often as part of ads or severe burns things that and it helps re distribute this body fat and give people their quality a life back tessmorelan is a g h ar h which i kind of loop into the category of g h ar pes growth hormone releasing peptides it is only a couple of meno acids different from indogenously produced growth hormone releasing hormone growth hormone itself is also a peptide it is a peptied hormone not a stero ad ormone you have a a different sematitrophs which are a very similar to growth hormone another fun fact is that h p l which is human plecental lactogen we love acranariet human plecental lactagent is nearly identical to growth hormone a the growth hormon an pregnancy is not what causes the sugar spite and gestational libedes it is the human plecental lacygen if you look at twin pregnancies if they have toplecentus or more plecental tissue making more human plecental lactygen the risk of gestational dibedies is expedentially higher this h p l is only a couple a molecule's different from growth hormone it is interesting that these different g h our hes in g h our peas actually have pretty different mechanisms of action gralan is also a hormne that is released when you are hungry an this is probably one of the reasons why you have more growth hormone release overnight and there is a lot of peptides that are very similar to grellan these peptides are not bywhi dentical peptides but they just have a couple different a meno acids change their almost identical and theyr problegan a be used in the future for growthormo deficiencies including in kids they have been studied somebody wants increase their growth ror worn out but in addition to not eating within two hours of sleep getting go deep sleep a doing all the other things of in the six pillars that you mentioned earli er especially resistance exercise a at some point earlier in the day what are the risks and benefits of taking a growth hormone releasing ormone peptide sirmorilin a prescribed by a doctor of course a what should one be concerned about a how long could one take these i've even heard that they can modify gen expression that they really are changing your hyp with the helmas a in very long lasting ways ye a there is deafinny lot of risk tumer growth and cancer you look at a type one diabetic they ave very high incidencies a various types of cancer they have very high growth ormone but lo i gap one paradoxically they would likely give you a similar cancer risk to a type one diabetic that has very high a growth hormone however there are the benefits of it you think of lypolisis a decreased body fat increased a lean body mass a lot of those can you can use other things to get those benefits then you do not need growth hormone for those benefits tat just leaves cosmetic benefit to which you can usually use topical sto get a your hair and your skin ind your nails there is a lot of other things that you can do other than growth hormone a lot of people just do not need ts g h arpies if there if they do not have lipodistropy or if they do not have growth hornow deficiency there is other uses of them specifically in injuries i know that they have been studied a not surfits in a military we mentiond the woodpecker or the two contracu injury thet haaays anting back and for ran busiy slammin up against it on the skull they all football heading the ball in socker adeafling people who used the fifty coller an military that is a fairly am small a population a and i think any one that is hit their head hard more than once a a we can talk about bp c one five seven for a bet g h ccopper peptide for a bet a t b five hundred or a fimis an bate afor analogue and the we can also talk about a brimmalanotide which is mlano tan three they have planatan one and two and thn they alsof lan a ten three and four yow let us talk about blok ye see one five seven and molanatan cause i think those of the ones that most people are am eyeing to speak bp see one five seven as body protective compound one five seven it is a identical or by identical to gastric protectve compound one five seven that is produced in the stomach as you age you get a trophi gastritus very often that is why you have less intrinsic factor which is kind of another peptide that bines tivideim and be twelve that is whyt you can get age related b twelve deficiencies that is one reason why you have more colitus more di verticulitus as you age you do not have that gastric protectif compound it is a it increases vedge af vascular indothelial growth factor which basically makes your blood vessels grow more s that is what a causes your body to form a blood vessel another medication known as a vaston it is on the w a chose list of essential medications for canter many different types of cancer including colin cancer you treat it with a vaston which is a vedge efin hibiter it' if you have cancer or a hy canter risk you probably do not one to be taking a medication that is the exact opposite mechanism of action as your essential anticancer med in other words if you have cancer or you are at resc of cancer of woid be beasy one five seven correct a lot of people prescribe it for six weeks and b p c one five seven brimalanotide that is eft approved for a hypoact ov a secual disorder tat's a morlan that is also aproved for lippodistrophy interestingly male a another one of the malanotans is also approved for lippodistrophy and also a deficiency in the malano cori co recept or the recepter that receives a the alphubalanocites stimilitan hormone at's a very rare condition it is also approved for that because if you do not take it than you get obisity but a bp see one five seven is not ef t approved but it is essentially standard of care this point a i would say it is a if you are not counting insolen or growth hormonas peptides it is one of the most commonly used peptides an anecdotalian in some clinical literature it is fairly well tolerated for short periods of time i'm not in the camp that everybody needs to do it two to three times a week or even daily for six weeks no matter what the major benefit is when you'e goig to take it early on because it is can allow your body to increase blood flow to the injured area and the less blood flow t has for example cartilege ligaments have horrible blood flow especially as people age it is goan to make a significant difference i would wager that that russian gymnist that acules heald in one month it completely from a a full ruptior was likely taking b piece in one five seven or something very similar i'm willing to wager on that as well a remarkable recovery a and because it is presprescription there are non prescription forms my understanding of the non prescription forms in the danger of going after non prescription forms is that oftentimes they will contain what they claim they contain p peasy one five seven in this case but they are not adequately cleaning out the l p s the lipopolisacaride which can cause inflammation fact in the laboratory we use el p s to deliberately induce fever and inflammation to study systemic inflammation this is a warning to people if your interested in peptides you absolutely need to work with a physician in my opinion get it from a really good compounding farmers who will clean out to that cleans out th l p s because if you are buying it through a source that lot of peop i doft ant a named sources but there thse common sources on the innernet that everyone knows about their buying these sources they will ship it to any one essentially but then the l p s is really causing inflammation and many people experience a kind of mild fever or tingling from that when they inject it ag i can feel it working that is probably l p s action which is not good for the brain i do not know about it onother preferal tissues ihave not heard of people dropping debt from the stuff yet but i certainly would not want to be injesting any el p s unnecessarily would you agree htyou should work wor the docter after all you are a definitely talk to your doctor about this and talks them about the dosin regiment as well if they have you doing it for six weeks ask im why my doing it for six weeks why not two weeks or why not as soon as i feel better can i just stop it the othere is a lot of good questions that that you should ask your doctor and if somebody is trying to prescribe you a bunch of different things than c is this what they prescribe everybody ors as individualized for me there are peptides g h ce copper peptide which is produced in dogenistly in the liver more at younger ages that is why the liver can regenerate folly as this the g h k copper peptite helps and if you'r copper deficient which not a whole lot of people are but a lot of people that ofe had beriatric surgery are copper deficient g h c copper peptide can help significantly with your nervous system and it is also cynergistic any growth agonists thimists invade a for made in kids in the fieists which shrinks a that is another reason why kids heel really well that and g h k is somewhat cynergistic with p p c but if you do not need all three you do not want them and if you do not need it for more than a week you do not want it for more than a week i really appreciate you saying that i often say that sometimes the best doce of something to take is zero it is often thate case of the best dosageis zero you mention milana tan there are several kinds of milanatan i find it a little bit of a funnin conversation because it ie first learn about milanatan from reading about peptides and discovering that people were taking injecting milanatan to get tan because it is in in the melonan umsynthesis pathway they also discovered this is an individual this is reading about this in verious manuscripts an a previeued papers that u it could cause things preapism a sustain direction that might be the last one that any one would ever have because of damage to the to the evasculature t m also women taking milanatan as it as a way to get tan and lose body fat the sounds all very recreational are there any clinical usige o malanatan at separate from the kind of extreme biohacking cosmetic world which is really not the main focus of this podcast ever wat more in terms of health pursuing health optimization a there is actually three ft approved indications believe it are not not many people know about this but there is three well accepted indications one of them is the hypoact of secxual disorder and more in women that is for brimalanotide those theres those are women that have assentially kno libito whatsoever but other hormones art seem are inchec classically it is a before menapaus those hormonal issues are not contributing and a when you give them this peptide it is also as p t one for one at help significantly wa toe times you use it in nasal spray it goes straight into the central nervous system and accentral you can also inject it and you can also take it for a troky men and women take it correct it is approved for women but it can also help men and it is relatively safe the only relative contraindication that i tell people and all o people say o there is no side effects that i know of but if you have a family history of melinoma or potentially have a melinoma and do not know about it that is why am a big advocate of demoscope is well and regular skinchecks then theoretically it is gan it increase that alpha malanosite stimulating hormone and it can grow that sa that is definlly not a good thing a'm be very careful about longtrm administration of it it is also approved for lipodistriphy which is the same exact thing as tessimoraland which i believe its alsonon as a a ivista or agrifta and then it is also approved for the reargenetic condition where youre a receptors or your malano sites do not proliferate as well usually have hypopigmentation it is not true albanism a but it is associated with morbid morbid obecity and very that poor outcomes from that inchildhood soits use in kids actually interesting pepsides are a fascinating landscape but thank you for that im a deep dive into several of them and we wl proubly return to you a to talk about peptize again in in the near future because i know there is a lot more there in a lot of interest i want a talk about the sixth pillar right just remine people you said diet exercise were appropriate coloric restriction managing stress sleep and sunlight are critical for every one at all ages to manage and optimize hormon health thany of the six category which is a really intriguing one which is spirit which is a kind of unusual thing to hear coming from a medical doctor except that i have many colleagues and i'm and indeed are a former director the national institutes of health francis callins as talked about this notion of spirit we talked about but belief of facts on this podcast before with alycrum how one's understanding of the things that they dou and ther world in general really creates it an important effect on everything at the level of physiology notciou psychology as a physician how do you conceptialize the spiritual aspect and how do you talk to patients about this giving that people walking into your cleneck a presumably have a bunch of different religious and not a religious backgrounds umsure some or eigtheas some are probably strong believers how do you deal with that and how should people think about this ye i believe it is it it is surprisingly well received you would not think at first glance that a patient really wants to talk about their spiritual health with their doctor but the way i think about it ind the way that it really is is it is a vindiagram and you have a body in a mind and a soul and you cannot have one healthy without the other halth even if your mental health is a phenomenal and even if your physical health as phenomenal the mental aspect of spirituality if that peace is not ther than that is can effect your body physiologically as well and a allychrums done some excellent work there is also been a lot of other studies regarding prayer and i'm a christian i believe in god and that gives me a lot of that resilients and mote ofation it gives me the the cornerstone or the ground work how i can interact with life and regardless of some ones and atheists are regardless of regardless of what someone believes as far as religion or the origin of the species they can know that their spirituality is going to have a profound effect on their mental and physical health as well people to compart mentalize it they to talk to their doctor only about the physical health caus that is comfortable to do that they only talk to their pastur or momer us we know rekyhuler for their spiritual health and they just talk to their therapist or psychiatrist about their mental health but youn to bring all three those things together a it is well known that interdisciplinary clinets lead to improved patient outcomes and that is just disciplines within medicine that is just a doctors that ar specualizing in this or this this takes a step back and upper ain upper part of that tree before you reach those psychotomies or the splitoffs you have your you have your body in your mind in your soul to your spiritual health in your mental health and your physical health if you are a in line in all three those things that builds the corner stone for the rest of your ealth and the rest of your life some one comes into your clenek and they say i their feeling one way in their body their feeling one way in their emotional life you run their charts you get their blood wore im and they are an atheist or thei're ignostic im what are some of the six pillar practices that they can consider that are in keeping with ther i'm atheism er ignosticism 'm because ihave to assume that people who are im in participate or feel that they belong to you do not particular religioussect will have pertyulers prescriptives from those religio s a sects that will direct them towards particular types of prayer but hi would im somebody who does not have a a prescriptive coming to them from some other source what would they what could they do or would they do yes i certainly do not force prayer on anybody or anything that but it is my believe that being especially being an agnostic it is almost the hardest thing because if you are anatheis thand you have some ground workand you have some spirituality even if it has to do with a the human spirits interaction with the environment things thit cannot be physically explained well phenomenon the work that ally crumed us but if you are acnostic you are still trying to find that i hope that everybody does find what they truly believe in as far as their own spirituality but ah yet that that is a a personal journey ah from a physician standpoint and even if ofm friends with him as well from a friend standpoint i do not to push anybody inany specific direction i do not think that everybody should believe what i believe and a i do not feel there should be any pressure for them to believe something different i think that there can be excellent physician patient reporter regardless of what of what we believe and what our backgrounds are ye aum that is wonderful to here i can say without revealing any names that i have close colleagues that in every bin of this spectrum ut hard court atheous hard cour religious in different domains a different religions i do not know i do not know if i know many i mignostic as to whether not i know any nostics i should say i im it is not something that people commonly discuss but i'm in the context of science in medicine but it is starting to happen more and more and certainly this issue of spiritualities is one of the aireas in which nerro science is asking a lot of questions what i'm spiritual experience is really are interms of how they are grounded in the brain or not grounded in the brain i think it is a really interesting area for discovery and i appreciate that you a that you bring it up and you bring it upen that in the non pressured way that you do i think that a it will stimulate a lot of thinking which is a ultimately the goal this podcast well i have one final question that i a a a listener insisted i ask and it is a very straightforward one im it is it is not at all occurdball and not at all related to what we were just talking about but it was the most common question when i told people that i was giing talking to you which is is kafine problematic for hormones is amazing i received hundreds of the same question about kafine and since it is probably the most commonly use drug on the planet i know its taking us back into the very practical but in a inclosing i were not quite there abut inclosing is kafine having a an effect one way o the other on tostosterone estrogen or other hormones that a is positive negative ere neutral only f it effectrsly works on identizi and it can actually slightly improve alor ges us well but a negligible effect otherwise greatwell sorry to end on such a practical brass tax type of a type of question but i did promise to the listeners that i would a i would ask that question tisten i want it sincerely thank you we covered at basically at an ender chronology text book a nerro ander chronology text works worth of information a ton of practical tips in their where can people find out more avout yue we will certainly provide lynx and am i guess the other question is are you taking patients ofm sure youill her that in the varys of vanuse where people can codtact you bebut where you active in terms of public facing work am active on instegram cyle gelett m d am also active on the social medius of my brand new clinec which is chelett health hat's a acgulett health on instergram or gelett health dot calm great will provide lynk to those and i should say that your the conton youe been putting out on instergramsterrific because you actually point to specific studies an you put things into actionable contects which is am o very meaning ful a for me cyll doctor gelett i should say thank much for your time i really preciateed i know the listeners well to thank you my pleasure thank you for joining me for my discussion about hormone health and optimization with doctor cyle jelette as you just heard he is a treasure trove of actionable clear information and again you can find him teaching more about hormones and other aspects of health on instegram at cyle jelette that is gelette with two tease and two ells but no ed cyll chal lett m d on instergram and chellett health on all other platforms and if you would more information about his practise you

unity six dand had become a truckdriver with nothing left to haul but mariwana through his early thirdies he could do little with the trurking business he would inherited from grandpa except watch as i crumbled around him back then he began his days by throwing open the door to the bedroon my share of my brother down he would stand there and is under were looking a tall diper child and say you too get up he would in the day drinking a lot of dougter fifty budwisers at the shanty bars that littered the port of brownsmon at home mom kept the bookkeeping she watched the flow of money slow to wa trickle and then stop outright when i was in middleschool my brother sisters and i nou things were dir when our mother stopped shopping at ell sentral super market the nice crosrstore as she would always told us en started bringing home bags from lopus super market the poor people grosere store cone morning mont surprises me by showing up it my seventh great algeber class and removing me getting us on the road out of brounsill headed north there is no explanation sinp that the yakaiate she snaps at me sit down and shut up i a i do not know why i did not guess what we were doing that morning the moment idor laccouts for dad who was on the road somewhere behind us and one of his floknos tract or trailers carrying a large lowof mariwan and had a north i had heard the stories new some ot the tactics ar smoke ing by this point but i did not make the connection that mom and i were driving ahad of dad to make sure the custom station was closed and if it happene to be open we were supposed to turn back and warn him this was back in the nineteen eighties before the patroact and there were two youas customs check points blocking the migration of drugs fruit people reptiles and parrots on the roads between the united states and mexico both about one hundred miles north of the mexican border at highway choke points the station on highway seventy seven and sereda was the busier and the better finance the check pointin hebrnvilleveug was an erstreame trailer with an attached carport to protect the ages from the sun and it would often clothes for breakfast for lunch we are headed twards that one this morning going north on highway to what y one driving through the scenery of asmatic plants and stunto trees the car is hot nowhere conditioning my mom and i are saying nothing to one another we have each decided that the other is unworthy of conversation we stare at the windows and think very different things mom is thinking about the hndred dollars she and dad ats spent before six ofclock that morning one hundred dollars that would help them make two thousan knowlerge if things went right because her first stop on this fell in the excursion was to dad's gudandetta whom we knew as lasignota dat's personal whitch doctor for an emergency session they were let right through at five in the morning and they had only one burning question will the check point be open after years of sitting through thecessions with my grandmother i did not have to be there to know exactly how it went in the gudandetta's office a signoda is older matronly dresses in the thin frocke with heir hair pulled back in a bun she has my parents sit across from her desk in ha black leather love seat with crome handles a panorama photos hang around her office some wallet usized others larger and in portrait a pencil sketch of a camaro by one of her grandsons hangs necxs to a window she listens closely to their question nodding sleepily at their preoccupation sympathizing understanding they have reached a decision and the cannot turn back they tell her they knew to do it no other choice any more she stands up abruptly and walks behind her desk which has cletter wich sheets of note book paper crawling with ink illegible notes names of people sets of criptic numbers whome addresses of saints she closes her eyes and scribbles something on her yellow legal pak nonsense to anyone else reading it on her desk are two cheap letded crystal botes each filled ewith a clear liquid she gently reaches for her matching shok lass and lifts it to the light making it sparkle she places the glass on the surface before her and parth from one botter then the other when the two clear liquids mix they turned a deep crimson and thickend plasma she nods her head as if her suspicions have been confirmed she produces a glass orb filled with water sitting on a black plastic ring she sits up straight closes her eyes and regulats her breathing into a loud rhithmic inholation exholation that unconsciously forces mom and dad to do the same after a few seconds she opens her eyes suddenly and strikes the glass orb with a metal wand making it ring in the clear morning air then she lifts the ar between her two pudgy hands and stares deeply into the inverted image of the room around it stting opposite this chicanery and watching everything she does youre drawn to the ritua and you cannot help tut try to figure it out too no she says with certainty the check arnt yor not the open this morning go in peace got me with you when mom and i reach a cheqk point at eleven forty five that morning it is very much open for business a line of ca ars five deep stretches back from the underbudget ad airstreme trailer our job now is to go through and then turn back around and reporched dad that his doom was indeed imminent mam is visibly shaken she turns off the radio with a hard click and considers this considers her options from the car we can see a skinny middle aged white guy ind green border patral garb sitting on a reclining chair and the open doorway of the airstreame trailer he is facing the cars as they pass under the tin roof it must have been a hundred ten degrees inside the trailer a hundred in the shade from his position never bothering to get up the agent sits founding himself with the newspaper and sleepily peers into the cars asking if every one is an american citizen waiting for an accented answer smiling and then waving them through a sympathetic priest grancing absolution hi we all going to today asked the skinny little man mam's window is now only half way open and in her nervousness she rolls it all the way up hi sorry i mean sanantonio as she opens the window you all american citizens yes she says and she leans back he could get a clear look at me nodding my head i do not say anything except the quiet yep when i nodd but he has not heard me there is an uncomfortable pause i think because he're supposed to hear your accent there is an anxious beet and he still has not let us go when i say yes i am a bit too enthusiastically mam laughs nervously she had been hoping our light skin would exonerate us without a problem you all have a nice day he says he has not noticed anything awkward we drive through and i feel her seethe for the next few miles that was about noon somewhore behind us atd a road side rest stop dad and my older brother dan oure waiting in dadstract or trailer which is attached to the trailer with the mariwante the two cenner iviums that run the length of the trailer make perfect housing once he welled metal plates all along the underside and at the tail end it creates a long rictangular box sealed at the rear and with the axcel of the rig whe're twenty forty pound blocks of marejuana can be hidden this is went down down or carn i wondered dimly if dan his figured out what he is doing out here on the road north when ye should be in high school but dan has always been more street wise cwhuch savier than me i figure that if i figured it out hee do figured outmanl mam and i drive on to abrenvill i'm be high drated i want to stop at a sore we cannot she says to me we have to turn back i think we are behind still i'm hungry and really thirsty i persist certainly we have time to get to a convenient store the cannot have schedul disting to hinge on a few minutes certainly theyve devise thus more cleverly than that please i clead just stop at the seven eleven grudgingly she polates the noisy car around the small town and finds a convenient store i get out with a couple of dollars and come up short when i try paying for some dognuts in a chocolate milk i returned o the car for more money just get in she ells and i doo weaving the food of the counter mam wips the car around and un introlen we sto it by ni we travel that for a few minutes and when the checkpoint is back in sight we hold our breath the guy will not see us and right then we see dad and dad and the trailer heading right for the check point dad had become nervous or may be brave or maybe he was blinded by his hundred dollar faith inutes goudondetta and had charged forth without waiting for monger vort oh god my mother says and all the blood drains from my face from just a tone in her voice i had never heard her voice charged with fear oh god she says again with her left hand she grabs a knob the controls a headlights and flashes at dad wh was only a few hundred feet from the check point she flasheis fore times an clear view of any one who is paying attention i wonder if that is her signal of the check poat is open but question the wisdom of doing it while he is next in line in full view of the guy a the check point were hy to look over his shoulder and see the noisy south bound car that just drove through not thirty minutes before she slows down sos terrifically down going less than twenty miles per hour on the highway and for a moment i can see dad is driving i can see that the blood his drain from his face too making his eyebrows stand out a rich black on his pallid deathly white forehead a mask of some one pretending desperately that everything his a o kay but doing it herrifically badly i see dawn in the passinger seat holding onder the hand rail above the door as it means to steady himself throuo this craziness through the stupid unnecessary risk and he looks calm collected uncarring lucky is not there there are no cars ahead of them now bhe trailer is next in line it is lows to a crawl and i can see dad desperately trying to ignore the crazy flashing noisy bonville rattling through the south bound lane keeping his eyes fixed to the road pretending he is not smuggling anything in the empty trailer behind him this empty useless trailer wih the eyebeams all sealed up with the two mexican men driving it with no obvious destination no paper work no affiliation with any hauling or trucking company no sir not trafficing an drugs just driving through to huston probably looking for work oh yes we are american citizens that is not what were nervous we can prove that that is nothing were nervous because of the pot were hiding and because we are only getting two thousand dollars for risking upwards of ten years in prison is not that funny is not that just hysterical but the skinny white eye is having lunch and campy vathered and one of the weirder moments of this hole te bockel the bondeville the air stream and dad's tractor are a lying du lik some cosmicevent and we see the skinny border patrolagiont with n white napkin took under his chin and dads bloodless face up in the trailor through the window of the air stream as the agent waves them through with a fork ike his conducting an orchestra go on through go on through ma conton is driving south stun by what has just happened and i am careful not to say a word we almost reach raymonville and stopp at a waterburger to get a quick wordless lunch end spend some time sitting in a parking loct waiting when she feels it is safe to return she turns a car around and heads back north back through the same check point are you sure this is safe i asked she does not answer when we pull up again to the check point at it back to hebenville round three ofclock there is a different boarder patrelation at the air stream he is a small clean cut militant mexican with a southern drawl yall american citizens he demands instantly leaning into the car through the window clearly smelling for marawana smoke oh yes says my mother who as probably quite relieve the hard part is over and it looks we are getting away with it how bout you son you american citizen he gives me ya direct glare through reflective sunglasses there is nothing more potentially hostile then the indigents ego interpreting the laws of his conquer upon his own people yes sir i say careful not to move her fidget or look away i've learned he looks back at my mother then at me luckehy smells the nervousness of earlier something tugs at his intuition we are yeu all headed the sunglass is finally ask this catches mam off guard her subterfusud ended when dad had driven through the check point she left all her answers back in raymonville we are going to hevrenville she says unconvincingly had he asked one more question had he pressed it we would have been in some sort of trouble but he does not and he backs off and motions us through mam drives the noisy carth habrenville and we are agot to the open highway again when you noticed douts trailer in the park an ot of a she hotel by the side ofthe road my brother is lodge between the yeur most tires working on the break lights that ri diculously aret working maum is his alarme to find them there as i am this confirms by suspicion that there had been no planeng beyon the consultation at the cron detos this hold do bockle have been based on nothing more than a hundred dollars worth o faice mamplls up next tof the trailer and i think she expects he victorious reunion when he sees her dat suddenly looks his about to punch her stupid an woman he els at her in spanish mom stops cold wit the were you thinking if they would have just turned around for a moment it would all be over and it ould all be your fault he spits at her in spanish we realize what he is upset about the flashing headlights his words continued to snap and his suround her bullets in a fire fight and she follows him forward to the cab of the trunk coutowing to her punishment lucky for us le senota was right dad says walking back with maum now excited and seemingly over his anger she made them blind and we were let through they were closed when we left them later that evening dan was doing the dryroom they pled out of the barkin lott and haded off to huston and the pay off the break lights temporarily fixed an loops of block electrical tape o watch is a truck disappears it looks every other piece of now broken down equipment we have ever owned rusting miserable and totally criminal mamm and i turned south back tor brownsville mammis her usual quietself except this time she plays the radio louder this means just

we spoke with the other girl in that story who has not talk with malichan and while did not know that ye was tellig that story publically who confirmed all the crazy details in the story she says they held hands an prade while the plain took off inaan can a at for pre k o tondersend es next story which is devininly a story about getting away with it in a big big way at first need to give you some background about prie school an reson years there been more or ore studie showing the prie school is one of the best in vestmen sat a country can make in children's education probably the most famous piece of recearch on this as an old one called the parry prieschool project the study began in the nineteen sixties they tok a bunch of poor kids from ipsilanti michigan put half of them into a prieschool programm and then the other half oun of just led their normal lives and then after a year of that both of those scgroups went back into the same public school system and then ever often recearchers would follow up with these kids to see how they were doing for the two groups the following thm still even now and there is als have been amazing at age twenty seven the kid who got prie school were half as likely to have goten arrested they under an average of fifty per cent more per month there were fifty per cent more w'd have a samg is a ccount ptwenty percent more would have a car prieschool kids got sick less often one and poyed less often sentenced to incarceration less often other studies show similar results not just for poor kids but for other kids too they do better if they have prieschool and the very first state to choose to make free high quality preschool available to almost every for yeuron in the state and then nactually delivered on that promise turns out to be a surprising one fact only a handful ef states have joined it hawlexplonber reports that the story of how the state came to lead the nation in preschol access is all about getting away with it quick reminder for we start to day show as a rerun from a few years ago since we did this story some details fokohoma's political landscape had changed he is aex the state is oklahoma and to show you just houesurprizing that is consider what happened to guo name ran peters peters was a freshmen legislator in the oklahoma state house of representatives republican one of its party leaders a veteran legislator came up to him one day and said the governor also a republican appointed this task for us to look into the issue of early childhood education they came up with some recommendations the recommendations were put into this bill the governor wants us to pass it will you be in charge of making that habit an mas vert was free monday in bill stoi was his said public privic partnership said be prov fondige ron peter said shar the bill seemed easy to pass and pretty non controversial there were no state funds involved with all private money the idea was simply to set up a non profit to publicize the value of early childhood education some more parents would consider it we introduced the bill on the house floor i did not no thanging by would bat it i mean had he d bat o no just pa sectoras gont rase money to fund the wor pok an somecould not argue about since pin state money but and they said wll be to bated up seven hands on my saw the iand at to the bit against it id this is a nany stae bill cans con con tikeor cads an risin for we thik hit should be rase by the maman dad ofs to ot theli rushlin lar in carnete i got the legesliterslike to thea tittle people hit were there you think there is anyboty right of you nooh no ne tut they te the whole hole munchim i got it pass and the pass he house past the senate and then all people story inn letters from the far right wig saying to the governor this is his manustate bill why woeld you secrecates from the hospital an tike im to utorise fors an he got he got scared a little bit i guess and heinit bets on his own pass force bill wi alos i was terblip si actually the governor only threatened a vetail that it was enough to tell peters bill that tin around and that is how unlikely it is to pass universal public preschool in oklahoma a bill that simply suggests that the state might think it is a good idea for kids to go to preschool a bill remember that does not involve any state money and does not actually set up any new government programms that bill gets a tack as socialism as cottle oklahoma is argubly the most conservative state in the country sgot a republican house a republican senate a republican governor for out of its five representatives to congress ar republicans as our both at senators one of those senators tom coburn was named the most conservative senator in congress by national review magazine and if you need more proof consider this oklahoma was the only state in the entire country in two thousand eight were not one single county voted for bracobama how in the world that any one get the conservative state of oklahoma to agree to a dramatic expansion of the states public education system in pree school something that many conservatives would oppose how did any one get away with that the answer universal pub lic preeschool came to oklahoma notest part of a bold evidence base campaign it was snuckin in the dark and to give you a sense of just half secretly at happened considered this rather amazing fact at the time ron peters was getting his little bill squash by his own party in the legislature universal preeschool was already in place in oklahoma itit been voted into law three years earlier loted g to law by many of the same people who were accusing ron peters of socialism and wat's more they had probably voted for that law without even realizing it which is exactly the way the people who brought public pre school to oklahoma wanted it ot pc o ppo the story begins in the late nineteen nines and it begins with a seemingly unrelated issue school superintendents around oklahoma had discovered a loophole and the states school funding formula and were using that loophole to run a little scheme that involved kindergarden classes and huge amounts of money s the scheme was it was legal in oklahoma for schools to have either a full day or a half day kindegraton programme the loophole was that schools got paid the same amount from the state either way and wat school districts began doing was running two half day programms and collecting twice as much money and if they could not find enough five year olds to fill two kindergraen classes they would had their numbers with four year olds we we got right in the middle that very very early loyd snow was the school superintended at this time who took advantage of the lophole ran two half day kindegardens and wrle a bunch of four year olds got paid double from the state it was a no prater did not only be able to do this put in play and in have money wft ower for others desperately needed under fundan educational processes i m it wit was it was a good thing and we haveit had very many good thing a good things and boblic schools and my estremation i did not blank was all around the state the scheme spread four year old were gold and the extra money they brought in whent everything from football programms to new school equipment even new buildings that is what happened in the district of joe edens a state legislator around this time there was much money came with these children the school district bought but we call portable clash rooms o the big moblehome ou know thitz clunk it together in and you have got a nice clas room a prefi up here they bought the the buildings paid cash for them with the money the the first year an m us t it s that much gravy and then from then on the youn to use the buildings an isence free not my time li joe was happy about this but he was not this seemed a loophole that people were abusing and for two years he tried to close it to keep four year old out of kindegrat they got nowhere and joe eddons he become sentral to the sctory of universal pree school and oklehoma you will hear a lot more from him later after he meets this next gy another main character in the saga a gy named bob parbason bob harbeson as a self described to corporit guy conservative suits torteshow glasses he was for many years the senior manager at tet u ay and after that and executive in the oil in gas industry hewas also friends with people on the board of the tulsa chamber of commerce and one day a banker friend of mine it was the incoming president of the chamber brought me ap piece i wan talk to you about a project we have been working on at the chamber and a he said tit a started in nineteen ninety they had put together ill task for s to a an ay way to work forch development issues because they were going to toso was going through a pretty explosive growth period the banker friend explained that local business is untilsa had a problem they were finding it harder and harder to ire employes with enough skills and abilities to do the job the chamber had been looking into the reasons for this was at colleges and universities not training people properly high schools they kept working back to this notion of children increasing numbers of children not being ready for school this banker friend handed bob a cardboard box filled with research and reports on early childhood education said here look this over and see what you think we should do i working through this cardboard box of materials in a cubical at the a chamber they in the staff had a cumulated a literature on the subject and a i became familiar with the a pairie priest school study and do you remember reading those studies was that sort of an ahamama we are reading these long term offects of prie school with that but what dou rememml mind at that as youo i tinded to frame things in terms of my a business experience an you i just ot yeue just automatic harbeson said he thought back to his career in the airline industry where one of the worst things you can do is fly a plan with an empty seate but a kid who comes to kindergarden too far behind statistically that kid might never catch op is occupying that seat ind first second therd grade an middle school an high school but the seat might as well be empty fror the good it is doing the id sitting in it and also he thought when you look at the statistics of what happens to a lot of at ress kids when they get out of school they an of costing the government a lot of money they and av been carcerated or on public assistance bad outcomes for them and for society ialways stought about if if if there was a business sor group of businesses and they had agreed to pay for all the out comes they would be spending money on prevention this cardboard box made a big impression on bob harbeson who in his quiet way became something of a crusader for early childhood education making the case for it to any one who would listen including some time in the late nineteen nineties joe edons nw member joe was this legislator he had this bill trying to closhe that loophole and keep four year olds out of kindergarden bob hareson started making the case that we do not want fewer for year olds in public school we want more of them here is joe bob harberson is ey wut how smooth bob harberson theis an e and ad you knw what to mad i never knew i was being lobby if i was ben loy not is thob boyis bob arbersons tellin me twit things i mad know which incidenaly a bob harbeson was telling the truth but th that that was the key tha that bob harberson a found me a willing pupil and ataught me all i know bout the four yours ttherewere the course of several meetings bob shared with joe the contents of that cardboard box all the studies and research projects demonstrating the importance of early childhood education and joe gradually decided that he needed to change his lob and make it much beaker he would still eliminate that four year olds and kindergarden for cash ski shir no longer could schools pack the kindegerns with four year olds to get extra money from the state but a longside that he would provide for an actual program for for year ols and entirely new grade fully paid for by the state public pries school and turned out oklahoma had a very good pilot preschool program with guy lines for choosing the appropriate corriculem and hiring qualified teachers but this program only existed in a few districts because according to edns the state did not provide enough money to pay for it edon's estimate the state provided only a third of the money that was actually needed to run one of these programms joe edon's plan was to take that pilot programm and fully fund it that any district that wanted it could actually get paid enough to put it in place now there was only one prob with this plan tit is probably no way it could pass no way the state legislature would ever agree to pay for a programmi this sill joe edon's essentially hit it he simply offered his amendment t again the one closing the four year olds and kindrgarden for cashlefoll only t with some new language a kind of p s and which he proposed a week to the states school funding formula made it that schools got the same amount of funding for pre school that they got for other grades this was in fact a massive overhaul of oklehoma's public school sistem but the actual tax of edon's amendment looked nothing special the way you amend to bill a the staff takes the sections of law that youre amending and then rit youre amendmancin a underline and line out what you are teleading language and i just had a few words here in a few words there still there were the traditional and powerful enemies to something this budget hawks and limited government folks which as i said oklehoma might lead the nation in edins strategy here political slight of hand he drew their attention to the stuff in the bill he thught they would and did not mention the stuff they would not i probably sat down a third desh with each republican and showed him two or three things in the bill i thought they ought to know and what were those things well i showed him where it is a were e're keeping four year olds out of kindigarden a were saving enormous amounts of money a you can contract with private providers they lof that that is all i sayin now everything he said was true edons bill did allow state money to go to private daycare senters to teach preschool also his plan was voluntary school districts did not have to offer precate programms and parents did not have to send their kids to one it was entirely reasonable to expect that in the beginning at least not too many school districts would even take advantage of edon's tweak to the funding formula and offer a precay programmeand one other thing edons had going for him this four year old and kindr garen for cashscheme it was growing and was feared that the two biggest districts in the state oklehoma city and tulsa were about to get in on it edon says that compared to the sure finansial armagedan that would be his bill was the cheaper alternative every body could see that my bill was way cheaper than not my bill if you voted no on my bill and killed it you were going o have enormous in roman a four year old san kindigarden and this was taking an emense amount of money and a all but one voted yes on the bill probably because in almost all his discussions with lawmakers about his bill edons left out the main part the part about how he put the state on the hook to pay for an entirely new grat lovel he knew almost nobody in any legislature actually reads all the bills and the number of people who actually understood oklehoma's school funding formula you could py count on one hand and his stragegy worked it was a huge and costly expansion of the governments roll and public education in a state moreiposed to costley expansions of government than perhaps any other in the country stephen dow was the director of an anti poverty agency and a long time early childhood egducation advocate in o klohoma he worked very closely with joedons to get this law written in passed i think it is fair to say the number of people that understood what was going on in terms of the adjostoment to the state ade formua that most certainly you could you could count the number of people that were were of that on one hand now if there had been if everybody in the state was aware of it wout it have passed i i i don' uknow that i would say that i think it is likely that it would have passed basically if if you got sadn't nuck fision i would say ad ad the fing had had the enactment of tuniversal prek i't not been done through this what i would call stealth campaign ai think it is fairer to say that it would not have been embrace the irony is now that the law is and place noklohoma it just adds evidence to the case for preschool researchers who studied tulsas preschool kids say they en ter kindo garden and average of five months ahead and mat seven months ahead in writing and nine months ahead in reating and the games are even more pronounced for atris kids who get preschool loyds know the oklhom school superintendent says he did not e a study to show him that he could see at the very next year after i district started off from pee schol i mean one year after we started i mean we had have department meetings no kinciof tepicaus our kids you will have better tward recognition letter recognition better sia skilles better a a and i cordination skiles better a a yo just almost a better everything aas it relates to redyi for school now we have got all of our kids for whatever bat gram i mean their voracious murners nam do stort me with that stop no madbe sees i kno ah ye yeh yes that was cut of a game changer for forn for for us nothing ote ta most schools a game change of that according to jo edons the legislator who arguably did more to change the game than anyone else would not have been possible without the strange four year olds an kuner garden for cash scheme the scheme that eddons used as a smokesreene to sneak universal preq through a sceptical legislature i do not see it ever a being fun did if you had other states do if you had to say here is a programme that we will not a implement a here is how much money it will take who were you going to get the money i if you would have to have a line item appropriation nobody would have supported it except the young mothers and they have no political clout what lessons could other states say other states wont tat try to do something this prayer they do not have a prayer they do not have a prayer a because it is expensie and there is a the state legislaturs are run by people that do not will not a s they will not a cut programmes not iad programes not everyone would agree with edns on this in fact if you talk to experts the trannd around the country as for more and more kids to be enrolled in state fon te preschool programms states as diverses georgia i wa or mont and west virginia are all hard on the heels of oklohama with preschool programmes of their own and as for oklohama parents says loyds know of the school superintendent they love this scprogramm andstatistics across the state bear that out remember parnts ton half ter cent the kis the preschol it is voluntary but almost seventy five per cent of the states four year old are now enrolled in public preschool however it arrived it seems that universal preq is here to stay in oklohoma who oug spimburg he is the founder of gimwat media in the host of the podcast without fail we originally haired this story back when he was on our staff

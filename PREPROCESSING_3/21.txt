last night two disappointhing things happened one of course was the release tha senat compromise border security bild an go through all the details of that momentarily the other was the grammies and hona starved the grammies mainly because frankly tomacdonali if we had performed fact at the grammies who oad ben at least ten times better because that was a te o can it just point out at this point that trevernoa is truly an awful host trevernoa is legitimantely most boring host in the history of the grammies because he is basically decided that his job at the grammies is to simply flatter the celebrities around him as suppose to doing the rickager bays for you goin and you insult all of the cslebries which way more encertaining for everybody else trevernoa goes in and tells much of jokes o how tailor swift helps the local economy a and everyone is beautiful aha and and billy jolas successful eh it was terrible also seevy wonder can no longer sayiging i say this as a longtimes stevy wonder van but the only is not a point all this out is because culture is upstream of politics and as much as were gon to talk about the senate borderbill in just a moment the reality is that there are maybe seven to ten million people in the united states wer 'v gen to have any idea that a border bill is even om the table or being contemplated whereas there will be hundreds of millions o people whoill listen to all the garbage music that emerges from the grammies in the messaging put out from the grammies does not mean that everbody listens to what all these dolts in holly would have to say about politics it does mean that they do have some impat we begin with a brief review of the grammies will start with this the fashion at the grammies these people are not you they are not connected to lives that you lead they do not follow your moral structurers they are not interested in promoting the morality that you wish to teach your children and yet if you leave them with access to your kids ve you tube or va i tunes or anything else it will in fact have an impact on your kids this is a human this human is called doja cat which i do not understand because she is not a cat apparently i have been informed by reliable sources that she literally named herself after pot and a cat not getting you because he did not come out of her momin er momos behold i shall name her doja cat a she obviously is not only a a class at in every way she also is just wearing a sheer body suits that does not even attempt to cover her nipples because this is where we are right now ni sum she can afford the entire drass if not then we should ou know tiffecan start o fund to actually by the extra two inches of cloth that it would take to cover her antir nipple but apparently not tbecause free the nipple because liberation because this is what holly would wants and it was not of course just doja cat the idiocy lany cravits showed up i do not understand why people bother to whear clothes that are not clothes again that this looks is though he got into some sort of mad maxs world strange bordello l fight i'd i do not ye this i this full hunger games couns i always encoy it when people lenny cravits where giant crosses surely jesus would approve of this outfit he probably figured out how toddress this in church at for those who cannot see he is wearing what appeares to be leather pants and the a leather shirt but most of the short es missing he is got fulon sleeves but it is not covering anything below manebe his breastbone and dum i n't i feel we should read distribute in the name of social justice his sleeve material to his chest just for the safety of all involved a leny cravits again these of the people who make the culture the your children imbibe and then of course we have billy ilish who apparently is dresse the gof pot smoking girl from hogwartzs iw know what exactly has happening here her her hair used to be green now her hair now that she is declared herself queer her hair is red i kno what the corelation is right there i wearing some most deliberately ugly clothes you will ever sa ocase o these are the people who have decided to beautify america with their art whe it is more on this in one second first we are experiencing a lot of goblan stability as we plunge into primary season how are you protecting your family in the midst of all this chaos the fact is

forward it is version o morality and it is version of morality is all he'l were make it a better p except that there is no actual healing of the world it is mostly just absolute cowardice and foolishness anny lennox she was a supposed to pay tribute to peopl who had passed away during the last yeare and tum they they did a bit in favor of a cease fire in gaza sinding to your anny lennox on a sease fire in gaza well by the way a hundred and forty hostagesrs who are still being held by hamas this winin to here from our or cultural betters here e fire ae she is is artist for sees fire

fire in got annylenics he outgod rognaless in to any lennics now and then of coure youhad the same sort of idiocy coming out of the recorting attademy c yo harvey mason junior a he did in entire stick where he proclaimed that the noba music festival massacre in which commass slaughtered hundreds of people at music festival in southern israel they did it cause they were jews but instead because the music industry is all athat watering morality towns the point where it makes no sent effectively he makes the case the people were slaughtered because they were at a music festival as sopposed to because they were jews which is weard since this did not happen in the middle of say montana it happened in the jewish state in ancismentic fashion that is what it was about for all of the a for all of the white to premisist all right conspiracists who think that holy would is cuonticle run by the jews of just point out her that howly would cannot even say that attacks on jews are attacks on jews they instead have to make it about attacks on music lovers evry wone of us te matter where were fro is nited by the sceriexperienc of musi at brings us together nothing else can and that is why music must always be our sace pace when that is violated that strikes of the very cort of who we are we felt that a the bothe con concer all and peris we felt that at the mantaary ana in england we felt that t the rout nivy one harvest music fest lost things and on a toter we felt that it gat when we heard the tragic news from the supernover music festival for lov that over three hundred and sixty music fans lost their lives and another forty were kuldnots that they and all the trati theys ther o follow hav been awful for the worlds o bear as we mourn the loss of all innocent lives we live in a world to lie the morals covelens i culd discuss thit o he stop stop this fool stop him an they can the lack of moral clarit is just insane right here first fie should point out that three of the attacks that he talks about three of the four attacks our slomic terratacs in the manchester concert explosion was in his lomic terror suiciboming in may of twenty seventeen the botoclonterratack was in tack in is lon atterratack an of course what just happenin southern israel is a is a terror attack and would havpen ansothern israel is a specifically antisemetic terror attack an yed this ideas there is the whole world and then linking that with what happened in loss vagas where we still do not have a motive by the way an the weirdess mas shooting in the history of the united states is superstrane and everyday we mourn life of an or you could you notike a moral stand against the people who murder rd music goeers who happened to be jewish because they were jewish in thenesroblet we cannot even do that again no moral clarity whatsoever from the recording artists shocker o ga then you hade the obnoxious one of the most obnoxious things about the artists at the e at the grammis is the absolute self centreness we begin with miley cyrus miley cyrus has an awful song called flowers shed two songs last year that we are both big heats one was called flowers and this was all about how independent ladies do not need no man and then the other song that miley cyris had last year was it one called use to be young which is actually a more interesting song because it to all about how basically she blue her youth of course the one tha makes or more famous in the one they given war to his flowers which is a really really garbic song my favorite part of this is where she assumes everyone in the concert hall noses fer lerics because she is just famous ever everyone knows the words these people there tiresome also i do not kno she high jacked her hair from a nineteen eighty's man acan last night very weard look for miley cyrus theooin to why are you acting you ano thi song cause no one because we do not kno you are song and then there was tom j s who decided to do a full conie and show up on stage who is giin some sort of lifetime achievement oord ispost and em an you decided to talk about how the academy was was not paying enough attention to beon say yes you are right beanse has not gotten enough attension in her life clearly the lack of attention on beante is destroying her career what can we do to help beyon say here we go in no one embarrass this young lady wit ye on mad ing everyg oning everyng one out wen a year even by yo on mextric pect os in were think about ther ost gramis nevery one out wena year eve esery were no ye that that is it ye it is

who are absolute self obsessinself sunter tailor swift i know that we are all supposed to un i take sides in the tailor swift war and a few things can be true a oms one is i do not believe her in anything that she does i find her entirely in authentic literally everything she does feels it has been scripted downs to the minutest to detail including last night second i do not care whether she is dating traviscelcy and i hope that for the sake of the country to get married now babies that all these thirty one year old feminis with seven cats can decide that marriage is actually good for them and we can have the tailor swift baby boom that would be good fror merica i also do not believe that she is some sort of deep state sih op if she is a deep state sabling to pic some od who can act because taylors in the most awkward moment last night she wins album of the year and she gets up and then promotes her next to album and she is sold she is clearly does not care about being there she is clearly does not even want to be there whenever they cuts her and she is dancing the audience she is dancing iwood dance in the audience which is to say awkwardly and with a sense of rage about having to be in this place at this time she gets upon stage and she basically as i got cab hare dopick out another trophy i have twelve of these already or thirteen of these whatever man an js put this one in the grash with all the rest f them also i have a new album i'll be releasing the cover later by i wount to they think you o the fan by telling you a secret that i've been kipin from ye for the last to years which is that mis aam s ae valu ortar poets department a cover right now that tat thank you i she does not love you shedoes not care about you she does not know you i'lleve ever in met my favorite cut away actually here was miley cyrus the cut awan mleast i is in the elecwas really really funny the the cut awan miley by miley was mi cott cannot blieve this lady and honestly point sor miley cyrus for that then she released the actual cover and a the cover is of course a lady half clad in bad because this is hollywood and its called the tortured poets department all's fair in love and poetry new album the tortured poets department out april nineteen eleven point eight million likes almost immediately on the instus oh oh ocas these are some of her brilliant lyrics some of her brilliant lyrics quote and i ents her into evidence my tarnishe coat of arms my mus is acquired bruisis my talismans and charms the tick tick tick of love boms my veins of pitch black ing all's fair in love and poetry sincerely the chairman of the tortured poets department oh sheis the tenthgray girl and shes starty for and again i hope she gets married to traviscelsy and has babies and grows the efop because i cannot stand any more of reading the lyrics of her albums that read a seventeen year old girl made another album about how tortured she is in how sad she is but really inside she is deeply happy but she is really sad do not care it is stupid ats that is your music industry that is hoer grahme's up tate now on to more serious matters the bide deministration is nobine the mind that therein is that americans at do not trust them on emigration the reason americans do not trust them an emigration is because they have basically declared that they are in favor of open boarders gobin is currently pulling at i i cet you not thirty seven per cent has tha thorty seven percent approval rating that is not a reelectrating not remotely on imigration he is deeply underrothirson enbysee pull by the way that same enbese pull has him losing to donald trump by five points forty seven to forty two an it has republicans ahead on the generic ballat by four points right now thes are very bad numbers for jobidon not only that again on imigration the american people do not trust jobidon and they thing that he has the unalateral ability to actually stop the mass ofe wave of elegal imigration that we have ben seeing because in fact he does ands what they believe correctly is that the bide deministration has made in overt decision that they wished the border to remain open and son he protests and he says they does not actually have the bility to shut the boarder no one believes him especially when you have allahandromaoricus the head of the department of home lan security who is currently theoretically can be im peachd by the house suggesting that we actually need more migrants in the united states he actually said this at duringthe interview with the nar times what would not it be more orderly would't it be responsible governants to be able to deliver a lawful pathway to fill what we have which is a labor nee and cut the exploicative smugglers out and give the individuals pat to arrive at lawfully safely in in orderly way to perform labor that we need they can senterments his home they can return home in their work is done is not that an element of a workable imigration system and ut when asked what what i'm hearing you say is you would to expand legal pathways in order to relieve some of the pressure on the southern borderwere people commin ilegally and he said yes and to fulfil one of the golds for emigration system yet theyt be yes to more migration according to alehandro maoricas and tht dunt early care other its legal or illegal ad ents of being basically the same thing this is why presumably jobidon continues to keep the border open now the game that democrats ere playing is their traing to get republicans to take ownership of the open boarder the way they are publicans to take ownership of the open border is to craft e quittincl by partisan emigration bill that when things continue to sock they can then say republicans helped craft the bill it is their fall now all the political dynamics are moving against demigrats democratic representative but rob manendas of new jersey he says that support for masty portation has now doubled which of course is true because this is what happens when you decide you let in literally six to seven milliony legal imigrants over the course of the last three and a half years minnimum then you stand on pol at this fying thirty one percent of american support piora tising maskyn portations of all people living in this country a lakaly that is ot from fifteen percent in twenty nineteen the language of tupker po pressen an batan all the way on dowt is that n wore about polling and politics or you believe its actually languace about policy i thint it is a lot of o polit excepte goton t e last several years people see te situation at the borter and the responding to the republican narrative around whats happening at the border is not there is a global migration challenge between global a climate change between faile governments and our hemispere there is a chalene at reet tou redress at the recaus an also how its appearing at our border but when you look at what republicans whet re pubkans talk about when you talk bout a massin vasion you here texas republicans talking about when you talk about things o repolicemen theory thesar things that have that've gaine t hold in our electric is thatuat republicans are talking about because they think its if they an if they can come olicans fericy thery thats dangerous ing op that i mericans will trust them when you see the rise an support for mastry portations it is in respars to a dangerous republican narrative oh is the dangerous publican narrative that is the problem okay not the gigantic way of of illegal migration by the way every one knows whould is the facilitaing you legal imigration lit is hm oon this in just one moment first nobody likes to talk about life inturns but it is incredibly

moments of the last seventy two hours was seanen was talking to experts on imigration and theye are talking about the fact that some of the legal imigrants who beat up cops last week actually would go and commit crimes in new york and then theywoud go spend the money in florida and then they would come back to w w york and the question was askedby se in an anchors why they coming back to new york whin that to stay on in florda and a the illegal migration expert john miller whose the chief lawn forsemen an intelligence annalist for sentom he says i'm the reason thy comeback to ne york is cause they will not be deported if ther in new york and the sin an anchors are oh oh that is awkward its individuals i went over there rapshets yesterday multiple charges grandlarsony robbery attempt at robbery grandlarsny grandlarsny a this particular cruoperated on mopeds and schooters they were doing organized retail taft they were doing snatches on the street i fonds i pads clothing on and forth i one of them that they are still seeking as ten charges on one day because he is part of a patin that is been going on and i'm looking at the dates that theyre rest started which is probably close to when they got here the only been there couple of months wat the detectives are telling me is they have cruise here that operate in new york do all their stealing then go to flarted to spend the money and then come back on won they to stay ind stealin flartin that it is ther you go to jail oh oo then the sin angs a oh you mean being looson imigration means that magrans take advantage of that now that is sotly crazy oh ow that is that super awkward well a kim jeoffreys of course at tempting to get repullicans taye ownership of this the house minority leader he wants the r publicans stake this up in the house because you realized il get polly half a republicans an all democrats to bot in favor of this and jeffreys was asked marngjus this aggregate what is in this bills this giant border bill is not actually border bill it contains but sixty billion dollars an ade you crane contains fourteen billy dollars and aide who israel it contains as we will see three billion dollars and aid to goza which presume we will go directly into terris pockets because that is hout works we send aid two places theyre governed by terrist and it give some money four the bordr twenty billion dollars for various bord priorities including by the way a bunch of money to quonnt quat non profit groups to facilitate ill legal emigration services and were down at the border and hely just tall you these non profit roups are literally facilitating i legal migration out of the border ther thay they have signs at the borders ing govis way to avoid border patrol come over to os it they basiclly are creating sanctuary pathways into the united states in any case yeres a keem jeoffreys trying to ake toclam that we to pass all this is a package the reason he wants that of course is because the boll here is to get republicans to sign off on bad border bills that they cannot run on it in the twenty twenty four election here he was and we need a comprehends to bill you saw the speaker yesterday say that hes can bring a stand alone israel bill to the floor of the house you response what wella value wate that legislation over the next te days i then on tuesday morning house themo crasswill meet as ta concas you might be open to it oh to theside the way forward as a relates to americas nassonal security priorities clearly we have got to support israels ability to defend itself against hamos and to tefeet hamos we also need to make sorad that we are doing everything possible to bring the hossag is home including american citizens and to be able to serg homanitarian assistance the palistin ins civilians who are in harms way in casat the no fault of their own beyond that we also have to address the assno security priorities of the american people in other parts of the world first than foremot certainly to support in crains effort to pus back against restent aggression also to support or allies in the in the pacific ti on japan south caree the legislaton being put forth by house republicans does none of that the responsible approach it is a comprehensive one to address americas nasmo security prirt of course the opposite the actual responsible approach would bo to approach each one of these bills is a separate giant bilties are big bills and in fact that is something that republicans are currently presuing sir republicans very early oninoust process tried to pass a fourteen billion dollar aid to israel bill they did by having iress tacks offsets and the goal was to cput in one place in order you spend in another an ow's responsible bill but democrats rejected it and they did on the basis that they did not the offsetting stuff now the republicans are lo kay will call your bluff we will put forward a bill in the house that just pass of the ade israel reject tat at your own parel which seems to me smar politics because agan of democrats r cn a clam tha the actually support israel inthe face of genecitle terrorism then presumably thy sould be able to do that without any preconditions just pass the clean bill just do it if democrats will not that suggest that perhaps they have another set of priorities o case what exactly is in this border bill you'r being told a pack of lies about this border bill ay you'r being told fr example that it ends catch in release i've read the bill three hudred seventy pages long there is may be forty or fifty relevant pages lot of i is tat you crane aide a lot of it is about crack downs on on drug cartells that re that are traffic in fetinal and all the rest but the kee border provisions do not in fact end catch and release there is nothing in there that for example requires attention of everybody until they can be fully a judicated in a cart and there is no bilding of giant facilities that would allow for the massd attention of people plas it also leaves in place the call floora settlement which suggest that children cannot actively be detained with parents which means the children get released into te country and then in order to reconnect the parens you actually in up releasing the parinton o the country ot as well morgan goes through some of the provisions in this bill the bill is not good the bill may be slightly better than the way that jobidon is currently practicing but it certainly does not mansate anything from jobidon that he is not already able to do under current law it is go through it right now because again most of th people whor can be commenting onthe bill hof not actu read the bill ispent this morning reading the bll it is moren this not just once second first if your most americans it canta struggling to make ends meat everything is a lot more expensive than it used to be by the time you pay the bills fill up your cargo grocery shopping there might not be them much left you are laying out your creticard more than you and last i check your average creticar intrustrate for americans it is now twenty four per cent which is in sane sove get behind on that creticardett get a probem lof the ona home i want you to call my friends in american financing right now interest rates hav finally dropped into the fives that is the lowest they have ben for a long tune call american financing and talk about their refinance options they save their customers and average of eight hundred fifty four buk to month by tapping into their home aquity and wiping out high interestocratic cardett think about it a hur fifty four bucks that is a ten thousand dollar rais every year what a relief that could be for you and your family do not wait to take control thour finances the rates might not last long act today call american financing and eight six six seven to one three three zero zero and if you call to day you might not have to make next months mortgage fayment that is eight six six seven to one thirty three hundred orvis american financing dot net animalus wonty two three three four amlis conto mer acisit or eight p ar for rates in five started six point four zero six per cent for well calld fi barwers cl eight six six seven to one thirty three hundred for details about credit costs and terms here is where it begins one it first has two point three billion dollars for refugy and entrance assistant activities a thetter thet are currently legal that would be a two poin three billion dollar give way to many of the non profet organizations that i was talking about and by the way down to bore some of thse non profet organizations are actively facilitating you the limigration not just people ocross the border and then they want o disappearinto the interior unti these non profits literely just bring them food bring them water shuttle them into the interior of the country and theree ben pretty surious allegations that some these non profits are outright in gage ne legal activities helping to break down the border wall when border patrol is not actually present there is about three billion dollars for u s a id and goas as i sat is notcjus aide for israel it is also aid for goza the is a provision in there that requires u say id give report to congress about how much of that age is being redirected in stolen by commoss or other terras scrps there is nothing there that man dates to cut off in funs if a certain percentage of those funs and up being handled by terrorists it has three poine for billion dollars and hiring an associated cost for ou a citizenship and emigration services including a hundred twelve million dollars for non personal operations including transcription services peresemn we for all the judicial herings and five hundred million dollars for facilities and forty nine million dollars for training related expences what exactly with those trenuralated expenses be whle for border patrol they would have to be trained to include descallation strategies and methods i dentifine screening and responding to bulnerable populations the im pact to bor security operations on natural resources thring they got som environmentalists lectures the border patrol and they have to be lectured on quote relevant cultural socital ratial and religious training we have diversity training for the border patrol officers very very interesting suff now the core of the borer provisions of this bill do not an cachin release and they create a sort of manditory quon quot shut down buthey are't actually shut down the shuttling into the country they just shuttle everybody over to ports mentry here is what it sasin a lot of this is the direct text to the bill section two thirty five b under the bill quot non custodial proceedings this the partri read it nes at in't understand i'm hering from various centers including curso asynima that this ends catchion release i do not understand how under section to thirty fiv be quote the secretary based upon operational circumstances they refer in alien applican for admistion for proceedings described in the section if the alien indicates an intention to apply for protection determination or expresses a credible fear of persecution or torture cay nout aget these be non custodial proceedings as you mak understand the language of english custodial proceedings would be were you get held non custodial proceedings a re you get released into the interior of the united states in fact it says that clearly aliens referred for proceedings under the section shall be released from physical custinot may be released shall be released from physical custody and process in accordance withthe proceedures described in the section an adult alien including ahead of household wo has been referred for proceeding under the section shall be supervised under the alternatives to detention program of you ess it migration in customs inforcement immediately upon releae fom physical custody and continuing for the duration of such proceding what would that amount to it could be house or astic could be tat we put an ankle bracelet onu it could be that we just releasing insto the interior relit come back at a certain date the secretary shall enshirts o the greatest extent practicable that the referl of a family unit for proceedins under the section includes all members of such family fo our traveling together you should try to if one person claims asylum you can treat them all is if they have been claimed asylum and theyu're going to release them into the interior again none of the supplies to unaccompanie miners if an alien receives a posit ife protection determination there immedliately issued employment authorization if they are judicated that they have refuge you status immediate before they leave the before they leave the building they get a card that effectively says they can work in the united states an of course reen over ti florus which says that their campy any family separations that remains in place as well now section thirty two o two of the bill actually loosins the definition of what it means to claim asylum there is been some talk about the strengthening the definition of what it means to claim asylum will talk about that provision one second but the baseline clam of asylum actually gets loosen here by definition section thirty to o two sais you ave the declare a credible fear right the original definition that gets change i used to say that there had to be a significent possibility that the alien could establish oligibility for asylum cay that was changed to a reasonable possibilityes now in order clemisilemu just have to show a reasonable possibility that you could establish olligibility for asylum this bill actually loosens the definition of a credible fear t eshu makes it easier to claim asylum not harder now the alien does have to show to receive actual asylum that there are no reasonable grounds for concluding the alien could relocate to another location in the alien's country of nationality or in the case of an alien having no nationality another location in the aliens country of last ibitual residence what is that mean that means that if you travel up from hondoris to the united state you have to show number one if you want actual legal asylum you have to show that you couldn' hav just relocated in side hundorus and two they ou could not have relocated in mexico as you were passing through mexico righty that that that would be the definitionist but that does not solve the problem because of course the vast majority people who are claiming asylum are not doing legally even the definition of asylum is somewhat irrelevant if people are simply coming claiming that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing asylumn then released into the interior and all of this of course tdepends on the actual inplementation becase if you ave a bunch o border patrol officials whoave been instructed by the ad ministration to be really loose about how they apply these rules it does not matter what the lossas they will just allow people through and then those people never show up again people hore saying this is a strict borderbill are focussing in on the redefinition of reasonable grounds right to that that if you actually claim asylum and then you show up for your secondary date or you show up and you say i have a credible fear of returning o my home country that you have to make a reasonable showing not aht not at again a significant possibility a reasonable possibility you cannot relocate yor country of origin or the cannot stand mexico yen all youud have to say presumably is i cannot stain my country of origin because i have a credible fear that in my

germy's valentines day sail the best way to treat your valentine and yourself uk am meanwhile the other element of this border bill the called borde security bill that a supposed to make conservatives feel more comfortabll is burb is is what is called border emergency authority here is how the system works and hearing a lot about this particular system in the mediat to day some actual read you the sections from the bil that ar relevants zactlets going on first the secretary there is of homerand security may activate the border emergency authority if during a period of seven consec cutive days there is an average of four thousand or more aliens are encountered each day a gaso just to get that stryt you are talking about a seventy period in which you average four thousand border en counter a day that by the way is actually in under camp because it aswill discuss in one second the way theyou actually du the border account tdoes not apply to children from non conctiguous countries i e mexico or canteaso that border count does not include kid to ar arriving from hondoris or a'll sovador for example it does not apply to aliens not from mexico or canida and it does not count godaways for people who simply rush across the border and we do not actually arrest them at the border the bord patrol does not actually encounter them that does not count if you have a thousand people two thousand people whore entering between ports of entry and they are just escaping into the interior and we know there there because we have cameras all along the borderhave been down of te southern border as you can seel vor a daily whirer we dat a whole documentry on this those people do not count toward the count there is a wild under count butif you are at four thousand a day right which again is going to amount to over the ports of a year one point for six million people entering the country if you areat four thousand a date then these secretary is allwed to activate ves this border of bord emergency authority the secretary must activate the border emergency authority if during a period of seven consecutive calender calender days tere's an average of five thousand or more aliens oare encountered every day that would be one point eit two five million people per year that is the cut off point where the secretary must activate emergency authority what is that mean that that emergencye authority all right now if you arrive at say the san magelgate which is where i was in that vidio down in arizona that is not a port of entry if you' arrive at th port of entry border patral wil still pick you up and there is the cud detensions enthere a mile away your process within seventy two hours urin the country the border emergency authority would allow the secretary of holan security if thereare four thousand and mandate that the secretary of homansicurity if there are five thousand tell everybody you cannot be process yere you have to be process at a local point of entry are youve to go to a port of entry in order to be process now it is un clear whether a you show up at the border bore patrol simply drives you there maybe maybe the now you are on american soil are you pushed back across the bordnage drop you back across theiother side of the gate or do they now put you inta bos and instead of them bussing you a mile away they simply buss you to the local port of entry when it comes to the port of entry during any activation of the border emergency authority the secretary shall maintain the capacity to process and continue processing a minimum of one thousand four hundred inidmissible alienceach calender day he cannot shall down to borth ports ventry hest actually continue at a minimum to alow fourteen hundred people a day into the country via these ports of entry an now dos that solve the problem somehow i'm failing to see how it does if and then is it turns out they pok a bunch of holes in thi supposed emergency authority for example the secretary shall not activate the border e mergency authority during the first calender year from ore than two hndred seventy calende r days during the second calender yoar for more than two hundred and twenty five calender days during the third calender year fro more than a hundred eighty calender days even if ou're getting fifteen thousand people o day in your two youe can only activated for tweundred twenty fie days during your three for a hundred an eighty calender days half the year it simply th usandth auply there is no way to actually maintain this you cannot it is not lickan open ended border authority to shut it down fave five thousand a day even to day that only applies for two undred seventy calender days why precisely it ulet let' say the ear the drugcard hels why not facilitays thse people will not be process rey the're not process ybecase they are literally stopped from processing if the border security if it is shot and portsventry cant process everybody let us say you the drugcard hells why not now bring it ten thousand people a day do it for two undr seventy days and they can do this just do it every day five thousand six thousand people a day they get rejected for two undred seventy days nowt's exhausted the border authority now i cannot use semergency authority any more see still its to process everybody who shows up or keep it at five thousand and one and if you ive it a five thousand and one for twenter seventy straht days then on day two seventy one of the year you fled the border with twenty thousand people the drugcar tells are capable of doing this they run the border i've been down at the board they have literal drug cart help drones that are flying over the american side of the border and monitering every specific bordr patral agent according to this bill the secredtary tshall suspend activation of the border emergency authority not later than fourteen calender days after the date on which there is during a period of seven consecuntive calender days in average iof less than seventy five per cent of the en counter level use for activation in other words the border the border emergency authority has to be then revote within fourteen days of the numbergoing down to one thousand two hundred and fifty border en counters per day batti that is by law what is more there is another hole that is poke in this which is if the president fines it is in the national interest to temporarily suspend the border emergency authority the president may direct the secretary to suspend the use of the border emergency authority on an emergency bays us the pret jobidin let say that that mayorcus is man dated they are five thousand a day for seven days he is man dated to kick in the emergency authority bidin can suspend it badn can say not do not want you to do it now the secretary shall suspend the border emergency authority for not more than forty five calender days within a calender year notwithstanding on any limitations on th use of authority that means that the secretary can than overrule the presidents after forty five days when you talk about two hnd on seventy days what you really mean is if the president used as authority you are a ready down to two hundred and twenty five days in your two you are already down two one hundred eighty days and in your three youare already down to a hundred and thirty five days that border emergency authority could even be used even if they wanted to all by the way all border cases all cases under this bill cand now no longer be resolved by the fifth circuit fort of appeals which is a much more contr t ive circuit court instead it kicks all of them over to the desey circuit court of appeals why why is the desy circuit cort of appeals they left when court anse they will do exactly what democrats want them to do does this thing shut the border in any serious way there lot of people claiming this the very harsh border put bor control method it does not man date nearly anything the thing that it mandates is not in end to catchin reles the thing that it mandates is not in fact a lower andmean abasically makes the new supposed cap one point eight million and it really is not one point aigt mllion it is well an accessive to million it does not count any ofthe godaways basily the new normal is one point aight million people are sayng well but that is a shall that is that is where the the secretary comen securit hy must do the thing but he can' do it under yes but there you no wian secretormaorchost to kick thes thing in that forty nine hundred ninety nine i'm not is see no evidence that he will more than that he can poecoles in this every which way the gull here for democrats is very clear get republicans to sin on to the bills that can then claim that anything that happens after this is somehow also republican's fault that is the glown does it create any long standing serious changes to the system the only longstanding seriis change to the system that would be a positive anywood would be the changes to the actual standard for asylum i doubt would actually be ae a good change to the system but is that worth buying into jobidon simply applying the law as he sees fit here anyway again political ownership of the issue verses a change to law jobidon is bucking the law is at curently stands his he an a firmative obligation is president of the united states toen forceporta law he is not doing it passing more law is not going to change that fact that' simply conto make republicans politically complicit in whatever jobidon does with the border ay the reason that jobdon is doing all this is because he feels the threat from his left he feels threatso he is trying to basically have the baby with this border bill that is going nowhere by the way speaker of the house my johnson says the thing as he men coming ut for a votes stevscollys now when i dn bring tis up for a vote it to bad bill were not doing it the reason that jobidan is pushing far to the left on things a migration is because he truly believes the only way's gon awin is to got out he left wing bas this a wrong calculation by him the way thathe is gone awin if he does whin is by winning a few ruale white vots an wining over suburban women that is the actual way that he winds the problem for jobidan is that he is a bad ganded it jobidon yesterday he suggest is is the weardest race that he has ever been and while i know join the clubded olor i'm feeling good about where we are i really am the folk sir or starting fokuss in an be gi wer reneagainst sir hes ihe is not foreignythin he is against everything o meis thors the weardest cannot fany evnisseen worse tho e terms es behaver then the last time it twoin e twent i'm i'm this is this the wearist race hes ever been in i mean i'll give him that is the superweard race but tom trump is by the way upright now i mean the poles are what the poles are and again downs from sortif weird distractable nature is one of the reasons that i think people this plater look i the distracthed guy rat than the goi whose lazer focust on doing dumb crap in donald trump spent the weekend actively telling people that he loks elvas pressly i'm not getting he actively did that he went on his truth social page and he put out in actual image of himself in which he is mashed up with elvas and he says that some people have been telling ma look elvis and most americans co fina id rather have that then what you have currently emma send be ceives at a very un comfortable interviewit the black voter where the black loderwas a the ecconomy is godunder trump and i the economy right now ot no you are hearing that is theres bebelieve your werbit who were he'v go withouts o er consider for shore alot o my paser povosly by soi ee oger wes olwe ol e what is weol for i for pres and chop wa cot allwe all an ther ci choe by the y well we we oll w by e we ware we shal at that is hain that only thing that ut her allen ale ea alre a in e that o chol we had mone by the way many of the issues that have been raised against on trum including classfid documen stuff the probem is the jobidon is done the same sort of stuff according to axios presiden bidin steam is now concerned that special council robert hurds investigation inubidin's handleg and classfid documents will hurt his reelect campaign bi needs don aspec criminal charges but they believe that hers report will include em barrassing details possibly with photoes on how bidin store documents because again class fi documens were in his garage and also any private offis that he used if the entire rip on donald trump is that he is very careless of classfi documents becaue he put boxes on the stage an marlago well i mean dat's awkward for jobidon according to axios anthony coly of former senior at bizer to maric garland caught the bidin steam attention recently when he wrote the bidin in those in his orbit had knowin to blame but themselves for garlan to ploning a special council coley said bidan seem was not initially transparent about the documents and put garland into kno wind situation this could certainly hurts go bidon's rea campankas again one of the points he is using against trump he she is ourresponsible the adulter back in theroomand the i turns out he is done a lot ofthe same stuff the donald trump has done and this is why he keeps doubling down on the on the wild left wing policy he is now pandering to the worst parts of his bas ape that receives enormous blowback over the weekend but happens t be trues by persen im steven

lose michigan nd therefor lose the election and all he needs is cover from the media which he is getting the entire ne york times now dedicated to the proposition that the crisis in the meleast was not cause bakomas actively attacking and murdering some twelve hundred jews and kinnapping to undred forty others that the cris in the middle east is israel fighting back against kamas and literally every day there just plastering on the front pages the suffering of the poor people of gaza all of which by the way could be ended right now allcomas has to do is walk out of the tunnels with their hands up with the hostages in to releast the hostages go into exile and all of the violencs stops tomorrow that is the end of the violands and then when rebuilding fase but the near time's not calling for that they want israel to agree to a cease fire leaving kamas in place leaving them alive which is insane which is wy than yor times is putting out piece is about suffering in gaza with all sort tof the picturers in the hospitals and all the rest of the sorstuff again the people responsible for the sorkomas all this is terrible i was suren't happening welse whiches it were not happening the is railly population these ray government i know that cause they were not doing this from two thousand five to two thausand and twenty three none of these picturers were available in two thousand five to two thousand twenty three wy tbecaus ir was not a masbombarbment af military arias of gaza because gaza despite the fact that they were in fact comasol firing rockes in israel had not slaughtered twelve hundred jews meanwhile nichlas kristoff doing his usual rution what can we possibly say to the childrn of osithit is literall title of apies from the excrable neck kristov over the your times what can be possibly say to the children of goza i mean the thing that you can say to the children of goza is mabe your parents should not have supported a terro group and maybe yor parents right now should expel that terro group from their leadership maybe that would be the solution nick kristov says my government is on the side engaged from y present biden has referred to is indiscriminaboming this not the same is deliberately targeting cevilians but this time as a tax parum helping to paid for those bombs not youvebeen payng for bombs of indiscriminate bomming for a while becaus youveben spend sending aid tas an american taxpare i have too we have been senting aid tru the goza strip the acamos and all that aid wen to bilding terra tunnels and rockets e been paying actually for indis truly in discrimna bmming for quite a wile but this of course is the is the the idea here is that israel is supposed to essentially pre emtively stop its war against comoss which of course is ridiculous o the democratic party is caught between a rock and a hard places on the one hand there istill some democrats who realize that hey comoss should be defeated on the other hand they are wetted to this peculiar idea that unless israel is forced into concessions to terrorists then middle eastern conflicts becomes more broad and inevitable which of course is a lie it is a lie you knon't createsminleation conflict weakness as always preceptions of weakness our death in the middle east an it is the united states attempting to make israel weaker by restricting their activities against goza that is the entire thing you cannot hold these you thoughts at once you cannot say tha you wish terrorsm to lose and also that you wish israel to negotiate with terras you cannot do those wo things tht that is exactly the by administration is doing it is on the one hand youof hakim jeoffreys correctly saying that the united state should not put conditions on allies defending themselves that is correct about on the ideisreal several members progressive members of your cocas have said that they wantsome conditions now a mad is realy cleangyour fellow new york consom notindia a cossio courtas when you say to that foither has ta right ot to defendiself and also of course the responsibility to conduct it is war in the man or consistent with the inst anase the rules of conflict we should not put conditions on the ability of any of our allies to defend themselfs puttictly against the rutal teroris resime hamoss he is right about that but at the same time y of jakesullivan the national security adviser saying we needed two states solution and they keep saying this over and over as tough you can just wishcas states in to existence which is totally crazy with whom with whom there is no government that ought to be a government of any self respecting state there is no de radicalized population the you radicalize population in place th gazastrip and less bangus twenty percent of the population maximum maximum but that lusy talking about you see any prospect at all these seems to have bee ruling it out prev preminetion and yawho of some kind of a long term dea that leads to a palistanian state the you es position on this is very straightforward the only long t rm answer to pece in the region to israel security in the region is it tostate solution with israel security guaranteed a palistonian state that also has a security guarantees for israel that is what we are gon to keep working for we were doing that before october seventh i think since october seventh the need to work on that i has only increase and we would to deliver an out that is over railing the tasson cremsary that is crazy we stop in there that is nots when he says that since october seventh we need to give more concessions to the people who actively did the terror attack that is preemptive surrender that is crazenat's all kida attacks the united states on in elevin and he us governmen immediately says what can we do for youasama what areyour demands you ont our baseis out of the out asality ok it maybe we can do that we ans it accelerate that we n make that happen for you wat is it what in the actual wenia and the answers beaus n ornathiona of plan t mitalies they do not their plan in the the least is to futs around nonsensically beause they do not understand the middleeast in any real way shape perform and wat that amounts to is randomly lashing out at empty buildings and occasionally hitting a camel in the ass yelling at thes railies that they probably should kill fur commoss members or that urban war is really bad and war is bad yal every one knows and then making weird concession signals to aron this is their actual plan tdain abash called jakesaldan on this sheus you keep saying that you do not wanto enterinto original conflict is this already original conflict or on's terror arms extend to syria a roch lebanon yemmen the the is rit licter all over the place just yesterday the youesan ou ka i responded to whut the rabpls and yamen theyre engaging in retain attacks on shipping in the rad se there are near daily strikes between israel and hasfala and matodetitruded and the war between israel and hammath my collegue peter burg and sfarley pen ad ot o this conflict involve ten contry is at least for major terriscroupt if he it is already ariginal conflict well tan of what i would say is that these are distinct but related challenges for example what is happening in the red sea is obviously to a certain extend a triggerd by what is happening in gaza but it is not the same thing the hothy's archeshitting ships ae related israel they are hitving a lot of different ships from a lot of different countries and we are trying to deal with the challenge to freedom of navigation in the red sea that is a distinct challenge it is always fun when they pretend that it is distinct challenge when the same exact group i sponsering all with is namely the goverment o bron beagain refusal to acknowledge reality ands in more conflict and entin more war and it ends in more dath ok in just a second we are going to get to

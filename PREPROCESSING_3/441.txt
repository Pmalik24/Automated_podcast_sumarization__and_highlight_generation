welcome to the youeremagus sciencesciencepactoi m indrucuberman and ofm a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to discuss the gut and the brain and we are going to discuss how your gut influences your brain and your brain influences your gut as many of you probably know there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling which tends to be something that you seem to know without really knowing how it that is one version of the gut feeling the other is that you send something in your actual gut in your body and that that somehow drives you to think or feel or act in a particular way maybe to move toward something or to move away from something now today we are not going to focus much on the psychology of gut feelings but on the biology of gut feelings and how the gut and brain interact because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain both directly by way of nuron's nerve cells and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body which permeates up to your brain and impacts various aspects of brain function but it works in the other direction to your brain is influencing your intire gut and when i say entire gut i do not just mean your stomach i mean your entire digestive tract your brain is impacting things how quickly your food is digesting the chemistry of your gut if you have not be stressed or not strest whether or not you are under a particular social challenge or whether not your particularly happy will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut and the chemistry of your gut in turn will change the way that your brain works i'll put all that together for you in the context of what we call the gut microbiom the gut microbiom are the trilians of little bacteria that live all the way along your digestive tract and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works at the level of metabolism in mune system and brain function and of course we will discuss tools things that you can do in order to maintain or improve your gut health because as you will also soon see gut health is immensely important for all aspects of our well being at the level of our brain at the level of our body and there are simple actionable things that we can all do in order to optimize our gut health in ways that optimize our over all nervous system functioning we will be sure to review those to day this episode also serves as a bit of a primer for our guest episode that is coming up next week with doctor just in soninberg from stamphord university doctor soninberg is a world expert in the gut microbiom and we will dive really deep into the gut microbiom in all its complexity will make it ll very simple for you we will also talk about actionwal tools in that episode this episode is a stand alone episode you will get a lot of information and tools but if you have the opportunityto see this episode first i think it will serve as a nice prim r for the conversation with doctr sonunberg before wou begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desirean effort to bring zero costoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens at letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the rease n i started taking athletic grens in the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called got microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probiocs to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer they' give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of dat an ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficion in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the five fre travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and petassium but it has no sugar 've talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolytes if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dot com slash hubermen andyoull get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dot com slash hubermen o k let us talk about the gut and the brain and how your gut in your brain communicate in both directions because as i mention before your gut is communicating all the time with your brain and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut and the two are in this on going dance with one another that ordinarily is below your conscious detection although you are probably familiar with the experience of every ones in a while getting a stomach eche or of eating something that does not agree with you or conversely eating something that you find particularly delicious and that sensation or that experience rather being a whole body experience your mind is excited about what your eating or just eight your gut is excited about what your eating or just eight and it seems to be a kind of unified perception of both brain and body to day were gong to talk about how that comes about in the negative sense when you meet some one you really dislike or w you ave a stomach ache and in the positive sense when you interact with somebody tht you really really can you to spend more time with them for instance or when you eat something that you really really and you to spend more time with that food to speak now the gut an the brain represent what we call a biological circuit meaning they include different stations station a communicates with station be which communicates with station see and on and as i mention earlier it is by directional ta two way street between gut and brain i want to make the important point at the outset that when i say the word gut when i refer to the gut i am not just referring to the stomach most of us think that the gut it quaits to the stomach because we think of having a gut or not having a gut or having a gut feeling of some sort but in the context of gut brain signaling and the related microbiom the gut includes the entire digestive tract that is right from start to finish the entire digestive tract much that to day we are going to talk about for instance the presence of nuron's nerve cells that reside in your gut that communicate to specific locations in the brain and cause the release of specific naro chemicals such as the nor chemical dopamine or seratonan that can modivate you to seek more of a particular food or type of interaction or behavior or to avoid particular foods interactions in behaviors and some of those nurons many of those nurons in fact reside in your intestins not in your stomach that can be in the small intestin or the large intestin in fact you actually have taste receptors and nurons located all along your digestive tract you have nurons that are located all along your digestive tract and they are communicating to your brain to impact what you think what you feel and what you do ou case o for the gut brain access we need to deal with the brain part and then we need to deal with the gut part let us just quickly talk about the brain part because theyre the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer in that when we say the gut brain access it does include the brain but includes a lot of other things as well as many of you probably know by now if you are listeners of this potcass an if you do not that is ine your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord and those together constitute what is called the central nervous system your nerl retinas which are the lining the back of your ies and are the light sensing portion of your eyes are also part of your central nervous system actually your eyes are part of your brain there the only parts of your brain that are outside the cranial vaulet your retinas your brain proper and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system the other parts of your nervous system constitute what is called the periferal nervous system which are the components of your nervous system that reside outside the retinas brain and spinal cort now this is very important because to day we are going to talk a lot about how the gut communicates with the brain and it does that by way of pariferal nervous system components meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain and cross into the central nervous system to influence what you think in what you feel that is the nervous system part of what we call the gut brain acis brain again just being a shorthand for including all the elements i just described gut as you now know includes all the elements of the digestive tract let us talk about the architecture or the structure of the gut of your digestive system now not surprisingly your digestie system ac your gut begins at your mouth and ends at your anes and all along its length there are series of sphincters that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract from the other chambers now also along this tube that we call the digestive tract there is great variation in the degree of acidity or p h as it sometimes cauled that variation and acidity turns out to give rise to different little micro environments in which particular microbioda microbacteria can thrive or fail to thrive and the way i you to think about the digestive tract this gut component of the gut brain ais is that it is not just one component it is not just your stomach with a particular acidity and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well to make you feel good and if emake your digestive pathways work well it is a series of chambers little micro environments in which particular microbiota thrive and other microbioda do not and certain behaviors that you undertake and certain experiences that you have will adjust those micro environments in ways that make particular microbioda certain bacteria more likely to thrive and others less likely dethribe well talk about how that was set up for you early in life actually from the moment that you came into the world that microbiom was being established it was actually strongly impacted depending on whether not you are born by c section or by vaginal birth a end it was strongly impacted by who handled you when you came into the world literally the hands that were on you how much skin contact you had whether not you ware a primi baby or not whether nt you had pets at home whether not you are allowed to play in the dirt whether not you are allowed to eat snails or whether r not you were kept in a very interceptic environment all of those experiences shaped these little micro environments and shaped what constitutes best or worse for those micro environments you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract and it is very very long in fact if we were to splay it outwards to take all the curves and turns out of the intestin we would find that it is very long it is approximately nine meters long now the structure of that digestive tract turns out to be very important in terms of gut brain signalling once again it is a tube and the hollow of that tube is call the lumin el u m e nd tut the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth at least not for significant portions of the digestive tract for much of the digestive tract they are bumps and grooves that looked very much the folds in the brain but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues thatre made up ot what is call them ou cosal lining there is a lot of mucus there and if we were to look really closely what we would find is that theire little hairy cellilar processes that we call microvilli that are able to push things along the digestive tract the microbioda reside everywhere along the lumin of the digestive tract starting at the mouth and all the way to the other end and they reside within those microvilli and they reside within the lumin and if we were to look really closely at the bumpsand grooves along the digestive tract what we would find is that theire little nichus little arias in which particular things can grow and reside best now i might some kind o gross but it actually is a good thing especially of what is growing and residing there or microbacterio organisms that are good for your gut and that signal good things to your brain and we will talk about what that signalling looks and how that is done and accomplishin justa few moments but i want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut something that we do not often see and often when we think about the gut again we just think about the hollow of the stomac foodd going in there and getting digested but it is far more complex and actually far more interesting than that now i have been referring to the gut micro biom and to the microbioda and these bacteria let me defind those terms e lobit more specifically just to avoid any confusion the microbiodar the actual bacteria the microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria but also all the genes that those bacteria make because it turns out that they make some important genes that actually impact all of us you have loads and loads of these little microbioda these bacteria in fact right now you are carryi ng with you about two to three kiligrams that is more than six pounds of these microbio to these bactria and if we were to look at them under a microscope a would see is these are relatively simple little organisms some remain stationary they might plop down into the mucosal lining or they might hang out on a particular microvili or they might be in one of those little nichis and others can move about but they basicly fill the entire lumine they surround and kind of coat the surface of the microvilli and they are tucked up into any of those little niches that are available to them to tuck into if you were to take the head of a pin and look at it under the microscope you could fit many many hundreds if not thousands or more of these little microbacteria and the reason i say many many thousands or more i'm giving up a cound of broad range there is that they do vary insize and again they various to whether not they can move or they do not move now they are constantly turning over in your got meaning theire being born to speak and their dying off and some will stay there for a very long periods of time within your gut and others will get excreted about sixty per cent of your stool as unpleasant as that might be to think about is made up of live and dead microbacteria you are constantly making and excreting these microbacteria and which microbacteria you make and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave meaning how many are excreted depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat and the foods that you do not eat now just because what we eat strongly influences ar microbiom meaning or microbacteria does not mean that there are not other influences on what constitutes are microbiom ar microbiomas also made up by microbacteria that access are digestive tract through our mouth through breathing through kissing and through skin contact in fact one of the major determinants of our microbiom is who we enteract with and the environment that we happen to be in and that actually includes whether not we interact with animals in a little bet i'll talk about some data as to whether not you grow up in a home that had animals whether not you grow up in to home whether not there was a lot of social contact me skin contact or whether not you grow up in a more animal sparse contact sparse environment and how that shapes your microbiom but the simple point is that what you eat influences your microbiom but also what you do what you think an what you feel and many of the little microbacteria they get into your digestive tract do by way of social interactions in fact if you ask a nurbiologist what the roll of the microbiom is they will tell you almost certainly that it is there to impact brain function but if you have friends that are microbiologists such as i do they will tell you well what maybe the brain and nervous system are there to support the microbyom it is the other way around you have all these lile microorganisms that are taking residence in our body they do not really know what their doing as far as we know we do not know that they ave a consciousness or they do not we cannot rule that out but it seems pretty unlikely none the less they are taking advantage of the different environments all along your digestive tract they are taking advantage of the sorts of social interactions for instance the people you talk to in that breathe on you the people you shake hands with the people tat you kiss or do not kiss the people that you happen to be romantically involved with or not your dog your cat your lizard your rat whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbio there is absolly no question about that hofully now you have some sense of the architecture of the digestive pathway and you have some sense of the trilians of little microbacteria that are living all along the ifferent components of that digestive pathway but what we have not talked about yet and what i'd to talk about now is what those little microbiota are actually doing in your digestive tract in addition it is living there for their own intents in purposes they are contributing for instance to your digestion many of the genes that those microbiota make are genes that are involved in fermentation and genes that e involved in digestion of particular types of new trants and in a little bit we will talk about how what you eat can actually change the enzimes that those microbiom components make enzimes largely being things that a responsible for digestion they catalize other sorts of cellar events but in the context of the digestive pathway wer talking about enzimes that help digestive food those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways and if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest it stands to reason that you would have challenges digesting certain types of foods the other amazing thing that these microbiota do is they change the way that your brain functions by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism of particular neuro transmitters one of the ways that having certain microbiota present in your gut cand improve your mood or degrade your mood for instance is by way of certain microbiota being converted into or facilitating the conversion of chemicals such as gaba gaba is in what we call an inhibitory nor transmitter it is involved in suppressing the action of other nurons and that might son a badthing but all types of sedatives for instance alcohol and a lot of nurons that naturally make gaba can help quiet certain circuits in the brain for instance circuits responsible for anxiety in people who have epolepsy the gaba urgic nurons as they are called can often be disrupted in their signalling meaning thei're not cranking out as much gaba and therefore the excitatory nurons which typically release other molecules gludimate can engage ing what is called run away excitation and that can give is rise to seizures the simple message here is that the microbiota by way of making neurochemicals can influence the way that your brain functions you want to support those microbiota and we will give you tools to support those micro biota but the take away at this point is that those microbiota are making things locally to help digest food other microbiota are helping to make certain nor transmitters gaba and will also talk about dopomine and seratonan and the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut have a profound influence on many many biological functions especially a mune system function brain function and digestion that should give you a fairly complete picture of your gut microbiom now i to talk about how your microbiom and your brain communicate or more accurately how your microbiome and the rest of your nervous system communicate nurons which simply means nerve cells are the sells that do most of the heavy lifting in your nervous system there are of course other cell types that are important gleal ells for instance very very important cell types you have endothelial cells which are responsible for blood flow perry sihtes and other types of cells but the nurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting for most of the things we think about in terms of nervous system function you have nurons in your gut and that should not surprise you nurons reside in your brain your sponicord your eyes in fact all over your body and you have got them on your heart and in your heart and you have got them in your lungs and you have got them in your spleen and they connect to all the diffent organs and tissues in of your body that is not surprising that you have nurons in your gut what is surprising however is the presence of particular types of nurons that reside near or in the mucosal lining just next to that lumin of the gut and that are paying attention and a'll explain what i mean by paying attention to the components of the gut both the neutrancs and the microbiota and thereby can send signals up to the brain by way of a long wire that we call an axon and can communicate what the chemistry and what the nutritional quality and what the other aspects of the environment are at the gut at a given location up to the brain in ways that can influence the brain to for instance seek out more of a particular food letme give you what a sort of action based picture of this but say most people you enjoy sweet foods i do not particularly enjoy sweet foods but there are few that i on of a succor for a really good dark chocolate or really good ice cream or igav this thing for donats that seems to just not quit although i do not tentindulg it very often i do them if i eat that particular food obviously digestion starts in the mouth their enzimes there gets chewed up the food goes down into the gut these nurons are activated meaning that clauses the nurons to be electrically active when particular component certain neutriante in those foods are present and for the cell types or i should say the nuron types that mater here the neutriancs that really trigger their activation are sugar fatyacids and a meno acids now these particular nurons have the name enturo endercrin cells but more recently they have been defined as nuro pod cells nuropod cells were discovered by giegobohorcuss lab at duke university this is a phenomenal set of discoveries made mostly in the last ten years these nuropod cells as i mention are activated by sugar fatiacids or a meno acids but have a particularly strong activation to sugars they do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system and even though onfocusing on this particular example they represent a really nice example of how a particular set of nerve sells in our gut is collecting information about what is there at a particular location in the gut and sending that information up to our brain now they do that by way of a nerve pathway called the vaguest nerve the vaguest nerve is part of the perferal nervous system and the vguest nerve is a lobic complex to describe if you are just listening to this if youare watching this i'll try nd use my hands as a diagram but really the best thing to do if you want really want to learn neronatomy is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can and if you contract down a picture of it terrific but heresout works nurons have a cell body that we call a soma that is where all the diena are contained that is where a lot of the operating machinery of the of the cells are contained and allow the instructions for that cell of what to be and how to operate are contain the cell bodies of these nurons ore the relevant nurons are actually up near the neck see can thing of them is kind of a a clump of grapes co cell bodies tend to be round or ovelish and then they send a process that we call and acts on in one direction out to the gut and they will send another process up into the brain and that low clustered near the neck that is relevant here is called the nodofs ganglian and o d o s e the notos gangling is locluster of nurons on either side of the neck it has a process that goes out to the gut in a process that goes up into the brain and again these are just one component of the call vaguest nerve the vaguest nerve has many many branches nocious to the gut they are also branches to the liver branches to the longs branches to the hart branches the larinx and even to the spleen and another areas of the body that are important but right now were just concentrating on the nurons that are in the gut that signal up to the brain and what the bohorca's lab has shown is that these nuropod cells are part of this network their sensing several different nutriants but in particular when they sent sugar they send signals and the form of electrical firing up to the brain in ways that trigger activation of other brain stations that cause you to seek out more of that particular food nwthis brings us to some classic experiments that at least to me are incredible and these are highly reproducible findings showing for instance that even if you by pass taste by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods into the gut and people can never taste them with their mouth people will seek out more of that particular food and if you give them the option to have a sweet food infused into their gut or a bitter food infused into their gut or a sweet verses sour or a more sweet verses less sweet food people have a selective preference for sweet foods even if they cannot taste them ow this is important understand in the contects of gut brain signaling because we always think that we sweet foods because of the way they taste and indeed that still true but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food also has to do with ta gut sensation that is below our conscious detection how do we know that well the bohorcas lab has performed experiments using modern methods and their classic experiments showing that animals in humans will actively seek out more of a particular sweet food even if it by passes this taste system nd the reverses also true there have been experiments done in animals and inhumans that have allowed animals are humans to select and eat sweet foods and indeed guts what they do if theyare given the option and yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these nurons within the gut that consents sweet foods now there are couple different ways that those experiments have been gun in classic experiments the date back to the eighties this was done by what is called subdivephromatic ve gotamy tht this means cutting off the branch of the vagus that inervates the gut below the diaphram that the other organs con still function because the vagus is very important but bacently cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut still giving people the opportunity to taste sweet foods of their mouth and they do not actively seek out quite as much of the sweet food when they do not have this gut sensing mechanism that we now know to be dependent on these nuropod sells more recent experiments involve selective silencing of these nuropod cells and there ben a lot of different derivations of the sort of thing but tho take away from it is that our experience of and oure desire for particular foods has everything to do withhow those foods taste it also has to do as you probably know with their texture and the sensation of those foods in ourmouth and even indeed how they go down our throat sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant and it also has to do with this subconscious processing of taste that occurs in the gut itself and again when i say gut idoncious mean in the stomach there are actually nuron's nuropod cells further down your digestive tract which are signalling to your brain about the presence of sweet foods as well as food such as a menoacid rich foods or foods that are rich in particular types of fatiacids signaling up to your brain and causing you to seek out more of those foods or to consume more of those foods now you are probably aking what is the signal how does it actually make me want more of those foods without me realizing it what does that by adjusting the release of particular nuromodulators for those of you that are not familiar with nurmodulators tiese are similar to nurro transmitters but they tend to act more broadly they tend act impact many more nurons all at once and they go by names dopomine ceratonaan a seato coline apineferan and forth sometimes people refer to those as nor transmitters technically they are nuromodulators i'll refer to them almost always is nuromodulators the nuropod cells signal by way of a particular branch of the vaguus through the nodose ganglion that we talked about before and through a number of different stations in the brain stem eventually cause the release of the nurmodulator dopomine dopomine is often associated with the sense of pleasure and reward but it is more appropriately thought of as a nuromodulator that impacts motivation craving and pursuit it tends to put us into modes of action not neces sarily running and moving through space although it can do that to but in the contects of feeding it tends to make us look around more che more reach for things more and seek out more of whatever it is that is giving us that sensation of delight or satisfaction and againd that sense of delight and satisfaction you might experience only consciously as the way that something tastes on your mouth but it actually is caused again by both the sensations in your mouth but also by the activation of these nuropod self this is an incredible system of gut brain signalling and it is but one system of gutbrain signaling it turns out its the system that we know the most about at this point in time there are other components of gupbrain signaling that will talk about in a moment for instance the ceretonan system but in terms of examples of gutbrain signaling for which we know a lot of the individual elements and how they work i think this nuropod nuron sensing of sweet foods fattyacids and amenoacids in the gut in communicating that up to the brain by way of the vaguust and causing us to seek out more of the foods that deliver those neutrians is an incredible pathway that really delineates the beauty and the power of this cup brain axis let me talk about time scales hurom talking about a particular type of nuron that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals to cause us to want to seek out a particular category of foods that is happening relatively fast compared to the hormone pathways of the gut which also involve nurons your gut is also communicating to your brain by way of neron's nerve cells but some of those nerve sells also release hormones and those hormones go by names c ce k glucugon peptide wan pwywy et cetera a good example of a hormon pathway or what sometimes call tha hormone peptide pathway that is similar to the pathway have talked about before but a little bit slower is the grellan pathway grellan g h re e l i n increases with fasting the longer it is been since you have eaten or if you are just eating very little food compared to your coloric needs grellan levels are going to go up in your blood stream and they go up because of processes that include processes within the gut and include the nervous system it is a slow pathway driving you to seek out food generally as far as we know the grellan system is not partial to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or on grellan increases the longer it is beensince you have eatin sufficient calories and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food whill how does it do that it does that again by impacting neural circuits within the brain neral circuits that include what we call the brain stem autonomic centere it tends to make you feel alert and quite a we say high levels of autonomic arousal if you have ne't eaten in a while you might think that ou just get really exhausted i because we all here that food is energy and coloric energy is what we need to burn but you sh have a lot of energy stored in your body that you would be able to use if you really needed energy but typically we have an eaten in a while we stare to get agitated and we get agitated by way of release of the nermodulator epinepran which causes us to look around more move around more and seek out food that all occurs in brain stem autonomic centrs and in the hypothalemus we did not entire episode on feeding behavior and metabolism as well and you can find those episodes that huberman labdot com do not want to going to a lot of detail byt hypothelemic and brainstemscenters but there is a particular area of the brain called the neucleous of the solitary tract the enas t is its called that is very strongly impacted by the circulating hormons and tends to drive us toward feeting behavior the important point here is that we have a fast system that is paying attention to the neutrians in our gut or the absence of neutrians and are gut and stimulating us to seek out food or to stop eating certain foos and we have a slower hormone related system that al originates in the gut and impacts the brain but all of those converge on nural circuits for feeding the neral circuits for feeding include things the arguent incleases the hypothelmas they include of bunch of other nurochemicals but the point is that you have got a fast route and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat lass i to seek out food and consume it or to stop eating an to essentially start the satiedy mechanisms as they are called and those are operating in parallel it is not one happens first than stops an the other the always operating in parallel and i bring this up because thereis a bigger theme here which we see over and over again in biology which is the concept of parallel pathways you have always got multible accelerators in multipl breaks on he system it is very very rare to have just one accelerator in one break on the system and this will become important later when we talk about tools for optimizing your gotmicrobaiom for healthy eating and for healthy digestion and for healthy brain function i wone to take a moment and talk about gluccugon peptide one which is also called g o p one g o p one is made by nurans in the gut end by nurans in the brain is a fairly recent discovery but it is an important one g o p one tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite there are number of drugs released on the market now one for instance goes by the name semaglutide which is essentially and go p one agonist it causes the release of morgi p one it is being used to treat type two diabedes which is insolent resistant diabedes as is different then type one diabedes where people do not actually make insolen it is also being used as a drug to reduce obisity and it seems pretty effective at least in certain populations there are certain foods and substance is that increase go p one ove talked about a few of these on the podcast one that i'm a particular fanu for entirely other reasons is erbamate t can stimulate the release of gio p one in south america its often used as an appetytes suppressent probably in large part because of its effects on gio p one release but probably also because it does contain caffine which is a bit of a stimulant which also can be ivolved in lipolysis which is the utilization of fat stores for energy and forth a brief mention about yerbamate there are some reports out there that erbamate can increase certain types of of cancers the data that i've seen on this is that it tends to relate to whether not those are smoked versions of the yerbamate te the amount of consumption and the debate is still out i invite you to look at those papers you can a search for those on line none the less yerbamate is one sorce of gio pe one stimulation semaglutide is another source it also can be stimulated by various foods nuts avocatos eggs and forth certain high fiber complex grains will also stimulate o p one i raise this as not necessarily i rout that you want to take in order to reduce food intake i do not even know that that is your goal but that g o p one is another one of these gut to brain signalling mechanisms that ad just appetite that is dependent on diet depends on what you eat or drink and that the go p one pathway does seem particularly sensitive to the constituents of diet there is at least one quality study i was able to find showing that the ketogenic diet for instance which almost always involves ingestion of very low levels of carbohydrate can increase go p one althouh as i mention before there are other foods that fall outside the the range of what we consider keeto genite that can also stimulate go p one and as i mention their prescription drugs somiglutide there other ones as well now the stimulate go p one how does go p one reduce appetite it does that in part by changing the activity of nurans in the hypothalemus this cluster of nurans just above the roof of our mouth that themselves make go p one and that cause the activation of motor circuits for reaching chewing all the things that we associate with feeding behavior i use go p one as an example of a pathway that you might choose to tap into by ingestion of your bomante or by ngestion of the foods i mentioned or it is something that interest you keetogenic diet but i also mention it simply because it is another beautiful example of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity of brain circuits that are directly involved in a particular behavior yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain in order to change what we think we want or to change what our actual behaviors are the next time you find yourself reaching for food or you find yourself wanting of particular sweet thing or fatty thing or something that contains a lot of a menoacids a proten rich food keep in mind that that is not just about the taste of the food and it is not even necessarily about the nutrients that you need or do not need it could be but it is also about this subconscious signaling that is coming from your body all the time waves of hormones waves of nerve cell signals electrical signals that are changing the way that euyour brain works and this raises for me a memory of the episode that i did with doctor robert supolski whos a world expert a colligomine at stamford who o is expert on things hormones and behavior but we got into the topic of free will which is a bit of a barbed wire topic a as many if t gets into the realm of philosophy et cetera and we were kind of batting back and forth the idea i was saying well i think there is free will and cant there certainly be free will or on or certainly the the idea that we can avoid certain choices and robert was saying no in fact he said na he does not believe that we have any free will he thinks that events in our brain are determined by biological events that are below our conscious detection and that occur seconds to milloseconds before we make decisions are assessments and therefore we just cant control what we do what we think in what we feel and at the time i orf did not by it i thought ii do not know i i just i guess i really wanted to believe in free will and to some extent i still do but as we talk about how these nurons and our gut and these hormons and our got are influencing our brain and the decisions that we are making at the level of circuits the hypothalymus and the neucleis of the solitary tract these are airies the brain way below our frontal quartex and our conscious perception think these are examples that really fall in the favor of what doctrisupulscu was arguing which is that events that are happening within our body are actually changing the way our brain work we might think that we want the cup cake we might think that we a do not need to eat something or duny to eat something and that t is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge and decision making that were making with our head but in fact it is very clear to me based on the work from the bohork slab classic work over the years dating back to the eighties and indeed back to the fifties that will talk about n a moment that our body is shaping the decisions that our brain is making and we are not aware of it at all now the good news is that whether or not you believe in free will or not the simple knowledge that this whole process is happening can perhaps be af benefit to you you can perhaps leverage it to get some insight and understanding and perhaps even a wedge into your own behaviour you mig thing ah i think i want that particular food or i think i want to avoid that particular food but actually that is not a decision that i'm making on a purely rational basis has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain we have largely been talking about chemical communication between the gut and the brain chemical because even though thes neuropod cells are communicating with the brain by way of electrical activity what we call action potensials and in nural language we call those spikes spikes of action potentials spikes of act shin potentials meaning those nural signals cause the release of chemicals in the brain dopamyg it is chemical transmission similarly hormones even though they act more slowly hormons nauro peptide why c c k grellin they are signaling chemically theyare moving through the body theire going in their affecting the chemical output of different cells and they are changing the chemistry of those cells and the chemistry of the cells of those cells talk to that gives us one particular category of signaling from gut to brain which is chemical signaling but of course there are other forms of signals and those fall under the category of mechanmical signalling you are probably familiar with this if you have ever eaten a very large meal or consumed a lot of fluid you experience that as distension of the gut and that does not just have to be distension of the stomach but distension of your intestins is wh ell that distension is registered by nurons that resided in your gut the signals go up to your brain and communicate with areas of the brain that are responsible for suppressing further consumption of food and or fluid and under certain circumstances can also be associated with the activation f nurl circuits that cause vomiting or the desire tovomit if ever you have eaten too much or you have eaten something that does not agree with you that information is communicated by way of mechanic censers that sends the mechanics of your gut possibly also the chemistry of your got but mostly the mechanics of your gut signal up to the brain an activ ate brain centers that are involved in stopping the eating behavior and activation of an arya of the brainstem that is affectionately for referred to as the vomit center among nuronatamis this is a area that mor appropriately is called the kemo receptor trigger zone the c ts or area postrema and nurons in this area actually will trigger the vomiting reflex the way that the got in the brain communicate is both chemical and mechanical and it can be both forsake of increasing certain types of behavior today we are talking mainly about feeding behavior up until now anyway but also ceasing to eat closing your mouth moving away from food turning away from food all behavors that were familiar with any time we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation of this mechano censor for gastric distress we have got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling and i also want emphisize that we have direct and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain direct signaling is the conisignaling of the sort i've been talking about mainly up until now which is nurons in the gut communicating with nurons in the brainstem that communicate with nurons in the hypothalmis and of course those are also going to interact with nurons of the prefrontal quartex which is the are of brain involved in decision making the i think it was the shrimp that made me sick i'minis ijusto want any more of that or i'm never going back to tat restauran again because after i ate thereabout an hour later i start feeling really not well i felt in a kind of feverish but my gut did not feel whal my digestion was really off all of that kind of information is handled in the prefrontal quartex at a conscious level but the immediate decision to stop eating or to eat more of something to move toward something or away from it that is made by neral circuits that reside at the we would say the subconscious layo level but what we really mean as below the level of the neo quartex below the quartex means essentially below our level of conscious awariness we talked about two types of information within the gut that are communicated to the brain chemical information meaning information about the neutrians that happen to be there and mechanical information distension of the got or lack of distension and forth and we talked about how these nuropodsells can signal the release of dopomin an circuits within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something now in a very logically consistent way dopa mean is also involved in the whole business of vomiting you might think lat us a make any sense i thought dopamin was always a good thing it is involved in moderation and reward et cetera but turns out that area postrema this vomit centr and the brainstem is choka block full of dopamine receptors and if dopamin levels go too high it can actually trigger vomiting and this we see in the contect of various drugs that are used to treat things parkinsins parkinsins is a a deficiency in dopamine or a lack of dopaminurons typically the causes arresting tremor difficulty in movement cause dopamins all associated with the lot of the nurl circuits for movement many drugs that are used to treat parkinsins aldopa increase levels of dopamine much or at least activate dopamine receptors to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain that they can cause activation of things the trigger to vomit now this should also make sense in the natural contets of if you gorge yourself with food gorge yourself with food gorge yourself with food the the nurons in your gut that respond to that are simply detecting the presents of neutriants but they do not really make decisions themselves they do not know to stop eating your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food and it is a wonderful thing that those nurons are communicating with areas of the brain not just that stimulate consuming more food but that are communicatng with areas of the brain for instance area postrema that when dopamine levels get too high cause us to either stop eating that food or in the case of vomiting to eject that food i raise this not to give you a kind of a disgusting counter example to what we call a peditive behaviors the things that we to do more of but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly even these refleces that we think of as feeling sick and vomiting or the desire to seek out more food are really being controlled by a kind of pushboll system by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut and the same narrow chemicals in this case dopamine are being used to create too opposite type behaviors one behavior to consume more one behavior to get rid of everything you have already consume our brain is actually sensitive to the amount of signalling coming from our gut not just the path by which that signal arrives our brain is very carefully paying attention to whether are not the levels of dopamine that are being triggerd are within a normal range for typical eating behavior or whether not we gorged ourselves to the point where enough already now of course mechanical signals will also play into arapostrema and into the vomiting reflects if we have a very distended gut we feel lousy it just itactualy can hurt very badly and we will have the desire o vomit or we will just simply vomit mechanical and chemical signals are always arriving in parallel they never work in unison and now we have chemical signals mechanical signals and o now w i'd to talk about direct and indirect signals because almost everything i have talked about up until now or direct signals a nurrl pathway that converges in the brain to create a particular feeling thought or behavior but they are also indirect pathways and that s what takes us back to the gut microbiom and to these little microbioda and to just give you the take away message that the front here and then i'll give you a little more detail as to how it comes about you have nerr transmitters in your brain and in your spinal cord and in your eyes an inor popherol nervous system they cause the activation or the suppression of nerve activity meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells whore they cause other nerve cells to be less electrically active and they do that by way of ner transmitters but as it turns out the gut microbiota are capable of influencing metabolic events and in some cases are capable of synthesizing nor transmitters themselves what that means is that these little bugs these little microbiota that are cargo in your got the six pounds of cargo they actualy can make nerrow chemicals that can pass into the blood stream and into your brain and actually impact the other cells of your body and brain indirectly without involving these very intricate nerve pathways that we been talking about in other words the foods you eat the environments of your gut microbiom can actually create the chemical substrates that allow your brain to feel one way or the other to feel great or to feel lausy to seek out more of a paricular type of behavior or to avoid that behavior and that would constitute indirect signaling ie been talking a lot about the structure and function of the gut to brain pathway focussing mainly on feeding behaviors and in some cases avoiding feeding or even ejecting food from the digestive tract i to drill a little bit deeper into this indirect signaling pathway from the gut to the brain because it bridges us nicely from neronal signals in the gut to the brain hormonal signals from the gut to the brain to what also includes the microbiom which is what we started talking about at the beginning of the episode they mention a couple of minutes ago certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize certain nerrow transmitters that can go impact the brain and we actuly hve some knowledge about which microbiota can synthesized particular ner transmitters for instance the neuromotulator dopomine can be synthesized by or from basyllus and seratia now these are just names of microbiodi do not expect that any of you would necesarily recognize them these are not the sorts of things you necessarily would run out and buy to get more dopomin but the point is that particular gut microbota can create dopomine in our gut that can get into our blood stream and can generally changed are base line levels of dopomin within the brain and other areas of the body i mention baseline levels of dopomine because as i talked about on an episode all about dopomine but ajus repeat the bas ics here now we have baseline levels of rtransmitters ar neuromogulators the act ive sort of the level of the tide the overall level and then we can have peaks of dopomine that are created by behaviors or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs et cetera basilisan seratea tend to increase are baseline levels of dopomi if it turns out that we are creating the right gut microbiom environment that these particular gutmicrobiota can thrive in will then our baseline levels of dopomine will be elevated and in general that leads to enhancement of mood similarly there are other gut microbioda for instance candida streptocacus verious a enterocacus these always have these con of strange and a not attractive names at least to me as a neuromiologist none the less those particular microbioda support the production of or can even be metabolized into seratonan which is a nourmodulator af sociated with mood with social interactions with a huge number of different types of events an behaviors again these gut microbiota when present and allowed to thrive in our gut will increase are overall levels of ceratonan and riding on top of that level of eratonan will be the ceratonen that specifically released in response to certain behaviors really wone to drive home this point of baselines an peaks the baseline level ceratonan might set our overall mood whetheror not we wake up feeling pretty good or really lousy if our ceratone levels happen to be very very low whether r not we tend to be in a kind of a calm spase or whether not we tend to be somewhat irritable but then of course individual events as we go about our day may be a complement that we get or may be somebody says something irritating to us whatever it may be will also influence levels of ceratonen but those ceratonan events are going to be related to events at particular nural circuits in the brain an this is an important topic because i think that a lot of people here quite accurately oh ninety to ninety five per cent of our ceratonan is manufactured in the gut and indeed that is true its manufactured from the sorts of microboda that i just described and there are many many experiments now mostly in animal models but as also some inhumans that show that if the gutmicrobiom is deficient in some way to these particular abactyria that ceratonan levels drop and people's mood suffers may be in their munsystem functions may be ven exascerbates certain syciatric illnesses however a lot of people take that to mean that the seratonan of the brain all comes from the gut or mostly comes from the gut that is not the case it still the case that you have nurons in the brain that are responsible for releasing ther ceratonan directly in response to certain things social touch or ot through other types of positive social experiences we have got got microbiota that can literally be turned into dopamin an raise our baselone levels of dopomin we have got got microbiota that can literally raise our baselone levels of ceratonan and indeed there are other got microbiota lactobasylas or bifodecti bifi dobacteriums cuses me hard complex names to pronounce bifidobacterium that can give rise to increases in gabbo levels this inhibatory narrow transmitter the connact is a little bit of a mild sed ative can reduce irritability et cetera but that is just the baseline the kind of tide of those neurmodulators again i want emphasize that we still have naural circuits within the brain and body that are specifically releasing in a very potent way dopamine ceratonan and gaba the two things act in concert even though the gut and the brain are acting both in parallel and directly influencing one another it is a powerful cyntergistic effect and there are now hundreds of studies maybe ven thousands by this point mostly performed an animal models typically mice but also some studies in humans that show that creating the correct environment for these got microbiota to thrive really does enhance mood and well being and that when our got microbiom is not healthy that it really can deplete are mood and sense of well being now there are two major phases to creating a healthy got microbiom one you con control and the other one is less under your control i get into this in a lot of detail in the episode with doctor sononberg which is coming out immediately after this one the following monday that is but for now i wanted just capture a few of the main points about the early establishment of the got microbiom it turns out that the invironment that we are exposed to the things that come into contact with our skin and digestive tract and any other mucosal lining even the eurethra the nasal passages any opening to the outside world that brings in certain scuse me certain microbiota in the first three years of life is going to have a profound impact on the overall menu of microbiota that we will be able to carry within our body and it really does seem that getting exposure to and building a diverse microbiom in those first three years is critical there is a lot of speculation and some data as to cessarian delivered babies having less diverse microbioms compare to vagenally delivered babies there been attempts although not conclusive attempts to linkth that to the the presence of otism spectrom disorders which at least by some statistics seem to be of higher probability in cessarian deliveries although there are other studies that refute that ni wont to make that clear however it is clear that babies do not get much if any exposure to microbioda inside of the woumb may be a little bit but not much but that is during the birth process and in the days in weeks immediately after they arrive in the world that thei'r got microbiom is established that those got microbito take residence within the gut it will depend on whether not theywere bresfet er botlefed ill depend on whethe or not they were exposed to a household pet or not whether no they ware held by multiple caregivers or just by one whether not they were a premi baby and were contained in a o a particularly restrictive environment in order to encourage their further development before they can be brought home or not i do not want to give the picture that if you were isolated or you are delivered by sea section that youre somehow doomed have a appoor microbium hat simply not the case however it is the case that the more diversity of microbioda that one can create early in life is really helpful for long term out comes in terms of brain to got signalling got to brain signaling and forsake of i the umion system there are some decent studies showing that if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment early in life that can be very detromental to establishment of a healthy got microbiom and fortunately that re establishing a healthy got microbiom can help rescue some of those dephasits doctors now days are mmuch more cautious about the prescription of antobiotic drugs to children in their early years not just up to three years but extending out to five and seven and ten years and even an adults their very very careful about that or they ought to be one reason is the existence or say the proliferation of anobiotic resistant bacteria that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere and that can cause serious problems but in addition to that because of this understanding that the got microbiom is influencing an actually creating nor transmitters that can impact mood and mental health impact immune health and on as i mention early are there are hundreds if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role of the microbiom on brain health psychiatric health et cetera i wanto just highlight a few of those studies and in particular some recent studies that come from labs that have been working on the sort of thing for a very long time one of the more exciting studies comes from the work of maro costomatioles lab which is at bailer college of medicine morrofs lab has been working on mouse models of atism spectrom disorder for a long time and looking at social behavior using a mouse model for a long time and they have been able to identify particular types of microbioda that when they take resodence in the gut can help offset some of the symptoms of autism at least the symptoms of outism that exist in these mouse models ociso again this is not human work this is work being done a mouse models for the simple reason that you can do these c anto manipulations where basically they took mice that were in germfree environments or non germ fre enbironments or they expose mice to particular microbiota and not other microbiota and they discovered that a particular microbiota called l rudery its l period re e u t e r ee treatment with el rudery corrects the social defisits present in these otism models and it does by way of activating our old friend the vagus nerve but not simply because the vagust nerve triggers the release of dopomine but it turns out that this particular gut microbota el rudery can correct the social defisits in this otism spectrum disorder model it does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway that stimulates both dopomin release and oxytose and release and they stablish this really mechanistically by showing for instance if you get rid of the oxitose and receptr you do not see this rescue now those are mause models we have to take those of with the appropriate grain of salt but the really exciting and they come to us in parallel with other studies that are being done taking the microbioms of people who have one condition or lack of condition and putting it into people who have one condition or another condition them explain what i mean by that the early discovery of the gotmicrobiom and its potential to impact health was not in the context of the got to brain pathway but rather was in the contics of colitus the states back to studies in the fifties whereby people with very severe intractable colitus for which no other treatment was going to work received feagale transplants yes that is exactly as it sounds taking the stool of healthy people who do not have colitus transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract of people who do have colitus and they saw significant improvement if not rescue of the colitus that was one of the first indications that something within stool of all things could actually rescue another individual from disease which sounds kind of wild and crazy and made even sound discussing to some of you but as i mentiond at the beginning the episode almost sixty per cent of stool is live or dead bacteria microbiota and it really opened up this entire field of exploring how different microbiota mucht might have theraputic effects and indeed that has been shown to be the case also in feagale transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses these are still on going studies they varyan quality ah its these are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons getting the appropriate patien populations getting agreement et cetera a making sure that everythingis handle properly but what this involves is feagal transplants from individuals that lack of particular psychiatric condition or metabolic condition into people who have a particular metobolic condition and there has been tremendous success in some cases one of the more a powerful and sailing to examples is for obicity their some people for which even if they ingest very low numbers of calories even if they go on a liquid protine diet simply cannot lose weight aisher somewhat rare disorders but these are people that would either do i get gastrid by pass surgery some people are now getting these fequal transplants from people that have a healthy a healthy weight and they take the the the stool from them they put into lower digestive tract and they can see substantial improvement in weight lost in people that were otherwise unable to do that nin some cases actually they can start eating relatively normal levels of food and still lose weight pretty remarkable and that tells us there something in these microbioda that is really powerful now how those effects are generated is not clear one idea is that it is impacting the metabolom imcomponent of the metabolism almost certainly that is going to be the case another ideas that it is impacting nor transmitters which change behavior and food choices within the brain although as i mention some of these people are already eating very little food to begin with that is a little bit a harder of an a argument to create there are also some somewhat famous examples now of howfecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes but those negative outcomes further under score the power of the microbiom in impacting bodily health one key example of this for instance is transfer of feecal matter into another person in order to treat something colitus and it effectively does that but if the doner of the of the stool of the fequal matter happen to be obes or have some other metabolic cyndrum it is been observed that the recipient can also develope that metabolic cyndrum simply by way of receiving that doners particular microbioda these microbiota can create positive outcomes where they can create negative outcomes most of us of course are not interested in or pursuing feocal transplants most people are interested in just creating a healthy got microbiom environment for sake of immune system and brain function and we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes but i just wone a further under score the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry and in shaping things mood or other aspects of mental health that typically we dont associate with our gut there are several studies publish in recent years aone that all dust highlight now first author it is tonian win engy u wy en the title of the paper is association of loneliness and wisdom with gut microbial diversity and composition and exploratory study the interesting study looked at a hundred and eighty for community dwelling of hat adults excuse me ranging from twenty eight to ninety seven years old they explored whether not having inhanced microbil diversity somehow related to these variables that tey refer to its loneliness and wisdom they used a number of different a test to evaluate those those are a common tests in the psychology literature not much the biology literature but none the less there ar ways of measuring things loneliness and wisdom om wisdom in this case being the the opposite of loneliness a at least in the contects of this study and what they found was the more microbial diversity the more diverse one's microbium was the lower incidents of loneliness and they did this by taking fequal samples profiling them for are ina as sentially doing gene sequencing of the stool of these individuals getting radings of how lonely or not lonely they felt and corrolating those and that is just but one study i pointed out because it is a particularly recent and thatculaus particularly a well done there is another study that i'll just refer you to this was a study publish in twenty twenty and scientific reports the title of the study is a motional well being and got microbium profiles by interotype what i particularly about the study is that they were able to correlate the presence of certain microbioda with feelings of subjective well being and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms they did high through put gene sequencing of the microbiums of individuals that meant measuring the microbioto figuring out which microbioto were present how diverse their microbium was in general got microbium diversity is a good thing and then to correlate that with what is called the p a and a s score p a an a stands for positive affect negative affect schadul this is a test that my lab is used extensively that other labs use to a valuate mood and well being and they defined what were what were called three interotypes three different categories of people that a very different diets that tended to fall into categories of having more or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative or more a fewer emotional signem symptoms that were positive and whether not they tend to be more depressed anxious or have more stress related behaviors et cetera and what they were able to derived from the study was some strong indications about what types of things we should ingest in our diet maybe even certain thingsthat we should avoid but certainly the types of things that we should injest that can inhants mood and well being and contend to shift people away from more depressive anxiety and stress related symptoms before we get into what the particular food items were that lend themselves to a healthy microbium ad one arays a bigger in perhaps more important issue which is what is a healthy microbium think if you asked any number of world experts and i certinly assis of doctor sonumberg what is a healthy microbium they are all going to tell you it is a microbum that has a lot of diversity that includes a lot of different types of bacteria that make sense i because it logically would include the a bacteria that produce gaba and dopomeneand ceratonan and that support the immune system into a number of different things but is it simply the case that adding microbio a diversity is always a good thing well that does not seem to be the case probiotics and prebiodicts both of which can in hanse microbitole diversity can improve mood digestion in run system and on that is been established but it is mainly been establish in the context of post anabiotic treatment or people that are recovering from illness or people that have been a very stres or i have been dealing with all sorts of challenges mental or physical and they are an attempt to replenish the got microbiom however it is also clear that excessive microbiota brought about by excessive in take of probiotics can lead to things brainfog there is actually some good studies that point to the fact that certain metabolites of the microbiom certain chemicals produced in the got and imand in the body can actually lead to brainfog states this is thought to come about through the lactate pathways of the gut that can then impact the brain if you want to look more into this issue of whether or not probiotics taken in excess perhaps can lead to brainfog an incurgio look at a particular paper this a paper published in clinical intranslational gastra and trology and the title of paper is brain fogginess gas and bloating a link between sebo probiotics and metabolic acidosis wit publish in twenty eighteen we can provide a link to the study and there are several other studies in the references that point to the fact that in some cases excessive in take of probiotics and excessive proliferation of got microbiota can actually be problematic i mention this not to confuse you but because it is confusing out there we all would think that just increasing microbiotal diversity is always a good thing but there are a thresholds beyond which excessive microbiotal diversity might be problematic i think everyone agrees that having to few mi crobial species living in us is not a good idea now none of that answers the questions that i think every one really wants answers to which are what should we do what should we not do to improve our got microbium i man clearly we cannot time travel back to when we were zeroto three years old and get a dog if we have a dog a get brestfed if we were not brestfed a be delivered a tasionally as supposed by cea section if we did have that opportunity we just cant time travel and do that all of us however should be seeking to improve the conditions of our got microbiom because of the critical ways in which it impacts the rest of our brain embodily health what sholl we do what should not we do clearly we know that stress can negatively impact the got microbiom however some forms of strasta can quotun quote negatively impact the microbom include fasting long periods of facts which makes sense because a lot o microbiota need food in order to thrive in fact many if not all of them do at some point there are other questions such as should we eat particular foods and how often should we eat those foods wev all been told that fibre is i credibly important because of the presence of prebiotic fibr which can essentially feed the microbiom but is fibre really necessary and how necessary is it to encourage a halthy microbium clearly there are number of people following relatively low fibr diet such as keetogenic diets and those can have in some cases anti inflammatory effects and can some times also improve certain microbota species itcan all be rather confusing and for that matter i asked our resident expert doctor justin sonaberg at stamford all of these questions and he answers them very systematically in the episode that comes out after this one but i do not want to withhold anything from you i'll just give a very topcontour version of those answers and then you will get more in depth answers during that episode i asked about fasting and the reason i asked about fasting is that years ago i was at a meeting as part of the pubiles the bimedical scholar's meeting and one of the other pubiomedical scholars the nexpert in got microbiom and i said hey are probiotics good for the microbiom and if which one should i take and his answer was very interesting he said in certain cases they can be specially if your travelling or your strest but it turns out that the particular bacteria that they put in most probiotics do not actually replenish the microbiota that you need most and i thought oh well why do not they make ones that replenish the microbiota that you need most and his answer was well they do not replenish those but they replenish other ones that than in turn incourage the development of the microbiota that you do want once you start eating the appropriate foods they change the environment which makes the environment better which indirectly supports that proliferation of quotunquote good microbiota o case that was a somewhat convoluted answer but i did appreciate his answer then i asked him about fasting i said well lot of people are getting interested intermin fasting now people are spending a signofng importion of each twenty for hour cycle avoiding food for sake of time rester dofeeting what is that due to the got microbium does it make a healthier does it make it unhealthier well my colleague from yeel and doctor soninberg both confirmed that during periods of fasting especially prolong periods of fasting we actually start to digest away much of our digestive tract now the whole thing doesnit strurct as is peer but there is thining of the mucosa lining or at least destruption the mucosal lining a lot of the microbiota species can start to die off and it was surprising to me but none the less interesting that fasting may actually cause a disruption to certain healthy elements of the got microbiom but again there is a cavia the caviat is that when people eat after a period of fast there may be a compensitory proliferation meaning and increase in healthy got microbiota you start to get the picture that fasting is neither good nor bad you start to get the picture that particular diets meanin certain restriction diets or macronutriant rich dites may not be good or bad for the microbiom and yet there are some answers that arrive to us from doctor soninberg but from other experts in the field that there are certain foods and certain things that we can ingest which definitely enhance the microbiom and make it healthier than it would be were we to not ingest those foods next i to talk about and what i think is a really pioneering and important study in this area this is a study that was carried out by the soninberg lab incollaboration with chris gardeners lab also at stamford where they compared two general types of diets inhumans diets that were fibre rich which has been propose time and time againd to enhance micro bioto diversity and to enhance got brain signalling even and to enhance the imion system perhaps and diets that were enriched in called low sugar for mented foods before i dive into that study and what the conclusions were because they are very interesting and very actionable for all of us i do want to touch on probiotics because i want to avoid confusion it is not the case that ingestion of probiotics will always lead to brainfag whan to make that clear it is the case that ingestion of probiotics even if those probiotics do not directly contain the microbiota species that one is trying to preliferate can be useful for improving microbiotal diversity in general it seems that maintaining a healthy got microbiom involves ingesting certain types of foods we will talk about those in a moment but perhaps also augmenting the microbio system through prebiotics or probiotics at a fairly low level on a consistent basis these are not hidose probiotics except under conditions of disbiosis where for instance if somebody has done around of antibiotics and they need to replenish their got microbiom there are foods end there are polform and powder form prebotics and probiotics that can be very useful or in cases where people have been very stressed or are undergoing excessive travel or have shifted their diet ratically maybe that is due to travel maybe that is due to illness may be that is due distress but when there are a number of different converging events that are stressing or depleading microbiotal diversity thats when at least i believe it can be useful to support they got microbiom through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics it would be under conditions where people are stressed ore their system is generally stresse for environmental or illness related reasons that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses of prebiotics are probotics than one might normally use but that under normal conditions that one would focus on quality nutrients through diet and foc is on ingestion of probiotics at a fairly low to moderate level and or prebotics at a fairly low to moderate level that just seems the logical approach based on the experts that i've spoken to but certainly if your doctor poscribes or suggest that you take high levels of probiotics for any reason you should defully pay attention your physicion and you should obviously pay attention your physician in any case you should never add a remove anything from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan without consuct consulting a physician what shall we do in order to maximize the health of our got brain axis as it is called how should we support the diversity of the good microbiota that help us create all these narrow transmitters that we want improve our immune system function and on and forth well some of that is going to be through the basics when i say the basics i mean the foundational things that really set us up for over all healths this is going to be getting deep sleep of sufficient duration eighty plus per cent of the time i mean if you cou get a hundred per cent the time that be grape but very few people accomplish that it is goin to be proper hydration it is going to be proper social inter actions is can be proper nutritiann will talk more about nutricion in a moment it is gong to be limiting excessive prolonged stressers or stress and indeed we have done episodes about just about all of those things but certainly about stress we have an episode of the hubran lab podcast that you can fine at hubran labdot calm all about mastering stress how to avoid long periods of intent stress what to do to offset those given that stress can distrupt the microbiom whether not your fasting or not those tools ought to be useful now in what i consider to be a landmark study exploring the relationship between the gup microbiom food in take and over all health is this paper from just in soninberg slab and chriscardeners lab both of which are at stamford and the paper entitle gutmicrobioto targeted diets modulate human imune status was published in the journal cell which is among the three top journals perhaps in the world nature science and sell really being the apex journalse or over all science and especially for bio medical sciences now this is very interesting study it was done onhumans there were two major groups one group of humans was instructed to increase the amount of fibr in their diet and in fact eight a high fibr diet the other group was instructed to eat a high fermented food diet now both groups started off not having eaten a lot of fibr or a lot of fermented foods and were told to increase the amount of either fiber or fermented foods that they were injesting over a four week ramp up period and that was to avoid any major gastric distress it turns out that if you are not already accustomed o eating a lot of fibre increasing your mount of fibr dramatically can cossom gastrict distress but if you ease into it over time as will see a there is a mec nism behind this was was unveiled in the study but if ese into it over time then the system can tolerate it likewise hih permented foods can the readily tolerated if there is a ramp up phase of injesting may be one serving a day than may be two servings in ramping up in this case as highas six servings per day however after this ramp up period the group asigne to the high fibre condition maintained high fibre in take for six weeks and the high fermented food group maintained high fermented food in take for six weeks after which they went off either the hifibr or the hipermento fhu diet and there was a four week follow up peryod during which they gradually return to baseline throughout the study there got microbium was a valuated for the diversity of got microbiota and there were also a number of measures of immune system function in particular measures of the called in flamatome the imiune system has a lot of different molecules involved i did whole episode about the imun system if your interested in learning what some of those molecules are verycidakinds and signalling molecules that reflect either hgh inflammation states are reduced inflammation states in the brain and body youre welcome to check that episode its also at huberman labdot come regardless in this study they explort the sorts of immune markers that were expressed in either of the two groups and compared those the basic take away of this paper was that contrary to what they predicted the high fibr diet did not lead to increase microbiota diversity at least not in all cases and that was somewhat surprising now the idea is that prebiotic fibr and a lot of the material in fruits in vegetables in grains and forth are supposed to support microbital diversity and the proliferation of existing microbiota and that is not what they observed although i want to be very clearn pointing out that the results did not indicate that fibr is not useful for health over all but it does pointo the fact that increasing fibrin take did not increase microbido diversity which in general as i mention befor is associated with improvements in microbiota function health and overall well being now the high pfermented food diet condition was very interesting it rusulted in increased microbium diversity and decrease in flammatory signals in activity there was a tufor basically by injesting hiermented foods at in fair abundance rite un afor to six servings are more per days is a lot of fermented a food intake will talk about what some of those foods were but the outcome was very positive am therewas a clear increase in microbio diversity and decreased in flammatory signals things interlucan six on a number of other interlucans and sidakinds that are associated with increased inflammation in the brain and body were reduced sig gnificantly now let us talk a little bit about this notion of number of servings et cetera one somewhat minor point of the study but i think is useful in terms of an act taking an actionable stance with this is that the number of servings of fermented foods was not as strong of predictor of improvements in the inflammato meaning reduced inflammation and improvements in micro bioto diversity as was the duration of time that the individuals were in jesting fermented foods in other words the longer that one is consistently injesting fermented foods on a daily basis the better the outcomes in terms of the got microbiom and for reducing inflammation i think that is an important point and i make that point especially because for a lot of people even if you do this ramp up vays six servings per day of fermented foods i con seem quite a lot what are these fermented foods right i think many of us are on familiar with certain cheeses and being fermented and beer being fermented and combuchas fermented in this study they focus specifically on low sugar fermented foods this would be plain yogart a in some cases kimchee or sour kraut an important consideration however is that it needs to contain what are called live active cultures which means their acttually have to be a microbioda that are alive inside the souer craut one way whether not that is happening is if you purchase saur kraut or pickels or kimchee from a jar or a container that is on the nonrish refrigerated shelf of the nonrefrigerated section of your grocery store it is not going to contain live active cultures of microbioda and likewise if you consume yeoger that has a lot of sugar or other components added to it it is not going to have the same pausive effect on the microbiom least that is the prediction given some of the relationship between the sorts of microbito that live in sugar verses plain typ yogerts they gave people the option of consuming any number of different low sugar fermented foods that again that coun be sourcraut kimchi things keifer nato a in japan they consume nato which is of fermented food a beer was' not one of the fermented of foods that hat was includ in the formented foodless and when we say six servings per day that is indeed six six ountz servings or six for to six ount servings it was not six servings or what is listed on the package that again that turns out to be a fair amount of fermented foods how should you gauge whether not you aregetting enough for this well if you decide to a take on this proto call of injesting more fermented foods which at least by my read of thi study and some of the follow up work that is being done a terrific idea if you want to improve your got microbiom for all the great reasons that one would want to brain body health reduced inflammation and on and on well then you devilly want it focus on fermented foods that you enjoy consuming for ou if that key fer r for you thats plain yogerder for you that sour crat which apas we might a personal favorite then you want to make sure that it is going to be something that you you are going to injoy in gesting quite a lot of and that you are going to be ocey with ingesting probably throughout the day now people followd different meal scheduales of course but this does require not just eating all the fermented foods just before bedtime or one meal a supose you could do that but in general its goin to work bastin frms of limiting gastric distress by spreading it out throughout the day i also wont to mention brine brine is the liquid that surrounds sour craut o its that very salty fluid and that contains a lot of active live cultures and they did a include a were they allowed people to include brine in this in the study and in discussions with doctor sanunberg which will going to in more detail on the episode o and that comes out next week we talk a lot about the particular value that brine might hold in terms of bringing about micro a biota diversity because of the richness of live cultures that it contains i do won o focus for a moment on the high fibre condition because there were some interesting observations about the people that were placed into that condition first of all increasing the amount of fibr definitely increase the number of enzimes that can be used to digest fibre this is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up pase where accumulation of more fibr in take can over time lead to less gastric distress but also to more utilization of fibre which overall should be a good thing while they did not observe and increase in emune system function or an increase of microbiota diversity there was an increase in these fibre digesting enzims they also observed what they called personalized in mun responses there were some sub groups within the high fibre group that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to ar i should say their in flamatome meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed as well as their microbiota diversity there ware sentualy three groups one group acshe showed an increase in inflammatory markers that was quite surprising and a probably a not a wonderful for the message that fibres always good for us but that was a small cohort within the fibr intake group another group and still a nother group both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity although to varying degrees i doft wnt to paint the picture that fibre is bad but fibre certainly did not have the posive effects on microbiota diversity that the high fermented food diet did my read of the study and i think the stands that many others have taken as a consequence of these data is that we should be increasing ar fermented food and take that that simply a good thing to do in order to support ar gout microbiom and to reduce in flammatory signals in our brain and body and there are number diferent ways to do that i mention some of the particular foods however any time your talking about in jesting fermented foods especially the high quality ones that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store or that end that have low sugar content et cetera we do have to be considerate of cost because certain things combucchas for instance can be quite costly a i should also mention some cambucchas actually contain alcol some to do not a or contain very little amounts of alcohol one way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods while still being able to accumulate a lot of fermented food intak is to simply make those fermented foods yourself this is something that a we started exploring and a expermenting with in our home one simple way to do this is to just make your own sour crowd it involves very few ingredients abasidly involves cabbage water and salt but there is a specific process that you need to follow in order to create these large volumes of sour craut at home using that low cost method the best resource that i know of in order to follow a creat recipe to make homade sour craut would be the recipe for home made sour craut that is contained in timferras's book the four hour shaft there is an excellent protocoll there involves chopping up the cabbage puttng into a bowl mashing it up a with your hands which can be fon a putting water in there some salt covering it and then keeping it in a particular environment and then routinely scraping off some of the a material from the surface you have to do that in order to make sure that you are not getting a micro a microbes an things growing in it that are bad for you you defly want to pay careful attention to the protocol but that is a very very lowcost way of generating lots and lots of fermented food you do not co broke trying to improve your microbayume the otherthing that you can do if youre really a obsessed with combuccha or something that to avoid the high cost of combucchas there arways that you can get the scobi which basically allows you to make your own camuccha at home i've never tried this but when i was a postok tere was an undergradua in the lab i think a well i will not out him but he is now gone on to medical school a and a i think he is passes residencin is and is a practicing doctor but none the less he was always making combuccha at home he told me it was exceedingly easy but then again he had a number of other skills and attributes that a maybe think that he could do pretty much anything with ease whereas a i tend to struggle with even basit cooking maybe if you are feeling a lttl more adventurous you could a explore making your own combuccha but there are a number of different protocols and recipes out there for making your own low sugar fermented foods you need not run out and buy fresh sour crawd all the time i shouldalso mention for those of you that are interested in a getting your fermented a in take from pickles jarred pickles a rarely if ever contain ferment a mostly there just soaked in an vinegar water and with some spices but there are some that contain ferment yes shou have to look for that on the container and iokno maybe some one out there knows how to make noto and knows how to make kimchi well in things of that sort a it certainly is the case based on the data from the study that in jesting more servings of fermentod food perday ought to be beneficial for our got microbium and since this is a ne posode not just about got microbium but got brain health i should mention that one form of signalling between the gopmicrobyum and the brain which we did not discuss and i'll just touch on briefly is that when the in flamatome or the the genes and markers of inflammation are kept in a healthy range there is an active signalling of that immune system status to the brain there is an intermediate cell type that communicates immune status to the brain and that seltype is the microgleal cell a type of gleas the name suggests when there is a lot of inflammation in the body these microglea actually get activated and can start a eating away at various components of the brain and nervous system and i do not mean massive eating away than i can digests the whole brain but these microglea are sort of the resident macrophages of the brain macropages are in the peripery and they gobble up debris in things o that sort the microglea on a regular basis are eating up debri that accumulates across waking cycles and in response to micro damage of the brain on that occurs on a daily basis they have a lot of important basic every day what we call housekeeping functions but when the is a lot of inflammation in the body when there is a massife immune response the microglea can be hyperactivated and that is thought to lead to any number of different a cognitive defects ore challenges thinking or a mabeven some forms of nerdegeneration over time although that last point is more of a hypothesis than than a well ttamped down fact at this point there still lot of investigation to be done in humans the animal data however are very very strong that when the imune system is activated or chronically activated or hyper activated that neurl tissue meaning brain tissue another central nervous system tissue can suffer there'r a lot of reasons to want to not just improve microbium diversity but to allso improve immune system function and to limit the number of inflammatory markers that are present in the body because of the way those inflammatory markers can signal diliterious events in the brain and while eating fermented foods and making your own fermented foods and buying hycualty fermented foods might seem an inconvenience i would say that from the perspective of cost benefit or effort benefit is actually on a quite a good situation where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods that or servings to ferment o foods e reading perday over a period of a few weeks that you'r tolerating that well that ought to have a very posive effect on your microbium diversity and indeed on got brain function and i'll be the last to suggest that people completely forego on fibr i think there is some debate out there as to how much fibr we need and whether not certain forms of fibr a better than others i'm not gin to get into that debate its barbed wire enough without meinjecting my own a views into that debate but i think there is ample evidence to support the fact that for most people injesting a fairamount of fiber is going to be a good idea i would just say that maysor that your also ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods and along the lines of fibr in in an accompanying article published in cell which was sort of a what we call a news an views piece about the son in bergan gardener paper they make a quite good point which is that the increase in fibr and take that led to the increase in carbohydrate active enzimes the see a zezimes as theyre called these are enzimes that help digest fibr quo indicating and enhanced capacity for the microbium to degrade complex carprohydrates present in fibrous foods in other words eating more fibr and fibrous foods allowed for an increase in these enzimes that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods or to better digest fibrous foods that are coming in through other sources there is at least one utility for in creasing fibr even though its separate from the gut microbital diversity and reducing inflammation and i be remiss if i did not touch on some of the data and controversy about artificial sweeteners and the gut microbiom i want to be very clear that what am about to tell you has only been established in animal models in amounths model at least to my knowledge what the studies have shown a and there were several but one published in the journal nature a few years back as the one that got the most amount of attention is that animals that consume large amounts of artificial sweetners in particular things sacron or sucrolos show destruptions in their gut microbiom i'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect and i'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect for things plant base lo calory sweetenerse things stevia mong fruit in things to that sort and at least by my exploration i could not find any data specifically related to the sweetener aspertain right now its somewhat controversial and actually this as kind of a third ral topic out there when one group will come out saying that artificial sweeteners are bad because they destrucpt the gutmicrobiom the response generally from a number of people as well that is only been shown in animal models and indeed that is true right now i do not think that there is a strong case one way or the other i think that people should basicly ask themselves whether not they artificial sweeteners or not whether not they are willing to risk it or not an obviously that is an individual choice i also ont to point out a recent study from diegobohorces lab which actually shows however that nurons in the gut those nuropod sells are actually capable of distinguishing between real sugars and artificial sweetners this is a really interesting body of work it was published that just n just recently i should say february twenty twenty two the title of the paper is the preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sense or sell and to make a long story short what they showed was there is a category of nurpod sells that recognized sugar in the gut and signal that information about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain vi the pathways we talked about before the notos gangly af the vaguest jopening et cetera et cetera interestingly the very same category of nurons can respond to artificial sweeteners and signal that information to the brain but the pattern of signalling and indeed the signature pattern that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain is actually quite a bit different whend these same nurons are responding to artificial sweeteners verses actual sugar this is very interesting because what it means is first of all that nurons hav incredible specificity in terms of what they are signalling from the gut to the brain and it also means that there may be a particular signal that the brain receives that says i'm receiving some intake of food or drink that taste sweet but does not actually offer much nutriencs in the direction of sweetness meaning that it does not have calories to spite being sweet now again this is all subconscious processing nd with the previous studies we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners generally in the gutmicrobiom generally it is unclear how this relates to humans at this point in time but given the similarity of sellar processes and molecular processes at the level of gut brain in mice i think it stands to reason that these nuropod cells very likely are capable of signaling sweet presence of real sweet nervers is artificial sweetner in humans as well although that still remains to be determined empirically i to just briefly recap what i've covered to day i started ouf by talking about the structure and function of the gut brain acces i described the basic structure and function of the digestive pathway and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species meaning many many little bacteria that can signal all sorts of things to the rest of the brain and body and indeed we talked about the various ways that they do that we talked about direct pathways literally nerve networks that extend from the gut up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut and we talked about indirect pathways how some of the gout microbiota can actually synthesize nor transmitters that get out into the blood stream can impact the body can impack the imiun system and can get into the brain and act as ner transmitters in the brain just as would ner transmitters that originate from within the brain elso talked about what constitutes a healthy verses unhealthy microbiom and it is very clear that having a diverse microbiom is healthier than having a non diverse microbiom but as i pointed out there still lot of questions as to exactly what microbota species you want to enhance and which ones you want to suppress in the gut in order to achieve the best gut brain acts as function we talked about how things fasting might impact the microbiom and how some of that might be a little it counter intuitive based on some of the other posive effects of fasting or ifwoere not just discussing fasting some other types of somewhat restrictive diets either restrictive in time or restrictive in terms of macronutrian intake how those may or may not improve the health of the gup microbium and the basic take away was that because we do not know exactly how specific diets impact the gupmicrobium and we do not know how fasting either promotes or degrades the microbium we really cannot say whether not they are improving or degrading the microbium at this time however it is clear that stress in particular chronic stress can destrupt the gumicrobium it is also clear of course the antibiotics can distrup the gut microbium and that brings us to the topic of prebiotis and probioics and i emphasize the fact that for most people injesting high quality non process foods that include some prebiotic fibr but also that include some probiotics will probably be healthy but not excessive levels of probiotics high levels of supplemented probiotics of the sort that would come in a probotic pill or even prescription probiotics would probably lend themselves best to when people were under severe chronic stress or had just come off a serious round or an on going or repeated rounds of antibiotics that does not mean that ingesting probiotics in any former any kind is not good it just means that the very hidos probiotics again typically found in presription form or or capsil pillform probably your best reserve two cases where of course your doctor prescribes them you should always follow your doctor's advice but in cases where perhaps you are jetlag your traveling excessively of for any reason or working excessively you are not getting enough sleep or your diet is ratically changed from normal and we talked about how increasing the amount of fibr in your diet might be useful for increasing fibr digesting enzimes and the assimilation of fibrous foods but that it is really the ingestion of fermented foods and in fact getting anywhere from four or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods can be immensely beneficial for reducing inflammatory marcers in theboti and for improving microbioed a diversity all along the gut and thereby improving signaling and outcomes along the gut brain axis we went all the way from structure to function to the four kinds of signalling mechanical chemical indirect direct probiotics fibr and fermented foods and i tossed in a little bit at the end there also obout ways that you can make your own fermented foods at home in order to try an offset some of the costs also its descon fun to do and some of those actually taste quite good i have actually found that o the fermented a souercrot they were making at home a actually rivals the saurcrot tha you can by ot of the refrigerated section of the grocery store and i am by no means a skilled cook or schef or and basily have no colonary skill whatsoever if i can do it you can do it i hope you found this information useful and perhaps also actionable one of my motivations for doing this episode was again as a primer for the episode with doctor justin sonunberg where we go really deep into the gup microbium less into the gup brain axis but really deep into the gup microbium what it is what it does what it does not do and some of the emerging findings from his lab that are yet to be published and i also was excited to do this episode because i think many of us have heard about the gutmycrobiom we heareabout these bacteria that live in our got we heareabout the gut brain axis or that ninety per cent or more of the ceretonian that we make is made in our got we har about the got is a second brain and forth but i think for many people they do not really have a clear picture of what they got mycrobiom is and the pathways and mechanisms py which it can signal to the brain into the other parts of the body i hope that to day's information at least improved the clarity around that topic and leaves you with the more vivid picture of this incredible system that is our gut brain axis if your enjoying and or learning from this podcast please

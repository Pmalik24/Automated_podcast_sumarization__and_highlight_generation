gigantic billy grand minnish shoe trock sat up in the harkinglat is commutidy and then all of a sudden this young gueye started wailing a sandy dy to be line fom ar ais a he immediately threw his arms around her cana her her here here tos it ok it is not oke it is not ope lettit go itti itta itt go cryo ado gonims o oo asok honey you are doing it nowo he graduated last year there wre crosses sat up

tika nice do i can nyt oko breathe with me after a few minutes he is caught his breath enough to talk he tell sandy he wants the shootings to stops he must to take actions somehow and then khe

toi we e ge and he plans to get a concealed hand gun licens when he turns twenty one later this thear the phillipses are actually gunowners too theyave a twelve gade shot gun they believe in the second amanment but they areall advocates free universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories bomp stocks i person con by however sandy says the do not push their political blece on survivors when theyr doing out reachd their primary goal is to support but it is impossible for greeting parents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement of conspiracy thearis who believe that the us government stages masshootings to make guns lik bat we were told by alic jone sait our daughter never existed alics jones of course this famous for seeing that mas shootings are fague he is now a defended and several defamation law suits when the phillipses ran in to him face to face an a gun control events he accused them of inventing their entire story and then two minutes later hes saying youre daughters still alive and she is living in the bahamas and she is live in the high life and you are crisis actors and you are paid by the obama administration and doubted then i'm listening toing just going you are absolutely crazy lawnie got into it with jones stood right in front of him it look a shoting match was about to start and tell sandy' stepped in and broke it up i reached out to jones through one of his lawyers who declined a comments the conspiracy theoris knownis truthers or hoaxers troll families of victoms on social betia immediately after any mas shooting this can get dangerous after the philips hes sun gave interviews in aurora he got death threats and had to get the aft the ion valved the man who was thriting him anded up in jail hopsers are one of the things the philips his worm parents about they tell families to brace themselves bafter watching lawnie and sandy and sanathe i wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting re living teir worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts for their daughters shooting they got the news in the middle of the night when they were sleep at their home an tac us this was back intwo thousand twelve andther doughtered jessy was in college at the time she got to see te new batman movy the dark night rises with one of her friends at amolty plex an aurora corato about a half hour after the movy started jessy's frine alled sandy from the theatr the minute i picked up the phone there was screaming just horrible screaming in the background panic an he said don there is been a shooting and i i sigt what is he talking about caus jesshe had been at am mallan teronto almost seven weeks before where there was a man shooting this was a coincidence jesse ad left to food court na mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire my first thought was this is not funny you knowd but he is not a prankstr and i shuid are you okan he said i think i've been hit twice nd it was when he said that that i went why is not jessy calling and i knew something was rally row he said i tried that is what i wol gup because the scream wich sa loud it was shall rif hecan save het e ever heard before lanie found sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch rehelder jessy was one of twelve people killed that night another seventy people were injured and then five months later there was another mashshooting sandy hook we are twenty first graters and six educators died days later the breedy campaign to preven gon violence contack tot the phillipses they are reaching out to families from otheir mash shootings and asked if they would be willing to travel to newtown to talk to parents there sandy sayd they didn'en't had to think about it they immediately said yes tbecaus they wished they would had some one to talk to you right after jasse died but when they arrived at the community center in new town sandy says they felt nervous and uncomfortable tmaybe they were intruding they were not sure of these parents would feel angry or grateful about their presents tyou know it is walking into a funeral of people that you do not know and i remember saying to my husband then we walked in the room and i saw their faces i said that is what we looked five months ago what is that look what ugh they are hanging on to each other hthey have been crying their eyes yer red the're walking almost robot their bodies you are moving that they are not really there i realized that is what i look just five months ago tut it all made me realize this is exactly what i want to be doing she wanted to help these parents acclamate to their new reality looking back sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out their trying to comfort otheir parents when they were still raw but the phillips as said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they could not turn away from while they were there they ran into parents from other msshootings to parents from virginia tack an tooson these parents had lost kid suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were say the phillips as now had parents that they could lean on to this was the moment that launch the philipses and to what is become their life work they could see the need they are no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mash shooting the only experts are the people at tap ten to to help them find each other launy and sandy have set up an organization called survivors and poward they help family's navigate their grie wless a much of otheir practical things everything from medical bills and charity stams that use kid's potos to raise money to how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehends they will not you to bobod with you lthey want you to get back to nor ol might well rotheshd they should yeu're not ashame as you were shuld no lenyc planco youre are it unluck to shad person un ther will be they shee as we are abshuse with no no we are in the ships we are objhust with it the phillips as and a few other parents told me because it' hard for people to understand that the grief never fads old relationships start to fall away tpeople you were closes to disappear which makes is in formal support group even more crucial but that support looks over time and what it means to the parents who get it i got to see all that when sandy and lawny got to know a couple from florida who lost their son in the shoting at parklands onica and mitched dorett i met them at their house their sons name was nick he was the captain of parklan swintin was about to go to the university of indian apolis on a swim scholarship he was as six foot tall blon kid who colleckted different flavors of orios and waited for supreme drops they shaid theyd just reached a point where they were becoming real fronds they talked about relationships shared playless and watched scar face together the day of the shooting mitchon onica got pone calls and tac all day from people who said they would heard nick was o kay when person said they heard he would been move to a staginarea for all the tudents to witness the shooting anothersaid of please officer was giving him a ride home and then ha nerse at a local hospital said she saw pati an who matched next description but by that evening the door at still had not heard directly from nick s they went to a mariaut that lawn forcement designated as a meding area the sat in a ball room with otheir parents and waited ivery time the phone rangs you jump hand think his nay calling from somebody else's phone ah the medy a was calling you you have any comments can we help you find your son and as to say yet and am at two ofclock in the morning we see this if be i car and then they start pulling one family in to a rooms at tha time and yersh screams from these rms then their names were called out even walking into that room weu have this tiny little hope that theregin a say we we could not ifind your son e know and that hopeful that buhe was some whre es and i'm takeits keep on thinking maybe he walked home and and then you to the map in your head tosn't take that long to walk to our house and then they told us te news but he was gone hit was shot than he was never brought to the hospital at all but to second igtmare to second igtmar mics body was still at the school because he died instantly and the bilding was still a crime scen i'd be two days before they could see him monica wanted to look at his injuries mitch did not onica says this was just how her brain works she is an e your nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about nick and the person that answerd the phone said oh ah letme let me take a look what is the name again this nicholas for i taste is wimmer all this former's perfect i think it meant that there was nothing on his face or his head id he was he was perfect he would been shot three times a bullet in his choss destroyed his heart and lungs was r to see him yes he ws hopful becaus you are picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shot with an ay ur fifteen just grows horrible horrible and i think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were were am made me get it he was peaceful and he was not in pain and he made me have a better anmage of him then the one that twas playing over in my mind the phillips's had travelled to parkland to couple days after the shooting they did not know the doorats but a mutual friend thought they should talk and this friend with mitchas permission gave sandy his phon number sandy called and got no answer she left a voicesmell i'm very sorry for your loss i i understand your loss we lost our daughter then you culd call me any time she let him know that she and launey would be in parkland for a few more days mitch caled back quickly he did want to meet with them in person monid be helpful to talk to another family who would been through hi mas shooting but he told sandy the tim he was not gat a work his house was packed with family in town for an next funeral and i'm on the phone with him and ironically i'm standing right in front of his child's cross and i said you are not going to believe this she said that you say rign for the next room worik by ge chills right now and we proceeded to have a talk and he said i do not think we are ready to meet with you ni sa i totally understand i'm just glad that we are getting to talk but you do need to know that truthers are already on mine saying that this did not hapenhe should what ar truthers he said ah oket i thought wo you gitty me we crazy mi chasterd to stop by their house the following day molmitch was on board with the phillips's onica haddad dif ferent take on total stranger stopping by their house i was more may be more scaptical nervous of the why are they here what is ther danda how can people come and meet with us if they do not want something from us their house was crowded that the only private place to talk was their bedroom onacan mitc sat on the that lonning and sandy and chairs onaca remembers felling a little uncomfortable and thinking to herself why am i sitting here why it my i with a family who are a these people i do not know them but ah i guess it might help but he was very overwhelming lik i cannot believe that i have to sit and have this conversation what is this this is my life now it was her appointing the conversation were it sturtedco turn for you yei think i think when they when they said do not to join ar on orin o sation now do not figd now just take care of yourself and let yourself grieve they asked questions about nic n before long they wer just talking lony remembers inich asking if they were religious nif they ever got signs from jussy he told mitch that them they were not but they took eleven eleven as a hullow from jussy the conversation went on for three hours all our friends and family as much as they did for us and how much lhave they showed none of them can have any clew what we were feeling and here what two people knowing exactly what we are feeling they also made me feel litle more confident if ev that is the right word you are in a club we all don want of mein we did not war me you we wish we would have met on the different circumstances but you have people help you with this kind of griefe and a few days later when the onling conspiracies started a pearing about nik that he did not exist or that he was living in california they remembered sandy's warning it was still upsetting but last upsetting because they knew it was comin they helped another ways to the dorit took the phillips's advice and got into tromat there be right away both individually and as a family their younger son alex has been through a lot nic was his bast friend one of the last things nected on the day of the shooting was walk alex to his english class alex was injured in the shooting and sat by a kid who died right in front of him onaca says managing her grief along with hersons has been tough thet was much attention on nacknacknacknacnack everybody came for nack at the flowers for for nak to letter wo from nik i felt i if this did not happen to nicholas and only this i could been there for alex much stronger and much more si i was afraid that he wuld get neglected in all that i think some times children feel when you must have loved that child more than you love me sandy son was twenty five when his sister died sandy tried to talk to him about it which ended at pushing him farther away when she talks to parents jox about her on mistakes to ay monts after they first mat thet just till in touch with sandy they tax er call each other ove re couple weeks nitct relies on sandy more than onica who un him ordhe has a bilton tnatwork of frends she talks to all the time then then we text it i think we texted yesterday it was lettit levin actually we texed yesterday and i feel she still in it she still with us say shes it is some one who we can lean on and an give us support and in turn worder her to lead on me maybe seeing us get stronger it gives her energy to he is right about that sandy spends almost every day aut her tiny kitchen table in their trailer feeldbing tux and pone calls from survivors and massaging with people on social media who ask for help the pain is always there at the end of the day and when you go to bed at night when you first wake up in the morning it is there but you have a sense of purpose to met that helps little bit of a life liners oh it is total l flohtotal if ind idn't han this work i do not think i be alive i really do not im i say that to lonny all the time he gos i do not you love me enough kind of thing to stay alike i jus t do not think i would have had the ability shi chep going miton oni coa tell me that when the're feeling stronger he to do frather familyes but the phillipsons have done for them he sad god forbid another shooting happens but if it does we will be out there wut tat meeki meek is one at the pucers of our shef coming oup a paen tries to combat an infuriating and very personal piece of misinformation on mine that just will not go away and does some things a prents almost never do that is in a minute jicago publgadio wen our programm continues sismar o life fro myr glass to dana programm the parents step in with the government doing i know is it nothing is it next to nothing to reduce the number of mass shootings in this country we have a stories to day of parents taking action specirigally parens of children who ware killed in mass shootings hen in the stories we have him to day sho these parents they get results the dad in this next act to somebody a who gonniy an sandy introduced producer meeky meek to his name is wenny posner thiss act two of our show down the rabbit holl and when wenny posiner was to explain to people what his life is he a sometimes sells this story whon election night back in twenty sixteen he says he went to a bar got a seat near tallvision order beer and stor to making small talk and i turned to the guye to my right and i said did you vot and from there he went into a long explanation about some shadow government ideas and and wheter voting makes a difference and probably ten minute sin to whit he was talking about mas shootings and then ventually sandyhook sandyhok of course where gunman killed twenty children all on first grate as well as seven adults the strandam stranger then started telling weny this particular story about sandy hook he thought the whole shooting was fake it had to be fake said is one of this first raters also shut up as a victim and a second mass shooting all the we over in packastan in the corners of a the innernet were people trade sandyhook conspiracy theories this is a key piece of evidence the sandyhook was not real cors a was rael nwhat happene to packastan was in reality about two years after sandyhook the taban gun down more than a hundred kids there and there ws a public vigil and at the public vigil probly as a sign of solidarity with other kids who had died in school shootings morners had this photo of a boy from sandy hook smiling and when a spider man shirt under a quortere jacka with furry cower sany hok deniers saw that in the coverage and they pounced did he die twice did he die at all the guy at the bar with lenny i's rattling throughall this packastan stof and then as lenny explaine to a meeky meek who he told the story to the guy mentions the kids name no a posner i din't really need to hear much more than that just needed to shut him down basically is you i took out my drarmers licence ai said who look or your talking to show some respect the boy in the photo was lenny son no ho was six when he died i he ge well he sure he condected i instantly o and om he just became more agitated very anger one outside may the hat a sigaret came back yeeldat e some mor go my god how much to they payu w how can you do this hee readed to his believe i was the gilin he beliave this man at the bar pretty much re to find everything about the way when he lose is life where he lives how he lives he rens in to these hoaxers in person and premuch every day on mine the think the government is paid im millions played the part of a grieving dad and never minds lany is the sick one noas never even his kid and the person who has populized these theories more than anybody is alecs jones he rens e wibsite info wars and he push these theories ithis readio show is you to bidios e oxjones made is name right after nine eleven fro munding the idea that nine eleven was an attack orgustrated by our own government we sandyhook jon said many times that he did not believe the shooting was real shant he hok u a shan satic completely fak with actors in my view manufactor i could not believe it at first i ne they had actors there clearly but i thought they kill soreal kage an yus show how boldly are thet they clearly used actors hexclaimed tat the government or some shadowy goba forces of the one who hired these actors he and the other hoaxers call them cracis actors as ike this whole alternate world that es his right next to the real one the makes miserable freparents lenning tnoling most parents in that situation lennie desided go all action hero on the hoaxer is in on alex jons action hero i will do what needs to get done to defend my family damn the consequences lenniy is resourceful he is dogged he does not give up and this world that woul within hoaxers in trolls he is murch ot a peth i think very few of us wer ont to take meekig me who did the story on sandy and mony also put together this story about the transformation of lenny posner we first bodcest is back in twenty nineteen there is some curse words in the story that we have unbeeped for this podcesversion f the show if you prefer bep version go to a webside hu smeeki the first time wenny became aware of any conspiracy theries about sandyhuck was about a month after the shooting he been on a media black out trying to get through noa's funeral and taking care of his two young girls they were also at the elementary school that morning and one of them was noa's twin sister she hid in a supara lass room but one day lnnie finaly felt ready to go on line by the news guggleda son's name ind forwars wirs coming up ons firch results and the cans wore and it is just completely discussting in just over thirty days this whole world had been invented and one of the sentral pieces of it involved lennie's wife in fa wars fands were disacting this one interview she did on syannan it was with anderson cooper just days after noa's funeral when he want people to know abot o he left running and playing with i o plangs and in the fabe bats and fire flies and he leves eating in side of oo cookies and he played the vityo gangon sile ad nasan understanin use to tell his the simplings that he that he managed to taco factor yes that he was going to split his tin as in a dull the swing manisan tacco factory and be an astenat the comments on line were grows and flinsy why did not she sound sader i wouch he put on lipstick if she was really grieving and was not she too old to be the mam of hi sixerold kid they were convinced that something was ot how or you holding up om in om a most e tin im im ana nom i think aveing wi ay out there he relates to the fact of how long it tix rein a ban os mi loths an ye watch ovi off to souns and avi hart be an its ixs nine months to created human being ani take sapins for an aarfi to take got away fom the surface ot the serth this reference to guns was another alha moment for conspiracy therists some of them started digging into barin sli looked up her maiden name and then said hay look at this there is a swist diplomat who has her exact same name and even fishier this diplem at once went to an arms control summit at the united nations maybe the're the same person maybe she is one of those a leegue globlis trying to make guns look bad president obama can repeal the second amendment suddenly every real sentiment varony shired about noah was getting reinterpreted as lines from a sinister script they were here and they matter they all have families and they matter and the kicker that senttip for these conspiracy therists anderson cooper's nos there is as moment when the tip of his nose disappears because of a diginal gletch in the vidio what see an end says was normal interference that happens with a live sadlight feed it is just a couple seconds but hoaxer's would not let it go they said thit itscreen scren or blue scran hoever that was a fake interview in vernit was a purchasament of a fake stage see in an interview that conspiracy theory was all aver you to and it was allr you to would nosimg i've talk to parents who lost hids and other masshootings and they have all been blind sided by online harassment from conspiracy therrists the crisis actor claim is common now he is a tacks usually star almost immediately after vec tims are ideed in the meya and parents who go on tv and talk about gun control verynet they get at the worse sandy hookas when this really took off tfanily's get stock fending off all this crazy hate by themselves there' just arnt that many rees horses for them he caus lon forcement still has not figured out had to deal with no ciber horassmet and tha tat companies are not much help son those families just try to ignore the conspiracy therists and hopetheyll eventually go away and that is what lenny did for a while his life was a rack tut after about a year and a half they were still at it and he could not let it go any more thi realize that i the grieving requires a commness in a silence and all of this material was a distraction for me in it was noise and i needet too handle that noise that i could have the silence and com that i needed there is a photoi love of lenny with his arm wrapped around noah he is got a walwer's moustache and he is kneeling on a tramplin with ha soft smile it is spring and noah has all this big brown hair fat cheeks he stagling his whole body into lenny's chests blenny's got tons of family photoes these ost of them in and online memorial he made for noah right after he died the sandy hook denier is downloted them and re propas them into cruel means wrote fake across noah's face tek a picture of his headstone and photo shopped under his name is not buried here botos of his taughters were circulating too he could not just leave them out throughon the web with the trols lenny got consumed with minking about how to take control the situation hadexstrack noa ind his family from all this the narnet did not scare him it was actually his comfortsone he ran his own eye tee business hhe was not the kind of guy who satarount and complained about how something did not work he was the guy who fix stuff you me to find whok he proplemess and then find what your solution is and tin tar canning closure to that solutions ta bistup otherwise the problem is overwhelming and thend you jus want someoe else to fix it for you on me you have the tract down where you can make a difference and get closer to theing less broken there was one ofther thing that made lnny especially qualifi to deal with the conspiracy therrists huse to enjoy those theories ind salf the classic fun once thig but lockness ery fifty one nassifaking the moonlanding wlike what is the fun of it am it is uspending your disbelief it is sitting down and watching siensfection w we an an looking at the woot if and it is it is just fun specially if there is no price to pay in your life in his now cost to that way of thinking that it is just te game sometimes he even listened to alecs jones in his car and in fact just a month after the shootings when lenny first saw those things on alecs jones's web sight he tried to reach out he fouded general infowarsymal drass and shot him off this message alec i'm very disappointed to see how many people are directing more anger at families that lost their children in newtown accusing us of being actors have not we had our share of pain and suffering i used to enjoy listening to er shows now i feel that your type of show created these hateful people and hey need to be reeled in exclamation point about an hour later he hard back from jones's staff and they responded with we have not supported the cresactor clam we consisted its true event imnot this was not true jones did spread the crisis actor theory it was on his wed side at the time and he stard talking about it a lot that see an an interview with veryneiqu he talked about it all the time such we have got bitty o manshon couper we have clear blo screeng out tere he is not there in the tounsquare we have got people clearly coming oup in in an laughing in the doin the fak crine we have clearly got people where ach actors playing different parts of different people iv le detted tan dowtinly there is a cover ot ther's actors ther men i puligting tey ben caght line and the were plee planing before it an rorld out with it what lenny wanted was a one on one conversation with jones but it did not happen therre fewmales after that asking me prove that i'm really who i am and sor of leading on t it get me omsho lenny did not want that he is very private and very reserves a behind the scenes kind of gie he is careful when he talks things no commet that is off the recard for do i had to talk about my personal life that came up all the time during our interview one of the groundrulls he gave is that i had to run his qots past him and his lawyer tecause he is worried about his own safety if his words for mis constrewed also he is fihting some of the conspiracy therison quirt we agreed to his terms and in the and he did not ask me to add it any of his quots but he did request that we remove one personal deetown and we did now a year and a half after he reached out to alecs jones he decided to try t a new tactic hed go directly to jones's followers and he other sandy hook conspiracy theoris i think he his approach was i'm going to make them see the light this is veryneiq she an lenny wreseparated when the shooting happens but were still a very much in each other's lives they decided to start releasing documents about noa report cards schoolphotos heven disclosed thel is deaths certificate which was a difficult decision that we made but figured after a while if providing this this hard copy convincing evidence that reason would prevail and they would say oh kay ye you have made your pit it or to come around lenny also decided he would answer any one's questions he wanted to join this notorious face book group called sandy hook hoaks it sqweare lot of the deniers were congregating and sharing theories the cover photo on their page look it came straight out of a horr movy a corpse girl with a keep quiet finger in front of heur mouth the administrator of the face book group immediately let himen did you identify yourself is i am a father ar youse y anywo wasn'n stanly to me it seems crazy to even go there this does not exactly sand a group of eople whod want a listen to you people who are conspircy minded ar see these tragedies unfold on the internet were on tolevation they still feel separate from these events and i considered that a bridging that gap could be an important step at a human elment to this thright that is right and here i am im on the person and let let us see what happens the question started pooring en why were not these children rushed to hospitals my was not anything done wyren't you soing he know thaantease or whyn't ye doing this why was not rescue how ofeter called from hertfrd and i started to recognize some of the patterns they were there there were the people you would expact in a conspiracy group ant i gun control people and i government people but also parents they were young parents with small children and they just could not wrapp their minds around the reality that than indulged can look and children in their eyes and bullet into their heat they just cannot deal with that the conversation on the facebot group quickly got ugly and abuses some of the members started using antisimitic firs len he was trying everything to keep up a report with them heven told them i listened to alec jones in my car i used to argue with people about nine eleven being an inside job i entertaing that we did not go to the moon but it did not work he started blocking people and fighting back this got him booted from the group what is remarkable is just how up for this whole fight he was when a bunch of people kept private messaging him lenny thought what i'll to start my own facebut group he called it conspiracy their a synonymous this name was men as a joke he has a dry sense of humor anyway he made some progress with people the people who were not full blown deniers who actually wanted help parcing out the truth of what really happens but they dropped away once they got answers and pretty soon the only one's laft were just dark sedistic trolls coming in to entertain themselves one of lennies worst trolls was a guiname wilfgang calbag that is his real name by the way he is a retired school security expertn for them his probably the number one new town hoks are in the world this guy travels to new town appeared is an exper on alecjonesis show he is even called for newtown parents to exume the bodies of their children to prove that their dat how teg ordered a background check on meney then sendan out in yemal to lots of people it was almost a hundred pages listeeng everything from his social security number and fo number to almost every address he would never lived at with phodos names of his relatives were included to the online harassment had become intents that lenning and very neek and their two girls went into hiding they move een to separ ate high security gated communities but lenniy's address kept getting expose and hoakes er started posting vidios of where he lives one apartment that i had moved then to i'd only lived there i think for a month and i got a call from a particular hoaxir who happend to be in prison now for attepted murder and don he called me up and was acting a smarass and then red me myselfsecurity number and then red me my address where i just moved thinto and i said won youknow i to department that much anyway and and i moved shortly after that to try and throw the hoaxers off lenny started putting nutility bills in different names and got multiple peo boxes all over the place ball this forse lenting into a new battle strategy if they were gon exposed him he do the same to them he wrote newspaper on bads cling out halbag an the others by name and when thes hoaxers posted his new addruss as on line he did the same to them he also made it to that if you gugled their names the first thing any one would see was all the sandy hood garbage they would created and leny being lenny decided to write a biography about wulf gng halbig's life called the hoaxs of a lifetime he really sis an yeu book lenny became the one who knocks he calls is troll rustling tit is trolling the trolls he gets both energize and sheepish when talking about it he insists sometimes he only way to fight hard cor hoaxers as i turn the tables on them and at worked on some of them frek them out still lenny was just one guie and every day new mountains of content about no overshowing up on line his crusade was a lonely one the hoaxers seemed dangerous thos to the other new town parents wanted to stay as far away as possible from them and my darker moments the conspiracy part of me would return and ask myself and mi the only one that poshed a child why am i the only went fighting thack anthou's goon and people were trampling all over other peoples children's memories and the children no longer had of wish to defend themself and beoplere ju silent about it but while lenny was esculating his tactics was the other side around the second anniversary of sandy hook a small group of conspiracy theorists made an almost three hour movy on you tobe questioning the shooting the described themselves as independent journalists and researchers but their backgrounds were totally random they included a magician the owner of a moving company a guy who been arrusted for stabbing some one five times and to stay at home dad i just hav an idea that i wanted to be and underground sill maker myself this is dug mc guire he says he ment this group on line on you tob and got brought in at the end to help polish the movy it felt exciting at the time dug was a struggling fill maker and lass angelis occasioally did some stump work he got in to conspiracy theories the way lots of people to wuatching them on you to lenny he loved the ones about big foot and nou a foes but then he went to look up news about sandy hook and you tobes recommendation system started suggesting hoax pidios he did not believe the theory that the kids were actors he thought children died but he felt pretty sure there was some other kind of cover up going on maybe one with the moffia and where did you get that in formation where did you come up with this idea of a mob had you rud this somewhere a moers cas i make movy a i think i have an act ofe imagination well i 'm confuse thi what was youre thinking aa family head done some one wrong ly li say the movy good fellows o ca i henry hell is is hiding out an a little village is he the also mention kinnerverin cop when they release their film they uploated it to a bunch of different accounts on places you tobe vimio daily motion pretty soon it was showing up everywhere to combat this lenny had a changed tactics one final time no more talking to hoaxers one on on now the thing he would focus on was content removal scrubbing their stuff off the inner nat he decided he was going to get every single copy of the moe taken down which was not going to be easy he could not just writ into you tob and say hey the pidio was full of lives that was not gon to be enough the iner net is full of lives he needed something else and he realized he had it thes conspiracy therus had used potoes and vidios of him and noand barenek those were his property taking this movy a copy wright violation the stolen images were now a useful wep ten leny track down every place where thes vidio was posted and he' probably seeng thus there is little button uand click on to report stuff that is what he did for hours every day and success sortus the hoaxers kept reposting and moving the vidi re on the other sides the crazies an ot running the asilum it is it is the platforms who were allowing this to go on that solidifies it for me that we have to just remove all of this carovage and that is all we need to do but this of course pestof a lot of hoaxers bwe do not know what is going on we just nowi donin look right alix jones he was stumped lenny had successfully forced the enfowar sight to remove pictures of noa using copy right show frus trate this is amazing the clamat us lenny pausoner they think because thakin hold out some little cange in shate we are shutting people's wat shit town becaust there

in hiding he would moved multiple times by then because hoaxers kept tracking down his address but now the chances that a hoaxer might show up at his door and kill him suddenly fhelgt much higher his kids were living with hin half the week and he worried about them at the same time he did not consider stopping he did not think it would make them safer that is one of the misconceptions that exist that people think that i am only targeted because of challenging the content and that is not the case i took the action because i was being targeted f my addressis published all over the internete my photo is published all over the internete and my living children's phodos are published on lying that is existed before i did anything i dare not cause the targeting it was already there ia's menamizing the targeting he posted receipvts for firearms i'd asked if he actually bought them and he would not give me an answer and that all this lenny kept up his daily ritual he would wake up m hy coffee and then sit in front of his computer for hours flagging contnt trying to sys tematically arace noa from the sandy hook hoak story there wis a lot of stuff he couldn invoke copy right law for let the dath threts an harassment that was much harder to get taken down the tut companies were wary of becoming arbiters of truth making decisions about what its users could and could not say but lenniy and his usual methodical fashion kept chipping away on you too he kept a squore card whence he nailed some one with three copy right strikes you two would remove their accounts he killed thousands of vidios this way the hoaers called this getting posnered he become a hashtg then he and verine help get a professor an florida named james tracy fired the skuy at harass than for years and kept using know his image to promote his conspiracy theories he is also the one who help popular eyes the conspiracy term crisis actor on his blogright after the shooting tand that woman who was

reality and there is no fiction there are no alternative facts he barred her from infolwars and that their conspiracy web sights is oe of the conditions of her paroll one surprising thing that happened over the years is that some of the hoaxers who used to harass lenney flepe to his side there were dosands of them enny says these were people who came to him only after they change their own minds not people he tried to convert he says that never works it is a waste of time some of them became disenchanted when they saw sandy hook hoaxers who were more interusted and photo shopping

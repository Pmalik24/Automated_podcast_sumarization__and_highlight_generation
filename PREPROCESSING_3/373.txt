welcome to the huberman laponcas co science science tace to s i mandruhubermen and om a professor of naurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor sotchan panda doctor sotchen panda is a professor and director of the regulatory biology laboratory at the sulk institute of biological studies his laboratory has made numerous important contributions that impact mental health physical health and human performance for instance his laboratory discovered the nurons in the eye end nurons within the brain that regulate our called circadian rhythm circadean rhythms are twenty four hour rhythms and everything from gen expression to the overall functioning of tissues are levels of mood and alertness ore ability to sleep appetite and much much more in addition over the last decade doctor panda's laboratory has made critical discoveries in terms of how our patterns of eating over time impact our biology and our health in particular his laboratory pioneer discoveries related to called intermittan fasting also sometimes referred toe as time restricted feeding today doctor panda and i discuss how our circadian behaviors everything from when we wake up to when we view light to when we avoid viewing light to when we eat and what we eat and when we socialize and how we socialize impacts our biology and our psychology and how all of that has a strong impact on our health during to day's discussion you will learn how restricting your feeding to specific periods within each twenty for our cycle or perhaps even exploring longer patterns of fasting and eating sycles can impact everything from the health of your liver to your gut to your brain and how all of that impact things mood end your ability to perform cognitive work indeed to day's discussion goes deep into all aspects of intermittan fasting a a time restricted feeding we talk about the basic science as well as the recent clinical trials that have explored time restricted feeding in a diverse range of people including men women children people with diabedes people who are otherwise healthy and much much more i'm quite aware that intermittan fasting is the topic of much debate these days we go deep into that debate and by the end of today's discussion you can be certain that you will have learned all the latest end all the details all made very clear to you thanks to the incredible expertees discovery and clear communication of doctor panda as some of you may already know doctor panda has authored several important books on the topic of intermitten fasting and how it can benefit various aspects of health those books include the circadian code and a more recent book the circadian diabedes code both of which weve provided link tue in the shownote captions in addition if any of you are interested in learning more about doctor panda's work including seeing his publications and reading those publications were supporting his laboratory you can do that by going to his laboratory website which we have also linked in the shownote captions before wou begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate fror my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is element element is an electorolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolites and no sugar ow salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurants in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performants element contains a science bactrolectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that is one grahm of sodium two under milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolites and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemente doccom slash hubermen to claima free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleemente docom slash huberment and now for my discussion with doctor sachin panda such in doctor panda good to see you again y i got to see we are colleagues still but we used to be read across the street fror one another ah ye mo tose days a i'm deligy that you are here e i think we are going to talk about a number of things mainly intermittan fasting time restricted eeding and health but also the many other thingsthat you are doing just before we started recording we were a discussing your recent paper in nature i at involve recording is from postmortem human retina maybe if there is time at the end we can get back to a your lab has shown that egan essentially maintain or resurrect nurons from dead people in order to potentially and eventually provide transplants to rescue vision and the blind that is extremely exciting but of course not the main folkus of to days discussions s'll have to i splitted up em the first quession i have is how am i supus to define fasting and time restricted feeding in meaning when i go to sleep every night i'm not eating in some sense everybody is doing time restricted feeding to some degree or another at what point can we start thinking about a pattern of eating is time restricted feeding called interment an fasting does it have to do with how regular one is about the start and stop times am how do you think about defining intermitten fasting time restricted feeding and may be just to simplify the come resration is one term more orrect than the other intrems of de scribing thi incredible paron of feeding well that interpreted fasting ofas many tipes of fasting i'm gatually it started long time ago and it is embedded into the history of callo ry restriction i'm almost hundred years ago people show that if you reduce callorin takin ta rat than that drat can live for a long time and in those experiments the callories were reduced every single day and that led to the idea that if we cot down our callories by twenty percent said thand we can potentially live longer by doing two things one is preventing is related disease or even if we fall us a false sak maybe we can axcellorat cure and keep the pair mechanasin going that we can live longer but it was very difficult to am count callories every day and reduce menten that i'm by must say that it is not that callic restrict on is impossible or we are not doing it in fact lot of us we do am count callories in our sub conscious mine and severy time you took out at you take out we take out a sora bottle or something a'm looking arout cer r in sicticulocallor pariclo calogilocilocallon we are doing that the point is it is it is we are doing subconsciousy some kind of callory a counting but reducing callory by twenty tady person every single day is not possible for many people then the idea cam in mouse and rat experiment whether they can eat every other day i'm and in fact this every other day feeding i also led to very similar almost ecuvaland help him from and as i'm continuous callo restriction i'm then the idea was well every other day is little it hard for humonths vust justin mas an ou just get to eat an only one day an another day then the idea can well for humonths can dey eat less for one or two days in the week i'm that le to this five two died for people can eat for five days and and two days that reduce callories that is also in tomitarnaly people are fasting i'm then as walter longer also can with this idea that perody fasting maybe four or five days in every month or two months three months yo can fast o reduce gallory and he also found many benefits ofcallo restriction was there with those studies on ihumans many of the study started it an mice but a alternate their fasting five to and a'm walter speedyly farst fasting all of them have now been done in humonths not for longivity of ourse pecause cannot do thus for a long time a but for whet mentonancs for reducing some signs of aging or reversing those things have been done all of them i have been done in humants mostly healthy humans and in some kisses people with a predivities or some maspectial men iblibiis that let t the idea that that all this forms are fasting in which the total callori can take on any given day is reduced for one or more days in a week a month that becan that umbrella tom became intimate and fasting it yew look up the scientificultreature most intimet an fasting involves intensonally reducing callories for at least one or two days in a week or am few days in a month when we a publiche time restricted feeling am the innicale mouse experiments and even now most of the mouse experiments we want to test what is the impact of time restriction wars a callory restriction in these experiments we do not reduce callory on any day of mouse life the mice ir the same number of callories as the arlivitom ford mice a but still the sa health benefit that is what we call it time restricted feding but since it involves living without foo for several hours for some people which is a it can be very difficult are the inicale experiments was done a thouhware done for eight hours of feeding and sixteen hours of fasting that kind of become popular and an that that is a people use the same tom as intomitan fasting and now if few a sane tometan fasting and popular literature of oplar milia than people usually refor to time restricted itting uso now coming back to how do you define time restred feeding anso the way we have in time to define experimentally and also in a literature is an trying to confine all your enogien take fram solid and liquid for combine within a consistent window of eight to twelve hours because that is something that dweble op course people have done time distreetreating with four hour six hours and some people ivein try to eat everything within two hours one miller day am wthe fond is those one not fusible to menten for very long time for lod of people one question about the six hour resis eight hour is twev our feeding window is it important that the feeding window begin an end at the same time never oless ye or an if how much flaxibility is there for in since i'm somebody that i am not terribly hungry in the morning i to drink water usually some caffen an electrolights yin the period before my first meal am mi first me al always land some time between eleven and eleven a m and twelve noon there are exceptions occasionally ohave a breakfast a proper breakfastas it is calld ah i gs toy improper if youare in in fassing for me am but tibically eleven a m or neness when i first e my last by thef food is typically round and a he thirty nine p m that is what worse for me yeis that consistency affording me any benefit sep an lets just leave aside sotalclerk number man or nutury and plan base meat et cetera but is there any benefit to shortening that feeding window that we are aware of were extending that feeding window a wore being even more rigid about the start an end of that feeding window yes the start of the fidding window u that is interesting because i an the concept of time te se feding when i described animal studies at feeding for hew months ot edin a the concept ac prthe sign subsecutien wi them that men sam a our body has an entornal time table a that is present in every cell in every organ am that three programs a many my licclar aspects of the selles that les tofido is an all the stuffs of that essentially a thare is a pre detormin time table for every cell every organ to do sudden things at certain time and am the secadian clocks as you and i know a more sensitive to light light is the most dominant a time giver i fr a jample when daylight seving time changes or when we travelled from one time jon to another times on we feel kind of crappy because or deily activities a out of sink from a in ton ofclock that was non for very long time but than onte yor to cousin to toin two am there is a famosex feriment by willy sibler from sigu mand what he did he just fed the mice at the long time m sudden noced on o ther night fe dos and when he fed a myce during daytime that liver'clock instead of following it is on rootin live ofclock actually started following foot that means by changing our feeding time we can chence we can tune out liver ofclock and subsequently the same experiment has been repeated many times and can we depeated that into thother nine and wefellid out yes i shally outside this bran centr call supe ciasmatike new cleas or esian which is considere the master sicatian clock almost the rest of the braniven follows when we eat and that came oup from peersham bonslab in europe a whethe systematically looked at ivin am plesces that are vere close to the assiun an for those who are we know or some deal hypotolamos or baramentrical a ne cles all of this within coupl up or four five millimeters of the asand but they were following foot you mis then am and now if we think about it for a jumple when the daylights haven time changes just one hour chance anm or one our change in a linemen between our intornal time and external time lits to kind of feeling groggy and feling not at a peak for formonts for one or two days the rule of tom is when the time giver changjust by one hour thand or internal clock exs a tlisted day to catcup that means if youre flying from ella to new york ar youve moving throh three times yons thand on an hour is it will take three or three days to catch up with the new york time for some people it can be even slower and for some people it can be two days but the borrow mine is yes there is a an decent cronie then what does it mean for the bodies the one of the congson of clck is to anticiparet when you are going to wake up for examples the blodfressors slightly goes ouk or hartred goes up a breathing goes of similarly for food almost every organ that is enbordent feeding our eating digestion a all of them have clocks even from a live of production thereis the fast fars of our digeston to secletion of all the digestive jewson the a stonger and then i've jorson of new try and than livor matavolism everything the whole villis expects wen y a sup as to eat and tha getting ready for you to eat the fast meal after fasting for long time thats firs breaking the fast or breakfast an and when that time changes when you change it by to or three hours from one day to another than a sometimes are on food in come maybe am well come at a long time we were at the long time and then the trat the new eatin times suppose ta one day you have been eating every day at eight a an a i ieteryten sos tat when you starre yhea your i jon whend you wen does your feeling win tdowis shut our sixpean iit for round ten hours pokagen am and then one day if i switz tor ten and than what happens is a clock is thinking whell the food in't arrive at tet but it arrived at ten maybe to morrow the foodall arrive somewhere between eight and ten will be a there or nine son they and next dayif i come back and eigt at eight ofclock and i may eat but my clock is not ready to digest that for that is why this idea is you hard to beconsistent a to take advantage of this anticipatory activity ofofclock in thefferent system to get the best out of it is there evidence that those insicipatory systems in am as they relate to digestion help us better a similate our food i would imagine evean if you have the gaster cus sistery in help digest the proatying fats an corritorates an tha already deployed at the time when you eat i can imagine that foot will be better youl ise than if you do not am in other words what is the advantage of having these anticipatory signals i'm in terms of a potential health benefits the anticipate is signal is really important from even even from working up m there isan why many people feel not ready completely when they wark up when alarm clock because the alarm clock warks you up but your body is not prepared that slipping as after warking out when alarm clock is dear to our body is not prepared for that and then the best example is when the o when am the daylights heving time changes particularly whand we have to wak up one hour early awhat happens people who have onder lying heart conditon am whend they are waking up when the body is not ready your heart is not ready and all officon the hart has to start pomping little retard or tand there is chance of hart ar tat an in fact a people have looked that hospital records and the the find that on those days and there is a sart rise in hartartacts an lecor accidents and caraccidents too because your bran is not cording at ded you cannot a mek os fined assistance that is a great example of anticipatary activity but coming back to digesten wanting is am and this is something that many people might have experience the many of thems in our digestive system and one of the them is our loo our intestime has the sparstaltiy function it kind of contractian expance and that mos for mo food doesn move dou to gravity sit goes back an foot and that bety staltic acts on actually slows down at night a few hours after our last meal and am that is why when people eat late at night for example a then that for does not get digestad because thereis not enough nigest in jes futing and second even if it gets ndigested in this tog it does not more fropaly then the next morning people get up and tink im of course not peoplepon yon some uncle ho vetty oft on a nunde think that this is hangla but those who do not a con you macal an thehave the food hangl because it does not diest that is one extreeme y jamplof a for i did long time can im hevdy port i delong time can be cot o junk ye i've uem experience that were if i've worked later i could not eat dinner or something and then i get home i always debate weather or not to try and sleep ybut if i'm too hungry oftentimes it is challenging and for me sometimes consuming something that it least seems easily digestible yogard or something in a liquid form im is better for me than if i eat a meal i've made a mistake of going to the refregerator being super hungry in eating abounch of food it ten or eleven p m and then falling o sleep and indeed the sleep if i'm tired enough can be quite deep but the next morning i feel just completely physically in and cognively weighed down i think it what you just describe makes a lot of sanse is it if some one were to select o a feeting window regardless of whether not it falsn't a classic intermen fasting time or stic of feeting sounds eating your first bite of food in eating your last bite of food at more or lest the same time each day has benefits i have this question you mention feeting verses eating and i think it is actually not just a a dramatical as it isomantic issue and heare's why we tend to think about when you take your first bite of food and then when you take your last bite of food but course foods digested different raids mor fat in there is can digest make carbogrs dijust slower et cetera men there isall these adjustments to the li see mc index and forth with foods and commination i is it better to think about not eating but you are fed state and blood sugar for instance i often get ast on sociomedia does blank break a fast i and i to think about it scientifically cookate is does plain water break a fast no does air break a fast no does one grain of sugar of sucrois break a fast well probably not but does one teaspoon of sugar break a fast well you could say yes but transiently i mean when we are talking out breaking a fast are we talking about a rise in blood glue coasts or are there molecular signals downstream of of a rise in blood glue coasts that im cannot be reverse an other words if in can eat my first meal every day at noon and iman eat my last a bite of food at eat p m and at nine a m for whatever reason i've coffee with one teaspoon of sugar in it i suppose in the strictest sense i've brokein my fast but maybe by if i went for a hard run that morning maybe by nine thirty a m an back in a codan cot fasted states what is the fasted state really because when i'm eating at eight p m just to give another example i'm start fasting at eight or one perhaps ye but i have my blodlucosis ill of eats i'm not really fasted i ino fed ye is just that i'm not eating the verb right ga a you i again i i do only get overally detail just for sake of getting detail but i think a lot of the confusion out there about what breaks a fast ye is related specifically to this issue ye which is if i eat a whole pets after sitting round all thay it is very diffent thin i fi eat a hol pets a after having run or twenty six moul merithon that y very different ye am metabolically speaking how should people think about fasted verses fed it can we be mildly fasted verse a severe fasted can we be am fed ish verseis very fed anyway il il as stop a asking questions now because they all relates the same thine ye now dis a am very interesting question an tan unfortunately as you can as you have you might have seen in life am the most obvious questions are often on man sad because it is hat to do this dam experiments becase if you really want to address tis in humans eure to bring himand o them in isolacom just you said i can now imagine flanning five or six different explainments each explaments wurd in ball eight or tan volunteers its ngendo sex and then do it sits difficult and now let us go back to see how do e a less diset it an in tomself san in derat calerymatri for example in dirt callrymatry is best on this principle that what orox isan we brethen an cabon diexad we a brethout if yeu can measure ti still than we can figure out withor body in tortal we we are not saying whether it is the livor a got or fat or muscle in tort of others a consumic blucas or fat as another source the idea is when we fa when we have without food for several hours tan ideally a body will tapon to glacosan first an than to litle bit of fat and than when bod is mustle running on fat than that dresio a seeor to to oxisan will come to point seven am but what is interesting we can do this explariments an mice we can go to mi an ascok is o what happens in mice an mice mice a little very different because mi sa nat simply little people there the metavolism is deferent tey sti relatively less lik cosin an he monts til in toms a fa toto matavlis i they overnight within twelve to fourteen hours the addiav respiritory extensres yo a thisresio will go from one when the conjuming mostly glucos of carbohydred as sen as i sos ital slow down slowly go to point seven porn seven five sapter twelve to fourteen hours that kind of mostly running on fat now as we give them food am within ten or fifteen minutes that not atually conguming couple of grans of food an they might have congume sa hundred to hundred miligram of that chal it is less than a fie pushno ther foot then the adia will immediately begin to rise as if that small amount of food stov that fat burning prosis and can got the am carbohide burning proses when you say fat burning process you mean body fat store being burned right not dietary fat crect yes er is all body fat ince that that is wha said an we do not know wher that fat is being burn because we ars us measuring how how much mice is bidding in and out am for a jample it can be from the skin subcutonious fat or belly fat or but not dietary fan now by that time the diete fat is alla the abjurved and digest ed and hopfullits as sitting in the livero i de postitiou some wher but it is the fat as body fat yes thank you for yat you hve the reason i ask is that nowadays i think more than half of the battles about nutrition that i see on line relate to this issue were i will not name names but some one will come along and say a lo carbohidry died allows you to burn more fat an end the more newance o people out there will say well that is true but you are also talking bout dietary fat the word fag anfuse people i realize you are not doing that you ere certainly ot when the people guilty of doing this but indeed you eat more fat you'l burn more fat but that iesn't mean you'l burn more body fat an fat i think the dad i say that under conditions of cor restrition you will atually burn lass i yey do not gat pri yet i prother yet am pitch fort sir sand a through the mal toward me an on that one but but i thing that is true whereas people who can soume carborhydric can still burn body fat even thoug the majority the feel there burning is from carbohidrate a here in this case prer jample for mice we know that as soon as they start eating am the adia goes up coming that to yo costan what woull the ideal for us to do the explainment would be okin weill go back to that and then give the mouse may be hundred meligram of food and maus ron aron in the cas and then well continue to measure to see how long it takes for the mouse to come back in them that is one us nowlet e am let us stay on this and then i'll come back and talk about non caleric for and how whether that is considered t i to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athladic greens a lettit greens now called eih g one is a vit him in mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs i've ben taking athltic greens since two thousand and twelve some delited that their sponsering the pod cast there is ma story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take ath ltic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets o be the probiatics that i need for got health ar got is very important its populated by got mycrobioda that communicate wit the brain the mean system and thasically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impack our immediate and long turn health and those probotics in ath letic greens are optimo and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains an number of adaptigins vitiments and minerals that make sure that all my foundationol nutritional needs are met and it taste cri if you to tryathletic greens you can go to ath letic green stock calm slash humormen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic reens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera nd they will give you a yer supply of vit im in de three c too again that is that letic greenstock cam slash humormen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o vit him in de thre c to there is a famous experiman that was publishe last yer by gortacahasis slav and it cam out in sides and that rlets to calorecrestriction and we kind of started to deci deam we would start a dis cuss on that the dat explauments were done with caritrestrition and three such as gen thr duce callory conjenson by twenty person or tenty person and get that food the rats and then subsequently mice an they all lived longer what is interesting is an and all those experimans an there is such as cam an get this bullas op food at one time whet's the a liviton fared mice or rats the har atses to food all the time there eating all the time an then this tats a were given twenty person less and what happens is this mice o rats thatn going to take that less foo which is ress ar now and just it libet of fa lanch on an snack after three hours or snack ofte teus they would gubble uf all that food within two to three hours maximum four hours foot is gone there sort of on the omad di the one meal day ye the almost in one miler day to the four hours foot is gone ar ecen sa dan four hours iting of fiting and twenty hours fasting an then the question became well the benefit of calratestrition as we know is it deto e duced calory or time distrited feeting o time there 's a timing conforen to it that they are eating all of that within thro the four hours and then there is a long fasting and this the difficult question to ancsa becaus now yodoas this poor grastor an n certacnicience to come and splid that food anto eight or ten or fifteen differen small persons and then give them to mice in every two hours an sir georta cahassi who actually poblisd the fast peper in twenty seventeen showing that most calrictrestricson sor in i man he used the protocall that was used by cali restrictson feel i datually crears e condison of time restrictsion he sowd that an then he went back and worked with engineers to come up with the smart keds where am he could actually tell he got programm how much food is given to mice at what time of the day or night compleely programm then he took this a for examples uppose te the adliveton fared mice it is a five graunds of sha in a day and if you want to reduced gallories by a twenty person tan the se ar mous sould get foregraunds of food and e divided this and to nine or ten meals and then give them in every ninety minutes and this gess theting small meals throuhout ther nights there is no fasting he can saiy that whall thi smallse actually is not getting into fasting because in every few hours is i getting some food and then he measured how long the mouse is going to live am and he used am e countmints and this is a very standat pot o call people count howmany mice ap dying on which day and then examined them to see whether they died because the there was an accident of the actually there is a nestral cauds and then the calculat at the end what is the an half a lice fifty person survival an because that is on anoher is that sa good in dicator because if there is an outlier that t live for long time than that can skew what as interesting was the arliverton fared mice of cose the live cortain number of days and than this callory restricted mice that never got into super fasting but kind of eatings snacking throughout ther night that also live ten person extra then person longer that means callori restricts on extended life sfan by ten person i've wondered about this because recent we there is been there were bunch of news head lines about intermitting fasting and and frankly i was frustrated if you looked at one major news out wat they would say time restricted feeding of fords no additional benefit beyond coor restriction for wait loss ye then a another popular press than you what is call it that same study described as time restricted feeding does not work ye right and then another on er may be some place a anven more extrame yeav time r stricted feeding aonly beneficial because of coloric restriction or something lie that we essentially got are three different interpretations of the same data all of which are well two of which are true one of which is false in myht onion but whut i think people take away from that as oh time restricted feeding is not valuable which is not the case it i think for many people it is a convenient way to eat because at least for people me it is simpler to designate between portions of my day when i meeting importions of they my day when i'm not eating as suppose to eat a portion control you ave rather people portion control can work but all of that is related to either maintenance or loss of weight none of it deals with the potential health benefits independent of wait loss ye right and i i think that a if we can segment those out a obviously in humans its hard to no if a given treatment are experiment is extending life becaus youdo not really know how long people live anyway y right whereas with mice you have some cense of and the mortality was likely to recur what can we say about time restricted feeding and longevity in terms of biomarkers or in terms of any other indication that people who start and stop their feeding when nou at a consistent time somewhere between eight and twelve hours per twenty four hour cycle are tilting the scales towards living longer a supposed to living shorter this example of this nesarical da du menso is rel intresting because that dulesto dos a duracasis a study because i describe that if te spit galories an itro de de the tro denit the te mice live ten posnextra but if few now give maus the same caloriestricte diet and fid dem iving daytime wet o within twelve hours sar two hours then the mice live ten posn extra beyon that yes twenty perso anyolers case o lemy make sure i understand that i that i make sure i understand if you take a certain number callories and you distribute them throughout the twenty four hour cycle ye it is cloric restriction the mice will live ten per cent longer ye if you however restrict that to the active cycle y the for humans the dut daytime then twenty per then they live twenty per cent long honey posso it is not just total colori can take y a meaning it is not just importang to be submaintenance and calories forsake a longhevity it also is important as to when in the twenty four hour cycle you eat those calories to i have that right now thats still this tory is not ova because this mce wor ferdiving daytime on the not suppos to it that is right for us o wild be the equivalent of being on the night shift and only eating at night but a subcolori ya sub maintenance calory diet i guess its ar i what to say but weny fed mis during nighttime on the suppostoit and the same isgetting the same number of calories within twe bous or two hours and the miceli tharty five porson longer than the control thirty five per cent longer skale te human life spend w in a we do not know but but thirty five percent longer we mean that am and again no one knows but am humans now what is the average more chality in the unites say somewhere re wete life ex yes ir surroundly te use to beti nou slor a redious little bit because of cour it but lestek eihty o case of people then a living somewhere betwen twenty five and thirty five years longer ye hare n putting some marrobory ye e ye may as that us a really profound but now you pointed out am byamarcer another stups and now if yeu look at any given time within that experiment and atually jowen back and am had a separate cart of mice very similar and that he could tak tis osamples and of course in the scarse you have te sacrifice the mouse and he looked for a it did lot of molecleranalisis wit non marcos for example hemogloving ar one see cual an to glocos control colestrol all the stuffs he could not find anything that predicted the benefit of caleires tretion tat means in this experimen font of or we now far the predictor of longevite none of them wuld predict for the this am see are only moushe which it troo ten night that mouse is going to live less than the night fare moushe that was going to live tarty fy twenty five por om extra does that mean that they are by markers relates a lon gevity that we just have not discovered yer ye that is ejectly that means what awe we know far about bya marers a those he could not use to predit maybe there as a lot of nice maybe he wanted he had to use more number of mice to get that because in of bymarkes and not going to predict in everys instance of they som er what is also very interesting is if you look at the body where ton body composison of all this mice there is no difference in body werton bote composition across all these differy a cus all this grots doesn' matter when they at y rovided they were submit sob calloranents calory intake sa las fewer calaries than is required to maintain their waight in matter what pattern of eating they were the same way yes that in many ways seems to me make the human studies wete thy say look it does not eally matter whether not you use cort restriction in or were you start your refeeding window in the morning or star you feeding win now in the evening or you am were you portion control for sake of waiht conwe loss beca a taking i nat sort of that and non another thing with the human study that o wer referend to her am that in that human study people are actually already eating within ten hours window habitually when they selected this people to hav them and roll in the study tere ar already ating for ten hours and fasting for a fortin hours all partisipans had to reduce that callorican tik and thet i duced by almost twenty five person the see at grup continued with ten hours sitting windo and the see at loss time destricted wo had toe the same number of callories within eiht hours it is just a two hour difference suggested to hours difference o ge that people i just one may sure people can understand is in this human study which is the one that i felt that the popular press venus all except one vanuw am got either same wrong or badly ron interms their conclusion that was my interpretation anyway was that either people came into the study eating basically in a ten hour feeding window which i goes back to my first question which is that most people are not eating in the mill the night ye or if there on' shift work and they are then there sleepings ture in the day anyway there reading in a ten a twelve hour feeding winyw anyway se saying they either did coloric restriction portion control within the ten hour window or another group within the study eight sub maintnance cawories to coric restriction see are as wer calling it the acarnam see ar but recu to that to an eit our feeding window and they did not see any difference in terms of weight lost ye but i lot the no not all that surprising right i mean if it is just a two hour difference ye exactly we have done that explaiment and my son we do not see am difference in not only wetlost many of the marcers and i was telling you about this am gortacasis paper where i told you that he allowed this mice to eat within two hours or twelve hours sub gelleric dait two or twelve two or twelve yet that is ramatic but still he did not sae stands in lungivity ven within those two that means am when you do kelle costrictson and than at least per mots and you are within twelve ovr swindow am that is that is giving be mice the best benefit the otemon benefit and m two three or five or twelve pre mous does not matter at least for lungivity can we conclude for humancs that whether not a feeding window is for hour six hours eight hours or twelve does not matter provided the callories ar or similar or same wele i will not go to that extand because we do not know many of this a particularly we do not know how thi sort or eting window will affec both success because and o we all listing many of this mos experiments iven that i tolly abon tose a don only in melmice but that should be changing right because the in a age i know this cause im mon study section which jis just a monch or people who recort who review grants is that every grant now has to include sexces biological variable you lart to get away with a am or rather i should say the way it should wbe stayed which is people are required and shou want to look at these phenomenon in male and female mice yes especially if there are differences in tisces am the many omens there is also another people am in time disto depeting that also came out te big paple soing that they a comoisinnasis was accounting for loss in fat mas in time disto fed mice that is also done only in male mice am this is am we are paying artenson to it we are now doing all apor studies in male and female and wedo si big differences between mele an fiman coming back to humans what difficully happens is when youare trying to do four hours or six hours o time resterdating people will inadvetently reduce tha caricanting it just because of got volume i tried one only onle for a day and and i felt i was eating much at that one sitting y that it led to lot a gastric distress and i are tired after the meale and parthe reason i to do time restricted feeding as i have more energy ye and certainly in the fastid state i feel more energize especially if i'm injesting or cafine or something ye a people ile dus am an o yontakan then some peoplep are more active they can actually unconsciously ther may be spending more enorgy in thet physical activity and bissal me a wileget all of this combined than homosaitin and that can hav iv very ad busiffect in long tom because we now that this and o e defisit an in pacterse am simety pictom for that is call thed es delective an ode deficit in sports re of energy defasit in sports oke ye s because nearly forty person of atlets am not the ana fell is but the lot of people who do trackan field am and nearly forty persone of atlers actually experience this reds eher tes withouet knowing can male and female aleds both meeries are rads it is reds are e d as a he always is an osy relative energy defisit in his forors interesting is the first i have heard this acrinem we have a new acrinim folks is is gid thad to a list of other acanims but i males and females can experience it we are w in females i've heard that am reds am can lead to a emin a rear loss of of mens of the menstrual cycle ye that is a common that a soprevean dat in fact many women many female atles they take it for granted that yes if they are more active than the lose the menstral cycle which is a which may be common but it is not nomal or ofte mamper helt and even if they do not want to get pregnent ye ye yeye a we had an expert on female hormons come on it and say the very same thing that regular cycling is a is very well of a obulatory menstrual cycles is important to tryind am maintain ye tem it that is one but then what is really concerning is am it does affect bone healt and am in this state people actually o a long pere of time the losebone mas and the bone also becomes more phrone to injury micro fracture and fractures am again its the risk means if some people are trying to eat within very short time in their physical active that happens and it also has impact on a mins the reason why these women are losing menstral cycle is there am it speg axis is disrupted hypotolamas pitutory gonada laxis and it starts in messtardin in off strimg at hypotolamas ar pitutors to that means that it is be a axis hypiotolamas pitutory and a drinalaxis may also get disrupted one of the symptoms of reds is also the presson anxiety bicolar symptoms and we know that many am many atlerts experience that we think that well this dhis may be just perofressor that always trying to compete and we know them unfortunately their few atlers who just cannot copit tand the many are temptertryside or seside this is a serious issue and am there is also another new topic in the lagh to come up with ta mouse mordel of reds and then study it a but this is one this why we sa not reduce soreating interval to two sut to one meal ar very short time a because it can have atborside effect that we don' known now am maybe in future will figure outt when we systemarically study them there are studies that are published soing four hours and six hours time restritarating has benefits on wetloss but those areon healthy individuals and they are in the studies o the am and on the study chame pocav a were allethe monitoring the mature that there is no sudden wetcloss or wetloss below am some septy level a those are very different from regular people who are who maybe even normal wet a even wit a within the healthy rents if they do than they can potentially thats fy what we think is eight or ten hours maybe the ideal spot to begin with and am once you are physically active and you are also spending a lot of enorgy ind physical activity of sports you can even go uf to twelve hours because in mice we have done that experiment am of to twelve hours the dose get lorl benefits not all but this is tweve ours of twelve as or feding al vors or pastin am in humans am again nobody has done systemarically twelve hours but there is one study in europe am from tein high collect lav and t and i and i we collaverates of they used or my sicilian clock ap this is ha resor shap we develop just to this is mostly used in time resuited eating studies and an he had nearly i think he started with two hundred swits a participencs but thenade and he selected and to the small number of gru people whoere very an meticulars of what recording all their foor divided them into usual feeling whatever they wanted to eat one ofer they wanted to eat and they were given the a advice of swis new preson advice that is given to improove health and reduced lod lookers almost thi itis preevenson program in the uers and then the other groop was given advice to eat within twelve hours an this was very early on in time le sreating and we thought that the mice wor getting some benefit let try with t he twelve hours has any benefit nd the bottom line is and the end of a three months and six months wert an he reported is both groofs lost same amount of bodywet an and than there as not too must significant difference between groofs but both goovs actually improve their health the bottom line is the swis newpresonal advise that he was giving an which is the standard of care there it a cheve the same amount of wetlaws as just giving people this advise thas eat within twelve hours one way to look at it look at the resolters this and and then he went to more extent and actually look that every single meal thes people congum dor close to i think close to sixty or seventy thousand mildrecors and pictures he went to and then classified them to say whather these are and good quality food o the call it the novar classificuson on to thre for one is the food that e can almost eat ror frots vegtables and yoor good daily frodocs that you can almost without any preparson and then second an nover two is can of home for a home cook food that most people wil prepare in few minutes and than three and then fourth one is the food that i can never prepare at home for example biskit or cookies that we usually purches and few o tof this and usually the nover for or ontel the oltraposas food of which we should not be atings or the advices to reduce nobov for and what he found was a people who got all this advice an to re improve that nutresen quality they actually improve than inpresen quality the reduce that nover for foor and people who were in timely srating the et we did not twelve hours they did not chance than iupreson quality but what is interesting is the both got the same modest wetlows that begs the question that in the meybitan hi wuld do this expectiment to combine nutis on advise with time restrictsion and maybe it deals the time to ten hours and that migt help am twelve hours is some ting that i say any one from five year or two hundred year old can do and am if yo are trying to menten wet that might be a good way and combine that with exercise 'll begreat and y an people can more easily avoid reds yn the way women and for non at leats or recreational exerciseercises women if they distribute their cawories across twelve hours or less likely to lose ther menstrual cycl yes sir and this is something that we have to look carefully they have to be because we do have the micicatyan clok ave that many people downlord and self monitor in the sal the deteforisuches and we will not providea link to that by the way it is a great i's a great sul yebut once in a while we do get is inport from some women saying oh i started doing year timelessating and i am seeing all this prodlands son than i ask them akis what else are you doing the difically improve tha nutysan qualities o thating only salar and few nd the trying to inclise the fiver intak and it is really hard to eat much of uncood for because cooking helts to at jer monnetent and that at the same time that running five miles every day and of course all of this combinely candly to reds simptom that is y twelve i think is a good point if a combining an physical exercise and better nuwty some quality because in mie also we have seen that if misiating healthy food and thiting within ten to twelve hours thand they also live longer than mis that ting healhy for but distributing that calory of a long perd of time and this is am a hindy cabas am finding from an iets he has systematically done thi study with two different tipes of diet and in mice and he finds the same thing that even ms that aiting within twelve hours they do live longer than mice that it annomly even heldic i i recall a recent study i think he was either probishon reports or reports n aticon for give me for not memering which both of course self press journals excellent journals which explored time restricted feeding in the contact of lo carborhydrates were non locorborhydra dies is lo carborhydrate verses lo carborhdrate an time restricted ye these al coloric match y rite between groups and then non locarborhydra dies sos you re standard i think he as somewhere in the eighbourhood of sixty per cent of cowase from complict corborahydrates and and as i recall the a the greatest weight loss ember sane cawories across groupfolks a was achieved with lo carborhydrate pluscolor ic restriction ye am and i wondered why all the popular nes vanus didn cover that study am that thats one bringing it now i thouht this is really interesting and umand i'm somebody who is cychled low carbohydrate diet em before i find it hard to sleep after about three or four days of being on a low starch ye i just personally i sawi to eac some starches especialy if exercising intensely your working intensely thus juss a litte editorial there that but look i know many people who do just feel better on a low carbohydrate die but wat what d you think of those data because it speaks to the idea that oke it is not just the total number of calories it is not just the quality of those callories it is the timing of those callories and maybe carbohydrate restriction in conjunction with time restricted feeding might be the best path for people who are looking to lose waigt ny i tortalyeg that when it comes to a nutis an quatity quantity in timing all this three mate nearly forty plessent of people who menten hadiboribet because sixty plessen or ol wedo bes forty peson da mintening hadiboribet and not of those forty plessent ouwt say nearly medurity of them a very a whereabout how mush thating and bo quality a fordeti i see youre really an optimist you looking at the forty per cent of the glass that is a or shald we say notful the that there was a pun intended but the no it is a very interesting way of looking at rather than saying in a wye or six you per scent of americans o beast a saying wire forty per cent nato beas they's a very interesting way to look at it yei'm in am sup conscieusly wot all tas making dendicism intid know mantime sur that you are not going on eating am tisbongon every day because am you ant eo you kno ye exactly i would not fyoua good ye i enjoy it cheesburger now and again but i am no not certainly not this stage uere any stage of my life i think that am i think people i actually think the pandema catal ot to do with tus i think that people started to take a look at what they were doing to support were not support their health generally i knw people gained a lot of waituring the pendemic other people got really into fitness i've seen some college t you have always maintained aum a you have always been in good shape ashes for some ive senior and while you seem to of age backwards you are at a a poster a for your own am ideas and hypotheses atout time rster tefeeding but but i am i knotice that during the pandemic an number of people emerged from the pandemic in better shape other people in much worse shape it seem thot as a it was a bimodal distribution ther a am ye i get the sense that starting and stopping eating at more or less the same time each day even if cloric restriction is not the main focus has additional benefits uam can we talk about some of those benefits as they relate to the other things that in packed health for instance if you are starting and stopping eating at more or less the same times each day are you sleeping better are you getting more predictable a sh ifts in oterness and sleepiness i can you project when you'r few good enough to exercise ye an mey we coal talk about tht because you of course am are well known for time rstricted feeding and scignce around that but also other things as well am not the least of which is circadin by ology generls i was think of the main timekeepers for our system being feeding whit activity the and social connection teramiss it many temp and temperature ye ye how do these combined with one another and using timing that we begin in stop feeding is kind of an ancer point we explore the lobut ye and are we got into this am bigginning an and anon we you ask for the callory how much callory will break the fast am one thing that i want m the listeners and viewus to bring back to this timing up when wa wen you are breaking the fast because we equet health with wit body wet and a that is when we are talking ofor nutison quality and quantity because both of them have impact now let us think about mental health cas lot of people thes troggle with mental healt they have anxiety ar a depression and also am sagot health because and ther lot of people who also have eserde flog or had bon and we know that ese defloxs or had bon can be exass of breaterd by ckaffin and takin empty stomach an those who have eserdeflox or had on their pron to them then am having black off in the morning before any food m cannop set their stomach that is fy in those cases is very clearly that kaffin for them becomes the trigger an that is something the fool i supposed to come and a the stomach is not seeing the foods is over reacting producing excess essered and that comes up to the eso fagus and that for their expense an if people have that kind of condition and may be destret consider when they dring their fast coffee i is breaking there overall fast or kind of putting them putting the healp at drisk for esede flugs the other thing as people who have anxiety panic attack am we know that kaffin can gans wou ar especially on an empty stomach especially hon i am ty stomach but them again kaffin can be a trigger that is why an i want to kind of dhe frenchere that there is this mental health and other aspects of healt and these are too clear examples fer anxiety panic attack telatted to bran healt or esede flug relatted to a got healt a in those cases when we condume that catiin in the morning can affect you avoid kaffin in the morning natually an here is the interesting a history about castian and this is something i did not know and an as once invited to this a history of nighttime activity and maybe we can take a little bit of detu and talk about a night time activity because that passiners me at thisicadian vilotis cause of a last two hundred thousand yearsments we assumed that humans homosappience evor two hundred thousand years ego we have been as the species we have been living on this plannet for two hundred thousand years and only in the last e can say couple of thousand or five thousand years when we came to control fire or meybe can even go back to hundred thousand years thet some divert an than the question is well when we control fire and we lighted op the fire and we could light up whon ewhat we wanted we can artfuel and we can stop the fire when we do not want it that is the ke ability in humans the defferenciates them from all the other species no other species we can always say yes there are signs of this intelligent an thisis on making for example we know many crows can make thisison many many animals they kind of figure out started i how to get food but control livse of fire e something very specific to human and when we started a controlling fire fire did not essentially extend the day because fire creeter day evening there as very different fram what people di during the day and what people use to do duing dhay they wat the lotments gathering food who has almost everything that we did and in the evening after the after the after we brought our food mostly tuvers or may be lentills to cook or once in a while animal that we can we could barbicu an all of the things happened around fire and fire was expensive that it was mostly co minol pire if you go back to for example masil and all this uncesar sorry an a populations that have no access to electricity and a still living kand of that a historical life a fire is a coming alevent and the sat aroun the cood food and then what happened they did not talk about walk the talked about an culture the tar the sang the danced they a strartagiyes an that is or politic started philosophy started signs started all of this things that a very uniqueto human civilizeon started aroun fireside chat an an that wif it hink about it we re still doing fires id chat the only thing is we have the michral with and the tip tellivision our slready asa now e chater o was sso i still we are hood to that evening at tivity because that is when we are completely free from the pressor of the work and we want w express ours olf thats hour independent kind that is why most people find it very difficult to do time oshating and storf ating at six ofclock because it is in gan in our in ou even be ana that we want to eat and socalizes in the evening now unless fast forr and see warsly roll of coffee in this if you look at coffee con obsan porticularly caffe a where people can come and have little tuf coffee and sosali it also started as he evening activity and am this is an am now we can go back to istanbo because that is wane pless where coffee caff is started in mid sixteen centuries fwe are talking out fifteen forty to fifteen seventy am and that is when a i'm sorry i'm for getting the nem of historyans who who haually invited me and a oget is nei chamal a kaffada and a i must be butchering the nam but i'll sri wl pe i the spowing in the wonderful thing about sor ciomedia somebody will saw on utu the proper pronunciation is a great opportunity if the proper pronunciation please put it in the comments on uter a lass am even checking wright now in my a an not library is not picking of thar a si wen't wen o at eing wfrioso what happened was an koffee was inproduced and am people cam and a dran coffee and talked about politics at night at night at evening and it actually started with a with a sufe branch of his slam because they are the once wo a conjummed coffee in the evening and this is the branch of hislam where they actually sing and dance and all that happened in the evening singing dancing am by the supes and and here in istanble people started congregating and having a a talk about politics but then are on the same time am some an o in tarke there was a good salible number of a muslins who have to do pie prayers to day number of prayers ar set time the fost prayer is very early in the morning and then the figort out that if they wake off and immediately have coffee then they can stay awake for the first prayer and in that way they felt very good they walk up i sai thats i wud started as a morning drink to stay away and kind of get get on with the day but what happened was i don' alwathough ou however tried tofkis coffee it is vey take yi a few years ago right before the pendemic twenty nineteen i travel to turkee is forswell thef food is amazing the coffee is indeed very very thick a am and i have a pretty high kaffein tolerance a am from drinking much coffee in yerbermate over the years and still do i really enjoy it but am ye it is it is very intense and what you'r saying is that am coffee an take started as away to extend into the night an ability to extend in to the night at all was because of the ability to harness fire and then coffees stimulatory properties were leverage toward morning a which is essentially the way i think about it we did not episode on kaffeene and some a some one else michael palland not i described it this way thy you serve taking alone out on your energy bank account y coffe you are sufpressing the adenicine system a das he makes you sleepy but that a denicine system will kick in later youre your it is a credic card of sors with an interest e right ri and the interest being am an energetic lag that you are going to i experience in the afternoon but what happened was with the a strong coffe am that ge hadbon an eside posto loropepl then the state eating something withcoffee and thats al de called sa breakfastate in turkee a coffee actually led to the development of breakfast not the other way around and that a ya that is very hartening a no again no pon intended a for the a the kaffine a lovers among us i i which i count myself yathos si sen ai i t for bifor coffee becam breakfast you kind of give something to your an to astomacs o i's busy digesting that and than hande coffee conseand it is not reacting to coffee a giting am esirepox it was not this fascinating it was not that breakfast is necessary on its own it was essentially a boffer against the gastrict distress caused by kaffine and i itan that called and send that contex a we cannot sait o what a dissenting hap and and all over the wal be coffee is not condin but stel people eat something in the morning you said you start your a first meal at all the days around eight what time do you wake up to wiko roun six if i said it is what time oyou have your first kafine nisly i have that is i brought of this a story because i have coffee after my breakfas fantastic i'm a big proponing of delaying kaffene and take for a few hours after waking for other reasons that i might listeners of at heard me talk about endlessly i will not bother with that now but i think am allowing a te sufficed to say that allowing some of the natural waking up signals to occur yunusing light to kind of clear away and a denicine to further extent and activity at is better than using as st imulant but until a few hours later this is fascinating because a never thought about the link between extension in to the night socialization for socializing rather feeding and kafine nacheam kind of am speaking what many othe resaca safan and this dis particularly this fireside chat a'm forgetting again the name of the scientist i thinks is from invessit of wassington siato am she wen to africa and kind of recorded what with lar talking of course ye could not understand what ever talking twitter and whether not taslas talk is going o of course just just getting foks and then came back and ta o fasla and then we got out tat tha what ou talking giving has time and in the evening bat a different am si sel what ae they talking about at night you sa exactly this is the that talking about a match making and talking out qualitigs and tastratagizing to gatherfood or or even singing and dancing a this is a if you think if we think about it how we manners sunset too bedtime what we do between sanset and bedtime a fets mostopohelt i mon to think about that for a moment i totally agree am and by the way i'm a huge believer and and i'm in living in great hope for the idea that right now i do think that sciencis understand a lot more about the different stages of sleep slow we sleepr amsleep et cetera then we do active waking states thik we talk about being focust or being alert but that is not those are not scientific terms as we know but i do believe and i've noticed a distinct difference between the first eight hours of the day in terms of cognition and we know that the catacolomeans ore t much highr levels plus cort is also dokin ind courseall iup and f fran all of that is really it much higher levels than in the later evening and that this evening time it ont icertainly in the contects of mental health we know that morning in evening we are basically different creatures yew ye goleallit ye that is why i i think in the evening if you think about it am again this is a ig an another set of resas from am my good friend forasio for tiglasius ye oh ye ye a big fan rasas another he is a fellow argentian occasionally we riff about things relay to that but he is a wonderful biologist are you lest colaborating ye is a his kand of a i say heis very humble and gits a lopropile but he does amazing amasan vesa tonangry he does desus that a we want to know but nobody is ready to do it becaus fidrisas is very difficult to go to the whidenes a go to the places where there is no electricity and then recard i'm when this people i eating sleeping or in the scass activity exposite to light n thats or torassia has done and i he puts this acty watchis is kind of i morte i'm activity tracker i'm bettis little bit more efine becas it also collects a light in for myson what i found was most of this agentin and to us who have no axcess to electricity they would consistently go to bed somemy between three to three and half hours after sunset this is very important because we all as thing that 'm our ancestors when thery did not have leficity as son as the sun wen down there is a friend o sleep now the fire extended ther evening they were staying awake for three to four hours kind of in om i'm tecompressing themselves that we say and and doing all this i activityis cooking saing meals and an they will go to sleep and if you look at the sleep onset the it it was very small they'te going to bed almost within fifteen to tarty minutes stanta divyis us sir no night houls verses morning people the scanly we will get none of this this athe m i i get a tack by for many reason such as goes with the busines im in of being public facing these days but every time i talk about viewing sunrise or low angle sunliht getting some sunlight e ring i some one says wol i'm a night hournd they just in its somoce a a protest of trying to protect identity et's be come this idealogical i i i identity related thing i'm a night ou i'm a morning person i am not but you telling me that in these cultures where there is not solectricity but there is fire people or going to sleep within all of tem within about fifteen minutes of one another ye there is no such thing as a night houor morning person in the an er as to i shally asked him mointedly because i i and that is enough it he has not sin man say as drag hundreds of people in if we ask ther many many sleeply such as a at list the public fiscing sleep imphysicians ar expors they will said yow we can say one tart of people o night a'll one tar of morning and and on tar in bitter in but thythey call my bearers wolfs and and i'm not being ti spurging of that i dy i think people really do feel as as if they orient towards one pattern or another when i was an onde grat to and i never when to bed before midnight and actually midnight was my going to bedtime exactly eleven forty five i'll try to get ready to hit bed an an by twelve an in bed tan i use to get up at six six fifteen it is o o that is a vretty short sleep with an alarm of course and but then daytime i's to take forty five minutes one hour nap and there is regular even if i whenever i got time of course in call azuno you do not have the whole det un in high scooly do not have of wuts te to nap but i callas you can i might hav been one of those kids with his fudy on napping on the desk but they come aroud and the wake you up yes what didn i an this gs just come back to the darmand am after lunchis only aster picna am then in gradschool i remember i derly went to bed be for to e and i could have clearly said that i'm a night all and actually was it not night all as very comfortable staying off lat as thery productive doing explain an striting all this am manoscapes mostly and but then afterwards a one a look back i in postock when i had a when we head or dogter am thand thinks started chending because you have to but the baby to sleep and thand after the baby's slaves it is almost when you have a baby your life revuls and on t pihi than we have to dim down the light there is no catin and a'lcoh drinking or any other things after the baby's slaves because we cannot doo too much noisemolesso then i dealise that no actually not a night all and i became kind of mor normal because i could go to sleep betweeng ten and eleven and an that is how i thaut wal maybe this was very unique to me but what is interesting is i have another a collegue am good friend i ken write junior i call orot at colorado and he also had graserancs and an and bosttocks me who strongly believe that they were night als an just everbody else and took ken took the whole lagh for camping and when they were camping of couse thet is less light and lot up physical activity higking during the day and they all went to bed an between nine and ten tadi pian aof that study ye what such injust described as a study i thnk the were two studies other two ye an am what is interesting as i recall is that after going camping for a week and where people a wake with the more or less with the sunrise ye and go to sleep a few hours after sunset ye there melletsonin rhythms and quarters all rhythms and sleep wake rhythms persisted on that scadual for several weeks the s liht returning tou environments where there was a lot of artificial lighting which i find amazing that yea just a week end of consistent rising and am going to bed with the sunrise and sunset ye more or less a loude a reset that was very long lasting ye am actually even in horasya study he found that almost all the tovas the wak of it on a sunrise time and it is amaging when i look at the stante devias an slicht tight te that night oul called night ous i also win graduate schol i would work until to i am a loved it ar blast music in the lather when was at home pretty much not everyone but there were the the night crew and then i'd get in some time around get up for some time around nine thirty ten and then get in around alaven and it was no problem because i was going to stay very late and then over time i nowice i become more lock to a scandar scasual think we were saying is that the clock and ar internal clocks can shift ye but this idea that we are genetically by us towards one scachel orn another may need revisiting that is what thot's the conclusion a i i anonthe a coufle of us bet one is a in a some people ar genaticalis pre programd because the other flift side is an what is call pechnically familyal ar man slee fecindrom these people am you can give them cafin or what about but they will fall asleep at eight ofclock they can not stay awake till nine or ten and since it is a very strong finor ti in sleep and sicidiunder them fill theyare very well studied in fact a lue petache cand in wue foo they were the first one to track one family this an an de figatout there as a muteson in one of the clogjins pity ar too that clogs in and that muteson am ualoud the clock the run in a way that these people went to bed very addly i guess historically given these fireside chacs that those people were probably not contributing much topolitical discussion whatever there was decided after they went to sleep is what they woke up into never reminds me because as youare describing the difference between nighttime discussions verses morning discussions is there any theme to what is discussed in the morning verses and the ihtcember people jis sipping their eating and sipping their cafin and just waking up an but is is there are there any ideas about what morning discussions really consiste ing discuss ons al daytime discuss on a mostly aout o work and lik hunting gathering a farming all theirstuff and even these days that falwy do we n i go to i go to wark and is smastly one mating oute another and an were talking abour ta minsifnd different commites an er sobing problems are your studens come with questions you have your tear o the office oas all the thangs watreleted we are not talking man city us philosophy of unless you ar in the philosophyr department an you are talking out political signs an and also we are not singing and dancing that is why the evening activity even these days a very differend and dif yi goly the evening activities a were we express ourselves we express who we are we feel we are free and an in o you and i we have this ecaremic intellectual freedom we can talk about o o work just were talking now the lort of people who work for even in takein dus try they may be warking for gego and all this bigtet companies they cannot talk about their work to anybody else it is all secret it is all secret just i masin the staying uso the spending more than half of their wak of time at work thinking and doing work but they cannot talk about that work even sometimes to their own family members then what happens for them lot of people also do the same thing an the person wh is going and beking an restaurant or cooking or the person who is an taking trus and driving when nurses and ar as cannot hart about their patience treat they cart o wealy ye yeand some people just do not want to talk about it is stressful they do not want to bring that stress hon that is i always say that from sunset until we go to bed during that time we try to find time for ourselves people say this is meatime the meantime is a sensilly we want to truly express who we are or we want to and to ten ourselves because on the fireside chat is not that everybody was a forformor theralso some ordience we always swits aer all sometime sweare for forming and sometimes there jerving that is what happens with meatime rother an maybe cial medea time should be restricted ed jus maybe a small portion of that evening time cause i would hope the people would also interact socially heare within in the oma tean a con structive way or maybe we use that for connect wit your family members an whom welove or can have some productive discussion something ids ait is can interesting it i think it is extremely interesting me as te think again this the conversation about timeor stricted feeding is really a conversation about secaian wison and sleep wake activity and human evolution rel a th that is i less i go back to this an a nightout because a we we can amelit comment that maybe is not theirtiy but a this is where ia'm still wrapping my head around because an o this days thers some an geasteris a where theyre trying to look at night house to see whether they are some genatic a lincons and sometimes we always think ye i should take half a million people of course you will find some los ide that but going back to this idea that ve some people more sensitive to light that it is likely that the same level of light even in the same household mey make some people stay awak late into the night wer as other people ar more esistant to light that they can go to bed ugly and since light has become privelin this days and thestob us story that weare talking about or people going on camping ther is we have remove that light am that is some am evidence that peoples light sensitivity particlaly the ipiagisi o the intrinsically porte sensitive re tinalgangiansel ar the simple spakas the blue light sensus in our eyes am that sense to bevin one logging a chens an sensitivity ayes measure my pupil constriction for some people a'm a small amount of artificial light at night could really shift their sir catian clock ye wake them up pas at yelly and then por some and men i'm very sensitive to light at night exquisitely sensitive to it oh then you are at tenas yes in many ways a mi'v been told thus thank you a i think a i have actually which to using a red night light but in i should beclear not a fancy high cost red light for sake of any the kind of infored simulation but i red party light dat light and i find ththat was based on reading one study that we covered in an episode on jetlike an shift work which was that it seems to reduce the quarters all reallysing properties of light at night to use redshifted light i just use a red light ballbashe travel with one if i go to an airbean beor hotel and i switchur bey light and i find that i fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night at much more consistently especially in when i'm in new environments where it is always makes he deserruptive an to sleep am it is made an enormous difference in the depth an duration of my sleep and am because often times hotel lights you knowing the bath room you will turn them on a just here just get inan and you'r wrihte some people do not seem to to be bothered by that ii i really struggle with that yeand in fact antinas a rit afte pubeti a thar seems to be i think that is whan a the tinas has become more sensitive sensitive to light and it is very it is well known that the tinas boys an guls the ten to stay awake it into the night and they can stay up to twelve mida past midnight although they can stay of that let that does not mean that the sleep schetelisredus thet boriste nis the same amont of sleep as other pina jeso tats i thet more likely not bewake up at sixtaty o seven when we expect them to wake up and go to school am i have a question and i ask every sircadian related by all just i can come into contact with this and no one has been able to give me an answer one way or the other but i grew up hering that every hour of sleep before midnight was of more value r potency than the hours after midnight and indeed i find that if i go to sleep at nine thirty or ten p m i can wake up at three or four i am feeling pretty fantastic and ready to lean into the day but if i get the equivalent number of hours of sleep starting at midnight i feel complete garbage when i wake up after five or six hours an is there any tr uth to the idea that going to sleep within three hours of sunset is somehow better for our circadian timing mechanisms well an ther few things one ou said that youare very sensitive to light i assume that you also have word bright light in the evening unless i can you as best as you could can then what is happening is with afsense of that bright light your melton an levels begin to rise you are prepared for sleep am of course this is something that we cannot measure because measuring melaton in and every one hour or tinty minutes am itis very difficult and there is no congum or fissing a product yet a its likely that your your body is preparing very well under this dim light to fall asleep and when you ase trying to stay awake and go sleep at midnight thand maybe from midnight for the fusty or four hours you are sleeping well but then after that you melaton and level might be begning to fall and it is not only melatone in your cordbody temperature and then the hartread and everything is changing to make you awap but the slep dead that you have a cumulated is pussing you to be in bed that is this tansome between the secedian aspect and your slep tit and am unfortunately you cannot have good night of restorative sleep for the second half of the sleep because of the tenson o makes good sense yet hats fi am you kno you are not the only one in a therre many people who who expeience that and in fact lort of people thing that well this my bethe way i sleep maybe i am not am i am not design to sleep restoratively until know i sleep one day just the camping trip me and then they reai a wa you at i feels what ar you av what you are missing youare absolutely an i one make sure that we talk about the other aspect of fire which is a youra paper the came out recently very interesting paper studying fire fighters enterestrate of feeding firefighters would you sure with us the the general contour may be ven some the specifics of of that study cause i think it is very interesting forsh for sake of shift workers but for everybody really to understand these results yes les go back to shiped workers because am this also theless to all of us because i onla said that each of us is you shiped worker or has lived the life of a shiped worker am and we have experience tow telibl difficultities am and nowless start with what is the definissan of i shiped worker am shipd work light light style there is knowing neu her sol definicon unfortunately but thereare many european countriis and particularly if you go to interest on level organiison am then you will find some wrefrences different europian countries have slightly different definition which essentially points to i f you stay awake for two or more hours during your habitual sleip time and when theys the habitual slip time am the assume that we are just you said weare kind of programm to sleep somewhere between sait ten p m and then stay in berd an cant of wak up after five am the idea is if you stay if you are staying awake for two or more hours between ten p m and five am and you are enguessed in some activity wither's physical activity or intellectual activity are not lying in bed and wondering worrying about something but actually working that defines that is defined as shipdwork and you do not how to do it every single day even if you do it once a week for fifty weeks thand that itself is enough to destrupt your physeology and me tavell is in behaviour brandfunction a shipworker the reason is as you discuss when you chance our external timing cu in this case when you travel jetlag for or travelling a crosthre days three hours of jettlag will take am three days to am resaid similarly if you'e staying awake for two hours extra or if you are warking up two hours before your habitual wak of time than we just don get wake up and then be engessed in some activity in the dark most of us none ments unless you are wearing a infir goggles we ton on light and light resets our ofclock end that way every time we stay up for two or more hours even for one night thend for the next two nights our clock is kind of tind to catch up send that way for three days the day of the distruption and then two days following the destruption a a clock is trying to catch up with the outside time oclock our body is not on time with our clock s that meancs almost for half of the week or half of the year our clock is tring to catup that is the definition of shipdwork now let us come back to on department of lever startistics and you was gone when am thay have not been tracking what par centers of people are doing ship t work i curately because they are many difficulties in tracking to but it is generally accepted that one and five working our dolls is a card carrying shipdworke card carrying shipdworkersmance they are norses am docters fire fighters am and bakers am trog drivers am then many in the service industry that is one in five twenty forson of working a dors then if we think about all the colustudents just i was doing and yew must have done am they are or i expe that lines drant gran ded lines the and we are also experse in experiencing the life style of a shiped worker because were the layngt slave even if you are the langslyve by two hours for most of the colustranes for five days and and the we cand your trying to catch up thats kind of hair secadyan destruption going on then you take one poin five or one pont six million new momts am in the ues every years of when the child is bon and that mother is a shiped worker and actually that mother is worse than a shiped worker because an iu know you do not know what time of the night the baby will wake up and how many times and there is no weekend in motherhood they are also living the life of a shipedworker am we do not count many food delivery and a oberdriver lived drivers are shiped workers but they many of them we know that they live in that way we think the actual number of people who are experiencing the life of a shiped worker is an somewhere round fifty persont of the otorts a populuson at any given time that is why it is also another point that you might have work from people those the o i cannot do timeishating because my scasul is mest up i wark in a dfferent way and am that comes into play that is why we taught a ocus we should try something on shiped worker another point is al the one and five people are shiped workers they carry tis proposciately heavier born of diges because almost all is related digees that we can think of wor there is high blorcresser usually high blorcressor starts in forthese or fifties a high colusterall am gastuen tistinal froblem in digision am chronic a inflamison of the colon and an even a colon cancer in manycases and then of course a dive it is am all of these a this proposinately more frivolent among shiped workers but then when you think abour clinical trials wether id sid drog all a life style often one of the touh tan exclusin factor citeria is shiped work people who are doing shiped work we exclude them from many of this ar trials a one thing is most physicians and most scientist even people who do shiped work than know that they are the body and mind is mest of that often time even medicasons maynot help them and lapsie we do not try you medicus on wat ter take the risk when we know it maynot help them and then when it comes to life sty intevens son whether its a sleep extents an for example we cann't do because thear supposcto stay awake and do that job we cannot ask them to stay asleep at night and then physical activity and exercise some people candle but some people are tired up tor all night that ther do not have the anerse to do physical activity and then nu trisan again a most nivtry son studies involld a the partisipents to come to the clinic and get am one on one or one or atan grupsesons and they cannot come and they cannot havebeen sometimes s come to the clinic visit am on people have to tak groma dra blood in fact there is another cayet that just if supposam healthy i'v perfrectly normal bloodresa blodlucois colistral everything is normal and i live the life of a ship worker just for five nights that means im sleeping les may be for five hours and even if i do not eat at night time of course many shiftworkas also feel hungry and just for am to kive the wol tey et a just after five days my blodlocoslevel will rit on most lik im pedivitic w i she saw a study in a publishing proceeds in the national academy that showed that even a hundred locks dim light present in the room wile people are sleeping with eyes closed can lead to desruptions in morning a bloodglucoslavels in directions that are not good yeam one night the the faint clock in the corner r even a a night light that is too bright could be problematic am by the way folks these t affects ar reversible i whenever i say these things i we hal a lot a comments about oniginis what ife i beendoing for years but kids with night lights this is an issue yeam but what i'm hearing is that one an five people are truly shift workers in the classic sentes the jobs require they work at night were en to the night and saleep into the day but for more people are shift workers by virtue of the facts that theyr tweeting or working or watching movies at night even though it is not work in that their not being paid for that time they are essentially operating shift workers if we add those two groups together would we say it is what a third of americans i say half of ate half of amerrya if if you take tina just because in o hig schulsterants on collisterans because again going back to horasias a study because horasia also collected activited it a from highschulsterants and collisterants and we have replicted to that with a highschulsterans and collisterans in sundayege that siatl and sundiego and this study now ther're many sleeply such as theve an collecting thisteta and what we find is a difically the hih scholsterdans they i're going to bedset on midnight and collister and surtlis te ou seeas distedants we found may be one out of hundred who went to bed before midnight that rum reminds me that horasioglasis just publishis reallyunices paper am showing that counter to what we believe students nothers the universy washing in siano i should mention where it is very dark in the winter young people seis tat people in their twenties ar saing up later in the winter months compared to the summer months ye which is co th honor in tut if you think we everyone stays up late in the summer and goes to bed early in the winter but because of artificial lighting at the exact opposite yes and another aments a i do not know whether horasio moniter id but may other suspicion am not saying whether is true in winter we are mott likely to con jim or coffee har choccolet in the evening and that might atso i delaying a sleep onsent make sense in that ti again here is another thing which can be te leted to policy ar practice at as you ca son istitut what happened doing a covit was everybody went to the mortalorning a the assignments became digitel and assignmend sommisson becam digitel and the many systems on line systems that came nto play and by defort the assignments some misson dedline became midnight thand now what is happening is i do not know about stan for a maybe a when you are giving a signment a when is the dedline innitmidnight then most of us moster and the try to cram as much as possible try to sall by the mos as possible on some mit at midnight and it 'll be deally cool to go back to your sister manstertor to see is that i in mandeficcentsy flot of ficces o distreson of what tigne people are submitting ther am assignment because we no ins when we sommit o grant i yes i mean you you here about the ob city crisis the crisis of metabolic disorders nochis in the uasbut everywhere in the word e a it is really striking i remember going to a keystone meeting scientific meeting in on the early two thousands and there was a map of the united states and showed where the ob ciy rates wer over thirty per cent in adolls in the entire country busy was lighting up crates and now it would be the entire country but there were these cand of zones in the middle athat word almost iv wait of of ob city e colorado teimly idaho at that time those are now also fallen under the umbrella f of ramp an ob city yoan ne an everyone speculatng o cais it a is it seedoils is it am is it this as that that is it highly process foods i'm i'm guessing its all of those things in cio lack of activity but one has to wonder given everything were talking about interms of metabalctis function lat shifted eating all these issues with late shifted eating and staying up late with artificial liting but they are not that could be one of the major factors in the called to becity cris i's likely and all we all i say fessman fiftin the srin yisa thisgis a getting kiptin founds in the fessmen yer in colles and an this is where i think as esucator professors o he will be interesting to go back and se a what can we do because another thing that is also becoming more and more common fora jumple i i give a sicetty under them class mince i just give to lectures and i remember when i started a fifteen seventeen years ago an that lecture use to be at on one tharty p m or two p m in the afternoon and it is at two and hap or lectures or i's done by fit and for the last tim before the pan i mak i dealize that the chans the timein now the lecture was starting at seven p m tas finising by nine nine tenty p m and thesgis they are to goin eat after nine ti dy s hat e shaes lies finessi chan farsi chat and then to express themselves to feel free from a sign ments one ore they gong to do that after the summidaa sign man than thy'r going to do that har w are to go back and drevisit this is say o case o for adolcs for most of us who are working at day jo our thed line is five p m in most gases i a mence at plistan you knewuster tisistem the pusson ways submitting the grand or who is doing taking care of my il be or ico theyre all living at five ofclocks u for me everything has to en by fight i think for most people out there i this rases a canomacroscopic question which is maybe it is not much about restricting the feating window but maybe it is about feeding mostly in and being active mostly in the early part of the day i mean i could imagine a time three four years from now when it is about when waking up early and going to bed within three hours of sunset is the protocall which hornessis all other protocalls rita yv gen or y exercise you gang i do it in that time you are getting eagerging to do it in that time you ging a social ise your ging t do it in that time and in doing you are also avoiding a lot of the issues related to diserruptid sla that is fi all this things a you said a time is serfiting is just one aspect of the cicetti an health and theys are all into connector and going back to the comment ofour om within three hours of o sunsetias and there is good but than what happens inc say toronto a bancover in winter time i guess ere going to bed very very early but also waking ut very very early yoyou know one of the things that i here all the time because i'm always beating on the drum of getting morning sunlight yen a three alou cover is people say there is no sun here this time of year and i i orgive me but there is son unless you live in a cave ther son is just coming through fout cover in a matter way you live in the worl their son unless you live in a cave of course a'm i will not to make sure that i we do not oov what was the major conclusion of the fire fighter s is a l go back the are fire fight estrrie o the isan why we did thi study was as they said there lor of us who ar living the life style of fire fighters or ar shiped workers and ship workers are excluded from studies tat mens wart obot we are learning obout e life style or even medicisons that may the beneficial for people who atually have a normal scidio a'm but not for people who have a desrupted cill you and if you look up am clenical tral dort gof theyre more than four hundred thousand studies listerd and if you sach how many studies are on shipd workers it is less than a thousan and man if you ask most of them are to se what is wrong with ship workers thats a we know that ship twork in creses or rist for met a bulle disis can sir and even some aspects of demensyor but if you ask how many studies are done to improve the health of shipd work alone that is less than fifty mens i ins have to go back an check the eactual number but it is less than fipty while that is why a'm we ger sopor excighted an we tart am from secedi under them pospected that is something to a dress this study again this kind of study is only possible because i'm a sok and we are fileatered with yu siesdy and a'm i can work with you se as the phygicians to do the studis a collaverat with an doctor pam tob who is the directer of canya te have senterin you see usty and pam has many fire fightes as hur pisans and we both know that the number one cas for death an the siability on work for fire fighters is not fighting fire but just getting hartatak and a'm stroke al the have a very high incidents of harted i can stroke and theyre also highly born to different kinds of cansir and it may be difficult to a scrive can ser to desrupson secadi an de srupson because they are also exposed wo lord of tocsons any time fire bones that is mell of fire is a sensially malle of cats yo noszens and theyr breithing even if they have the a'm hood on an respirit of the still ge the idea was very simple we know that fire fighters ar nearly seventpeypersont of fire fighters in the wess full time fire fighters because ther waranteer fire fighters an tan full time fire fighters the full time fire fight or seventy person of them work twenty four hours shiped free jample in sandiego they coming at atheir shipd is from eight em to eight and the next ter and they do a cristan san dy ago r they do one day on one day off on off four cycles and then four days of and am but in some fire departments they actually do forty eight hours shift they come for two days to deys of to deys to deys off and then four o five days a rutl thank you fire firers ye a man am then the idea was o cas o will scran fire fighters and then find fire fighters who are am metabolicaly unhealthy and then will see whether they can actually follow ten hours time restuterating because the font is the fre fighters can follow it and everybody else iwith all that stress if they can and this is again where i should also at noledge the sunday ago fire and rescue department because without their health we could not have even submitted the grant and at that time a the bitbecon who is am theyr health and wellness battalion chief he is the one who atually upprost us am because e's very careful he neal that the job that the dew mext them weker in a long term and can kill them and long turm he was always looking for new solitions he approstus and then wi sha this is the idea is a well i love this idea becaus we are not asking them to sleep more or we are not going to cut down ther over time or shave tor chance they works casual the only thing will be doing is aske them to eat within ten hours and hopeful we can do the serpinsistently between the days that ther working and not working yes that means if the from eiht a m to aiht a m working then the next than they go home then there can eat on the same scatual they did when they were at the fire fire house yer but whi wat home s they are not allowing themselves to you deviate from that yes o them we we thought whether they can do it on not begau they number one go or the prime hr c in this clinical trial was fisibility can they do it and then second was ive they do it and what happens to tha blord sugar and wait and all this other stuff and no we started the study and we hid the next te hordle and that is am and a fire fighters a very very tight nit community and they'v want to mexure that you understand their culture and the best were to understand their culture is to live the life of tae fire fighter a milly manugian with the fastortersy and than a we had a dinner gedoriand who is now in medscools he was a theys a scording at er at that time am theyvevoluntef the stroker will gorothy bigiest firster sun in sunday ago and we will live the life of the fire fighter and they sunday a go of fire and rescue and the city ar they all a a grat they efooted for duty ar seven thady in the morning a sin day bere in the staton because all fire stesons do ha ave some beds for five five fighters to rest and they have a signd bed they were signed a bed an yes every time an nine one on call ken and if that five sters an in that fisters an that five ingin was called and just other five fighter there run get into the gears just the shoes and an a jacket and the helmat and gettin the sit and at ten the call of course there on go thy side is get out of the trot wait there then come back sen that twenty four hours emily got ten calls at night that see had to rund but ther're more than ten times the an they got the nine one every time the nine one on call ken and there is a bip that goes out all five fighters were slipping the resting ther get up or if they are doing something ther look up to see which ingun is cord interesting sos nohis the ones said go out it is every one gets woken oup every one gets woken oup that means in a night if we con night there waking up am ten fift and twenty times sometimes they are almost an an on new months are er five fighters because the're do not have any idea what time the babby will cry and for what reason also thet or ous o similarly it is five that is what emily did and then next fining whene se came backs i t at gos seem easy yer e then wis did the study and and we are sincily a sign all the five fighters we recrited fron fifty five fighters we are signd half of them to mediterin in diet because you cannot do any harm ye are to give them something goods that and other thing that is a now we want something that we now works for five fighters and there as a mediter in tad study and everybody was suppose to follow mariterin diet and then half nearly seventy five of them was supposed to eat within ten hours we did not fix the ten hours because we said am you pick your own ten hours that you can stick to itt has to be consistent from day te days if you ser eating it in am you finish it tat et a it is seven p m f an and then try to ye ather mri is tir right we consistent because i sai dyes we understand that there will be somethings and you can take man te half an our here and there and we will see how many times you can do it and am what is interesting has hol to they are all doing twenty for our siv more or less jas to begin eighting somewhere between eight en and eleven am and an thay did not kip any meal they had their first mel or what we call breakfirst tam but it wase several hours after waking up because they 're waking op aut five or six and the drivin to come to work at seven thatty or eight and the eiting the frst meal say between eight and eleven and then the finished meal an ten hours later and what we found is more or less a am most of them could stip to doing this at least five days o of sevendays im and then at the end of the study when we look at an ther health paramiters one thing that they said we decruted everybody who can that means the lord nearly one an three fve fighters were completely healdy than no sign of any am any illness no hi borcess or highbors ere of high colestrol de presson or anything since we have one tart of the vopolicion who are already healthy and then everybody has slightly different condition some have high blorcressor but they do not have hig blod ookers somebody has hihblod lookers ur not high blortess tdos kind of hetrogenias we did not see big the ferencs in wetloss or anywerchans between this two groovs another thing is fire fighter fatially run almost eight o nine miles when they are a the job ficxe thes part of ther i'm exercise rutin but then onting that sence significantly in the time resttating groof was on what we call vealdeal particle size and particl number because this is something that we know this very lor dancity ly popotin these are atroganic and if we can manage them much better than we reduce the diskfor atres cloruses there is one parament of that chance in the time lesrefitting gru even when we combine all healthy on healthy everybody now if we take five fighters sowar beginning with high blood pressor then we sar significant redocxson in their sistolic as well as diestolic blortessor and the change in bloressr of cors we do not claim that in the monoskipt but when we talk about it some fhysisan would get ofp and said wy that looks almost there on a blottresa lawyer in drog i'm the extent of blorcress or loring is ecrivallen to somebody taking a antihaprotensive drog mazin and then those who started with hig blod sugar of cors we did not have too many ty too divitic but ther of a few predivitic and they could better man as their blord blokers and this is interesting because once ship workers be compre divitic or divitic they have more difficulty managing thair blord sugar than nonshipd workers because the worskitoself we mes tem op too much even if they are or many mericas on the have difficult that is fascinating in i'm really glad that you explain the study in such detokes i would have thought from reading the abstract and i did look at the dator but e some one were to look at the object they sey o fire fighters of the waking up n the nol the night an there youw throwing on their gearing going out the calls nd we bet panishing correctly or fire fiters are being woken up by the signal which makes e fire fighter population a bit more similar to the more standard population is waking up i he mill the night to use the bath room getting on social media for a couple of minutes or flipping on the lights a minutes it is maybe not as severe is what firefighters are yearing am but we know there are blood sugar regulation issues related to those multiple middle of the night wakings especially if people are then staring at screen yer am saything it is really important that a people were able to hear about the the deeper contours o the study a ii mean this result of regulating blood sugar bedder is really powerful i get asked all the time i gan new kid or a i'm a shift worker how can i do this morning sunlight viewing am what i'm hering is that keeping a regular meal scagual every day i ges's five five out of seven ye aers even were as closy every days solay asleep by we say tryand get a really great nights sleep eighty per cent or more of the nights of your life and on the other twenty present hopefully its for fun reasons a great party or saving at therers he celebration of some sort am that seems to me a great ancher point when one cannot reliably control their sleep wage cychael it os that mean that if somebody is coming offor shift work and they are very very tired that they would be better off staying awake in eating then sleeping well it is i yes u and this is wher we get in to newanse here the fire fighters ar twenty for hour ship twork that means and they have been working to sip for very long time they have figr out a one thing is yes fire fihters are different from norses and help car warkes wo have to wark toout the night and ther staying a wake towar the night for as fire fighters they get opportunity to sleep then even with their ten calls they actually have opportunty to come back and go to sleep and in fact whand emily and at dayna they we and defashe us and what tdev jut was fire fightes after they after a attending at call they are not coming back and playing cards or time to watch the neals or get discor theynd no they will just go back and anliin te bed and set of to night whenever they got any opportunity to sleepe they will try to sleep send that wiy theyr sleep det and sleep pre s or doing daytime is not as strong as send night ship nurs or ey trodriver who is driving all night because they have dersting a wak toout the night when people say yes you found the sand can you extended to other ship tarkers my unsedis now we have to go back and figer out that is why we went to the station and figet out wat to walk for them if i have to go and wuld do this forsand norses may be ean i will go o our starf will go and figer out what is that wakskas o what happens do they have opportuntiy to eat do they have opportunity to to iven take five minutes break what do they do diving brick and all of these things coming to play but here another thing is i allay said that in other timelis sifiting paper we see chancs in nuti some quality and quantity but here we also saw that somehow both goofs inadvertently they a improve that into some quality because everybody was tord to it meditari and i they plis that fruits and vegetables and olivoil in texnan slightly and when they had to stop eating utly they also did duste alcholintic and this is very significant because many ship workers just to cop with the sip toar the ten to depend on alcoholat night and kafin in the morning they begin there dey with kafin an and wi talcol and now we can relert that many normal people were not doing ship tar we also more or less begin our day with kafin and many of us and wih talcohol and then when they duce that eating to ten hours and then we si significan de duxan in alcoholintic in the atimelestretin gru bute not in the standout of care or meditenit i certainly support that we did not episode on nalcalln i was shocked when i research that to learn that zero ti two drinks per week is essentially the threshold beyond which th you start seeing health the efposites in particular cancers and metaba desruption sleep desruption an increased anxiety when people are not under the influence of alcom it is a bre incredible how alcoholl's kind of escaped as the the opposite of kaffin and therefore i'm not a health hazard it is in any here i i'm somebody have a drink every once in a while no wee all for me i can have it or not have it but it is just striking how a alcall despite exstensive data that it can really desrupt health even at three drinks per week the is a is just avadly consumed as if it was kind of food or kaffine everally incredible an i i wanto make sure that i circle back to something you mentioned earlier because i know they are going to be number of people at asces if i recall you said that provided that the feeding window is not shorter than eight hours that man women in children can used time restricted feeding am well when i sai yes what i what i says am twelve hours but twell excuseme twelve hours that ingi for that ir am because we did a study that is publich in twenty fifteen and again am behind many of our studies that is a story we ave poblicsing all this mo stories an the nod go to conferences and and of course thy am some some people would give me a look saying while we must be doing something wrong we this just brexty exelow tomodanan is because halcon teting te sam number of kalloris and not ge ing wet of course by that time we figot out that aa clistin mouse time less refuting also chenges te got mycobyum in a way that the mice may be poping out little bit more fat and sugar than objerbing that wanting that happens in time lissriviting a clistin micis tha liver colestro matavolism to buy lised and buy lessits a exclison an the got chenges because the got mycrobiumcanges sof tis is a very nice study when a mirgerinpar was a in the lab now he has his own lav in ou see as te and he meticulausly did that and we we event bid bomcallomitry from the poop and matavolo makes from the poop and than we figot out that the excirts some some callories an than that brown card activity goes up o there may be borning some of thes extraccallories o ther more thor mo general tomogeni but any wa in a one nice thing al something of our salk is if they see that your science is going well than they will find was to help you and the supific ye and a this is when billrodi was our precident he was the precident of fom a hofkins for twelve yeas an than he was preciden and an that time he had started this in a wison grand programm a which was funded by or in jacob aoron is the founder of qualcom tas also a faculty at you see as tay he understand the very few the led us wo achly spend some time in a cad himia he understood the pa enofg getting grant money when you have some interesting idea tesom idea ye i do not only in age but i'll do it anyway because i sit on study section for the annage me withen i ch wants to see proposals for things that are certain to work that they are mostly done and really ground breaking work can happen and does happen withan a ach funding but more often than not is it is the a generosity of philanthropists liker wen jacobs and other people ther alow the really pioneering am the new stuff the cool stuff ye that the ground breaking us the stuff that really now i'm not ti say really marries it all matters it is all important at matters but in is high risk and an an i as mens an is is not just governmont is not making money from tin air wen sits taxpes money there is a little bit responsibility or conservative that ocase he soon at wastaxfors money on find the sky kind of prose too mu were we are not talking about politically conservative were talking about an and scientific we son scitiv e be careful with language now idays prety soon were toscon a s it and stare at one another i for microphones to they say aso that is interesting the that ways started ths and tan a what we did was we a i had a o som garstudant and we got this funding from or when and also the ar som any philantory matters it sully teway we says yes if you give me fifty boks thand that fifty bos to at sigos toards buying the glovs and efond of tofs for one pors to for mary seven days soi socer i think of our people do not realise that ninety nine per cents of lavratory sciencis just they they do not make me any money af their discoveries and even if there is a padentable discovery tivically the te the divide between the institution and the company that will vun shy put that to market i si slin in favour of the the others involves that your scientis really do this as as wework of passion we are a labor of of we we a came op ot this a ap my seculion clock at that time and we took some an and on lessons from tecty dos an partigularly from an as on one click check out an wbecause withaut most new ty son ats actually ask people to de tell te scribe ot the ad go t ther food library and then porson size the sicu o will just sart got all of that we just ask people to take a picture of the food open the up one clicktet ca picture second click and pres saiv thartly and on the serve the picture i tually came to our soverign di not stay on their fon and we asked a hundred fifty six people who an not ship tworkers t struggular worker or home makers to be part of the study no student was allowed to be part of the study because we know that theres lik tany sicsippes and we moniter for three weeks and here is some onces and i want people to understand sop u sa on the somebody is starting to eat at sas seven an and since that it according everything we fort we got every single thing even if they id hap a cooky they had to take a picture and they actually to picture because it is not it become second nature after three or four days that evydent thy ars something even if a thereis a glass of wat or the actually tic a picture because we ask them take picture of everything well figure out what it is what is surprismi we found the million a the mildan number of times people eat within it dey twenty for ours dayis actually seven it is nart it is not that we are eating three times to day we actually snak lit it a seven times for day seven times and that ten for sort of people the top desile was it ting twelve times to day am and it max en sand that trospect sometimes may be out fallinto that seven or eight f before an i did the study because thin o getting up having coffee with came and sugar is one an and i at my breakfast that is two than i came to be lave and i found that cookie that three and wen to meeting and there is some cooki and es something else an that is another one and lunch and and afternoon somebody asked me to go out and have a meeting and if you think about it it is very normal that we can go of seven to eight times ten times but then if we look at what time say i start breakfast and as they said andwe see that in many people thos start or seven ofclock and one day and seven thirty another day and eight fifteen another day or they go back to six an because theare to get apollyan gor wor and we tak all thes food it er from three weeks an then ask what is the time when your body system is expecting it to eat because it is kind of ourg is out is inno thinking of kar maybe for you if you are eating breakfast at say somewhere between six and seven thirty seven forty five eight it maybe you expecting food ar ound seven ofclock let us forget abour sixtript inners an outlier then similarly at the end of the day somebody is itting finishing the last bit or the night gap whatever you call it save one that ninethy and nintha ity and ten eleven twelve tharty or one let sing not that one and twelve thardy but still we got some i witin seven to eleven thirty for that person over three weeks time this is how we kind of figer out what is the likelihood that your body will encounter food when we do that what we found was nearly fifty for sone of our dogs in our study eight for fourteen hours forty five minutes that window whend your body is expecting food sirse easy to say that fifty for sone of our dogs a eating within fifteen hours or longer well and and quite frequently yur it frequently too and then if we ask what facks on of our dogs were actually eating the convension all within twelve hours threemales o day or something other tes ten persont thes nacking is gone up tou mai we howevery one is te find snaking the ey goor tive of food in take the other day and outside this breakfast loncs and dinner there all this small snaks here and there and also for lot of people the dinner is delaed and we went back and looked at ook as what kand of fool tiflr eating lat at night andall the staff and what came out interesting with is very confor intretive is people who prepare their own dinner thate more likely to eat later at night because tha're coming home and then thare taking some time to prepare dinner and then they are sitting down and eating of may ve theyting next to the come fit of whatever it is 's fors kind of interesting that came out and wut coming back to your point that is wh i say that nearly ninety for son of our dogs i eating for more than twelve hours that means a lore of people can there is scope or there is enough hat's besto re deas and it within as i said all of this at interrleted son wheny thing ovour children most sleepry such ers agree that children and teen egers should sleep somewhere between nine to ten or eleven hours because young children even five to ten year old they should sleep nine to ten hours just pomping out grow thor mon and a growing growing ir and than the teen as ars actually the an recommendisson is and they should be sleeping nine hours because if youl take ten esers take out all the stimilar tre in pust to them and than remove home work assign mend to everything and than led them kind of equilibriate to their homiest acis wat the likely how many hours tht likely to sleep that con sart to be somewhere between eight and half to nine and half hours wich also means that going back to sleep nearly ninety por sent of high scholsturents in this country a cronically slep decrive because most high schlsturents do not get nine hours of sleep on the regular ves is mally in the weeken probably because of devices yer o and also as ti said this new idea that midnight is your am assignment some missometime i'll come back to that again and agan i am hearing that again against the ceever is taken oa it is an int it is a very interesting idea as a ways you can a anchor behaviour earlier in the day y learning to in i mean public health i is complicat because people are incensivised by fear but they you get more beas with honey as they say ri year aere si insensivising people to wake earlier not necessarily with the sunrise but wake earlier in go to sleep earlier and eat within an eight to twelve hour window am twelve if it is yes tht's my sholder and ye it seounts to me you kow all these health benefits or what i think ofre going to insentivise people more than for instance this idea that w if you do not yo this you can to get the men sureor some nata or lik mi but i cavry thet people fill more healthy and more productive and tht's o i said that even if children ae suppose to sleep for nine hours of coursethey not eating during those nine hours and we are not a fitting children and putting them down to sleey because and on thet cort bar ry temperature woill behigh they cannot fall asleep sartlis thei have the last meal one or two hours before going to bed because tipicaly a parents fid them and a ye give them a sour or bat an and the redthe bedtime stories oits wan to two hours before betan ta finising for similarly on the other and after the wake up it is not that we are waking them off and an fitting them awfully wecnot deing that that is at twelve hours sencs to be oft the mam and it is not only am saying that if we put all the health recommendessons together from pidietrius and than it maxsens am fascinating i have a question about structuring meal in take or food in take 'm during the eating window im i have a good friend actually he sam he is the nurse urgeon at nurlinc now but he came up through stamford and am and he has a a habit of eating of skipping one meal per day within a feeding window i mig be breakfast lunch skip dinner one day then it mig be breakfast dinner the next day im lunch in dinner the next one it is not in keeping with the same start time always but the end time is either going to be earlier or ththere is a gat it is never later ye's never later im what you think about that as a strategy am in many ways it feels that fits with the way that a lot of people's lives run sometimes for instasce if i'm in apot cast i do not tend eat much string mil the day caus it makes me a owa gro draly that mustperin the ol dep in energy i'll do breakfast well again at eleven and that is ha first that is when i break my fast levenish and then dinner maybe a snack in the middle the day but other days it is three meals of the does it matter im over all as long as am one isnin't allowing the start time and the ending time to drift out is it okay if you go from twelve hours to ten to eight eight ten for twelve as long's you do not exceed that the the brackets are you oke i this is ra the seceti and aspect come in because if youare going am if youave moving that breakfast time a dinner time to for hours ticenstially causing may be a metabolejetlah an o in sarttam in weks months or maybe in few years you may not see any cens im but the same time we do not know what i the long com consequences one thing is we all as think i'll come back to the spornd again and again we ting that a body where to the maker of health at bordy compotis on is a marke of healt it is not always true because i they said ese deflox im filling am an a having some tang of depresson or anxiety raldeo hialeali a te alilin i people av ear or lowbodyf have you a very high oveal yell those are the things that am we do not collect with or habit and since the kety an de the man mil timing mil structure now is a very new filed im i think good studies will come out only in a few years because i'd not with la just going back and reprospectively looking at some ditrecor one day of ditreco and trying to glin too much outo out of it i think hopefully thinks will improve where people become it it wuld becomes tanda toat cleast look for one week of ditrecor mill time and what ae eating all the sta becaus imthe na moustudies also soing what am front lording cabohidre a front lording fat or brought in n has benefit ofa i think this studies ar startings o i not comment for the last good of bat or ithin it scragt to hold off until then we have you back on to discuss an i have a question about a fasting on the longer term am and there it is in near infinite space we could explore of two days ar fasting one day i know people that every ones in a while they just decide i'nm fasting they have either been eating too much at parties or there not feeling well or whatever they just decide unfasting for twenty four hours and am theyls still consume water in kaffen but though just fast is there any health benefit or deatriment am you mention the circady in clock shifting e facts but if somebody wakes up on sunday and they they you eat too much sure they feel they too much for they do not the foo they on sares an that rely feel wit than they are just gin a fastinto monday is there any known benefit or am health detrimen to doing that kind of thing yethers a itually richly treature on a this complete fast am an in fact in many religion a people practice complete fast as it way to clens there body and am piple ops in that ther benefits to that in fact they every other tey eating ain mouse model or even in humans tar also innocently some sturies were done an therre many health benefits and write now there even fasting clinics and germany where people checkin and than the strict supervision and than they do complete fast ar maybe a small bowl of sup wiys has hundred two hundred kill ocal an that is all they get to week sometimes to three days for theys five days even they have gone off to thee or four weeks for sake of way lass ays ti wi fom many different things and a they come out pretty well hel thy off cosand or a supervision make sure that there getting muto mio nutr e sudy the michronel trans by them ine and am an electrolites those studies af pretty solid people have a objerve that and an in fact there are even idea that fasting this kind of fasting can have hus impact on bran and people may come out of trictmen tresis tan de pression ar something but and a those studies are very difficult to do there only cess of one here and there that we here once in a while but hopefully in future will see am whether the depression anxiety the mental healt caspect will benefit from fasting because now as there is more and more evidence that there is this god branaxis and what the the presents of food ar the michrobium chengesin te got am if they can affect bran than may be long tom fasting pery fasting a few days of locellery dit back to back a will be interesting to see how it impacts brenhealth very interesting what ae you thoughts on fat fasting were people a'm trying limit their blood bluco spi only eating mainly fats mainly healthy tibically they will eat a ho ter fast o acals o wills and not sese and som animal fats perhaps but am as a way to keep blood luco low in also time restraict this it goes by to the can locarbo hydrate am thing wwat are your thoughts on that as as a general strategy for health i mean it combine ser two general themes that are out there i think both of which ar sbe youn datar still in coming that a restricting the feeding times it can be beneficial as well as keeping bloot over all blood blucos lower can be beneficial y i think a thereis too much a emphasis now on blot to te spiking or am we do not know am this kind of eating paton for example mence we ar sincally telling pankias the locas ye ar the islets els that fro dus r insolent they soka can tak am taka brik gon becason foryu for a month or two or three months am my question is it will be interesting to see whant happens to those islets because a prxample we know that if wed this seos are on us or muscles there is muscelar tropy a muscles ol beck become weaker a we do not know whether long tom consequences of this very lok ot wha to diet whar your not sensially in gazing the isletselves a pedically a what is its impact if therei's no inpact may be soim and may be because as many people wachally work on kittes an idiet theserchus themselves they find it very difficult to stay in true kittosn'n igdit because the truekit dosn'n igdit is condeming less than ten pesson of calleries from garbide and not very many from proaching a lot people think kiter ganitide allows them te massov amounts of meat and that is not serly the case just one clarification four people am a suchin was referring to islet cells of the pancreas which are the ones that ar manufacture insolent im the questions whether not a taking in low levels of blood glucos by way of he locar padry died the those isletselvs are going to shut off their production very interesting amin the livers afe very plastic tissue i man it telds to am react very dramatically to to li stalv change tyes that sie interesting to se what happens mence we know that even muscle this seas for example people who become better tan the lusa muscle us but when they come back and exercise they gen it back sorb interesting to say a what happens and this people wh are going through long tome kittes an igdiet and of course once in a while because of a sel pressar or something else if thet do not have accest e foo or something happens the maycongum somesugar some plod lookers will spike puts not that a bespike is bad i mean there is not why we have insolen is for good reason to offer thats py to bofor that spike and also and of people of e say that welld if you have insolent produce or insolent grot fact of to e really badan it should avoid that and i think thats little bit a extreme and me nats a the inson grot atters abolved in mussl prortins since the estition repair yet a they even cognition y ye and it also goes back to as a emtoractivisn and all the sto people get really excited about a how to reduce son toactivisn rapomisin an al that sta this is where a egan from secadian point of view an i ask people to think to very populare drog molycals sor drogs that people think will incislon givity ar met formen wits many peoplei ge not all will come to econ tenses that dit activ ats im pi kindness a the sensor in the selves that sense that yourselvs are fsting met formen kind of activit it that it kind of you can say although men ot besinticacaly accurate and the am an o fasting in a peal erin mimics fasting yand the an the thing hat lon pin there with metforman is the burberin is yhave the four mens met four minutes a the three bark extract that also dramatically lowersbod wi co yer ye ait mimics kind of that am fasting and then raphomisean am also cand of reduceas emtor activison and a people have shown that an aphomisin and met for men can extend mou slife span an in improve health now thet's go back to the callowy restricts on study that i menso in calloy restricts on people are giving food as a lonsom and there are essentially doing time restriction the mi sor doing time restriction if we think about it during day time whand experiment or sare coming to the biveryam the my surbisliping and fasting and thes su naturally have high level of empikinness if thet truly fasting and the should also have low level of emtor activity because am to response toinsolin and that should go off at night my suspicion is an in many of these experiments woar the mice for alowd to eat ar libitom even normalst under cha now we are we know that as mice get older the actually congum little bit more foor during day time which is the acquordin of human i hemants niti metis ik nit i meeting we knowas an issue i did not know as there was more vinishu is people age but yes s we do not now what that clistin mice because nor we can put the mice an cal re matry look at everything a by diting how mus teating i gues it was natural to see that ris i such as found that there is some em tor activity during daytime when the mice for not supposed to have em tor activity be coue they should be fasting and since they at little bit an there was nacking during daytime an empikind es activity was not at it speak giving mat for men kind of mimic that fasting stead and reducing em tor activity by drog apo mice in al kind of mimic for aspect of the fasting sted my suspicion is am since this studies were done always in mice an who wat supposed to be in the fasting state and both em or a y rapomice in empykind is activit or met form in kind of a mimiking that fasting sted that is why we have seen those benefits and it will be interesting to see if that experimend will be done in humans ing long time because many people are very excited abour and o there is em tor a long tom met formin an study an an lor a pilartuly conduming good amount of rapomice an off level they can get their own a that is my a curiosity i'm not saying wher there is good or bad or ther there is signs or not that something that be intresting to control for and se an because we certainly i've i saw on one o my again an close friend and collegue at scliffs and cut yyalamia a suited a very simpul elegant study people should have done mit formin fear it took mice and then mesor that blod lookers at different time of the day and in fact just human blood lookas oublor lookes fluctur li a little bit ashe saw that to them and then in every two hours or three hours an on different days of course se geve the sam dose of met from into mice and what she found was at different time of the day mhat formin had very dramatic chans in blokas reducing ability an which means that even if you take mat formen and give at different time of the they for the mouse or even for humants in very long tom of course in this mice an this mice for not divetic or anything the er healthi mice to begin with in long tome we might see am benefits an that ar very different this brings to this idea that while maybe met for men say at the end of the day evening met for min may te go that fasting state much alier an and of digesson a what s mat formin the beginning of the day manot at least from m lon gevity prospectin i'm not talking oer dibidi tiped to dieisia the sen thin with emtor amis amtogin to have much better inpact if taken doing evening a morning before meal these are my thoughts that go along with tal this pat am story that we talked about do you take a that formin your berberin a no i have not taken athou i no a i have flos a friend on colec am rubenchaw wis now the deretrov cancosentersate extensively walks on ampicinas an its mechanisn and am am it is all less fond to talk to him t hes a he is af fan yei've taken berbering before and i've had a two different very distinct experiences with them first of all am berberin when injested with carbohydrates in perticular carbohydraes to have a lot of simple sugars definitly i know this cause i measured my blood glucos sinto the expirment alows you a flat now your blood glucos response in some sense if you the nothere is this ide if you areging to eat u particularly big meal or sugary meal whend you dont want to get a mass of bloodglucosrises you take berbrin or mat for him that fore minutes y prescription thans i whent with berber in cases as far as i know it works at as well am at least fo heldy people ye o for help of you that is right am when i took berberin and did not in jest large amounts of simple sugars or carbhydrates along with it i experienced profound hypo glisemia i felt complete garbage for about eight hours and i had one of the worst headaches of my life because which make sense you just got a blood sugar crash if you lower blood you your bloodsher when you already have fairly low blood sugar in you nan jestin carbohydras you can really bottom out your your am blood gluco such ju sits i see that as a im for to res one as kind of a cautioner in the other one that am when ye think about the biology these compounds it makes perfect sense and i think that and i did not pay attention circadi in a facts i iman at e inno when i jan salkam am that we know ron i vanss the kind of the am bigly donin sicin matabolism and he walks on neuclehamon de septas am de sa de mastere greto metabolism and nomasels cansosels and many other and what is interesting was an depast few yes a ronde de ve simple explaiment am he just looked at what time of the day this nuclihomon de septa a tn on agenix bes on level and som attortin level and he found that almost all of them i have a cicadian pat on at leastin samtiso a he went to that length to say even that cicadian is matabolism and matabolisn misicadian tht eson why we have asicadian wi them is to have a delididem and foot sicking be avia an iting and also go to appeat et of time when we should be fasting an an on the other hand all the metabolicagletes also have to follow that tru and almost all matablicegledos everyting teeican think of conectato matabolizing macronutrian protin caban fat there should also have a cicetian de the modanal cycl to a line or missaline pejample pato todition should bein ofposit

thinking o the supracismadic newclea sle wi cycl and we are not thinking too much about a matabling odasty alsomething of our sog o being at sol because wer fiftipiees really camdin tostuo alsome buildings and wih opend lat structure you bump on to each other an tatu se and with a notion gian oston bi yes it it is an amazing place i was lucky enough to have an adgn position there when i when my lave is at you seeesty and ait is an amazing place doing incredible groungrakin work which of course includes yours this is a such in i im clear now that am we have to have you back on for another a series of discussion seriously speaking if if you be ur a kind and willing to do that i want to thank you a for several things first of all for your taking the time to day to sit down and discussi these am incredibly interesting ideas indeed tell much of what we talk about on the potcast is a obviously grounded in science and and often but not always as actionable and much of what we talked about to day is actionable in the sense that many people are already doings certain dimensions of these things some are not somer hering about it in considering it you have given as dozens i alisted sommout dozens of tools and considerations based on whether not people are engaging in shift work or not i think a lot of people are going t realize that they are shift workers theyot eventhough they didn' think they were a because of the nature of their habits now it to light anto activity and forth am i absoly love the fire fighters study because of its relevants to the general population also anot another nod to fighter fighters and shift workers everywhere thank you and you might i think among the collegues i've known for several decades now you really are one of a very small few who manage to do both animal studies and human studies but also animal studies with a very clear eye and appointer toward a human health and a that is such a vital and rare thing especially in this day of am extremely competitiv funding i want to thank you for your t ime to day for the knowledge you share the actionable aspects o that knowledge the sciens that you are doing ing your laboratory we will provide links for people to learn more about you and of course you go to the ap yam people can am engage in some of the scigns directly and of course you have several wonderful books now that we also link to both of which i've read and ar wonderful prarticuar the book m the first book but also book a relateod ibedies and am for diabetic sand people interest in metapolican and a bludshiger regulation an there y on behalf of myself and my teem here at the you ren lapartcas and all the wisteners a just for u say thank you much your time is valuable and am the fact toe you share with us and educate many people is really a gift ye thank you and actually likewise thee very few scientists who have taken this lider cicrol that you have token to a common communicate scins to the public it is not easy am because sometimes you'l have to disto lit down to simple sound by to the point where the scientist and al sa all that manartis right but we always have to keep in mind that we are always living in the dark is of sience because thit is not why i say that this is not my court i shall this is from one of my scientific itup all simal from a ascifs youlus says think about it ten years ago what its what you thought was right and the best has already chanced but ane thing is an the secidian o them and a lining it to our inturnal clock to our habit is very important and as you mentiond a we have a a my sicutian clock ap which is resuts ficing but we have also distid all of this down to five or six time in componant and we ave a new ap co on time health i'll get on time

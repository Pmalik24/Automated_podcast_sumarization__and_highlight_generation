of tiktok generation americans reading osama baen ladens letter to america that letter was released in november two thousand to an essentially makes the same case thet radical muslims and radical leftus now make in favor of commas the lest is evil and aggressive and westerners including jews deserve what they get is fran's fanown an shon palsartra and hosan obana the founder of the muslin

this on tiktok in fact much of this is happening on tiktock tat the guardian you ca guardian which had the entire text of the letter posted had to take it down from their website because they say that

defend anybody but i am here to say we got o do some on olterbe here if we'e gon to call osama been lotin terris is the american government and that is the point that is the point we have taught entire generation of young people that asom ben lawden has a point is bena lot of talk in the aftermatho omossed october seventh attack about why is it the young people in the west americans members of of the european community why are many young people siding with commoss and the answer of course is because we as a civilization have taught them teside with commos we have taught them at the west is in herent evil or the very least morally equivalent with terris on the other side of the equation andthey havebeen bibed from that well hey been taught that for years an yours an yours when they

thoes people haos because of our freedom and that was the propagat the cat it is western freedom if the western ideals of freedom whatever that means and it is freedom for white people g again oppressed vere's is oppressor and the more unsuccessful you are in this matric more evil you are in this matrix the more you are not ouv the more you'r oppressed because we have to see your side of the argument and again you being an ppress person you have the ability to stand up and then destroy your oppressor of course these people are procomas today they are proben ltten yesterday here is some more of this how can letme get this strait wet me get thi strat im not san nn than i just whan to make sare that a my facts are in order not say anything tas tis won to make sharn crrect and it certain slter tisial america tas taken down afterr leterly being on the guardian leb taver twenty years an which as o a ben loten te thats as nas killing of civillions y san hay you americans you takes such pradin yearsistemen democris teyou pay ar tact is youalacer leaders that is why i also who yo accountab ll and that is whyi killed americans billions rat we defind tot a terris here in ameri ca but when a same hargument wr a sin ar argument is us that its aha that we level gaza wer alow is real to level gasaf be cas they electen mos whin tou twenty ears gone fifty pop fifty peresent of their population is miners and te elected a leader who didn' to everything they said they arigan alling does not represent everything they sait they re present wol how can we as americans possibly empathized with that but bacts abalit argument ter israel levelingas at right they elected an mos they knobody nobody including theise really government is that wonn quoe leveling goza by targetting svillage but this the whle case again the whole case here is a bunch of people w te the west that is what this about now let us go through some of the ben loten letter exerpts here is what they say and get you can see the matrics that benlateon was trying to create in two thousand one two thousand to and in the nineties and you can see it now materialized on the streets of paris of london of washington d c in new york here is what benlottan said this again back into thousand to why are we fighting an opposing you the answer is very simple bhecause you attacked us and continue to attack us right their victims a benlaton was victim you attacked us in palistine the creation ofthe israel is a crime which must be a raced he brings us both laughter and teers to see that ou have not yet tired of repeating your fabricated lies that the jews have a historical right to palistine as was promised to them in the tora anyone who disputes with them on this alleged fact is acuse ofvantisemitism it is the muslims whyr the inheriters of moses it is ot notice here that he shifts ben latten does intwo thousand to from the argument that palistine must be establishe to israel must be disestablished and there is no jewish right anywhere they are right he is in favor of the destruction of the state of israel an the murder of all the jews and all these people inthestreets to day they agree this is why they are chanting from the river to the to the see palistine must be free benlatdoen continues under your supervision consent and orders the governments of our countries with which acts as your agents attack us on a daily basis these governments prevent our people from establishing the aslomic cherea tusing violence an lies to do 's again westerners particularly western leftus they read that misto ell whale there are a lot of tyrannies over in the midlist that but benlatdon is calling for the establishment of his lomic cherea these calling for the establishment of an eranian style theocrasce does the western left care about that of course not becaue again what the western left holds in common with ben loten is a hatred for the west that is the thing tha matters benlatton continues it se commanded by our religion and intellect that the oppressed have ta right to return te aggression here is that matricts oppress oppressor matrics that all this is dependent on do not await anything from us but ge hod resistance in revenge the american people have the ability and choice to refuse the policies of their government and even to change it if they want th american people cannot be innocent of all the crimes committed by the americans and the jews against us which is his excuse for killing massive numbers of civilians in the world trade senters and athe pentingon i dhat is that is the reason why been lotten did that he says it is saddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization witness by the history of mankine the jews have taken control of your economy you 've destroyed nature with your industrial waste and gasses more than any other in history despite this you refused to sign the keoto agreement that of course at the time was been loten attempt to cudgel the proto grutatunburgs of the world intho line your law is the law of the rich and wealthy people who hold sway in their political parties and fun their election campaigns with their gifts tbehind them stand the jews who controll your policies meedian economy your hear echoes of that when both the entire ratical left the ao sea wing of the nam cratic party and in the isolation is right benlatens has you have used your force to destroy mankind more than any other nation and history the freedom and democracy that you call to is for yourselves and for the white race only that is the appeal to black live's matter proto black live's matricas this is twenty years before that what happens in glantonimo is a historical embarrassment to america and it is values and it screams into your face you hipocrits wht is the value of your signature on any agreement or treaty what is the a peal of all this the answer is really obvious ben lowdon is expressing the ideology of the current barbaric colishon dedicated to destroying the west which is why the curent barbaric polishon dedicated to destroying the west on stumbling onbin lowdon's writings is finding a new huro why would not young people love his words they have all been taught his precept at their universities all of them axcep tho part about churea law and killing all the gaye peopl and not being able tohave sect it hever you want buthey can put all that a side because anti western solidarity is the important thing the oppressed class must come together to destroy the oppressors that is what is behind the tiktock tran china of course is pushing it because china hates the west in china is of course running ticktock and young people are pushing it because we have trained in the west an entire generation

barbarians in the streets to last night massive protests outside the dnce head quarters in washington the bold here of course is for the radical left to try to push the more moderate left into mirroring their procom oss position and the way they are oing to do that is by again playing the oppress wremember in the leftust matrix the more angry you are the more evil you are the more criminal things you do the more this is evidence that youare oppressed now in reality it is the ofposite the reality is that actions of evil criminal actions for example violent actions they tend to make you poorer they tend to make your life worse but because the left does not believe in personal responsibility at quar level they believe that basely life is a thing that happens to you because of that when they see somebody who is poor and angry it is that the poverty is causing the anger not that the anger is clausingt poverty and when you have protestors in the streets are gtting violinds the lefts almost immediate respons very often is to say well those people must be angry for reason and the reason is because we need to make concessions to the that is the purpose of having these violent protesto last night according to the associateo press police and protestors clashed outside the dnce head quarters during a demonstration for a sease fire in the warbitine israel and come oss the latest reflection of boiling tensions over the bloody conflict by he way the only boiling tensions are coming from one side and literally the day before there was a giant three hundred thousand person rally on the washington mall pro isro rally peaceful loving american flags zero violands zero that was not a boiling crowd the boiling crowds are the ones in london or assaulting police officers the boiling crowds werethe ones last night or assaulting police officers i'm olds enough fremember when the was considered a bad thing on januari sex now it is considered you do not just count of deregor scores ofe democratic representatives in candidates including house minorty leader hokim jeffreys were inside the building for a campaign reception when itwas interrupted by chancing outside protestors said they wanted to block entrances and exits to force politictions to en counter they are counde liht vigil however the situations swiftly revolved capital police set about a hundred and fifty people wrelegally and violently protesting in the capitalwhol neighborhood of washington protestors then beits blame police for the violens here is ut what it looked as these craze leftists and o the radical musslim allies tdecided that they were going to attack the the front of the denci building poslexs cen insurrectionary does not it rah here no nothing does not mater tottally fine just can a point out at this point that donem this is not covered pretty much at all in he mainstremedia itis buried inthe mainstremedia now f you imagine pro israel protesters outside the ncy calling for more support for israel attacking police officers do youthing out my make the from pages literally everywhere the answerof course is yes when see a violent protest outside the d n c and i's by left wingers it is considered normal these yen that o presser o press matrix is strong the have no systemic community to it at all the capital offices anded ap having to go into lock down and again this is just the latest example for over over in berkeley for example left wingers we are throwing money at city council members the implication of course being that it is ju money that is responsible for the lack of the cease fire which of course is insane here re these anti jewish protestors in berkeley throwing cashet city council members inseea again there there they are delight delightful human beings wmeanwhile forty groups ot columbia university have not proposed to a push divestmen from the state of israel they call themselves the columbia university o partide at divest ay colition of student

continuation of the veanom antiwar movement and the movements dives from a partie and south africa we support freedom an justice for the palestinian people we know the true collective safety will arise when everyone has access to clean air clean water foodhousing education helth care freedom of movement and dignity now never mind the commossis deprived it is people of liteally all of those things for last twenty years while bilding terratunnels and shooting rockets at the jews does not matter the students at columbia have decided to to face down the quoc zianist project according to reports from the w acho a palisinian chaud is killed every ten minutes these attacks are explicitly connected to israels attempts to anax and ethnically clens more palestinian land again historially ignorant ridiculous israel literally pulled out of the gosstriptit vaus of hivxis did not want anything to do with this area it does not matter the entire agendicere is an anti western agenite is not chust in anti israel agenta how do we know because they say quote we believe in liberation all systems of oppression are interlinct the fates of the people of palistine curtistands sunan conguar minia ireland porterikacorea guama hety howia cashmer cuba turl island and other colonized bodies are inter connected theres some things on this lessthat are they are rather interesting apparently i they want hoa to be turned over and corea to whom i seom they mean south corea i turn it over to te norks whate whate would exactleyr they talk amout there we are committed to creeting a molti generational intersectional accessible space dedicated to fighting for abolition trans national feminism anti capitalism an dcolonization and also te combating anti blackness queer fobia is lamaphobia and antisemptism now again rational people look at that lissen they go wat tha they look at that list of det mands from this columbia antio partite colition th go i noticed the yu have a few things here that conflict with one another when you say queer phobia and his lamaphobia back to back it is weird thecause let us be real about this radical muslems hate gae people and tried to kill them s that is strange but that is not the point the point is it is coalitional it is all coalitional strategy we keep each other stafe we do not believe that prisons police profit over people militoris more colonialism or imperialism will keep us safe we reject the you us emigrations and customs enforcemen agencies weaponizing of the united states is ra systemogration laws to prevent our international comrades and peers from speaking up they believe in open borders we believe in the right of self determination land back the right of return from palestine to turtile island a noticed by theway none of these people giving up their land to native americans we believe in solidarity and the power of relationship building we believe ind collectivity an that is the that is the that is the stick ere itis a coalitional strategy and agen that coalissional strategy sounds an awful lot likeeso been lot in this is wi ofsom ben latin was doing the keeoto proticul routine wayback wen it is why he was doing the anti colonialism routine way back wen now by the way there has never been a more colonizing religion in world history than is lum ever it is lom is a colonizing religion by nature if you think that erebic peoples we are native to spain you are out ofer mind if the reality is that virtually all religions have at times been colonizing but the arabian penensula was completely dominated bit is lam since the seventh century and pretending tha there is no colonialism in herrenton is lomis just historically ignorant of course there was it is why they still consider in radicalislomic circles the world to be divided between dar all islem and dar all harb breat the idea of the world governed by is lam and the world not governed by is lam and the ideas that eventually everything is can come under the dominion of is lam when you have this group pushing against colonization obviously there is a lot of a double thing right there happening but that is on the point it does not have to be internally consistent it has to be externally consistent meaning its enemy has to be consistent and that is the idea and that is why you see this coalition building happening and just one second will talk about how far this is gone in democratic circles to the point where obviously they not only are quite supportive of som comoss forces they are perfectly willian cover for congress people lic

been given the fact that according to the neric post toleb is a member of the facebook group palistinian american congress whos founder maher obdal cadar has referred to his railies as not real jews and question whether the holcosst really happene that facebook group which to leav join six years ago has posted several images of comms fighters following the terrgrs brutal assalt that left at least twelve hundred dat across southern israel a member of the palcine american congress posted on our tober twelve quot we do not want to throw you in the sea we want you to ride it back from where you came sharing a picture of an elderly is raly woman identified as a holicossorviver held hostage by comas another post on that same facebook group showed a commas terr longside a list of achievements reached by the resistance in northern occupied palistine toleab of course fully in league with all of this not not a great shock is aosy the comas cawcas rides fully within the democratic party at this point yesterday she treated out the jew money sctek again apac has said that they are going to dedicate a lot of money to getting rid of congress people who ar out a lined with comas and she thinks that that is a truly jus a reflection of jew ba bad ju money what criticism of these raly governments virtually unon existent in youus paltics but apparently that is not enough that aspen a hundred million dollars to un seat the few who believe in palistinian human rights and a sease fire that most americans already support the acceptable level of desent is zero well tha's weard becase i see that apack is actually not launching primary challenges against the vast majority of democrats virtually all democrats theyre only targoning the people who actually our membersof the comosqua but again the idea is it is it is that corrupt juw money that aose is really upset about speaking of which twenty four members of th commas cawcas have now signed a letters to present an by an an secretary of state blinkin expressing deep concern about the intensifying war in goso and calling for aseas fire they am they then commit the moral sin of equivalente between c moss and the is really defense forces that of course os signed by all the usual suspects all the people who you would see ye again no shock there the british labor party experiencing similar convulsions cure starmer is suffering a major labor rebellion in briton over a gozsa sease fire vot fifty six of his ampeas voted for in immediate sease fire ten of the party's front bentures those are people who our sort of spokes people for labor have left their jobs over the vote including eight shadow ministers and though the left is turning self apart over all of this because again the left has no systemic immunity at all two the osonem ban lotden intersectional crusade they have know im munitive that because they too believe hat the left is in herently flod that must pay a deep and abiding price and that battle is just going to get more and more pitched it is it is stunning to watch ot play out in real time but again this is the wages of wast that is a pologetic about it s own existence for decades on end now meanwhile the meda are targaning where they think the anti semiton this and they the media have been very very generous tor comoss in attacalites the media have been granting every dounts of credbility they can to the gozin ministr of help theyve been granting every piece of credibility they can to every lie coming out from comoss they have been stamp that theyve been stamping for a sease fire and claiming that israel's committing war crimes indiefines of all facts on the ground the media love that' sort ostoff they are doing comossis work i mean really comosses proping and work but they think they know where the true anti sematism lies the trueanti sematism apparently lies with wait fort waite for wayferit donald trump now the other day donal trump made a rather intemperate comment during one of his speeches now that that is nothing new we should not be shock by this everybody clutching at their pearls its tiresome as i've said many times bfore donal trump's epitaph may and up reading donal trump forty fifth president of the united states he set a lot of stuff but in any case cure is what he actually said that set the intrnette oblaze sure hiristonal trump the other day the great shilangaris rii lik every or and under alytion the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten aon o be forgotno with your help you love an ou o we will put a ma a first and to day is

elections and will do anything possible they will do anything witthe leglyelyly to destroy a ma and to destroy the main ty now he is reading from is hell a prompter ther mean that that that is actualy part of the speech tan's not the best use of language the use of language verman it is dol redolint of bad things it is ugly but the media were not just content to say that that is ugly language that is redilend of of af demagag ree of the past the immediately went alltheway they went drectly to hitler and then just go to hitler hm with hitler fifty one times is their favoritething i gated trump because he said lord verman is just hitler they here he go here is your beloved media of course its trump is a noty time again let tillat hitler aca i do not think a typobolic to say that amy that is mostaly any hitler languar trump e pinany for hitler with away covered under an umbrella he hihedity ee er words liten a o hitler leduly electe a echoing the hateful recory o adol hitler the echoes

goes on ling tis over and over and over and over ritam in this is the stake hitler hitler htit now let it be said at this point tonal trump is not enough hitler not only is not tonal trump enogh hitler he is the most prot isral and projewish president in american history barnon but here in lies the true insanity many of the same members of the media tone policing trump as hitler have been simultaneously poopooing the actual mosies of to day come oss in their supporters the gout medy husson and the rest of te host at a mass an be see who seem to have made it their likes mission to down play comossis evil in order to establish moral equivalents with the jewish state and they are the first on the band wagon to sniff out hitlarian references except for the people lashlly love hitler of course the people of she love hitler well that they just have sme legitimace grievances some the same dynamic has been striking you lon musko f the course last twenty four hours fo mosk made a rather large twitter booboo last night somebody untwitter posted the following message quote jewish communities have ben pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them i'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest bleap now about western jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hords of minorities that support flooding their country do not exactly them too much you want truth said your face there it is s that was the tweet musk than teated you have said the actual truth and this set everything ublazs it is true obviously that certain jewish organizations have brought into and promoted things diversity equity and inclusion which are gros distortions of theamerican dree nobody hates d ey more than i do there are certain jewish groups that ar liberal an orantation who have supported that sort of stuff many of those groups have also pushe for open borders it is also true that some of those organizations are now realizing post october seventh that actually open tomagration for peopleo heate jews on an intersectional basis with pretty stupid the pr opin with the original tweet is that it label's jewish communities on mass my community for example pritty jewish has always opposed d e i and open boarders in fact most orthodox communities do presumably then musk was reading t at the term jewish communities and instead seeing the letters ady ell and indeed that is exactly a musk then clarifid he said quote the adiel unjustly attacks the majority of the west despite the majority of the wes supporting the jewish people in israel this s because they cannot by thir own tenets criticize the minority groups ware their pimary threat it is not right and it needs to stop and then musk continued you are right that this does not extend to all jewish communities it is not just limited to the adell sayds a much more specific point and it is certainly true there are a lot of liberal jewish organizations that supported a lot of the same policies that have now imported a lot of people who really hate junes and westerners into the west and a lot o the very same people who are pushing d i intersectional politics are now realizing the wages of that that is true te original tweet was wildly overbroad but a huge number of people in the media decided now was the time to link musk in the altright and the called jewish question and support the notion tha musk is some sort of cripto noty now it is not a coincidence again that a lot of the people jewing just that are happily calling for israel to sease fire in swarth komoss see very often antisemitism becomes a political football when ye can hang the label on donald trump or elon musk and ofre on the left you doit however when your fort denounce procoms protesters shouting from the river to the sea palstine must be free suddenly get a little shy thus the same media leaping on both trump and musk has been down plaing the open jew hatred and massive procomos protests around the globe instead propagating lized bout israel supposed human rightes violations instead thei'r focusing in on their political enemies trump and musk and seeming them the actlites of itler meanwhile the actual hitlor ackalizes or out their waving mine comthilic those people i mean they are oppressed and brown it might have more bight to hit trump and musk for supposing antisemtism if these people actually spent some actual time talking about the people who actually hitler on planat earth woare right now holding some two hundred forty jews and others hostage in goza and killed twelve hundred people and have subjected the gozstrip to complete hellish syranny for last twenty years but a lot of the same people are totally silent it one second will talk about thei'r silence becaus their silence is absolutely defening first not easy get sleep these days it is been pretty rough time for a lot of people but when i havng any sleep it

anslonic terrs grup called bocoheram and they kidnaped two hundred seventy six mostly christian female students in nigeria and the celebrity class sprang into action sem missschel obama ellen's generous queen le tefa they all held up signs breading bring back our girls remember this hashtag bring back our girls many ous that that hashhanging can do bleep and did not work by e wiy a hundred pluss of those girls are till missing but that is not the point the point is the celebrity class was up in arms over the kidnap girls as they should a been right hash tag up bring back our girls that was the thing all the big slebs all of them ouniversally question have we setme look at this have we seen any any of these same celebrities holding up bring back our baby signs for americans being held the hostage and gossa actual americans and for all the talk of people about america firsinsthe i jus to point out there are currently dozens of americans being held hostage bacamass right now thet we have seen members of the medea gal king lecture a jewish father whose eight year old daughter is currently being held bacamases whit the meedia do meda are not holding up those sins for this guys kid but they are at tempting to cudgel this guy the're theyre tempting gt this guy whose daughter is being hel by comass to say that isrel should stop trying to kill mumbers of comass but now this seems to me all about holitics what to you say about that you have ani sen children and colist polistan an toar dying and the sent tis ral y children who are sin and no one seems to be able to say enogh stop tat i'm tho interests in the coletic teto my hunmy concen is ge ting enrealy back in this is nsan the media are literally trying to push a man whose daughter is being held hossage by a terrorist group into saying that israel is doing the wrong thing by going after the terrace roup not sing that time from gel cang right there that bring back our our babies sign not seeing it here the thing the is tons of jew hatred on plan earth plenty to go roun any one who spending their days going after donal trumpet elon mas frantisemitism while leaving comas untouched is retty obviously concern about something very different from jew hatred pretty clearly an came meanwhile with regard to the latest in this war jobidon is playing boatsides a that that is tholingwy to read this jobdon just greenlet ten billion dollars being handed over to eron lade on tuesday the secretary of state sense congress a recommendation for one hundred and twenty day waver allowing the arocky government to transferd ten billion dollars and frozen funs to the itolas in eron the capital is urock tos tayments for ronian electricity but is being held in in escro accounts the administration says the waver was necessary to preserve rocks electricity supplies but ta that means that there is canneas all that money for terrorsm because tat is what they are doing the united states has been under attack from terrast militia groups throughout the italeast mostly controld biaron on fifty six occations youust positions an rock and seria are now under attack from the aranians fiftey nine youa service personal had been injured in those strikes and a jobidon is signing wavers to transfer billions of dollars to the aranian government even as the aronian government is weak the rona government has been tremendously weaken there is a port yesterday out of aron international english that actually the aron supreme leader ill the comany one of the itollus he delivered a clear message to comas leader ismale honea he said we will not warned about your attack and dom we love you and your best friends but high five as you droun which makes perfect tens and as i've suggested since the begining of the war the the most plausible explanation for what actually happen is that ron greenlet an attack from comas in attempt to scuttle the souty piece plan that was being put on the tablesteen israel and sad arabia broker by the by dministration they want to kill that deo they sait to comas do an attack killabuncho jews hope that israel goes in strong and tat will scuttle the deal but what that did not count on is comoss being successful enough to kill twelve hundred people and take two hndred forty hossages necessitating the complete obliteration of coms they just figured comass would lived figh another day there would be another sease fire coms would continue to maintain its power in the gocestrip instead of oron gaining the death of the souty piece plan they got that but they also lost one of their biggest pawns on the board in commas and then the question became to they wish to lose other pieces on the chessboard tbecause the unspoken reality of this current middalys conflict is that the actual serious threa to israel is actually not comas in the gosistripright now is casballa on israel's northern boarder which has two hundred thousand rockets pointed at israel including fifty thousand highly sophisticated rock it is capable of geo targenang which means can hit towers in tellofeve not the dum rocket they are being fired bacamas smart rockets they are being fired from southern lebanon into israel as we seem deterrents does not really tend to detur terrors groups when push comes to shav and israel at some point is can have to go after casbalas the question is weather they are going to it right now aron does not want them to do it right now es for if israel wore to swivel and hit kisbell all right now and take them off the table that is a real prom fer ron the fourd operating base against israel for ron was commas in the south and casballat in the north com as has ben taken off the table if israel tase casballas off the table aron that has no projective capability in terms of actually being able to destroy israel they can certainly make trouble on the northern border they can certainly create problems injurdand smarry the called less bank they can certainly do all those things but they do not have an accistential thread on israel's border if israel tackes out casbalas or ron basically its interestin containing this thing because they do not wan kisbalat to go down alongside come as asaron is in a weaken position it is very weird the by administration continues to fund aron an what exactly is the thury there that the'regoin to be nice if you give the money that has not work well in the past meanwhile israel has ben taking over the all shef a hospital aagain it is truly incredibleme truly incredible that the united states the rest of the world tcontinue pe pressure on israel wit th rita human rights when israel is literally sending in arabic speakers and medical workers into a hospital run by commas in being used as they base of attacx again soldiers for the ideaf and then the question is whether israel's being humane enough there is never been in army that is been forced to do anything remotely this the united state when it came to isell bomd hospitals we did and what we ware not wrong to do when they were being used as basis by isel and yet it is the same exact people hare now li gal man i hope that israel isa is bringing in sufficient fuel to these hospitals the cmmasses turning down whle the shoot the soldiers in any case jonathan congrte gets who is the ub who as the spokes person for the ideef and he walk people in side partspital shive a hospitan showed its to military base because it is a military base a aecethy in emai ro i dunnow when this was use the last time i e the lain a eite ai ny follo me behi ivty soyou wa a crup o you mini thegal in ena thi terms thit is a grabman rate go o e homa fo raen if you ful in an we get the li over in what yoful caveful fee or if mina that equipment there is a a an camfor e teven herar cartete a amo a therar remanhin here of course uni fo and all of that tith was hithem very conveniently secrey behind teeiity well man obviously it is a medical facility an wha why wuld is rall possibly be going into a medical facility obviously not a medical facility but dom that is the entire idea here 's the media which aure focust again on creating moral equivalents between a group that it is literally using its own blood re sources soldiers lives in order protects civilions on the other side of the conflict many of whom were involved in the actural october sev of attacks the trngrin moral clinsing those people on thepeople who hide eightcky forty sevens in m ari rooms that is the media ben dedicated full time yo doing and meanwhile ther targing colezerbeam the anti temis is m even of any one they proceed as a supposed right winger t this is their stik and it is real it is really obvious and it is really quie pathetic acgan meanwhile jobiden is meeting

military matters as well well jobiton relidan knose message to china whosact what exactly with the message whose trying convey to china yesterdy he just walked away from the question eby walkan inside an i'm sure that those negotiations went amazing according to the walszrejournal we made real progress said bidn in is weet the toxulator told reporters were some of most constructive and productive conversations we have had what exactly did they do well they agreed to resume communications between the militaries said they aren an a firing on one another qo operaht on choking off fentinal production yet i'm sure that is gon to happen am sure china's goin a stob the giant cash revenue stream that is fentinal production and begin a dialogue on the risks of a i yes that is what we need we need the chinese involved in the direction of artificial intelligence probably that will not go wrong given what they have done with tiktok by weaponizing it against the west remember thething bout tiktok tiktock in the west is not the samesticktok in china tiktock an china teaches kis to no mauth tiktock in west teachers kids to cut off their own penises it is it is a little different ya china involved in the ai discussion not superhot on that the outcome is likely to face pressur in coming month with disagreements over an election in tiwan and the chinese navies harasmen of ships from the philipines o yess ally theu us n'n china have differen sharply over the israel commoss war bidon also faces politicalrisk at home from republican politicions who argue he is going easy on bashiong here is the thing therereshes a pety wide by partison consents as the chinas the baggot wat a democrat agree with this repres on miht galligar runs an entirely new committee incongress dedicated to chinese relations and it is well attended a mean democrats are are largely on the same page in terms of believing and being correct the chinase infarious force in the world rare area by partisan agreement what exactly is bidin wut what deal is bidn going to cut this time the agrements reached wednesday give washington and bishing more time to steady tize than down on downward pitch for years well sore sure they do excepthad when the united states shows weakness china tends to pick up the batonang go i i'm old enough remember when honghong was not a chinese occupied territory i'm ll nogh remember when honghongstoll had a level of independence andnounces completely run by china the lest just completely surrendered the thing the shinoa account which is the official chinese media quoted she is saying quat china has no plans to surpasser replace te united states and the united states should not have any plans to surpress and contain china a that is a li china does hat plans to surpassr or replace the united states obviously and at's particularly true one comes to international relations the senior ad ministration official said the leaders had a substantial exchange aboutstiwan and that bidon a responded by saying the longstanding os position is a determination to maintain pieace and stability bid an urged bashings respect the ac toral process inti wan ge appear to push back at the white houses view that relations with china are to find by competition saying that he rejects the idea of a major country competition sut towns somma some pretty words im but houses can materialize i i have mite outs i jobidon again speaking a lot of es pretty were jestrace on we have to work together we have to work together with the chinese an good luck with that grosa responspuer people the wore word t wore o geer wer reto ok we will see what that working together looks last time jobi an work together with china on at least the big i got to money soid there there is that as well a ga meanwhile the the republican party continues to be a party in disarray the popolitico has a piece to day all about the house cheope and how mak johnson the new speakero the ouse avoided a shut down the avoid to shut down by putting into law a a continuang resolution tha basically is a continuation of what carthy would have done and many members of the house jopiar lice we do not even know what the hell is going on and that is correct no one knows of the hll is going on because you 'ave no sense of cility or insense if structure as we discussed it yesterday on the program according to political republicans cannot agree on basic policy priorities or even fun the government without a majority of democratic votes individual law makers are going rogue on the house floor with theatrical efforts the senturi colles an impeach members of the bide ministration acgrowing number of lal makers are choosing to retire because they feel ompossible to get anything done well yes that is correct rat represen cally armstrong of nort to cot aid it is the same clown car withth diferent driver we do not have the majority essentially i mean that is right chiproy is saying the same thing from the conservative side of the ow hes as iron under yuni what we do for a living id yo your blot here is represent a roy we would notly cown without forthing shut sumer jobi into the cable because republican control the chamber orly they than tha republicans for the life of me i do not understant how you can go to the trouble o campaigning rasing money going to a tanc calking to people coming to this cown av the member of a party to aleely thanc for something a legely thant for roducing pendin a legely thanc foreliminating that securing the border strong military anding the wokness that is killing at corrupt ing our schools ar cid an then do nothing about it one thing i wl my republican college the give me one thing one the in go campaign on it thiy we did one anybody thing in the coplec you aught to come down o the for come explain to me one ma curial meaning ful significant thing the republican majority is done beside well i guess it is not is tat of the democrat i mean he is right about that obviously but that is the natur the gamewright now the republican party has a lot of independagions and thse independations are not working together to actually craft anything they remotely resembles solutions and they are losing and they dis here to lose that is not a leadership problem persey again replacing the carth with johnson asn't change the maut it is an insentive problems i've ben saying for a very long time people getting on t v people the purism tests in congress because it makes them look better than their colleagues it means ththey get to yelland scream alot the realities whoone get something done you are actung in a half to at some points get together as a caucas democrates got things done becase they do stayed together as caucas that is for shore

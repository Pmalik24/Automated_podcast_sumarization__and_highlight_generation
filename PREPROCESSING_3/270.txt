bum bum bum it was the boy friend after all think about it to as gou a big it ritrest beke rachel says at she is sure there was some small part of her in the back of her brain which was oket what if it is him i mean of course that something you would think about and the ba ank sirways do you have a boy friend it is the boy friend that is what bank should say that they would suggested yet any bank or police officer wout i spak do you have a boy friend it is the boy friend it is always the boy friend and i was you do not know my by friend you do not know my boy friend these are magic words that sometimes keep people from seeing things that are right in front of their face you do not know my boy friend my boy friend is the king of generosity and kindness just giving all the time to every one jus giving heus want to give you do not know my boy fyou doft know my wife you do not know my spouse you to know my pardner you do not know them i know them hire's one of the dangers of getting close to somebody to get close you have to agree i trust you i believe you i know tht what you say is true what i say is true and sometimes that is a mistake that is oneof the perils of intimacy ther're others too of course that is hat i shows about to day perils of intimacy did me we have grown men awkwardly trying t a make friends with each other nots your what to talk about we have people on nervous first dates greavely fighting their own it securities and anxieties there are downsides to being close to somebody that is nok about that for a change instead of how great it is to be married forever and bababa brigid jons wedding tost babaa single people there ware thirty two million of you living alone a hundred seven million of you unmarried here is an hour to make you feel good about that for a change there mou be easy chicago its this american life on mara glass stay with his lusers rachel came back from the bank from seeing her boyfrind's handwriting on the check that he stole from her when you got back to the studio apartment that they share to confronted him with the truth obviously you knon't how was she not going to ditchhim but sat in bed with her e did something he broke down crying and he said i have to tell you something and i do not want to tell you am cause i'm afraid that if i tell you your going to leave me and a that is when he told me that he has impulse control disorder that he is been diagnost withus for many years and that he is done a lot of stupid stuff and he said he was seeing a berapest andnd en getting help for it how long did you bo gis been together probably four years nin three ear three ears he i do not be disrespectful to somebody is actual a disease but the name impulse control disorder just sounds the name of but that is just saying whi just could not help myself i was one until i take money from a casha gister i have impulse control in smorder i i goud sen t yo sleep with your sister i haven' cos matrodis order ri o could deceives the most i mean i sav with respect to people who my have this as a real disorder right and ike you will not you tell these storries and ten you just feel how do you not not he just sound stupid but fact then i think i needed to hear that there are some sort of medical reason hoqet it is not gages an explanation ye he is not a bad person he is just going through something that is ot of his control in it is medical yes in think how how a person would want that rather than the other thing willy i a bau i coald tie up an b wet hereis why not he is been living for years with as sociate bot theother one sounded better sa at the time she accepted arigt he has an impulse control disorder an she believe the disorder is would cause him to steel the very last money she had in this world and for which her name on a check and then search for the check with her pretending he had no idea where the check could have gone but that is all she thought he did that tiny morsel of truth as all she was able to take in at that point she did not put together the whole truth that he been stealing from her for overy year that he was the identity thief not some stranger in a dingy apartment in chicago he was the identity thief who made her totally stressed out over money all the time whe drove her to the point where she was looking over her shoulder as she walked to her own post office box the did together for another year and a half and before you judge o ci before you' think how could she do that ill explain how itstruly interesting i think it coun appene to a lot of us for starter's her boyfon had been the one steady thing in her life right she is going through this hard time with banks and credicards in its not ending and he was the one thing she thought she could depend on is just hard to let that go ah god makes the sound stupid but ye ii i i really thought i knew what good was everything felt bad and hard too control i was hes has to be good because if he is not good nothing es ged right that is the whole premise that is the premise of your life ran ne et i was rationally there is no ay that it was him because he literally supports me he bis all of our grosery is and he pays all of our bells and he is legitimately my personal army to try and figure out the identity frod rights o just usn't at o there is not than that person al sould be taking money from me the person who is actually paying for every theright yes i why would some on stell for himon that spended on me it juston make sense to me but weard financhal stuff keeps happening rachel gets phone calls about crediccards that ein her name that she never took out kneaw nothing about car gets booted youve the rachwel never got a ticket herself and occasionally the thought would cross her mind ook if i broke up with him what al thes troubles go away i you'r just kind of brush that thought away once the boy friends step mother sits in the to rachel she was the evil stepmam that he he hated her and hy kcond o got me to hate her and i realize years later she was the only one who was on to it this happened early on thistepmom said to rachel i here you having some kind of identity theff problems hows a gan she as do you gis go of er bells together doyou as ever do that connistuff together nd i was now i want to do it i it strusts me out and she was a really important part of her relationship as figuring out financial stoff maybe you should look into that make sure that he is got things on her control e no really tried to get me to do stuff with him and i honestly i know she said something sort of rude about him he is not great at this and i i shot it down i was just you do not know because he made me hate her years later i realize on mye god she tried to warn me but he had done such a good job of protection that i was she is not even a candidate for trusting s inntything about what was not this for the boy friend and i i mean stealing from her making her feel anxious a parenoid about her finances and then stepping in to comfort her and save the day and help her out using her money he was a care takeer it made him really happy he really wanted to provide i h you really want to be a provider and he would make me he is fancy dinneris every night pack my lunch a for work and stuff that s up a sat year and half passes and he asks rachel to marry him she says yes shes really happy next morning is appens the very next morning she gets a call from their landlord ho the boy frended always delt with and he was just screaming and he is i do not know you an your way forn are trying to pull but you owe me sixteen thousand dollars whatever it was and your being evicted and why are not you re turning my calls and a i was i i have no idea what you are talking about and he was you are a liar just your boy friend she begiving her boyfriend her had for the rand but he had not paid the landlord in a year che was lookat what where did that money go and she started to look for it she went through his stuff for the first time with out him around and open drawers and found all kinds of bills in credicards in his name from american express and been an a republican all kinds of other places a whole secret financial chaos and then they fight about how he would been lying to her and this is what breaks him up though it takes a few weeks for them to break up which i get he ben her college boy friend hey bed to gether five years they were engaged oka takes weeks and during those weeks horribly we started planning a wedding i kind of went into a cadatonic state of existence where i went through the motions for a month were we would go look at wedding places but in the back of my mind of his i cannot marry this person but i could not say it out loud i did call her boy friend to ren all this spy him everything rachel said and give me chense to respond but he said now people close to rachel en to him did confirm her story finally they agreed they would an take a break for a few days think about things talked o their families dthen come back and figure things out together and ahe went home to his parents and i went to my parents and a and i never ever saw him

cris gerban poor guy he is thirty seven years old nim months ago he moved his family from san francisco to austin for a teaching gi at a small university leaving most of his male friends back on the west coast he has no choice but the start over i have not left new york in sixteen years but many of my male friends have recently moved or drifted away that i probably need to start over too i have not done anything about it exci may be complain and overburne my romantic relationships the thing i found remarkable about cris was that he was being proactive he was actively seeking male friends he got on met up dout com he formed of men's only book club he memorized baseball statistics as conversation starters he started going to bars expressly for the purpose of meeting other head or odus an do youwill not nel remember ever going really well really well i been an ouf to make about a mont i do not can not te thury near my house and a on i eating dinner atting my wife i had our daughter out

to continuel on this line go o det wi e an the only reason i know about chris's predicament is because he emaled this american life about it and even though i could relate i wouldn' hae given the letter a second thought if it did not remind me of my body evan evan coincidently had also just move to austin with his partner and his young daughter i could tell from face book that they would mans to get set up o kay but evan was already feeling lonely that special kind of loneliness that people in long turn relationships often know too well me you you to gether worrin al together bu ra fra ye that is evan he is honest co the park of i den ded e at mak me gi any der li reading a ri o cofo e yo movy i deent e mi her thatin l have te wi regard roler te o you now go e part of ye a wo import to me wan of i here about yo awit en o dely a wa gon you my friend for yevan is one of those friends i let slip away in a flurry of ranchecks earlier this year we have known each other un maybe ten years now he used to reconmand comic books and expox games that i never read nor finished part of what i love about evan is how unabashedly he is who he is he is arnest somewhat awkward and above all anerve although i think he would accept the term black eek he says he was not always confident about these parts of his personality and moving to austin away from his friends and piers livin on the sleepy et to town with only his partner and daughter has put him an un familiar territory what is your place iat ni la you a pool maybe com a hundred feet away fom a ender a cn cort o noer you o ot o li o evan was not puttig himself out there but chris was and he live in the same city both men both tads around the same age both want friends maybe have been making it out to be harder than it actually is maybe all youhave to do to make a friend is get uff to ask o try het was a chance to find out without unashy havingt do anything myself i fix evan and chris up on a date a mandate you cannot have a mandate without an official activity those of the rules the first thing i did was right to chris and evan and asked them each what they were into chris sent me a list that included the high ging running carrioki and something called disgoff evan said he likes playing pidio games and eating iwen drinking in moderation i suggested they go see captain america civil war which was coming out in a week the trailer was ausome pufs the movi starts chris evans as captain america chris evanss that is fate ike evan emale me that he wrangled free passes to an early screening more fate the he was concerned about inviting chris the movy features the sytematic da view of evan's all time favorite comic book superhero t of black panthers and he was worry that chris a total stranger might witness him crying i grabbed fate by the hand and convinced evan to give up his plus one anyway when i emal chris the good news he wrote back that quote hate may be too strong a word but i really dislike the newest round of superhero movies i did not tell evan about that we kept looking eventually we settled on trivya night at a bree house in town but by then the whole idea had started to feel a little precarious for one thing chris was having some weird misgivings e pirs mi did wit gogle him e wi girson was avn on un toi twitter hedn telt that he would interact ing wit people and retweeting people who hain' really dakin is field and iin divitatin i mean ta pirsin at a was i hell ti for theo have not go out wit me he now i really fell edidn eet e he felt evan was out of his league meanwhile evan was not even thinking about chris he never googled him and when chris gave evan is fole number over ye mal multiple times evan never responded with his bhen i talked to evan hours before the date his biggest worry was traffic he moved to texas from new york city he had not driven in years edof o o o te egiy round in you even when you d o i cotrol a you compitet o my go you but you en o ge itout there ain o gurneer e gerl i get it having relied on the subway most of my life driving scarce the crab out of me too but i needed evan to get his head in the game you see by now i was starting to think that chris and evan might not immediately or ever become fast friends they might just be too different but whether they recognized it or not there was something that connected them i could see it from my perch eighteen hundred miles away even when they couldn'evan is a deep dive pop cultured junkey chris is an english professor whowas in the sports they were opposite sides of an egg headed coin buttween them i fir they must have the gamit of trivia game an nusha thoroughly covered if my experiment would not generate a life long friendship at least it was within my power to forged the mightiest trivia eemen all of waston on this particular wednesday night and this hope i was not alone evan was poise to win if te don wa girl dikin there get a beleeve white i want in ony yet why i live for i know i looked at the webside for the trivya night n i some starwords references and things andyt or word loring mothers to but ive got my weak i en or wat what are your weakness s i do not know wh you we o a hoin oo oin at all really o yet no no that o o it o wite for me the night of the man daye arrives and i hear nothing from chris port evan not a text not any now the next morning still nothing i finally talke to chris that afternoon about how the night went being the eager one he got into the barfirs i got there and i was going table to table askim f we coul sit down an every singl person said know e know cenry min in me if elementary school where youre going tabl table askhim you can sit all the cool kids are saying no a me tht's cunto wat it felt i really felt as already in the whole before even even arrived they would agree a head of time on how they would recognize each other he told me that he was going to be wearing a purple shurt and and and you will shooes and he was ging to be limping slightly cause he had a a stub to i got there live at early i order drink right away i i get as al ta ndi som stried out to an the first white dude with a blue shirt sitting in the sage an disco introduced himself and was not me and since i saw it i said this migh gi how tit was a sure i know ow i evan li is was a sure i would not be able to wear on public and then he sat down and then the firs thing he did was order lemonade i thought on know that is this cano be bad evan eventually ordered sim burbon but not too much moderation i said we when you to teem him what you want and at just rippd off he said were the lonely transplants i said all right i thought that is a little on the nonicholas it was a low briefer than to duids on from new york one from california both of whom cannot find any friends balaba but ye ha lonly transplants was our name elonya the trivia night that chris and evan went to is officially calle gek who drank and evan killed it just as i had hoped chris was impressed there was a whole cadgard about directors they would show us clipse sim we enhave to count of guess what the move he was and he was getting this left in right and i honesthy sat there i sat there for entige around without doing anything the lonly transplants did not turn out to be the quick fire mine mell the dream team that i had hoped for there was one were the answer was a lufa he know a bath a lufa 's an organ excupstance that you have to mike away if once a day t and cleans out the bacteria and i for what ever reason thought as a sea cucumber and he is no ince a loufi as ie know i i i promise tit a seecucumber and if it is wrong i will lead chris says evan did not actually force in to leave or holded over his head that he was not pulling his wait chris took that to me that things were going well between them the lonly transplants came in nineteen out of about thirty teen wobut there megor showing didn' matter to chris this is a guy who had told me that he was missing spontinaty in his life it is every day felt scedual around work and wruting evrans and toddler parties he was feeling there were no surprise is let suddenly here he was trying to remember who were quorted rock me on ma day as wethis sort of awkward sort of dapper black in the oo one and he knew as by falco i i forgott n is by falgo and i did not write down falca it was cool evans a cool du and yet i think o know if there was an opportune to meed some one him out in that conicot real world i think i would have gone home just cant floating on air tell my wife but how exid i was for a potential new friend but at the end of te night the trivial host came over to talk to chris an evan nd something happened that left chris feeling yet again a little inadequate evan and the quizmaster is went on this long rif about starwars and then start track and the death of spock and how that had a relation she men's feelings and and an loss and and i'm sure i saw thos movies but i was just nodding an idiot and it was at that moment where i thought o man i i i got nothing why would you need to to mark awave a see cucumber to remove bac erio though just killed to sea cucumber and whut do you using the see cucumber to cil toa to wash anyon after talking to chris matrally i called evan how did it go were we donht wont the quizs part are we talking about the making a friend part just general impressions yeat general pression i thingu wint well i do not we thought it was more fun than ou tanticipating it to be i can difenly see myself hanging out with him again this was confusing to me because the entire time that i talk to evan he just did not say that much about chris or how he himself felt about the date if he had any impressions of chris he did not let on the only thing evan got passionate about and i should have expect ed this was when i asked him to revisit the impromptu star track conversation he had with the hosts at the end of the night i i love rath of cam and in the the the friendship betweene kirkan spak i gould itas been a thing that i've always love in science fiction pot culture kirk represented the count of brash impulsive see to your paance mode of living that i never really pulled off and spack he dent fitin and his emotions were not readily accessible to him and his primer identifyer was his intelligence which is something i felt deeply kirk and spock were opposites thrown together under extreme circumstances and multiple alien encounters who came to a level of mutual respect and abiration that spanned ta galixy and several franchise re boots they were friends for decades who were willing to die for each other by these standards chris and evans mandate was not arousing success but i'm more of a romantic comedy buff than a star track fan and rom coms for the most part our only about the beginnings of relationships by those standards you just have to establish that first connection all you really need are two people who both kind of one to meet some one and a powerful external force to bring them together a best friends impending wedding or forced road trip together orsay alradio producer just trod to satisfy his own curiosity would you to hang out again ye i would ov a o love ting ot thevagain i is really cool gi would i be would you would you consider calling chris at sometone or haou ye ye on'tly iive almost planning after i spoke to you i doin't want alike mock up the process oh by you mal him a prematurely yes i'll thing to follow up in in him it is been three weeks since their dat cris and even still have not gotten together again but even fanally gave chris his number and they'v been emailing back and forth about plans ithing it will happen how i do it probably an driming is

refers to as hero whe when of the first jobs i i got at a college o was thas sisting on avidio being made by a big hero of mine my friend got me the job is she she thought this would be a really fun thing for me to do but ad you saw this is the worst thing ever because i do not noif you can just tell bye my energy but won' really bad at meeting most people nthis was me ating one of my heroes and i've had many awkward horrible interactions that at a certain pointing just realize mame i should not speak i took the job and but i had a plan i was i'm going to ignore my hero i know he is not evenn to know i'm there i get there and immediately realize that this ist a ver he small shoot and they are only seven people there and wantof the first people to introduce themselves to me was my hero he was hi i'm your hero what is ter name and i just thought this is the words stay fand it keeps happening ause he is is really nice gy he would pass by and you would belike are you haveim fon how is i

these thoughts are going through my head and at was there is just deaf lingin to be a moment were he shares something about himsef and and i'm going to be i already know that i know everything about you to her in the gar and it is really hard to avoid some one who is in your cr but a strange thing happens that i i did not feel as uncomfortable as i thought i'd feel cause he was just sping open and nice ti started sharing things and i told him that he was one of the reasons why i'd started doing commediand i was as a spiring commedian and it was just cool to work with him and as i was dropping him off he said i'd love to see you performsome time and ou's probably being poli but you got to imagine being younger it was just the most magical exciting thing ever and a weak later i set about i went about composing just the perfect emale to invite him to a show and the great thing about emale as that you do not have to send anything immediately you can dragthings i can really take your time and make sure it is right and that is what i did i made all these drafts i made sure all the info was there about the event and mature the grammar was ryde and the spacing and i and a even made sure i sounded a fun person i sounded you read in you are that girl's fun o and i never heard back bute but i it did not even matter because i was li he is just busy he is this busy guide and and also i just felt i had made this really good impression a and and that was's five years ago and i i kept doing comedy in i i was aon female very recently and something that i to do i was consciousness stalgically looking at old emales i ad sent it just this weird thing i to do cause occasionally i'll see a fun one an all ford it to a friend be remember hen i said that ah i was doing that and i scrolled way down and i stumbled upone the very emale that i 'd written to my hero five years ago dear hero set aside two tickets for you to next month show on january nineteenth if you can make it if not it is every month there is always the next time also the shot turned out osum pretty good right that was sent at twelve o one an h underneath that i i found another one sent at twelve o one within the same minute dear hero set aside two ticke its for you next mon show on cinry nineteenth if you can make it and then i added hope you lat a wonderful oliday then i i found another one and a it is in a twelve o to i'd confuse saving with the seenting i comedy hero received all my drafts dear hero set a side two tickets for yoou next mon show on janery nineteen you can make it nd then here is just huge gap and then i they i added also the shot turned out osum yd'ar her o and this one i twelve o four just added the venuw it is a twelve o four again and now i just added the time aow it is

tally up what is good an what is bad about getting close to somebody this a god one ofmy favertsord stories it is begudia daveus it is read for us by actor mat boy wanting to whisteners the story does acknowledge that people have sex e's sitting there staring it a piece of paper in front of them he is trying to break it down he says i'm breaking it all down the ticket was six hundred dollars and after that there was more for the hotel and food and on for just ten days say eighty dollars a day no more a hundred dllars a day and we made love s once a day on the average that is a hundred dollars a shot and each time it lasted may be two or three hours that would be anywhere from thirty three to fifty dollars an hour which is expensive though of course that was not all that went on because we were together almost all day long man she would keep looking at me and every time she looked at me that was worth something and she smiled at me and did not stop talking and singing something i said she would sail into it to snatch for me she would be gone for me little ways but smiling too and tell me jokes i loved it but did not exactly know what to do about it just smiled back at her and felt slow next to her just not quick enough she talked and touched me on the shoulder in the arm she kept touching and stayed close to me you are with each other all day longin tot keeps happening the touches and smiles and it adds up it builds up and where you will be that night you are talking an every now and then you think about it now ou do not think aw you just feel it is kind of a destination what is coming up after you leave wherever you are all evening and you are happy about it and you are planning it all not your head really somewhere inside your body ore all through your body it is all mounting up and coming together that when you get an bed you cannot help it it is a real performance man it all pours out but slowly you go easy until you cannot any more or you hold back the whole time you hold back and touch the edges of everything you edge around and till you hafe to plunge in at finish it off and when you are finished you'r too weak to stand but after whye you have t go the bath room and you stand your legs ar trembling you hold on to the door frames as a little light coming in through the window you can see your way in and out but you cannot really see the bed it is really not a hundred ours as shop because it goes on all day from the start when you wake up and feel her body next to you you do not miss a thing and not a thing of what is going on next o you her leg her arm her shoulder her face that good skin i've felt other good skin but this skin is just the edge is something else and you get a start going only no matter how much you crawl old over each other will not be enough and when your hunger dies down a little bit then you start think about how much you love her and then that start you off again and her face and you look over ter r fance and you cannot believe how yet got there and how lucky and it is all still a surprise and it it never stops a mean em even after it is over it never stops being a surprise it is more you have a good sixteen or eighteen hours a day thits going on even when you are not wither it is still going on at me it is good to be away from her because it can to be good to get back to her now it is still there in you nd you cannot go off and look at some old street or some old painting without feeling it your body and a few things that happen thet day before that do not mean much by themselves or would not mean much if you were not having this thing together but you cannot forget and it is all inside if you all the time it is more say sixteen into a hundred would be six dollars an hour which is not too much but it is not over when it ends and and it goes on after it is all over she still inside you a sweet loocur youre filled with her everything about ers kind of bled into you her voice or smell the way her body moves it is all inside of you at least for a while after then you begin to lose it and i'm beginning to lose it you are afraid how weak you are that you cannot get her all back into you again and now the whole thing is going to be out of your body and it is more in your mind than in your body and the pictures come t you one by one and you look at them some of them last longer than others the pictures come to you and you have to hope they will not lose their life too fast and dry up though they will and that youl also forget some of what happened because already you are turning up little things that you nearly forgot we were in bed and she asked me do i seem fat to you and i was surprised because she did not seem to worry about herself at all in that way and i guess i was reading into it that she did worry about herself i answered what i was thinking and said stupidly that she had a very beautiful body that her body was perfect and i really meant it as an answer but she said kind of sharply that is not what i asked and i had to try to answer her again exactly what she had asked and once she lay over against me late at night and she started talking her breath in my ear and she just went on and on and talked faster and faster she could not stop and i loved it and just felt that all that life an her was running in to me too i had little life in me her life for fire was coming into me in that hot breath in my ear n i just wanter to go on talking for ever right there next to me and i would go on living that i would be able to go on living but without her i do not know then you forget some of it all they be most of it all almost all of it in the end and you work hart at remembering everythings nell you will not never forget but you can kill it too even by thinking about it too much thugh you cannot help but thinking about it nearly all the time and then when the pictures dart to go yu start asking some questions just little questions that sittin your mind without any answers why did she leave the light on when you came to bed one night but it was off the next but she had it on the night after that and she had it off the last night whi and and other question little questions that nagget you that and finally the pictures go and these dry little questions just sit there without any answers and you left with this large heavy pain in you that you tried to numb by reading or you try to ease it by getting out into public places where they will be people around you but no matter how good you are pushing that pain away just when yo think you areging to be all right for a little while that you are safe your kind of holding it off with all your strength and you'r staying and some bare little numb spot of ground then suddenly will all come back you will hear a noise maybe's a cat crying or a babe something else her cry you hear it and make that connection in a part of you have no control over and that pain comes back hard that youere afraid afraid o how you'r gin a fall back into it again and you wonder know youre terrified it how you are ever get a climb out of it it is not every hour of the day while it is happenn it is really for hours an hours every day after that for weeks though less and less that you could work out o ratio if yhou want maybe after six weeks han only thinking about it an hour or when the day all to gather a few minutes here and there spread over or a few minutes here and there and a half an hour before you go to sleep were sometimes it all comes back and you stay awake half the night when you had up all that iu've only spent maybe three hours an hour on it if you have to figure in the bad times too i do not know there were not any bad times it her though maybe there was one bad time when i told her i loved her i could not help it and this was the first time this had happened with her and now i was half falling in love with her or maybe completely if she would let me but she could not or i could not completely because it was all gon to be shoret and other things too and i told her and i did not know of any way to tell her first that she did not have to feel that this was a burden youw the fact that i loved her or that she did not have to feel the same about me or say the same back that it was just that i had to tell her that is all because it was bursting inside me and saying it would even begin to take care of what i was feeling really i could not say anything of what i was feeling because there was much words could not handle it and making love only made it worse because then i wanted words badly but there were no good no good at all but i told her anyway i was lying on top of her and her hands were up by her head in my hands were on hers and or fingers were locked an there was a little light on her face from the window but i could not see her and i was afraid to say it but i had to say it because i wanted her to know it was the last night i had to tell her then or i'd never have another chance and i just said before you go to sleep i have to tell you before you go to sleep that i love you and immediately right away after she said i love you to and it sounded to me as if she did not mean it a little flat but then it usually sounds flat when somebody says i love you too because there just saying it back even if they do mean it and the problem is that i'll never know if she meant it or maybe someday she will telle me whether she meanted or not but there isn't there is no way to kno now and i'm sorry i did that it was a trap i did not mean to put her in i i can see it was a trap because if she had not said anything at all that would have hurt me too as though she were taking something from me and just accepting it not giving anything back she rally had to i mean even if just to be kind she had to say it and i do not really know now if she meant t another bad time or it was not exactly bad but tit was not easy either was when i had to leave the time was comeing and i was beginning to tremble and feel empty nothing in the middle of me nothing inside t nothing to hold me up on my legs and then it came everything was ready an i had to go was just a kiss a quick one as though we were afraid of what might happen hafter a kiss and she was almost wild then a she reached up to a hook by the door d took an old shirt a green and blue shirt from the hook and put it in my arms for me to take away the soft cloth was full of her smell and then we stood the close together looking at this piece of paper she had in her hand and i did not lose any it i was holding it tight that last minute or two because this was it we would come to the end of it things always chaing this was really it over maybe it works out all right maybe you have not lost for doing it i do not know now really mean sometimes when you think of it you feel a prince really you feel just a king and other times you are afraid you are afraid not not all the time but now and then of what it is going to do to yot it is hard to know what to do with it now walking away i look back once and the door was still open i could see her standing far back in the dark in the room i cand only really see her white face still looking out at me in her white arms i guess you get to a point where you look at that pain as if it were there in front of you three feet away lying in a box and open box in a window somewhere it is hard and cold a bar of metal you just look at it there and say all right i'll take it all by it hat's what it is because all about it before youven go into this thing the pain is part of the whole thing and it is not that we can say afterwards the pleasure was greater than the pain and that is why you would do it again that it is nothing to do with t you cannot measure it because the pain comes after and it last longer the question really is why does not the pain make you say i will not do it agait when the pain is bad that you have to say that but you do not i'm just thinking about it how you can go in with six hundred dollars more a thousand and how you can come out with an old shirt mababoy reading whidia davis h's story break it down it was

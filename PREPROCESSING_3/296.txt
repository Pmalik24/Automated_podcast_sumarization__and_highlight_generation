prorgam to day a quortered on a live tor o five cities a bostaand washington do see portland organ denver and our o town chicago s he chistmas tock he needed money to go to a doctor and then he got this idea he remembered how a couple years before that he had wandered off the street into a shopping mod to get warm and there the state of new york had set up two labtop computers on a folding taband to see the lady just look at me not her head and smile when i walked up to the booth i was just want at anybody was was great soch is don at the computers and on these two computers you could look up your name and see weathered the state was holding money for you that you did not know about and there was all sorts of money utility bildery funs taxre finds lost checks owed all sorts of people ind institutions lost money are not even lossins must be put in even ot his missing this is lik money in purgatory there is money in winbow and then heg about all this chris sol realized how he could pay for his doctors he would look on line find money of theirs that they did not know abot wmoneyed the state was holding for them and then he would present that to them wh i am was hoping that i would suddenly get a couple of fon cals and a couple of checks ion people would say oh well thanks for an havin having done this and then i was hoping that these doctors wouldn just even talk to me in it in a sivil matter and then work my way up for now the christipik that have to tell you about chris suel of this pon in the story as chris is great at finding othe people's money an these day debasis on the entrynat and when he looked for money for the doctors at his local university hospital not only did he find hundreds hundreds o unclaimed blue cross po shiel checks reimbersmens lost

happened to people hands christian anderson queen elizabeth the first my grandmother's prophetically name brother uncle heiman and i knew it was the kind of thing that could happen to me days would turn into months months an to years and ev entually i would drop dead in a mens hotel and be buried sexless and a single semetery plot squeezed in on my side between my parents and i began at an early age what i thought of as my life's work the work of not dying o vergion at ten i met vered my first crush she was in from israel with her family and was staying with our neighbors since this was the summer greese came out i invited veried upstairs to our living room where i played the soundtrack on our sterio while it played i danced for her my feeling was that you had to give girls everything you had your showman ship your best moves even your dignity as the music played vred sat there with quiet indifference i one point i tried to bring her soul to life by lying down on our coffee table and spinning around on my stomach a spastic lazy susan when i did the splits i fell to the ground with a ferocity that almost tore my scrurdle sackin to before verd went back to israel i handed her all ten archy digests that i owned i stacked them all the spines lined up perfectly i wanted them to look solemn and substantial a package rapped in rope from the old country it is how i feel about you i wanted to say but her english was not good enough to understand for the next several years i would say some variation of these words to many different people but no one's english was ever good enough to understand at the age of thirteen i entered the service industry the self service industry i spent all of my time listening to music yellow while fantesizeing about the high school gim teacher playing tetherball in her brazir or steeve nek strumming a guitar in in her bazir or in my darker moments golda my ear ruling a nation and her bersar and then at fourteen i family got one of those early model elephantine vidio machines i rented early eightye'steen sex comedies private lessons private school for girls and reform school girl i would make each twenty second shouerscine last anywhere from six to seven hours pasery wine frame advance became my version of the holy trinity one time having lost the remote control to our viciar i watched the entirety of soority girls on vacation lying on the basement floor with the visiar on my chest getting its buttons a seventy pound a cordian it was around that time and spired by a potent cocktail of sexual desperation and movi starring phebi cates that i left the comfort of home for the streets afour footteen inch ferimon drenched cabbage patchedall with ackney on the prowl and thus at sixteen i met tomara every one had a locker partner at our school and i shared mine with tomara just knowing that no matter what our winter boots were alone in the dark together for six hours a day was enough to make me feel at least that something in my life was going all right one day i finally worked up the courage to ask her if she wanted to see the arythmics concert with me because i knew she was a big fan and she said yes i do not know where i came up with the idea but i had decided at some point during the concert that i wanted to whold to mara from behind and sway with her back ind forth to the music it was all i could think about all night it was not the kiss or a held hand i was after but something else somethi ing less definable it was i wanted to prove that i could get us into some kind of groove finally during a slow song i snuck up behind her and put my sweaty pocket hands on our hips i tried to ease us into it my movements were halted and completely non musical rather than dancing at looked i was trying to hoist a resistant woman into a mail box while in the throws of a painful pile's attack tomara freed herself and for the rest of the evening she was afraid to come near me at home that night i ate a boll of cold serial while staring at a bottle of my mother's nail polish on the kitchen counter carefully i painted my nails in bed my fingers spiderwalk the length of my ribs quick tick lat me i told myself i have to make this an early night i grabbed my hand and flung it away for myself roughly but it always crept back if furly eightyteen sec comities hat taught me anything which unfortunately they had in abundance it was that college was going to be a nonstop nooky fest i was not fat enough to be the one who sees on dressing soardy girl shortly before falling backwards from a ladder nora was i daring enough to have secs of a friend's mom nor was i near sighted and good enough that science to create a filatio bot but i didt know that i was the ni gy the one that drove everyone around on the way to getting action and that before the credits wrolled i would receive my due it was only right well the credited rolled the curtain had come down there was a man sweeping up pacorn and still no due for winter brak my friend howard and i decided to spend the weeken new york city as we rode the train there we passed a burned out schoolbus in a field and i thought yes that is my heart my heart is a burned out schoolbus with no windows sitting in the middle of nowhere but then after about fifteen minutes the train passed a little gray wooden control booth the door flung wide open and i thought no that that is my heart the train continued along through february fields and i looked for more things to call my heart a rusty bridge a chop down ever green a discarded can of mountain de it turned out my heart was everywhere that winter month we stayed with howards ant in flushing and every night we would go to the local bar and take pictures of ourselves scribbling in our note books our faces illuminated by the neon juke box it was at that bar that we met at twenty five year old ven hiswailand furniture salesman named hose hoard and i thought hose was the coolist while we drank our ruman cokucolas hose drank bloody caesars something we considered very sophisticated sort of drinking a salad howard explained his dilemata hose and i explaind mine haard had had pancer when he was sixteen and was concerned he would not ever be able to produce seamen and have children i explained that i had grown weary of being a virgin and really really wanted to see nakitchenmy chungas hose furowed his brow and listened to our problems with concern then he said he was taking us to a horhouse i caughtin to the idea of a hoarhouse by telling myself that it was very old school very neel simon or burt reynolds or something it was probably how my father and his father before him did it mi imagined my grandfather had lost his virginity to a kind hearted madam who after the deed had cooked hom a brisket hose took us to an apartment above a fruit store an span ish harlam where we were invited in by a small older latino man wearing a shoulder holster cose told us not to worry that this is how thingst were done we were seated on a couch facing an east indian man in what appeared to be his two teen ae sons there were three women dressed and nighties who walked by carrying balled up faded linen and punchwol sized metal basins with sopy sponges it was nafter sing toe basins that i realized i would never be able to pull this off there was something to ma disinal an matter of fact about the whole thing not only that but i was terrified sex was one thing but if i was going to be getting naked on a strange bed with sheets that were dubious i at least wanted to be with some one who mildly me an that of course is something impossible to gage when the exchange of canadian travellers checxes involved i told hosey i would sit this one out howard on the other hand was rearing to go a woman came over to woman introduced herself as cristel howard introduced himself as mister kolonovsky which was the name of our greats seven matteacher cristel took howard by the hand and let him into a room each person got twenty minutes howard remained in the room with cristel for forty the indian man sitting opposite me kept pointing to his watch while smiling and winking there is nothing that makes you think about dying o virgin more than sitting on a couch in a horhouse waiting for your best friend to finishhavi a that couch just then fell the loneliest place on earth as it turned out cristel saw howard scar and they spent most of their time together talking about what it was to have had cancer cristel had lost her brother to luchemia several years earlier she told howard that when her and her brother were kids they poked toothpicks into bubblegam which they ate our derves she told howard that she missed her brother very much on the walk back to the subway i lagged behind howard just watching ham eventually we asked howard how it was with cristel and he said that it was different any thot would be and hose told him he was being to emotional what i had not taken into account was that before you lose something in this case the albatross of one's virginity you had to first find something to enable that loss at eighteen sort of by accident i found galite her name meant little wave and when we kissed it was a little wave of blood was sweeping through my chest we kissed long and hard our eyes wide open gelite's face was always sad i told her she had a frown that lit up a room gelite would be the first person i'd ever sleep with yet losing my virginity with her even just after it happened was something i can never remember i could still recall what her brethsmot after she had eaten chocolate how she would almost cry when she saw little boys with big lasses i remember a thousand other small things too yet our first time together this thing that i had waited for ever to happen to lose a virginity i had waited for ever to lose was completely and utterly lost to me i'm not sure i understand why this is maybe when you are coming towards it hat looked big and all eclipsing it looks the finish line you imagine champagne well wisher certificates of merit then you reach it and pass it and you understand it is only the entry point to a lot of other worries worries that proved to be much more immeasurable and complicated my fear of losing my virginity was nothing compared to my fear of losing galite i can never fathom how she could love me and i tested her love all the time let sany i smashed your card i said then i'd kill you she said bill you would still love me i guess she said before i meant belite i called myself a virgin it was

jon byas leading a sing along at a black college in burmin ham in nineteen sixty two went with the traditional die in my opinion die is the way to go when you get rid of tho or die you ar raise the most movin idea in the song that if cries died for us we should be willing to die for each other why give that up this s the one clear cut case where you can ask yourself what would jesus do and the answait jesus do die and of course be will disagree about the wording we disagree about everything else in this country and when we sing this song today i think we been disagree about who the serpents are that our heels should crush some of us see our enemies abroad some see them at hone some of us are still mad at france not sho i to beng with this song all through its history it gets adacted for one use than another the melody is powerful the word strong you feel you really would lay down your life for a just cause of your choosing when we sing the battle him and i say we because that is how the song is traditionally performed at public events as if sing along in whach a group of citizens turn themselves into a qhoire we sing about taking action about marchang on about doing something and this is the best part about singing the battle him you are not standing there alone doing something your part of something the song starts off with mne eyes and eye have seen and by the end it is you

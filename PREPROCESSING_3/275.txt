from w e s chicago it is this american life i'm konda joff yo walt sitting in for ira glass irit is here but i'm taking over to days show because we are talking about questions that i think oure pretty fundamental to all of us at verious points in our lives but are especially pressing for me these days i'd to explain with a brief example of a situation i find myself in all the time lately with my two children feeling deeply lost it is bathtime jacob the older one is running a restaurant be's giving out grief prizes cups were grown ups and all animals i won onn animal ik of says if some one in your family is christian he can get one of those an w no oi ta no therod you he snatches the animal and says sorry w y cannot have any animals christian swhy can a i no jews aloud says my three and a half year old to my jewish face o a here is my question what am i supposed to say writ here becuse i should say something wright i should say that is nat o kay because why because i said because you are a jew because jews your great grandparents were driven from their communities by exactly the mentality you have just expressd to me my gree and half youra boy or because we live in a majority christian country and i'm worried that i've clearly already failed to provide you ith the positive relationship to judism or is the best approach not to say anything he is just having yau bath i do not know as you will here but pled is it is not nice to say that somebody can not something because they are not ay you'r nchr o iiave athy al o swee any y r ncri i many rules in this sany co minit restaround he says theyre kind for some people jos not my kind of people ow e the problem with talkingkids about anything that is actually importanc bis that they do not know anything it is your jab to teach them about all the stuff that matters most bat you have nothing to work with they do not know religion they do not kno history they do not know how ta maintain proper hygen also a problem they are little and they have feelings you have to be chareful about saying well plenty tell you a story about a man named at off pitler you would have the way you run your restaurant by the way we have all been on the kid side of this kind of conversation where a grown up is fumbling through with some thing that is clearly important the big one most of us remember is when some one told us about sex and on the adult side whatever the question is what is sex what is god or what is isis what is transgender me in that moment that what you say could really matterr could be the thing this person remembers and carries with them into adulted could shape the way they feel about their safety for their sexuality these conversations are how we make are mark on the next generation they are also very often how we learn how much we do nt know and into day show we are gin a listen in as people tak on three of the most difficult things to talk about we gong to hear teenaturs talking very frankly to each other about sex parents talking to their children about race and kids talking to each other abouttdest to dey show the birds in the bees we have got jot and gold seen commedian dw canou bow stay with us a o act one some it not on the nec to begin i should say throughout this hour we are ging to be talking about subject matter that can be difficult to discuss with children if you have got kids listening that is omething to consider also in this next story as ira says we will be acknowledging the existence of sex and talking a lot about our reluctance to speak of its existence o get let us start with the beginning one way a lot of kids learn about the birds and bees is from each other the seven year old name moxy told me a friend of hers this gud errand said someting to hear that bothered her on the bus he said if you drew a picture of a baby on a piece of paper and put it in her belly that would make a baby moxy knew this was incorrect that is why bothered her a week later at the playground across the street from her house she sat errand down ga such a way shat a bet e a paper not working a that be on the buff a few days agall you talked about pay bo et body en about li a a oly a a ta shur ga wi bata do a i not sure jut the baby cat to ry you see i ju say sho yneed a mak ta for an the frm fa how ga a a an tha cot work i do that to at ha nown ya do sry when it comes te sex a lot of us learn the wrong thing first an the right thing later you learn through a series of corrextions you start to find out tha half the things your brother told you we are not right that that seen in the movy is not realis it that sophia disantos was lying when she says she did that thing because that thing is not possible that is busily our system you learn things wrong tast them out and hopefully get the real story from some one ma moxon this begins on the playground and just continues all the way until you actually start having sex and all the weird information that was not corrected begins to matter you hoping tere going to cober hopecl webi teondre is in a class rom at buffalo state with about fifty other people mostly men mostly his fraternity brothers heu's her for some sex at i bo ga she shpe l ol e w don' you kno i adlga sha good question this is a voluntary workshop about sexual assault an consent on a monday night you think this event might not went out over say pitting up the jompa juse or staring at your vangoposter but this room is pocke the students are wide awake knees are bouncing hands are shooting up in the air the instructor paulomagrical is talking about the importance of consent o consent is a verbal and enthusiastic yes o ka why is it enthusiastic you why exactly you want to do it and sex should be why ra yet i hope this kind of worshop was repeated in crassrooms all a crass campas here and throughout the country in the last yere college administrators are panic about sexual salt as they should be theyre turning to this kind of education as the answer instead of mostly focussing on protecting women things grape whistles ir travel with a butty programs they also wane to teach men actual sentences to say do you this can i kiss you but the sins here are struggling with the besic premis they have to learn to speak in this new way because if you do not your rapest because it is just more virtuous they have questions rite from the start it is a continuous process of checking up what it are checking in either or what ies that mean wa it se says yes if she says yes on much o wheny wa if she says yes at this syou knows she you saying ye i gogt to be e o sure you really sure you nogt to do tis i'm almost te am o th go a shet thil get the protection no not you ar you re you wra you rae w no on youself an i stop bike but the keep to we efformation of yes oer nobgain the conto wou miss of the move shope lke should ther be a number of toms that she sus he presses them on this to three seven but that guy is overtaken by his fraternity brothers who also have urgent questions does body language countess consent what if she said yest before you got into the room when you are both sober and a message on twitter something how many beers is too much to have consent again please offer and member li youaver heard the turned olcles liquid corige what if a sent a sents aways you you by novers that you on be novs about hus at a give you nas hou liquid cotee i am not will be saking wit she coubled you fill me light you not yuse in that to get a yes the next guy over interrupts what if both parties are drunk and then across the room does the girl need to ask for consent another sudent ok what if we have been together for a year paulomagrigal replies you always need consent even if youre woman even if your man sleeping with men even if you are in e relationship eve if you have sex every day even if you are in the middle of sec or if you guise are engaging in sexual activity and may be all of a sudden someone decide i want to try it rough if you guis already starready having sect that the other person can withdraw that consent o ka that is why it is active what if some one's i want to hav another person here now let us have three people you already haven sex if all a sude the're surprise i have another person o a you can be yat om i did not really sign up for that im not a here o ka does that make a little bit more sense when we talk about ouno checking in in the active process those are carefully chosen examples the vast majority of sexual salts on college capasses occur between two people who know each other and there is not always physical force paula is trying to say take the picture you have in your mind of a serial preditor rapist put it to the side for a moment imagin instead a person who wakes up in the morning and wonders quietly to himself she was into that right yet she was in to that imagine that person is wrong the workshop was suppose to be forty five minutes it is been an hour pall a madrigal is tryin a wrap up how do you gui d you gui a yas fr how do you gas for consat i ika o is mess a gold moldlys ly extet it is been an hour and the students in this room are still fixated on this question of the mood i do not remember there being a whole lot of mood when it came to sex in college adnno maybe ougas all had candleat dormrooms but there is genuine panic behind that question it is dismissed in a workshop about sexual assault because ef course it is were tiking bout assault you are talking about the mood those are two separate conversations but these gas are trying to have just one conversation about everything e conversation that takes into account consent but busso all f their questions and anxieties when it comes to talking to a person their sleeping with it seems that is a conversation they have never had that is one of the hordest thins evers she chatit on find out how hoould giu sy fondal with the other personal this is nagib ganzalas a college freshmen in buffalo i known nagib from previous reporting he is lovely and every freshmen at his school he is been to a consentraining in the last year i fell if wergana lay the burden of changing the way we talk about sex at the feet of eighteen year old tpeople who are already many years into learning weird and bad and confusing information if that is our answer to reduce sexual assault i wanted to know more about what these guys acually know and where they learned it then talkabout women all the time they i just thought moton may alway talk to me about his favorite sex position or andn lod the fo to tell me their favour sexmentions and then we will just talk about oh that is cool that is ol i'll try out on wen der it thouht to men who are sleeping with women talking about what women two other men yet that is just it is more et well decide what women do what do not when you tak to women about what they yet loki is defily men talk to men about what woman that is how i flike that is howte even if you get told by women when she you will be ol i know that i lately nagib's biggest source of information is his roomate elija lesly he brought elija up a lot elija says he first learned about the person bes from his cousin then you get older than you see ukno sportilasreted than you see the playboys an you see the pornn than you see the girls gone wile than you see those lake the girls go wile t late commercials sulp that thee borna mornin girls go awhile tha i think i think that is whake when you start learning elja was not the first or the last person i interviewed who told me he learned about sex from corn nagib is learning how to engage with women from other men who are learning from porn that s learning chinese from a white american ind wyoming her missings some key primary source information every person i talk to who works on sexual assault prevention brought up one thing as particularly troubling about the way men learne about sex and it was not porn it was baseball that we talk about sex its paceball getting a home run as a metaphor for sex they said think of how many bad lessons are built into that metaphor you go first base second bas thir bas there is only one direction to move ind a home run is a wen not to mention you are on opposing team it is competitive and it is a sort that mostly only men play nagib gins alice is not attach to secs being baseball or born najib just wants to be a good person he wants to be good to people he is looking for some guidance nagib is always looking for guidance hes solicits advice often this is n't example i momer my cousin telling me heonly got a kiss a gos tin that gokisshe gos neg oum i got doly all the tim all mucco lozy inself that soten that is cotoway len nagib ever the careful sudent kissed necs every one of them another friend told them women it when you are funny he tries to be that but then naji about a girl friend who told everybody he was a bad kiss er an some one told them please stop kissing my neck she thought was gross and he felt waiht do i know things or doing not know things thatfinly when you younger you think of it more as rules an steps to get to yf lke to get lad all when you young inou think all it is i have to do this thap i have to follow this steps sh'll have to kiss her in this certain place than i have to make oer than i have to i on old touch her ot an o in no ga wul but er something if a and then finally we get hi but 's not that for is not that at all it is less it is very i is if vers is different from personal person i is he could be anything iton oit gos it gosve that not evy go something that you do evenothers different every one is different girls vry heople very what if that was the first thing you learned about sec what if instead of starting at eighteen years old with rate and moving backwards to teach consent what if you just started with people very because if you understand that consent follows you have to ask questions and talk about what you and do not otherwise you will never know hou may be with one of those neck people and you may not i tli for the rest of to day show we are going to leave sects behind and we are going to step forward from the beginning of life to the merky complicated middle the other facts of life that you really do not want to have to explain to children because you wish they were not facts or part of life at all our next tiry is from w commau bow he is a commedian on a father and recent we come outs then planning for a conversation he really does not one to have with his children one that is familiar to black parents everywhere in america act to if you see racism say racism here is come out i talk about race and races in my act a lot some

old name sammy my wife molicit is wife and sammy calls herself peana butter she noted to say much of anything et my wife and i have both put our toes or at least our older daughter sammy's toe in the race pool ot we have not even put the slightest hint of a sammytoe into the raccism pool yes those are separate pools the race pool is filled with positive stories of black achievement affrican american roll models books and teevy shows featuring tivirse characters our race pool even has quanza but sammy's racism pool is completely drained with tha lock on the gat and we run past it every day on the way to the race pool and every day that goes by i fill guilty the racism pool ish treacherous it is not fun to swim in when if you are not careful you drownd in the sorrow of the black experience in americdam we live in berkley people hade been protesting the police blocks from our house how do i explain that s this was on my mind recently how to teach sammy about racism when this thing happen it was january twenty six my birthday i was having a low key celebration just i hem i was carring a children's book i just bought for sammy the case for loving the fight for ineracial marriage mildred richard loving are the interacial couple responsible for the supreme court striking down the laws in sixteen states that band into racial marriage and if i was going to get into raism with sammy than the loving story which was about a family ours seemed a great place to start i was headed to meet up with my wife at the elmwit cafe a restaurant she loves this was her second time eating there that day after we would gone their earlier for breakfast it is not really my conplace slipbe to impress with itself alue two humble braggiy about its lates served in bowls i get to the el with cafe and i see my wife sitting at one of thei sidewalk tables with our baby and three other mobs and there babies the four moms all look they would go out for the sam cassing call for white woman mid thirties who was recently had a kid and while exhausted is doing a great job of keeping it together my wife introduced me to the group we made small talk one of the women asked about the book in my hand i turned it over and showed it to her she nodded at the cover i did not get thes sensie to the story that is what i heard knock knock knock it was on the cafe's window coming from inside i looked up and saw a woman a serve her who clearly worked at the elnmwit cafe she was angry and looking at me next she flicked her head and mouth something i did not know what but the message was clear git or maybe was sgram seriously what is the difference i was floded with thoughts i could barely process i was stunned i was hissed i wanted to run away i fellik i might pass out i was actally strangely em barrassed as if i had done something wrong maybe i shouldnt have been talking to my wife and her friends mlist and i might have exchanged words we might not have i think i said something the effect of a woman told me to get out o here there was some realies and a couple of whats within seconds another servat came out and pretended to do her job she did not have a water jug she did not bustny tables she did not drop or pick up any checks she just stock the area and by the area i mean me finally molissit could not take it this is my husband oh the waiter said looking at nobody in particular we thought you were selling something she thought i was selling something that is my wife and my daughter i said we just eight here earlier to day we thought you were selling something she said sorry in berkeley selling something is code for homeless whut she was saying was we thought you were homeless first wall i's wearing a knit cap a hoodie gans and sneakers i was just mark zuckeberg in winter but i knew the part of me to look homeless was not my clothes it was my skin specifically how my skin was getting close to a bunch of white mobs ind their white babies but you kno only looks white she is it ob late wach is again i'm srry me i bet you'r sorry oke i'm going to take a walk and think about racism that is acy what i said i did not yell it but i did not say tonto my chest e molissa stayed behind to give the watress a peace of her mind then we went home and milissa cried we hugged each other and were preoccupied with it really bothered really obsessive and stuck in it we knew we had to do something i blogged about the whole thing and posted a picture of myself wearing exactly what ihad worn when i was at the elmwood and also holding my book on the levings within a couple hours the storied spread around the bearia people on line started debating every single point people debated whether what happened was races whether or not i was racest people blame me for marrying a white woman it became the righteous indignation story of the week it is hard to know what to want after something this happens i did not wantan apology from the owner though we got one i did not want the waters to be fired though she was molis and i wanted something more substantial we wanted a public conversation between us and the cafe owner and the employes involved we wanted the community to show up and talk about their experiences with things ik this we wanted or re and we found out a lot of people wanted that many people wanted to discust the un with cafe that our idea to have a public discussion snowbald with our daughters in our mind before i could say rose of parks we had a venyou and an event planter the cafeowner was there and a full on panel of betted academics and activ there was a detailed i tenerary and a modery i'm sure tha i many of youv heard the story av the ges that det that happened on ganuary twenty six on a friday in march mlis and i sat on a stage at a middle school an a packed auditorium imy main concern was that somehowl the planning instructure was going a lead to an event that was careful sanatized and may be the worst thing boring it was not do in large part to two amazing women on the panel cedetia means whol get to an a minute but first micky jones o get but a mi professor voice nickey jones teaches at yeshe berk she said something that for me made sense of the world not just about the small rachal injustice that happening cafes but the bigger deadli ones tht are happening all around america she asked us the thing of the world in terms ot black space and white space credits eliza andersen for the theory but to night she made it her main point nikey says people have ideas about black spaces it is tied to blackness and poverty and the getto it is impossible to say there were getto in america without thinging about black people see a black man in a suit your brain does a calculuss what poor neighborhood did he or his parents rise up out of or his parents pante it all goes back to the geto i ain' gato we thought as beweeve to be carried on the body i on iniin black people i neperethen pescial do lemit when black people are in white space what is white space jest about everywhere else i she says you see berkley were she teaches white space lmost all education public and private white space movy theaters restaurants some of my own stand up shows i'm looking you spoke han white space public radio white space and of course the elm wil cafe iso win tes white spaces black people ihave a special burden an a face a number of delemma they have to pro that they belong there the burden is on that to prove that they belong in a particular space now let us go back to the incident who belongs in that space what is the presumption about what comma was carrying on his body bof course not belonging can work both rans a white person in a black space lickes a similar trustworth of us but think of how rare it is that a white person goes to a blass spae a tourst in another country you can leave when ever you chans an anbut the highland of the night high school senior cadisia means his eighteen a made a man

tha you oll to have to take a sthap outside of that and remember that people are individuals people have different lives just because i'm black does not mean i act other black people black people built this country wether you it ar not let lest please thank you nosi was impressed by ca meason i began to think about her dad the one ho taught her about fractions in race cadisios completely first in the evils of races but she was also idealistic about the future she understood how well intin the people co de raceos things but how they does not always make them bad people she got the broad strokes and the new ances ancadisia also knew how to do something that is absolutely essential to your surpy whatas a black person in american she saw and identified racism in her everyday life and she did not internalizeit but she also did not ignore it she is geto flip did not kept walkin i wanted some advison how to rade i kit that who was the dad i imagine him to be a makes of sixys er a burgly hippy and hopin change our old bama i do not smile atat som not the smiling black man yet that is scliff means he is a self escribe business man who means business i to imagine that his business car reads on one line cliff means and under that business in fact when we asked cliff to do the interview innishly said i do not know you i do not know your audience no when my producer robin and i met with cliffic adesia i knew he was still reluctant but i was not sure war to change his mind i had to ask why are you doing this interview then could easy really want me to do this is the bottom line now had i found i anything too horific about either one of you then it proby still would have been now but i could not find anything terrible wi take one thing at leaned in your favor i did read something written by you si fon do as much monework as i kid cause my answer wid wuld yeu know and your writing had made enough white people angry that sat o kay maybe he is actually trying to do something it is clear that cliff is not exactly a whiy cannot we just get a long type o gy and he has very clear thoughts about what should be taught the kids how old it was ced esy whn he first i explaining race to her i would imagine four or five years old she was an early talker we spent a ton of time together as i asked her to she wanted and her a speech for the mind at the king celebration tat her school and we co rote a speech that people were very enamored with and i explained to her that marn the king was not keeled five a dream speech but was yo start tombogan poor whites and poor blacks together than he had togo but my chosnot talhed you will be going to school and you you will be getting told that theres justice for all and then when you find that there 's not then you will be confused and i doft want my children confused almost the knowledgeable in it what age did you get into the the history of black people's country can have to cover things cresol writes movement jim crow and slavery things that at five i thought about slavery and i taught it as what it is that a europe went to war with west africa for centuries kid ust a love native americanswhen is ct tay fal back whi do bla pyo if fi bat what he did and were slaughtered and terrorized and tortured and murdered and rated i probably left out rate at that age for her captured kitnapped and brought over africans to america and they were here terrorized and murdered and we go from that stage all way to being here inslaved he taught her that it five cliff is clearly 't afraid to throw his kids into the deep end of the races in pool and let them learnd to swim this is pretty much the opposite what i had done far how deep did theire races in poull gid she learned things a white officers following the black migration too northern california to work in shiping yard and son account form ship yards had we better bring some race white cops here to keep these people aline she learned that there were een black cook's grinding at a glass in the kitchen to make sure that white races brutal slave masters and testins would believe hin be open an and he rebe gone was your question do you want the church thing brout at it it fine that is condesian i do not know what the church thing is but i could tell it was one of those family stories culd easy let my producer robin and i n on it after my dad told me about races that i distinctly remember li being angry with white people how dare you and slave my people im and we were at church one day and it was not actually at church it was a chur h function you was in the church it was a church function hailed after i guess i went up on to the pulpit and asked for the mike and i told the entire congregation that black people and white people should not be together an and that wit my senthesis af raceis an america and slavery that i ad come up with throughout the week after my dad told me about raceis saing you became a fiver out segregation as i did i did in my house we cannot have a five yoarold segregationis i mean non gou be wrong it be fun forbid in a kid say the dartest things kind of way i ran avergeon in what cadesia said in church by my whife mless as a hypothetical what would you do if sammy told you white people in bite people cannot be together it would be an immedia investigation llist would ask what makes you say that why do you think they cannot be together and yes wo came white people did hert your people but also mommy and dadyare together and that is good is not it it would be a conversation with me it would be a conversation with sammy every day all the time i ask cliff how he felt about cadesia speech at church o li well she learned what she learned as probay healthy reaction for having knows she learned this wee i think that das a little surpressed was there was there a white person her that you fell o if she thinks that about all lhike people that she is got to hate this one white person ois exualy a nice person i no absolutely not i'm i'm not concerned about the white man in america i think he is doineg very well and i had no concern or do i had now have any concern for any one feelings or whenever else being heard bou five gerow maybe start a conversation when the thiyk of think about some the things that thiyg enjoin that no one else in join this country know i really cliff cliff is not an easy person u then why should he be ease cliff is the type of person who keeps the rest of us a little more honest i want more cliff in my life cadesia told me that even with her candid unfiltered upbringing she could tell early on the difference between white oppression and the white people in her life but to be able to do that she had to learn about it and get angry i get that when i first began to really understand the violence of racism i was angry it makes sense to be angry the angr helps you pushed back against the injustis anger's not the gol it is the fuel even sometimes i feel i have too much anger there are black people in america die from racis thad treatment of a fancy coffee shop is the softest and easiest part of racis there were times during this whold thing i felt i choan just drop it cliff and i talked about that to being told the leave a cafan college avenue that is not a big deal on a bon a baseof level but i knew that you can jus keep letting your boudryg an pushed o no let anything go i do not let anything go do not shake my hand your black or something you shake my hand a white man you shake my hand shbut you do not relate to me do not let anything go i the message of the day that that is what i feel but i never put in those words those the words i was looking for do not letey think racism is real and happening right now every day that means that every day i have an opportunity to teach my daughters about racis this is to you sammyance i promise you fr now on i'm not going to let it go the stakes are too high de e you canal bow yes the host at united shade of america am fiana coming upa i a grown us who are not frumbling at all they have a plan and it includes costumes volcanoes and a talking stick that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programm continues it is this american life i'm acona joffywalt sitting in for ira glass to day show the birds and the bees we are listening in as grwn ups try to convey their most important deeply hol beliefs to small humans who cannot yet zip up their own jackets we started at the beginning where d you babies come from in this last part of the show where n i talk about the end act three about that farm up state jonathan gold sten has this last stray and a quick warning us at of the beginning of the show these are stories about grown ups talking with children about difficult subject matter if you have kids with you keep that in mind look at here is jonathan there is a house in sal city were kids come to have death explain to them not just that people die but how they die it is called the sharing place and the first person they meet there is jomac farling this is how she explains a heart attack ye are a heart stopped to working and could not live your blood through your body shis a quiverfull of kidsized explanations for all the ways that life can end kidney failure your kinneys are washing tmaschines for your blood and when your blood they stopp working in your bloods stirty than et poisons your body you die overdoses overdolis is when you have a sickness in your brain calld tha diction and a diction makes you take medicin that is not good foreelin you take away too much of it but not all medicines bad either ive you do with thit murder it is when somebody chooses to make your body stop working it is a choice we also do choice an not choice a murder is a choice cancer is not a choice we lso do contagious or not contagious the cou're not ghen to get my depression and you are not gen a gad my cancer the sharing place is a grief support centr for kids who have lost a family member it is one of hundreds of centers it around the country kids sit in support groups led by grown ups but the point is to allow children to talk to other children about their grief there encourage to speak in concrete language about death because the thinking goes that is how to process death's finality people do not pass away you do not lose them they die we invest much effort trying to shield kids from the scary things in life we place advisories before chievy shows that warn against tan appropriate language and subject matter and what could be less appropriate than death for all we led on bunnies lay egs your mother means well and life pretty much goes on for ever to do otherwise feels your breaking a basic pack that grown ups have with one another o we e who if your have di my dad an i dog to cad and my dd that is all the kids heare a more comfortable talking about death than most aduls are hayley who lost the sister and brother to mito condrial disease she and her other brother have the disease too but not as bad they have had to deal with something that most other people have not had to let alone other kids it is hard to talk about with the kids at school sometimes they dontwen oal wer talking abous cause the as e o all these words da nobody's heard no o the other cans heard about li a ner rlogical ersin lik o what does ot mean o afeeding to what does thot m tit is i a really hid to explain it is not hard explaine with its hartalike all them and they still do not not understand where it goes or what it does to help you but this is a place where kids do understand there are more than a dozen separate groups at the sharing place broken down by age the groups meet twice a month for about an hour and a half in a referbished house made to feel homy and safe it is visiting her grandmas there are rooms wor kids meet and talk and rooms were their parents do the same but most of the rooms are dedicated to play there is a costume room er kids can dress up police balerinas cowboys iinspite of me you to do what every ie ta your o do and beside it is a room called the soft room which is full of props and toys including an old telephone one little girl who watched her mother of a heart attack spends an entire playsession pretending to call for help higd nine one one she would say my grandma's dying hurry come quick then she would hang up and dial again hid nine one one my dad's dying hurry come quick one of the most popular rooms as a padded room called the volcano room ont ye it is full of cushions and large rubber yeogoballs it is even got an at old size doming and wrestle and punch the kids can scream yell pound the walls and throw things round they love her o o a o it is a release eve is nine years old and her father died about two years ago she knows that feeling of keeping it all bottled up in sie she says she can go days at school that it kind of feel them really overwhelming and it is you you would do not know what to do and on le ins ide it is hurting somehow an fe o feeling lik y hurt somehow where do would you say it hurts usually with meud hur in trot and kind of you my stomach it is em something that needs to come out but just i really needta learn how to do that i think there are people who in this world who can grow up and do not really know how to talk frankly about lots of things nancy ryser is one of the cofounders of the sharing place and this is what she says when children asked her how people die well close your eyes and listen and there is not the next preath does it hurt i do not think i do not think their face does not look at hur nancy's a therapist who works with young children for a long time the very concept that children do in fact grieve was hotly disputed froyd said that it was difficult for children to even conceive of such loss and does a culture nancy says that is pretty much the idea that we operate under oh look she is playing she is o key she did not really understand what happened well she is playing but thet half an hour later she is in the householding her teddy baran secong her thom and crying we need to let people know that children grief and hop them when they grieve it is not stuck in sided and comes out when they tried to have a relationship later when they start to get intimate whe they cannot bear it and they go off and they do not know why nancy says children just grieve differently than adulfs especially little children they grievan fits and starts they cannot focass on it for very long and grief is more physical for them thel lacked out their anger maybe kick a door which is the reason for the volcano room at the sharing place they might also regresk suddenly using baby talk or sucking their thumbs and if their potty trained they might become untrained they are also magical thingers i heard stories of kids who were afraid to go to sleep because grandma went to sleep and did not wake up one little boy wandered away from his mam at the emergency room saying i'm looking for dad we left him here last time another boy said he just wanted to die for a few days swe can go to heaven and teach his little sister had a right a tricical children also regrieve that is with every new stage of development they experience their grief anew and with every mile stone when the braces come off when they get their drivers license when they graduate they will inevitably think i wish my mam was here and given all of this the thought behind the sharing place andother senters it is that kids can help one another in a way that adults perhaps cannot help them that is why they are brought together in these groups in short kid speak the same language aiturn on llein before their session at the sharing place i sit down with gaven whos sexs and his brother aden who is ate the're both dressed and matching long sleeve polofs shirts gavan sits on his mother nac cole's lap aden sits beside them u't you you want to introintroduce yours i im in ain im my dead di thice as i su say id his little brother gavan points his finger to his head and pulls the pretend trigger he snaps his head back ye that is a apen wer hhe shot i had an then we did not know he was ded i mam we did not an en thenit wa got dad no you did not thim mummy found him and yes aready he was aredhy dead de you turn over i did not cut him o ka she knew he was ar bake ded because she saw blood an things i on is him yeh e ad he was terrific die nice generous you would always help any one he 's a terrific die what would what did you learn here that helped you the most to understand how he died sometimes that task telling the kids that their parent committed suicide false te jill mac farlang because the sur viving parents eir guardian might be inside their own grief that they cannot bring themselves to do it jill explain suicide as simply as she does other kinds of death there is ha sickness in your brain called depression she says and it can make you decide to make your own body stop working she says it is required that the kids know how their brother or sister or mother died before starting the group why had one can wy say he died im because he was sick when family thaid that he died in a car accident one family said that he accidentilly shot himself he did not mean to it was jill who helpd their mam break the news to aiden and gaven that their dead shot himself she says that conversation was especially hard the boys immediatly sad you do not you do not know my dat why would you say that you do not know ess we the i know i do not know you and but your momps here to dacea she needs she needed my help in telling this cause is the really hard and scaverything that happened and and you'r mon't told me that that is what happened and aden just was your crazy lady there is no way that work in a talk about this this is not what happened it wis horrible and was awful and i crid that whole night i just it was just awful i just felt horrible and my husband as you cannot do thas you have to go to the director and tell her that you cannot do this again suicide is always one of the highest if not the highest cause of death for sharin place families in any given time thi's actually e special group devoted specifically to suicide and a lot of the stories you hear in that group are horrible that you cannot help it wonder why tell the kids what happened at all why not to say they died and livt at that according to jile and her colleagues we need to tell children they will not find out later in life and wonder what else did they lie in about they also do not want to have to cloak it in a way that suggests it is unspeakable and shameful they get enough of that idea at school this is eve again whise father also shot himself wit some people at school they say this makes me feel rearly said to they say the em why nam somebody kills themselves that means they go to the wrong place i do not believe that but it just makes me feel ray said when they say that instead of going to a happy place theyud go to sat even even if you even if you do not believe n it is nonsense it is lok an a hurts suctlmen would say that yet it does causim lyke it is somebody jadging om the judging my papa which s not a bad thing a lot people do that but jus kandi feels a little weird on the inside it makes me yee i'm gein to scream him he is something that wat what of the things that you wish that people would say probably it is cay tadam that has happened in them e we can help you with them feeling better andam understanding ou that is cally something i want somebody to say once a child knows how their loved one died there encouraged to say it out loud there is a kind of sorcery to it naming the dragon you can defeat it i sat in on the suicide roup which is different in the other groups an that kids tend to come to meetings for a longer period of time pardly because they did not get to say good bie the kid sit in a circle at the beginning of the meeting and hand around a talking stick one by one they say their name who died and how they died y na is he lie and the person e died bes my dead and he he did bi shooting hin hiself with thi gan and hem and he wanted el my name is wensee my da die he ti by a suiside and ire ba bot seeing him caus i hadn' seen him for a couple of months before his death there is also a different question they respond to each time they meet what you miss most about the person is there anything you do not mess to night's question is what you regret my thame is e en an the person who died is my dave he dard by shooting is from the head and kno for have any regr h cannot re memer it can take a long time for them to get to this point where they can say the word suicide the sharing place never corrects any of the kids or forces them to say anything they do not want to but they notice when a child is finally able to say it the night i was there aden the nine year old i talk to who had a hard time saying the words suicide was finally able to say it in gruve abeden the volunteer sat around and talked about it afterwards it was hard for him i could tell he was not about to say it but he said it and i was proud of him but it took him probably at least a minute to actually get those words out is momawhos o kisa su henasn' coaching no no you on the other hand aden's brother gaven the six year old talks about his dad she wasside incessantly he also draws guns during playtime and even sculps them at of platot this is jole mac farlane again he tells everybody at schol my dadshot his brains and it frakes everybody out and then he gets in trouble at school which then he was ike us i cannot ever talk about my dat but this is how canni gartners talk and pross has thinks it is just easy for them to talk about but it is scares other people bisit o kid for kids other kids in ther class to hear their cwill ya i but i mean i but is i right answer to that i do not know i do not know either if i were a parent i'm not sure i'd want my kid hearing that kind of thing at school and while jill does not have an answer she does think kids being allowed to express themselves is much healthier than sending them a message that it is wrong to say this kind of stuff out loud and that is got to be a step in the right direction i have very very very fond memories of this place i actually tried to come through the side door cause ha was the door that i always came in through that i was i can use the adult entrance finally hesarah mohammed has not been to the sharing place for a full six years she is twenty one now but when she was eleven her older brother hanged themselve even though he was supposed to be baby sitting her her parents had told her to keep an eye out on him because of his past suicide attempt obviously what happened was in her fault but she blamed herself which is something i heard other kids here talk about too it is easy for an adult to say do not be silly it is not your fault but it is a whole other thing to talk with tha kid at the sharing place who says i know exactly what you talking about it was it was kind of ni seing the older kids whos he do not loved ones had been gone fir a few years how they were able to go to school normally and an just live theire normal lifes cause i just did not want to go to school i did not want to be with kids yho just id don it was just it was too hart i asked sara if there was a turning point a moment when she began to feel maybe she was doing a little better she said yes she was in the court yard with a bunch of other kids we were just out theire painting rocks or something for a funrazer and and we were just talking just talking normal and i reallis that i had not how to conversation that and about a year just where where i felt under prersent free and just laughing and not feeling guilty about laughing and just happy n that was yet ii was really the first time in and in a good nine months after my brother had passed that i illt oket it is the kids themselves who decide when the ready to stop coming to the sharing place but on average they stay about to ears when they are ready to leave they have to announce their intention two times and grew before their final good bye any view that would to say something toan which i'm sure several of you will the good bye is ceremonial and on the last night i was there at the end of the meeting they said good bye to a kidname robby he sat in the circle with the other kids and volunteers and anybody who wanted to could pick up the talking stick and say a few words his friend jessico was the last kid to do am i'll that flay miss you because you one of my best friends in this group and oll me seeing you an or major fight that we had in the volcano room it was not my fault nyif you did no am it will just really fun and i'm gin a miss seeing you in missinging out with you at robby's last meeting there was a kid who just shown up it was his first meeting ye had long bangs hanging over his yyes and except for his name did not say anything the whole time whenever new person joins the veteran kids have a chance to gage their own progresst to remember what they were when they first showed up and think about how bad it used to be and how now it is not as bad and ultimately robby they will make way for someone on the long waiting list a list on which new names are added all the time they will say i think it is time to go and then they'l say it again tojohnathan goldstean

a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in todays episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websit this american life dot a work one of things i's happening right now around the world is that you have all these couples happy ones struggling couples cuples in that kind of you nothing sem oke but i do not know haze tens of millions of couples confined for weeks now the relationships being remoulded by the lock down it is an accelerator it is a relationship accelerator it it it rearranges the priority and chos the superfluous overboard in a very slarifying way for many of thes wone din what is happening with couples i reached act to estere paral whis couples therapist if you have heard of her she is bubby best known for this idea from her book mading in captivity thet takes it hall on couples and kills passion when theres not enough distance betwee the partners they turned to each other for everything for friendship and the sense of identity and comfort and everything a whole village is to provide a person it is very ware that under lock down people are witerally turning to the partners for everything these days she sing a ful schedul of couples more than she usually does interestingly she says is is an unusually good moment for therapy ut t lock down lots of clints r opening up pinging out things in ways that do not mormy it' some of the men in the couples it is for the first tand they actually doing ther it is exciting pro basingly because they stop they slow down their home and in thertheyr they this blossoming o opening othing well three doot three men and a it is just exit i dofonly get off the fon because it is very moving from most or the couples that your seeing what is your sense has the lock down been good for them prepared for them soo it is as such an interesting ting to say an really both really bo that con't say one or the other couples struggling the moustar pretty much exactly the one shou'd expat people who even before all this were quick to pick at their partners and criticize them and argue over whose sacrificing most for whom but also then this mondin one our lives a been profoundly diserrupted another group doing badly people who they have lost some one or they have some one whos sick or they are they are anxious they are worried and basically their partner is unable to have an emphatic response what are you worryd tabout it is nite that there is nothing and people tell you yu know my partner is the last person i'm turning to for anything i'm feeling wit now it is i have nowhere to go wit this to just cand of be able to be upset or scared or this constant sense of lost just os the low the world they have known theyr ownt identity ther work all of that the extreme circumstances are also driving people to repriour tie the stare seen couples split up anothers move in together and but if i most fascinating ro reversals she is cauding one couple where one of the partners was always seen as the insecure one she would struggled through a dramatic childhood its agreed between the two with them that she was the troupled one who wend in her stronger mor together partner but now it the degly virus everywhere she found that her difficult childhood gave her all kinds of coping he managing skills she is bitly i have known cares you wuld mean this crisis i know what to do i knew what we will be for anybody around me i was in tht supermarket i ven le to go to self for the poncs of my girl frend who one who is not even here because i knew that they would meed is and i just said now the world is clear to me i knobody needs for me and in this particular relationship it is the women and it was ha very interesting thing representi tato i do not think that side of her had ever been known it had always been described as you the one with the issues because you come from this very tromatic background she became the functional one in the relation ship it wase a whole different way of being that it was also a revelation to herselvs this turned everything around suddenly she was not seeking her partners approval all the time she did not needet which of course is healthy and grat except for the partner who was used to being the strong one i it is one thing the wish of the person you with is more sertiv unless needy wout dou yo when you get that wis he made her uncomfortable and wet is puite out did not surprise to stare oh when when i when iam not comfortable with some one who is emancipating wiht next to me i basically trie to make them doubt themselves again because if they down themselves into they not sure than they come to me that is what she was doing yes in thin all kinds of very such a ways of course i this is not flagrant she would say things to encourage her formerly dependent partner the second gass herself tho dout herself things ie it is interesting that you wanted do that i do not you did not really that that was not what yhou wanted to do or you you mean yo wante mentione to me that at that you do not want to bring you momp you do not wanted cor your father wittle dae sets a bit of mind which just gentle mind wi you do not mean do you doou it looks it is a very rational conversation with other couples is their proucess being on mock down as forcing thin to confront things that they'ad been avoiding met whenever actually stop to figure out the couple this on her podcast she has a sho called were should we began we she record their presessions with real couples who volunteere to do the s ynonymously on a

for him to marry his dad went around talk too their parents and he found parida a biology student with brown eyes and a kind face obtor roman and parida talked on weechat thats the mean social media platform in china they could not say much because they knew the government monitor calls to foreig numbers the conversation with stilted but they got a sense for each other and they decided to get

air port says hey i'm weaker too he gives them a police escort back home lights flashing it is a movy not too long after aobe roman and parida had a son they named him obde lizese after his grandfather and obde liese becomes sis dads minnyme everything abde roman did obde lizese would follow from the way he stood to his table manners i must age las ieso he ats e ga en n that drav n ho as e oto sat rond ot me and the gri itwas me this was in a parking lap obde roman was teaching parida had a drive and eighteen month old ab de lizese would sit on his dad's lap and grabed the stickshift he' throw fost if he could not at to telittle aser te cur e o oo o onmon one is e try to copy o i sd but obde roman's relationship with pardas family was rocky right from the start aobde roman his religious but her family a secular and pretty wealthy but the hart of the problem was that parida's parents felt she was wasting her education in turkey she had a degree but she was not using it she wanted to stay home with their son when abde lizese was born parida's parents started asking her to come back to shing joung for a long visit may be even to leave ob de lizes with them for a while in weaker familise it is reely common for grantparents to take care of the grantkits for their first five years of life while the parents work the praster from back home got realy in tents but obde roman and parida were hesitant to leave turkey for starters abde roman could not go with her toshing john tbecause he was sure he would be arrested if he returned to china and by this point it was twenty fifteen they would been hearing whispers about at its surveillance thot weagers being detained in ching johng the do not kno exactly was happening but they know wit is not good yofs a bo i as on my wive what you sayslonte is in a be can try but i do not see to gothalod it than tha i have fre do not be but to come back again because of e stritotratnthat theron sho sat that no i prisa reaty the want of trouble parida's parents kept hen sisting that it was safe at least for them they were loyal to the party and they had high level government contacts they are not religious if obde lizese was with them they sat it would be opay they were pushing but obde roman and parida kept saing no woa fee months later abde roman was walking by a pretzil shop in his neighbourhood when the police stopped him and asked for his residence he papers his parmit had lapsed he would applied for a new one but it had not arrived yet they arrested him took him to a detention senner this happens to a fair number of weakers in turkey te'll be detained for a paper work isshue and they' gat stock for a while in obde roman's case he was locked up for three months allowed just one phone call home every week parida meanwhile was home alone with their todler and pragnant close to her due date when obde roman finally got out his whole world had changed his wife had given birth to their second child a girl and his son abde lizese was gone he was in china parida's mother had come for a visit and arranged for the trip back obtor roman felt trick he did not even get to say good by it is his inlaws waited until he could not interfere and then sent his kit away he says he never would have let apdolizes go to china aaers osation y ia wr a a e os that was to look it is o the foes ook i only waysedi los bu the than he aoor f a si as she was also on the pesus ot sho on o i should tat me and on thers oter fan fin o i was wenl to make it easy for her perida said she wanted to go back with the baby just for a short trip make her parents happy then she would come back without dulizes optor roman was not crazy about the idea but he agreed drove them to the airport it was hard frooting but the i fou that could not doansing us and they flew away to go to a place for only fragments of information never make it out the plan was that pereda would contact at do romin on we chat once they would arrived and felt it was safe but he did not hure from them he called her parents again and again they never picked that he is started to panic but tdis is not entirely abnormal because of how difficult it is for weekers to communicate with their families in ching don he ws hoping that that was all it was after two months at this he says a distant relative who is visiting his temple on business contacted him and said let us hat lunch they met he had news it was not good police arrested perida as soon as she and the baby arrived in china she was interrogated and beatin the cousin sat she was in prison serving a ten years sentence he thought it was because she lived in turkey human writes observers say they have seen several cases where weakers and ching johng have been punished for communicating with people in turkey or other predominantly mosone countries it is not a legal persat but it can get ouen trouble with the government justs te e egienter just the en te lat you burn inside in something as etiin sid it is eating i fron the inside the an because eatabot n ain but becan tos as is clommin sosopokin co gu oen their children are with their grand parents his inloss at least their safe but he cannot get his wife out of prisen he cannot even call home or try to get more information without endangering his family be cause he is living in turkey any one in chin johng who gets a call from him could immediately get flagged by the government they could be interrogated or even sent to a reeducation camp and his family knows this by this point most of them have deleated him from their contacts he waits there is nothing he can do he tarts putting on wait he sleeps late hes stock b for everything he is gone through obte romans still reany young he is thirty i've known him for about six months now and he does things all the time that remind me that he is a dad he never got to be adad he always springs food when we meet an chers his snaks steeme to buns with lam iin a spicy fin airors us once after an interview we ran in to his friend with her kid at a weaker run cafat i'll never forget the look on his face while he tossed the toddler up and down in front of the delly cases this pure uncomplicated joy but when i ask him how he feels about all this he is told me men do not have feelings which obvious lay is not true back in december of twenty eighteen when obde roman was living in a stample hearing nothing from his family things in ching john were getting worse mornmore weakers for sent to re education senters and later required to do lowwage factory work human writes observers say this campagn imprisoned about ten per sent if we ger adolts in ching jon but oder roman had no idea what was happening to his family that is when tiktok came into his life a friend showed it to him he was you have got to see this yawee to bewat the eys an te hes sat i just ta fon i redy i a a man i know from my home ton i ask ye how howdy thato fin people ho that i wo he ton me a you can wrike the name of your ton obder roman cannot write in manderin his friend types out the name of his home town for him it is called ox to it is an agricultural senter in the west hogging the mountains that form the border between china kirgistan and cossackston suddenly hundreds of yusers ore popping up on his scren he goes through vidio after vidio he sees all of these places that he recognizes the woods and the rivers and the familys hanging out in front of their houses and he can tell things have definitely changed the cotton fields look this same the houses are familiar but to obder roman oxwo looks a city under occupation wat i s an at te u can gan on is one since wehat the edeiss a chines i on that an in ter reos er e looks lik a heay momen is en bat lat teeo shon is bo an tha chines i in thaweer house er only womanes a house and that i ther lady ain my monsate i hich is a cinese man fos try to tance as ha thak on mos forsing hat o dance and tha trite the hack her and that the chines gise a looks haky and tas e at a e omting but bat thets for in ober to dation is a a take i i can see the lady shes he can thas anything against it batsh on fon o dance as agi in another vidio something else seems of it is a group of people clearing icesoff of an irrigation detch with picks and shovels it is winter you can tell by the trees in the coats their wearing yes a on be letnl issons obder roman knows this ditge it is just a few minutes from his family's house and to him it is clear theire being forced to work we never clear ice from the ditch until spring time he tells me there is no need it just freess over again this watching does not seeme to be good or oub to romin but he cannot stop to talk his this tiny flashlight into the big black box that ching johng has peak om for a week he stayed in his apartment just searching would he was really hoping for was to see some one he recognized and he traces of his kids his wife's parents his parents he had not been able to speak to them for several years at this poin he watched at the kitchen table watched on the couch at night he would lie awake squirrling on january forest twenty nineten he was in bed and usual squirling through ticktop 's a roun to a yam an obder roman sees this fitdio 's a little boy with big cheeks expressive eyes he is in a school answer in questions and mander and chinese from a teacher off camera behind him hid surmilling about in winter cons d h e have tis er ajac it win ther der the teacher asks the kit a bunch of questions what is the name of the father land the peoples re public of china what is on the father land's flag five stars on a red flag where is er water bottle water bottle is here where do we put the food we cannot finish in the trash obder roman does not speak manderen but there is one word that stands out to him obdulizese what is your name the teacher asks and called out do lizzes he says how old are you and for that is how old obder roman son should be now the vidio wis just fifteen seconds long one of a hundred that his watched that dak and he cannot be sure it is his son out dulizes but obder roman simultaneously gets this rush of love believing that it is his son and this intense fear that trealy ham because his kids are supposed to be living with their grand parents while he figures out away to get them home and it looks they arnt let tat te the the mon the a ise that canfeted that camp fortruen getting this cloen it looks obdelizeas is in a bording school one of the ones set up by the chinese government to take care of about five hundred thousand kids thany if his parents have been detained in reeducation camps inthe except for short visits home the kids are generally kept away from their family tot manderan not weaker an belonly ge canegega e thas r w yes i feel that my son is becomis more chinese every day o ben en de ween tha of thais tozy tas evedo i becan morry about o future ta hoserasham e tats im and the make him and enemy of wegerin the future specially and make him enemy of people me that seems to be exactly the point of these schools they place these kids in a setting where the removed from their families their language their religion their weaker ness as one internal government document claims the goal of this crackdown is to quot break their lineage brick their ruts break their connections and break their origeons the government is their family now tan who b bare from this moment when obder roman saw his son in this vidio all he onted was to getting back he was consumed by it i should say there are lots of parents around the world in thi same situation in the past year r i've personally spoken to nine of them in three different countries only one was able to get her sn out of china thanks to an influential family member and a turkish passport still obder roman was convinced that he ta guy who does not spea commander and does not have political connections cannot even call home he was going to get a son back reported dery buscaran coming out abdr romin uses everything he has to get his family back that is in a minute cicago pup a gradio when our programme continues this mari an ly from our glass today's programme black box sure is of people who do not have the information they need and want trying to fegrat what is going on and what they should do next we now continue with act one of our shel and for the brak may be heard obderomantoty thought that he spotted his four year old son on a tiktoc vidio decided set out on a mission to retreve him and the rest of his family theportederybu scaran picks up withob de romin' story the first thing he did was he went to the press made a public this was risky because his family was still in china his interviews were published all over the world in turkish english portuguese he was on the bby c and in the new york times wer teo tin tin gen le inmediatention la sitin tens igan tis cor was that make me onthat makes me have mor holl and trust or the the sint ocat to something maybe happen but then i find that te si cill not happen toceanke lonish a clon iton on this with each of these interviews it felt he was screaming into the void trying to get china in the world to look at him and the response silence he was no closer to getting his family back than he was when they left he tried more official routs he went to the chinese embassy nothing asked the churkish government for help wrote to the united nations he once told me about this plan to move to candida as a refugy tecause he thought the government there would half more leverage mind you that would take years to come to ferwition but he truly believes that one day his family will be together again he has these pictures on his foum because there is no portrait of his family he is made some using passport photos of him in parida a baby picture he has of his daughter and his greenshot of that vido of abdulas ease there photo shopped on to backgrounds the catheodral of no trdam in paris cherry blossoms in japan why do you do that can you tell me about that me te you the in ha bon te ge through the it is because we are a family he tells me last summer obde romon had some lot he was scrolling through we chat and he found a child hood friend he says they hatched a plan to buy a plain ticket for her to go back to their home town get eyes on the ground but of course even when she made it all the way there and was sending him vidios of their old neighborhood she still could not spek directly to what she was actually seen the significance of it everything's find she told him everything's new and better as she panned the camera around the empty streets obde romond was kicked off we chat we do not have the actual vitios and we were not able to reach his friend without risking her safety but he says the way she spoke was supercasual to avoid drawing attention the biting is a not hany more ton gus uprise a they had been new test onser if you come here i by foud for you an th ti tis i te doking a ans tan thatas ei as not lisi bes apris a cey may be ot they have chance on me there she drove to the street his parents left on theye were a lot of check points eventually she got there and found an empty lat his family's house in the city had been demolished they have another halm a farm they could have moved there but this is the point when obde romon started to worry that his parents had been taken to he had not been able to speak to them in four years every time he gets more information it is this the more he learns the worst things seen obde romons toll watch his ticktok it is a nervous habit when he is bored and hes tired an interviews when it takes too long for interpreter to translate a question he will sort of lean bak and polisphone out from under the table eventually in january of this yere the ap shook loose another piece of information an old acquaintance wrote to him through tictox direct message ind function the messages start off non chalantly enough hih how are you rother obde romond asked him if he is seen his parents lightly how are they doing the friend did not have any information about his son or his wife but e coul tell obde romon that his family in oxo is gone theyre not staying at their farm he had hoped his elderly father his mother who is cancer he gives them name after name there gone theyre gone too and obde romon cannot even be sure what this means they could have been forced off their land but living elsewhere ey could be detained into re education senter they could be in prison from thousands of miles away it is almost impossible to find out as he telling me this it is the day after he got these messages and obde romon is getting really worked

it is no different he says they have killed my soul i have nothing to live for any more we later called the local police station in his home town and confirmed that no one is at his familyes address even though thirteen people used to live there they knew that ob de romond was looking for his family and put a weaker speaker on the line to talk to him maybe they have left maybe they did something wrong the speaker said but she refused to say if they were accused of a crime two days after he gets the news about his family he found something new to fix it on the mayor of this stamble he thought that if he could convince this sky to help him he might be able to put in a word to turkish deplomats who elp people the tained oversees the mayor was scedul to speak at in afternoon event ia dinner in honor of the different cultures of the turkic world the turks that oos backs in the weakers i met up with him to go there he is brought backs if weaker breads and fried noodles for the event hecause an ack tiv is told him it might help him get a chance to meet with the mayor face to face the chances of this resulting in anything are sim honestly it is a hale mary but as down as ob de romon was the day before he is op now buzzing with excitement in the car on the way olfars a onisi a lonis a a meaeti onis p is o onser i'm going there is a human being and asking them to do their duty as he humans gang he tells me the event is happening outside and usium under a big tent i do romon pulls his bags of flood out of the car and we wait for the mayor a few minutes turns into a few hours he falls back into his phone flipping through tiktoc that he as usual he looks tired finally justise the programme is about to began the mayor sweeps in with body guards in town he is introduced ushered on to the stage and he speaks for about fifteen minutes i o e on there thi sasin tare ain in ier n i oasen a a aar i and then the mayor moves to me ab do romond realizes that this is his chance he needs to go now but a group of admirers to sens on the mayor shaking his hand giving him gifts i'm do romond waits on the edge hanging back and till he sees an opening and makes his move on i stand back with our interpreter to watch an ein one on e te oin on the wine gring wetter in a sein n inesens n s terin o s ins es s on ins i disappears into the crowd and justice the mayor is leaving the ten he is able to wiggle through to get close enough to greet him they shake hands it is just enough time to say holow not to explain a story or to ask for help to findest son ands the mayor moves on it is thie same as every other time he is reached out to the turkish government for help nothing changes we sant request for comment to china's ministry of foreign affairs ministry of public security and ministry of education asking for information about obder roman's family no response we tried the office of the vice president of the ching jon atonomous regon and the local propagand a department in that case some one did pick up told us their facts machine was broken and that no other facts machines were available we summerized the questions over the fon the person on the other end called at cheer nonsense and told us to go on line and read the news the chinese embassy an washington d se basicly said the same thing i asked for information on obder roman's family and on these cases in general the responded with a list of view toob lanks bidios posted by china state metia service defending the reeducation camp programm and claiming that people who say their families have been imprisoned are lying i would suggest wo check some of the rumors being exposed they wrote thanks for reaching out to the embassy we also cannot reach parida we confirmed as many details as we could about parida and obde roman's life together with a friend of theirs it took more than a year before obde roman finaly saw a small glimmer of success weirdly it was the pandemic that did it this winter news of the coron of iris outbreak in wouhan started to filter out of china the vidios obde roman started to see on tiktock were of empty streets people stuck at home without much to eat some would set their vidios to music pulled from somby movies obde roman began to worry about ching john social distancing is happening there but the weakers in prison do not have that option would the gined tan the on congines obaty get the in feca mons s e prison esor somebodyin cam than all oson be infected an one and it is not just the people in prison people detained and reeducation senters can also get infacted ere the kids who have been separated from their parents and placed in government's schools this winter a group of parents in estamble started planning a trip to the chinese embassy to show up in person and demand access to their children before anything was finalized the parents started to get fon calls from the consolate obde roman got one too anan o yo

designd to placate heep him quiet he knows this but obtor romin insists that even if it is not trim it still good news wit this fone call means to him is that now some one in the government has finally acknowledged his jumping and screaming and waving his hands some one somewhere might actually be responding oman belon usis is good good news bout antu i see them directly a fat forther teir

i mustup a for mes tha good news it gives me hope obdor romin has renewed hope that they will be together again because this time after four years of trying to find his family the black box has spoken back but even this tiny victory is short live a monthlater obdor roman calls me from the road he is driving balancing the phone on the steering well o we g he says a contact from tektok his been sending him information about oxo wrote to him to tell him that local government officials went on the village lowed speaker to make a public announcement saying any one with information about the totey family ob der roman's family is forbidden to share it ate ish cey gan in shap was call i sro asy tre o do look we are not iven in twenty first century and tef people lose heir ces or their dogs sa hav right to look for them in my case of course i have right to get information about my family as a fazer as a son but ther are even forbitting me to get any information about my family members his fear is that the are going to disappear there would be no charges no prisen sentence no anticipated date of their release no communication with the outside world and he will never know what became of them and what frestrates him is that right now people he knows or starting to hear news of what is happening to their families but they have moved out of re education senters and into low wage factory work or formal prison sentences they aregetting answers but obtor romin still knows nothing for years he is been fighting for information he may never get it dury buscaran in his temple w s

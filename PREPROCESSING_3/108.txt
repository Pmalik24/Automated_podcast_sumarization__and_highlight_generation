the sunday times reports that four women have accused russell brand of rape or sexual assault and he comes out swinging jobidon's favorite union shuts down to troit and the emmigration crisis continues to grow i benshkur of the sis the venshpuro sho benchkiroshosponser expressv pian protect or all myn privacy to day express be piansi coms lasban the news that has engulfed much of the legacy medias engulf to the british media for sure a lot of media here in the united states is this massive exposa supposed expose from the sunday times in the uk accusing russell brand a person i consider a friend of rape sexual assault and abuse from period two thousand six to two thousand thirteen now i did' know russelbrand at that time i gus if ihad known russell branda would not rusell at that time considering that russell bran by his own admission in all of his writings and in all of his statements has basically admitted to being a sect attict and incredibly promiscuous and a person whi would be considered to have engaged in incredibly vile behavior during that entire period and then russellbrand has remade himself and in the period wrive known russell which is realy the pas thre or for years russell has been a person who is searching for something meaningful he is settled down ovisy he is married yes kids he is a person who is been trying to put together a good life now can i attest to russel bran's character from two thousand sixty to thousand t thirteen i again i cannot i did not know him at that point do i think that russell bran today is a good person yes i think that russelbran today is a good person now is a possible that you'r mistaken about people you think sure that is possible to but here is my problem with this particular attack on russell brand from the media my promise the timeman during the time that russelbran was pretty flagrantly and obviously not only promiscuous but incredibly vile in the sorts of things that he said publicly about sex aabout women and all the rest of the sort of suff the media work championing him he was a hero of the left at this time when he was engaged in this sort of behavior he was he was treated as some sort of person to emuly at this time he was not only on b besis on m t v who is being treated as a public celebrity while he was engaging this sort of behavior he was the impish devil who is who is having sex of as many women as whomly possible in doing inten mastrugs now ten years later will russell bran has fixed his life in is trying to make a better life for himself now he gets it with a full scale sunday times expose about all of these women now were gog to go through some of the alligations with which russell has been hit hor russell has denied all f the alligations and again in every situation are tigue about a ten year fifteen twenty year ago situation it is at he said she said theresjis no wa to verify one way or the other whether somebody is telling the truth or whether they are not absent some sort of d an a evidence and even d'ana evidence isn'g in a fully explain what exactly happend if a man in a women are in a room together because consent or non consends is a matter of behavior in the moment itis not something can be evidence by physical evidence typically must youre talking about god forbid some sort of ful an murous reep or something in this particular gis were you haves hy bunch of stories were women se jastad the time then were not happy or ther woen't happy afterward there is one allegation particular that teems pretty seriously the russell has said that he is going to addrass before i get to the actual allegations the time ine here t is that russell whens un his swin and he put out e pretty lenth he steepemen talking about what he sar coming because apparently but the sunday times in channel for were going around and fane dozens of women to talk to ander it was pretty clear to him that they were going to wanch the story at him hereit is what russell had to see just before the story launched hala there you awakening onders now this is not the usual type of vidio we make on this channel where we critique attack and undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story i am the news i've received too extremely dissturbing letters or a letter and an emou one from a mainstry medio t ve company one from a newspaper listing a litany of extremely agregious and aggressive attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuffs er my communifestivales should be storp that i should not be a borter attack mainstry media narratives on this channel but amidst this litany of astonishing rather berock attacks are some very serious alligations that i absolutely refute these allegations pertained to the time when i was working in the manstrum when i was in the newspapers all the time when i e was in the movies n as i've written about extensively in my books i was very very promiscous now during that time of promiscuity the relationships i had were absolutely always consential i was always transparent about that then almost too transparent and on being transparent about it now as well and to see that transparency matastesized into something criminal that i absolutely deny makes me question is there another a genderat play particularly when we have seen cold and medior attacks before with jo rogan when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstry meded in approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language i'm aware that you guises have been saying in the comments for a while watch out russell there coming for you yo again too close the truth russell bran did not kill himself i know that year ago there was a spate of arcles rusell brans of conspiracy feris russell bran's ri wing i'm aware of news medium making phone cal sending letters that people i know for ages and ages it is being clear to me or at least it feels to me tike there is a serious and concerted a gender to control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices and i'm in my voice along withial voice i do not mind them using my books and my stand up to talk about my promiscuous consensial conduct in the past why seriously refu are these very very serious criminal alligations also is worave mentioning that there are witnesces whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these too mainstry medio outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems the me to be a co ordernight it attack now ought i wene to gan for thif any fiout because of the theoriost night a al theatigation buti feel on being attack and plainly thatt working very clively tigthaso is he right about the timing is you rght about the timing that is one of the questions here obviously because again all of these alligations some of them are not criminal some of them are very very criminal and there is no stature of limitations on raper sexual assault in the united kingdom or pretty much anywhere else in wes which means that theoretically the police could still bring charges against him if in fact the alligations aur true or if there is proof of the alligations but the real question here that i have again 'll get to the alligations themselves in just one second the real question i have here is why the sudden interest by the media in all these stories now meaning all these stories been floating around for fifteen ten years over a deckat and only now do they see fit tactually track down all te women who slept with russell brand and try to find some who will make alligations or who believe that that they were victims of rape or sexual assault fror mussele bran and all i can imagine yere is that russell bran crossed a particular political line that if yeu'd still ben on the right side of the line he media definitely would not have been going after him because you have to you dut lorn abot the motivations what exactly changed in the same way that nothing changed about jo rogan from point aihe to point be except his political viewpoint in the same way that nothing changed really about donal trum between point aht and point be except his political viewpoint in the same way that nothing has changed here about russell bran from point eightopoint be accept his political viewpoint you wonder about the timing when he was engaged in all this behavior when it oud hav been most plausible that he engaged in the sort o behaviour alleged the med you are not only uninterested they were paying him ten years later when rusell has e'sn't by the way not a right winger when russell is just ecided that he is not in favorabae lot of sor left winged narratives ranging from covid to to wokeness when that happens suddenly you have a coordinated attack a coordinated investigatiom to the sunday times and the and the taleman and the channel for news in britton i find the timing at least somewhat suspicionu say somewhot i mean a lot suspicions will get to the allegations in just moment because some of them agait our pretty question will on their faces one allegation particulaats very serious and then there some thetr prett questionwile on their face

con slashban o cas the actual alligations here now there there' certain women who obviously were not quoted and again it is not proof that somebody did not commit a sexual sault to a rape if he had consentual sex with another person but it does go to character there women were now coming out saying that they were contacted by the sunday telegraph e therre or the sunday times rather that they were contacted by channel for and that they just were not covered becaus they did not tell the story the media wanted them to to to tell here is one women explaining that she had consentual sex with bran and was reached out to by the media i was contacted inti bytion es i regati a pit i mate about sa sapety an a wee hand that we sad together the vidiais kind of iro i some mi pay somewhere if he wented a see n tand that san somebody was as mas if he will be awar mister brand they watat e's my story becaus it did not fit the narrative for that documen try because he was not an cul to me we had a fan coso contacted me from o information and i did not contatebac because i kind of fell it wi pe me anyway e gi p yo beson it is te do cument about the onein i me mister russe brand a again yet not all this s gun't be quoted by the media what afe the actual alligation there ther two sources that coordinated on the alligations against bran one is e show in the uque called dispatcthes from channel for and i i have to admit it is a littlebut weird that one ofthethings at they do here as they say that that none of the women were willing to come on camera to talk about the actual allegations instead they have actresses playing the women reading their tacs wich just cannos strange just from a media prospective typically if you want to have a reporter your talking had read the actual words i get that i do not understan having actress play the woman and infusing the the lines with emotiontemen tha that that is at's a strange move just from a production standpoint to me anyway here are some of the the quotes from dispatches i find and somebody bels what i was reboting and i was said that is pegoting ruscle brant bin sex a founda i was lie o my god he wrate to me jel ies t noty onin for traing by acgris when my rat happens is out way and he happen to call me and say i've had a really by day please come over an i at first i said no my going fay and he is please com tos common cote with me door was unlocked i just wanton tis place he comes running out of the baterin the cent he came 'm superconfuseus why te have nactress to this bu again on on and then on unn can i knowwhat he wanted mean that point ageys a lot of these alligations towntalolike for example tho coby brine talligations rember coby brine s alligations twenty five years ago thei'r alligations that he was at a hotel and cholorado and a woman came up to his room it three a m and then as it turns out most likely shad contentual sex ithem than she claimed she was rape in some of these cases were its women going to men's rooms at two a m that does not mean that the man gets to pertispatan rape it does mean the outh to take into accounts all the circumstances when you hear a he said she said story ind the sort of believe all women meam has alwaysbeen ridiculous it is no difveren thing believe all men in specialy ridiculous whenyou can men to find the words women or men but and when you look at these sorts of stories this is the problem in herily with not going forwith say a criminal prosecution at the time and alligation is made when you come forward ten years later of course the story is ging to get analyzed and that is not being mean to the woman or cruel to the woman it is if were trying to get at the truth of a thing that either happened or did not happen ou have the look t the circumstances surrounding the actural alligations garin gets o more on tese alligations in just one moment first did that poor sleep can cause waitgain mood issues poor mental health and lower

cent off o case nounce the actual alligations very long story from as i say the sunday times in the yuk nd they say four women have alleged sexual assaults between twenty o sects and twenty thirteen when he as a presentor for b b s radio to and channel for and then in actor and holly wood films others have made a range of accusations about brand's controlling abusive and predatory behavior bran denied the alligations and set all of his relationships have been consensual it is we an go through some of tese alligations because again there is this weird tendency when when alligations this come out n you see them also about people for example army hammer write the actor army hammer all these alligations will come out ofthe wood work accusing army hammer of have engaged in rape or sexual assault and turns out t persons been in a long standing sexual relationship wi the person where they had sex the person both before and after but we are supposed to somehow believe that in the middle was the rape in maybe that is true maybe that is not but it goes to credibility if you stayd with the guy if you were the gi before and you stated with the guy after there'are couple of situations that are liked us and then there are certain situations where the're not against the law it is just the brand is supposed to be creeping which he has ad mitted to being between this en tire period that he was a creep with women for example the first story here is quote as her taxy approached to rustle bran's home alce remembers the driver begging her not to go inside recognizing the destination he would stided task questions alice admitted she was sixteen in still in school she says the driver repplied his daughter was the same age and and treated alice please him askng you not going there you could be my little girl i would want some one to do this for her he offered to take her home without charge but alicin sisted she was fine he had just a sad look in his ey she recalled alice whose name we have changed to protector identityg now realized as she was not fime during a relationship thet laster for about three months when brand was a b b se radya presenter she says he referred to her as the child and eleges he became increasingly controlling andthen emotionally insexually abusive at this time brand was thirty and she was apparently sixteen can now in the united states crime in the uk not crime the age of consent in the uk is sixteen and apparently brand ascertained thet she as sixteen by asking her and checking which means scuzzid scum baggy behavior shore criminal behavior now if you are again in the uke and the age of consent changes from states out prefor the age of consent be eighteen but if you are not going to have that then that is what it is according to the times brand made his name in commenying the early to thousans and also achieved the status of london's most lecivious lathario after h gave up drugs into tdosn't too brand filled that vood with sex in she thas not five yoe received treatment for sexodiction at a clinic in the us his womanizing ways he once had he could sleep with eighty women in month som crown shagger of the year by the son three times have relationships os some the world's most beautiful women including cape loss and mary pop starkaty parry in twenty ten now again this goes back to what i saying before when he as engaged in this incredibly promiscuous behavior the media were championing him and talking about what a wonderful guy he was an theare talking about how he was just this again sort of elvish imbish figure on the world stage screwing as many women is humanly possible now this would have been an amazing time to check into whether any of those women were happy with the situation or wether all of them were or the some of them worn't did they do at the time now because he was busy getting paid by all these same people only ten years later when he has fliped in terms of his personal life and in terms of the values she is pouses now now it is worth while for them to come after him and it is the mediamotivation here is part of the story an is impossible to do without it ad then they go on about alice anda and she in it gets very graf a contalks about how she was aversion and hw he as turn on by this again is anything here actually in accusation of criminality now it is it it is apparently an accusation of of grosstness toward the end of the relationship alice says the bran sexually assaulted her now this is an accusation of criminality oright she she says that effectively he forced her into oral sex anda she had to punch him to get him off of her and all of this there is only one problem which his has quote the relationship anded when brand invited her over one day and she arrived to find another woman in his bed i was an gr a said then why would you do this to me this is humiliating alice has decide to speak out now because she beliefe she was too young to be able to consent to a relationship with then as alt man and the law should be changed protect those under eightin i agree the law should be changed pretect those under eighteen but the alligation of i legal behavior including forcible secual assaults here right would not that if that is a criminal assault should not she have reportef that is a police or shouln't seureport it now you will notice tha these are not criinal charges the police apparently are now soliciting the women to see if they want to come forward and do criminal charges far none of responded as far as i'm aware then there is talk about how when bran was e channel for presenter there are basically people were sent in of the crowd to pimp for him to go pick up women and bring h bring the back stage sai that da ho 'd have sex with them now leme just point out that this is common practice in holliwood it is disgusting it is been vile for ever only people meeven pointing it out were considered prudes for doing it is totally fine in holly woud up until the point it is not thit is part of the changing standard here pretty amazing wy they all knew i mean if this was the bad behavior why theire port i've question why is this news relevant that he was alathario who was sending people into the crowd of bb c shows to pick up women i'm just wonderingly what abill clinton did the same thing to can present of the united states and the media dismissed it i'm just wondering why exactly this is relevant now it wouod been relevan then but the problem is theyare on the side of those values they are on the side of those values which as why they protected it then if it was bad then if i's bad now was bad then apparently but accoring them was not bad then that this is why the're trying to come up with with new alligations the new alligations being actual rape or sexual assault and rustll is denying all this alligations and we have get seat the proof but py the problem with a situation which youave unnamed women making alligations and these unnamed women are ot makingtem criminally is that there is no way too a judicate the truth or falsity of the statements now the burden is supposed be on rustle bround to disproov that this thing happen which just typically not the way their work typical you have to have a burden of proof that shows that the thing did happen i wave seen to many situations in the past few years of accusations that turn out to be either exaggerated or not trof bragk havenot being most obvious example that comes to mine in my opinion the egn carrel story is not credible red there there just plenty of these alligations tha are out there about famous men who have crossed a particular line and and i mean politically there and and the alligations and up being either false or exaggerated get to more on this in just one secon first as we are big fans of our friens over at genusell do not just take my word for it 'men you should take my word for ecause people m i found been using genusell for years they

tat this nody a person who is quoted in that channel for clip by an actress which again i'm come i keep come back that becaus it sobasar ut why not just read the alligations thh am reading the alligations out loud right now unless one who infuse it with an extra level of hemotion as played by an actresswhich was strange heste meant nadya e business woman who is then in her thiryes the exchange numbers bran later got ton touch tot bhe antexting in talking on the phone they met up at june in june twenty twelve at his house nella and hey went on to have consentsual sects ka they they screwed and apparently she was unsettled by his glazed over look and then during one text exchange brand suggjested noty a bring a friend again he was in hew's a a degenerate at the time they then met again in the early hours of the morning of july first when she arrived at his house after he would pled with her to come over and this gr get int the allegations stated before she is coming over in themiddle of the night he is obviously calling her to have sex with her clearly now does that mean that she cantendst everythng t thells of course not does it also mean that she is in a situation she probably should not be in sure does it also mean that we now have a full he said she said to nareo yes not only that she claims that he a he had another person in the apartment he says that a friend was already in the bedroom and you wanted her to join them according to nadya and she is lik no i'm not happening were not doing that and then she accuses him of pushing her up against the wall and then raping her and then she has some tacts and hear what the text say this and think the only proof in the story to support some of the alligations they'r made quote i'm sorry tht was crazy in selfish i hope you can forgive me i know your lovely person and then she wrote back you scared the bleap out of me you are right i am a lovely person and for you to take advantage of me that is unexpected you have a probalem meu help its dangerous that ou think you can get your own way all the time syou kow how scary you are when that glazelook comes over you when a girl says know it means no i have to go and get myself tested last time you asked me condom or no condom when i say connom that does not mean it is optional youon't have the best reputation i pride myself on being save in trying to make the redicitions obvious this was bad when i'm disappointed and he said i'm very sorry you don' ned to get tested i will somehow make this up too with love and kindness not my original i to which was more sex yu been lovely tomean i embarrass by my behaviour sorry and then will you ever forgive me he visit again this the most telling alligation and most credible alligation may noddy i had told the friend what happened if she aparently went to the rape treatment senter at you seella santomonicot medical senter that same day and she share a copy of her treatment records ipparently she provided her under were an other samples is evidence which were froz s in at the time an officer from allipety was alerted by the centere according o the notes she chose not to make a police report she said she did not think my words would mean anything up against his which again is a strange allegation in theur two thousand twelve were not fing myn nineteen sixty thenote say if she was worrd that if her sailant's name is somehow released her name will be dragged through the mud should there be at the clinicfor the following of five months during her therapy sessions record shonadia was contemplating criminal or civil proseedings before ultimately deciding against it shrope branda letter hoping to regain some sense of power in the process and she sents it to her house and since you knowhat you put me through my body though you scared the pleep out of me on tolife first i foughd any situation i be strong enough to fight to moroff you completely broke me down ogaso that is by far the most serious allegation all the other alligations that are ther levert here are pure he said she said with no real supporting evidence other than the alligation itself and again many of the alligations here include further sectual entanglements they go on after the actual sexual assault alegation ow are gun to find out what happened here ell presumely ther's extual hard evidence certainly that she ad consentual sex wot hem right me that is presume it the frozen samples would show but if she maye contemporanious police reports all of this could be made not only public with her name but also she could file criminal charges if those croinal charges are file presumaly will be adjudicated we just i'm i'minasay i do not knowbe's i do not know and you do not know and no one knows again i can i can say what i think of russellbrand today i cannot saywhat i think of russellbrand in two thousand twelve and i do not know that russel brand would say what he hinks of russellbrand in two thousand twelve the thing that that i find non credible about the en tire situation is not that aligation which frankly towns she has supporting evidence and will ee what comes up the thing that i find puszling and bewildering is the media's decision to go whole hog on this story after spending years propping him up while he was engaged in thebehavior and apparently everyone in town knew about it you on musq for his part hea he put out it sweat after rssell bran put out his statement saying of corse they on't the competition meaning this is why the media are going after him and he says i support russell brand that man is not evil tucker crarlson said the same things had criticised the drug company's question the warniong cran can be pretty sure this is going to happen sure seems that way musk replied again the the media's decisions to go in a particular direction in cases this the pattern of who they go after who they do not is pretty obvious to every one which ironically enough under mine's actual credible alligations but also yo leads one to question why the're doing this in the first place it will get to the rest of the news in one second first are you looking to diversify

apart from the russell brand to allegations which will continuel i am sure to progress as the media covers them wall to all and one additional mother i should point out here that those of us who ave always advocated for traditional sextual morres have been scoffed at n laughed up on th medio for literally decates and it turns out the gris protection for both women and men is those sexual morries and only when russell brand has reembraced those are the media coming after him fullskill an hofs engaged in transgression of the sectual morres he was a hero to the world the minute that he switches all the sudden the media are after him tbecause this is one o the things the mediao love to do thei're favorite charge is hypocrisy th the thing that they consider to be a crime in many cases they do not actoul considerd be a crime much of the behavior they discussur they are totally fine with it is when the person advocates ae different standard morality even now ten years later that they say whll he is a hypocrite hypocrisy you should recognizs is not actually in attack on thebehavior hypocrisies an attack on the standard which presumbley is why they are going out frussel brannow as opost when who is actally engaged in the behavior o cam meanwhile united auto workers are striking against the detroit three that bh g m ford and stillantis they ware set to resume talks starting on sunday following the start of the most ambitious us industrial labor action in decades the first i'm the ou a w has gone on strike against all three automakers simultaneously is not accoincidences that this is happening in the middle of jobidons administration it is happening for two reasons one the automakers are getting squeeze theyre geting squeezed because jobidon's new mandate that everybody shift to over to electric vehicles is creating mass ov profitability probims at companies thet are largely invested in gasp powared engines all these companies have built up their entire brands on making a fortable and powerful gasp poward engines and now the bidad ministration comes in in thei'r trying to force all the automakers to completely shift their business model this cuts into profitability simultaneously you a w knos that they have their man in the wite house jobiton is a union man whi say he is a union man i omy he has sympathy for the uions am ming he has bought and paid for by the unions and hasmen since thin he seventy jobitdon has always bee a politician in the pocket of the unions and at they figure is they will get jobidon who cram down a settlements on the big three automakers whare simultaneously unable to accept any of the deals tat are being propose not only because the demands are extraordinary but also because their profitability is being destroyed by the same bidan admnistration now siding with the unions as the walsterturnal editorial work points out shawn fan narrowly want election as u a w president in march on a platform of new militancy against u s auto companies he now has the strike he appears to have wanted as the union simultaneously struck g m fort and slancis on friday for the first time in history fans said this thing boils down to one thing it is corporic greed the u a ws calling walk outs ot sleke plans to minamize how much it has to pay workers from its eght hundred twenty fi million dolar strike fun while still causing pain for automakers suts bout greed but the w w is also not calling a strike of all of the people the're justcalling astrick of some of the peoples thay do not have to pay everybody m tane wants a larger share of automake ar profits but to trice big three ta is demands to make them less competitive against carmakers testlaht and lead to losses he wants a thirty six per cent pay in crease over four years a thirty two our work week thirty two hour work week what i'm sorry who has at th what i mean if i i may not be a math genius but af thirty two our work wck is in eight hour day for days a week thirty to thirty two our work week in what world i come from a world win a forty our work week was the normur oin eight our day five days a week thirty two our work with over time for additional hours the restoration of retidry helf benefits which bankrupts all of these auto companies because again thus helf benefits were benefits defined not contribution to fine and o find pen benefit bentions rathan for one cases and thy want cost of living adjustments s another words they want all the things the three automakers have raise their initial wage offirs to increases beween seventeen point five per cents in twenty per cent plus large one time payments and im prove that fringe benefits including time off but a thirty to our work week and restoration for tirement benefits for newer workers are non starters in many ways as the walster turnal points out the strike is made in washington because of the bide dministrations policy mansating rapid transition to electric vehicles the u a w knows e vse require feur workers to make and will jepardize union shobs making gas power cars but the compani's already lose money on evs and they worry about making too many concesstions to thw ae w that will cause them to lose even more it is hard to overstate the costs of this coerce e v transition the bind administration with california as coin forcer is mansdating that e vs make up an increasing share of automaker sails two thirds by twenty thirty two californiand other progressive states plan to ban all new gas powder cars by twenty thirty five which by the way is not that fine the future it is twenty twenty three right now last year ev's made up three per cents of the troit automaker sals i mean is amazing to think that jobiton has basically forced the automakers into this position and because again he is such a a bought and paid for union sho the unions feel they can force these sorts of insane concessions down on the car companies hakem jeoffreys again another democrat based union show ye he says that thu se fihting for basic freedom which is weird s atdin't thing basic freedom as of thirty to our work week and to find benefit pension plans i w havn't to detroy a little later on the ter lookig forit the spanding im thoaverity with the ng at it all the workers wo ar fighting for the funomeno americin tree wit ye quite simple if you work hard and play by the rules you shouldn be able to provide a comfortable living for yourself for your family aicate our cildren purchas the home and one day retire with grace and dignity oh thats that that is out their fighting for a thirty to our work to find benefit pensions and all that that that is that is about basic human rites interesting tak interesting tak well no shock it turns out that done as the union rats at pressure on the b dadministracion theyre sending their emissaries there to try and cram some sort of deal down on the automakers you ad de'll be president fain he says that don they they are refraining from openly indorsing bid an next presidential race because they are tying to pressurbidon herous an we expect to actions not words from jobidon president bidon says these must pro union president an american hisshapin you have not indors tem what is tit going to take for you to do that arn' dorse met a go to be ear and remeen very clear about that no matter what politician atiy on't it and we expect action wewe expect acts in our words and and this this fight werein ride now me obviously the people talking about them tryn interject themselves an i in do ard negotiations you kno this this negotiating the ar negotiateors ore fiding hard or leavships fightin hard is goodbe wants egotiating table with our negotiating tames with our members maning the pickit lines or ow lies out there a who the president is now you who the former president was or or th presents before them is not good a when this fight i get tat that that is again him basically pressuring bi now biding is saden naming white house o bisorgune spurling in acting labor secretary july sue to go do trate help reacha deal to end that walk at which began early on friday he official with thewhite house unnamed officials had both spurling an acting secretarye yo are engaging with the parties by phones they have for weeks with the intention of being their early in the week the're please that the parties are continuing to meet as they hav been before the contract expired then i gess fom his mediators or intervene but help support the negotiations in anyway the parties feel is constructed and o bidn sat he understands workers frustrations that is automobile companies register record profits theave been fairly sared in my view with those workers let us be clear no one wants to strike but i respect workers wriht to use their options and the unions know they have their man and jobidon realenions the unions ho really does there is newpole out from sbsnews an fines that seventy two per sents of americans believe the jobidon is not actually healthy enough to services president of the united states again a newpole from bes news yugov has dona trump oover jobidin fifty to forty nine at this point showing again the donal from remains an incredibly tough candidnt against jobidon more importantly showing thit yoeu's not running away from bidon binan runningway from ham the're locked in a death struggle here meanwhile the entire democratic party is in a state of panic about sobidon in your times has an article title t a top democrat's bullishness on bidan twenty twenty four collides with voter worries as one top democratic stratge is put devoters do not want this that is an poll after poll after poll no wonder jobidon has to shore up that union support if you imagine this bad time for the democrats well good news the republicans are great atta at blowing every opportuneit wilgets that momentarily first whether we love it or whether we hated a i is here to stay a i's expected to crate for a hundred million you jobs globally some jobs include to data sciencist product designers robodicts entineers and maybe even add revenue assistance with a i skills why do i

unwoke cocer chocolate is coser is delicious hednover to jerem's chocolates ot com order to day o can meanwhile you imagine the democrats are running into some pretty strong head winds here the have got the jobidon impeachmen cema carthey by the way is saying that he is going to call hunter bidon in any sort of impeachmen action here he will be sipenat here was cemicarthy the speaker of the house saying just yesterday will you suppena hunter bidinavin ton junor spend twenty hours theitin haven aven ans an yav e wrant i in they question him how cam you have not brought in hunter biti t first thing as i do not suppena anybody i let come im jorte i let committees do their work but think about this maria you would not know any of this if we were not in charge i i understan i in do you the one thing american public has tha understand is there is a stradigy behind everything we only follow facts hunter bidn will get sopenit but wins the appropriate time do you do it because telibition wants it or do you do it around the facts in the timing when comer i think we should have tae bank statements to actually know where did the money go you wuld know the questions to ask hunter bite by the way hunderbidon for his part he is responding to a ll of this including the new gun charges against him by suing the iaress over iris whistle blors who criticize the do ja probe and blew up his sweethartdeal i'n alays gettng ll this money is we are just nome of money to pays child suporpit es got plenty of money to sue the ir as sets this interesting of all this would be very bad for the democrats the good news is for the democrats that the republicans again we are locked in a clash of stupid we are locked in it in it in a closet with a couple of morons just going at each other that is the democrat party and the republican party the republicans ar stupid for a couple reasons thei'r two things thet make republicans in herentlandpopular a feeling of chaos and also when ever democratsk can charge republicans with any sort of sexual hypocricy it is their favorite thing to do soave not one but two stories along those lines four publicans first of course we have the cristy nome story christinome who is the governor of south to kota apparently had a in absurdly blakant and public affair with handsy trump ai quorloun dowsky that is according to the aur post i have sources of my own say that noeman no loond asker basely making the rounds being all cosy lak months and months and montszigal publicly a ers walkin interviews together and such according to the yaur post marry republican south to co to governor christinome has engagedin a years long affir with long time tonal trump advisar quorlun dowsky who seems to be am a bit of a m he seems to be a wet lettrsy gets around duters apparently having a fairet with hopaks while he was married with forkids and now he is havingan affair with christi nome who also is married with kids apparently the ppara and less than to screet about the relationship with one sorce ere calling a making out at a hotel bar at twenty twenty one sea pack which is a pretty grows it was not two a em h sorces it was not we caught them in to dive baur miles way ts a lobby bar were everyone staying his a bejulian political operatives in journalis an electeds round remember i sawt with my own eyes and couple other people saw in the blateness was absolutely absurd the weas enimers one week after nom a fifty one year old mom of three formerly indorse donald trump seventy seven for these twenty twenty four presidential omination trump for his part by the way said even this week end that he would consider christy nome for the vice presidential slot this is shortly after she endorsed him for the presidency obviously are you leading toward a woman i the concep but wit pic the best pirson but not the conse yes a lot of people knoti wan governor kno in dorse to there wor trump non i to you have her yeur i uner i do i thin she en tas ti he is en a great covernor she gave me a very a full throated they do spent e pbeautifule an dosment tectually and te they do not spen a very good sta fom m and tsetly she be one of the people ike con sider or for something else bey be but we have a lot of people wi lot of grea people of the re publican party yet m there is that we have christinom who apparentlyas having a firth corlun dowsky a man who keeps som failing upward apparently and and then we also have lorn bobert in the dumbest story of the recent pass lorn bobert whos the congress woman from colorado she a she apparently has a new bou her newbeau is a person who owns s a bar that it stages drag shows occasionally s a gave friendly dragbar in ganuary twenty twenty assbeen gayski weeken whostid an evening of cocktales apptizers and last at hooch which is the bar owned by quingaligar who is the the person who is conoodling with bubert a g agan that is not the scandaled scandal here is that apparently bubert was caught on vidio getting frisky with galigar at a showing of beedle jews apparently she was vaping and loudly singing during her viewing of beedle jews and then he was petting her breast and she was i'm grabbing his hand to keep it there and apparently im there was some crochety behavior as well some crotch behavior as well and then when she was when the ushers came and ththey came to boot her there is a pregnant woman behind her who complaine bout the vaping she refuse to stop andt that point the ushers came and got her and she said quo do who i am and then she apologized for a hu her uncouth behavior chogmate up to a recent split from jason her husband of eighteen years she says there is no perfect blue print for goigth ra publican difficult divorce which over the past yumonts had made for me a difficult challenging personal time in my entire family ive tried to handle with strength and grace i simply fell short of my valuyes on son uk i'm i'm sorry no no n i there is there may not be a perfect blue print for going through a publicand nevical divore i'md pretty shure that first on the list of things you do not do on the blue print is give people handshops in the isles af beedle tusewhile they grab your breast in ou vape pretty shurt's that now the reason i say this is not because i deeply care about loren bubert's sex life i really do not but the point is that as another one of these republicans who is supposedly standing up for family values i juston non why do not republicans seemed to understand that when they present candidate wo engage in this sort of behavior it undercuts their position with the american public and i don hypocraty charge i thing that pocas charge is stupid i think you can hold valluys that you yourself failed to meet i thing it happens prety much all the taunt however running candidates and championin candidates who consistently do this in swing districts bobert one her last race byla two hundred votes i do not know that that is a recipe for success this whi say the re publican party they are the stupid party there is no question and hat that stupidity is extending over into this government shut down talk meanwhile the republicans are having internal fight now over a spending cot that would theoretically o vert a government shut down according to bloomberg housspeaker commi carthy overthe week and pro posed to deal to temporarily overtigos government shut down with demands including in eight percent spending cot for domestic agencies and resumption of borer wall construction he presented that plans for publican law makers in a conference call on sunday evening after negotiators representing keep facturs within the house t gu be settled on those demands but it seems their munch republicans who are not ta who are not going to go along with th plants the plan here was we present ta plan for an eight percent goverment an eig percent cot in spending and building som border wall in the middle of anemigration crises in that wrong foots then ima crats because that is not an ask for forty per cent cut or seventy per cent cut it is a pretty reasonable ask jobitan eventually comes to the table he makes a go three per cent cut he refuses on the border and then we yell at him about how he does not care bout the boarder which is fairly decent politics instead and an politico right has an entire article about how this isn' goin to a verto government shut down because bidon will not give them any the ogan wil bidon does not give them anything and and mac carthy's able to pass something then the ownest moves to bign andthe democratic senate to du something giope leaders told their members on a private call sunday night they hope to bring that plan to the floor on thursday according to multiple people listening the bill which would punt the next funding dewnline toctober thirty first was drafted in the last few days by colish an of hard liners in the house freom cawcas and more centrous members in the main street caucas the deal includes those across the board cuts to domestic spending exenting defense an veteran spendin as well as disaster aid and woeud pave the way for republicans to pass a stanalone fullier defense spending bill mhatwat would now happen on wednesday but a bunch of republicans have now said that he're not kon to go along with it because iy can you have a collective action probenside ther publican party if you are the person who shows the crowd that you are the purist this apparently means the win points this is one o the promis weakening parties the the strength that the prom with a strong party is the tde party can cramtown moderate policy on people who do not want it the pom with a weak party is that it has no capacity to hold together its members sufficient to prevent humiliations walking directly into walls s apparently the freedom cawcas the mainstry cock is work this thing out and then apparently a bunch of people come outntiy know that of course includes maggates whose entire agena in life apparently is to bring down cemocrarthes speakership mat rosandale of montana is opposing sos margery tailor green ye lie crane of arizona also their objections from a bunch of others presumably some of these people will have some goody's negotiated for them with that sead now the fact that whenever whenever chaos is projected and an a mand well a man fine whenever caos is projected to no apparent end because the democrats run the senate an tobiton is the president and they have a bit of a say in what ex actly and up becoming law here republicans habout this be consorted in the issues that you attack focas for a moment in time otherwise democrats are gon to have somethng to run on anda that is not what you want meanwhile donald trump did a mainstream media interview over the weaken i it did not go amazing for him his his recent interviews of nopping going particularly while this one was with a christen welker the most newsworthy thing that he said in this interview was he made a comment suggesting that hartbeat bills to protect the lives of the unboard in states are terrible which it is not only not pro life it is an awful thing to say it is one thing to say the taxtically speaking as president of the united states i'm going to trid to reach as much consensus as possible and gradually move the line back on abortion to accustom the american people to protecting life because if we move too far too fast then the snapback is going tobe dramatic as we sawin kansas that is it that is a pragmatic quastion andtht to case you can make that is not what trump says what trump actully seys about a bortion in this interview is morally agreegious he s has that hard be bills do protect babies in the womb pas we five week sax those are terrible that is the thing he says e a henderal ban landed on your dask if you were reelactit would you sign it at iftens o ren a complet ban i ban it fifteen wealth people people or starting to think of sifteen week sat seems to be a number the people are talking about right downd you find at i would i would sixtdown with both sides and i negotiat something and will end ip with piece in that issue for the first time in fifty two years i'm not goingto sa woud or i would not i mean to saink is wul is willy desine a five week and six weet ben support that you n that tetwhathy lers a terrible thing in a terrible mistake a' terrible thing an a terrible mistake it is her in the state he is iin talking federally in the state i that that is not a prolife physicion by any stretching imagination now i'vas the trump supportersig n ta say look you pointed three justis to the supreme court they overturn row but the real question is is notnal trumkin to make this a priority in his next term but in his last from i'm with you what is gin to do in his next term and this should provide some foder for th disanse seem to work with when it comes to for example sates i woe which are very very pro life mean the question is whether re publicans really care about policy at this point or whether they jis can trust trump to do whatever hi'sgoing to do that is rally the running question of this campaign now meanwhile donald trump was asked about his efforts to overturn the twenty the results of the twenty twenty election by cristion walker one ofthe qestions i keep asking peoples if they think that tdis race is run on this is that is trumpkin o win that race it is gin me difficult i's gin make it harder for him could he wen that ris sure because drobin is a terrible president could he win maybe will he win if this is the chief issue that he is can be discussing and he loves discussing it is obviously would animaes him i den no is it smart politics the most sing your lawyers in your own administration and on your campaign told you that after you would lost wule than sixty legal challenges that it was emfer why did' you adnure then and defie to listen to a new outside because i did not respect them oud hirylayers ser but that does ominion i youhire im you never met these people you get a recommendation they turn out to be ronous a they turn out to be not good in many cases it idn't respect om the're numerous books that were written or how the election wal just to be clear weumistening to your lawyer's advice te reoulisting yoron in ta i was listening to different people and when i anded it all up the election was rid the're a bookly you lot a ri shots that in fact molly hamming way rod a great boil were you coii ra shot tultimas lismin molly hemmingwan n was highly respected and grat she wrote it ud book of the best selling book called rig were you calling the shotfon mister crenton ultimately as to whether or not i believed it was rig tas sure i it was my decision now he i'm the reason she is asking him that is because that is the entirity of the rego case against him is that he was calling te shots ray now i thing the reco case is specios i think thet are serious problems in the legal interpretation fannualis is putting fortan all the rest down'll trum the this part of the danger here judes in the middle of bunch legal cases and he is being ast about legal matters on national telivision i then trumples asked what he was doing during te capital riot now again this is legally relevant only in sofa ibrelly do not things predically relevant but it is lude legaly relevant in far as its part of jack smiths january sixth case againstrump here 's trump on what he was during during the capital riot the shekwa shevis se sho we betterf ye did te a tan le to to i the sat we be better an ti we wen bac to the what us just si you understand i spoke a materein i space combe how you watch the fell an o

yo e ait wor la to the a we n o en an ido no three hours acte wen ta tres an we put out before that o ge is this is this going to be what what people want o hereabout in the twenty twenty four election and trobine's a terrible president he is presiding over a terrible economy he is presiding over form policy disaster of for form policy disaster apparently a hundred and three tranese ships were spotted around tilan to day i'm it is this what an be talking about s real question i'll gat time for some things i an than some things that i hate things that i it to day apparently according it to the daily wires manapristojocamo it seems that stephen avery himself from behind bars may now be directing supporters to tank the rotton tomatofs audience review score of daily wire host o candis ownstoku ser es convicting a murder avrian is naphew brenan dascy or convicted of murdering photographer tries to how back back in two thousand and seven and of course they are featured in the brad new series from candus convicting a murder which were butts making a murderer well apparently a post on the facebook group called stephen aver is innocent says important stephen is asking for all of his supporters to flood rottins made us and give convicting a murder a bad review this garbegin vitrell is not trou we need our communiys step up and let canasons now that stephen avery is innocent the facebook post issued by the groups administrator on fidaynight then links to th rottins made us reviewof page of convicting a murder an taks everybody in the grup whichs thirty six thousand people before the post convicting morderwas bosting n average reviewsforin the nineties is now droped all the way down to at last chack in the sixties yah this dout things are going ing out the ri do not whide i this because it shows that stephen avery if there is something that stephen avery does not it is pretty obvious what it is here and that is that that candas his documentary really puts the li to all of the alligations that he is wrongfully convicted eu nar her documentary really blows the lid off that particular story in the fact that stephen avery abpures to be directing from behind barsan efforts to take down the film tells you what you need to know about the value of the filmok a time for a quick thing that i hate apparently our f thirty five stouth fighter is stealth that time it is nowmissing why he just gone according to enb cy news a s fighter's stell fighter justs stelth abilities appear to be working too well with authorities forced to ask the public for help finding an f thirty five the en missing somewhere over south carolina when the pilot ejectit because of a mishap join base charleston in air base in north charleston sait it was working with the marine court air station baufort to locate an f thirty five thoas involved a a mishap sund afternoon the pilo as able to safely eject from the air craft and f thirty five b lightening tojet n was takin to a local medical center in stable condition the jret was left an auto pilot mode when the pilot eject ed from the air craft it might still be air born however sorchers were focasing ther attention north of the air base around moultry and lag marian base on the jets last known position nancy maye republican of soufh carolina said how n te held you loosn f thirty five how is it not a tracking tovice were asking the public to what find ejet and turn it in apparently the transponder is not apparently working worth noting that is a the f thirty five cost perplane the acquisition coss ray now or or somewhere betwen eighty and a hundred and fifty six million dollars who on that is not that is not ideal guis ye or our milaeverything's going well in the military which is wy mark milly is still the had of the joincheves he is doing such a stellar drop he was asked over the week and about the military going wok meaning whyre you ges flying elgou be te keep plus minis divide by sin flags why is it that you guys or for example putting out ads talking about the value of individualism in the military is though that is what the military is all about why is it wirguys doing det yy training and margmilly is i'vent i've never heard of this wok what is this woke that you speak of 's the et military to wok not not at all am i'm not en sure what that were truly means but i would ta it that the military i see is a military that is succeptsly strong it is powerful it is ready ofact a readiness rates the way we masyour readinesses thatter now than they been in years that is som is it is the militit it is it is he does not now woke me ansgis things are going amazing then he said that it is their obligation to staut apolitics which is weard because milly keeps injecting himself into politics by talking about white rage and such you thought about resining you did not i thought at the time it was a consideration of mie but several people concelled me in and they reminded me that that an officer commission officer resigning is the consummate political act and that it is our obligation o stay out of politics and if i were to resine then that would be great mistake in would be putting the uniform even more into politics i get ther there is very little that can put margmilly's uniform more into politics quick reminder he did get a presidential ccommodation from donald trump

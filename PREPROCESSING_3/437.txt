welcome to the hubermansciencescience pactei mandrhuberman and on a professor of nerbology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin to day my guest is doctor andy galpan doctor galpan is a full and tenured professor in the department of connesiology at california state university in fullerton he is also a world expert in all things exercise science and conesiology today you are going to hear what is essentially a master class in how to build fitness no matter what level of fitness you happen to have he talks about how to build endurance and the multiple types of endurance he talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy which is the growth of muscle fibres if you are seeking to get stronger or build bigger muscles or build endurance or all of those things to day you are going to learn how you also going to learn how to build flexibility how to hydrate properly for exercise and will also talk about nutricion and supplementation what makes dolctor galpan unique is his ability to spand all levels of exercise science he has the ability to clearly communicate the sets and repetition schemes that one would want to follow for instance to build more strength or to build larger muscles he also clearly describes exactly how to train if you want to build more endurance or enhance carty of ascular function what is highly unique about doctor galpan and the information he teaches and the way he communicates that information is that he can take specific recommendations of how recreational exercisers or even professional athletes ought to train for their specific golls and link that to specific mechanisms that is the specific changes that need to occur in the nervous system and in muscle fibres and indeed right down to the genetics of individual cells in your brain and body in order for those exercise adaptations to occur it is truly rare to find somebody that can spand many different levels of analysies and who is able to communicate all those levels of understanding in such a clear and actionable way indeed doctor galpan is one of just a handful of people to which i and many others look when they want to make sure that the information that thei're getting about exercise is gleaned from quality pere reviewed studies hands on experience with a wide variety of researc subjects meaning every day people all the way up to professional athletes in a wide variety of sports it is no surprise that hese not only one of the most knowledgible but also the most trusted voices in exercise science doctor galpan is also an avid communicator of zero costic consumer information about exercise science you can find him on instegram at doctor andy galpan and also on tuitter at doctor andy galpan both places he provides terrific information about recent studies both from his laboratory and from other laboratories more indept protocals of the sort that you hereabout to day if you are not already following him be sure to do he provides only the best information is extremely nuants and precise and clear in delivering that in formation i'm certain that by the end of to day's conversation you will come away with e tremendous amount of new knowledge that you can devote to your exercise pursuits before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desirean effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens t letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there isen i started taking athletic grens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probiocs to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stoc com slash hubermen and claim a special offer theu'l give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too therare ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficion in vitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic gren stock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the five fre travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ove talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly nd all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolytes if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement doc com slash hubermen nd youll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element dok com slash huberman and now for my discussion with doctor andy galpan well em doctor professor andy galopment s a long time coming we have friends in common but this is actaly the first time we have sat down face to face ye i'm very excited yet thereare only a handful meaning about three or four people who i trust enough in the exercise physiology space that when they speak i not only listen but i modify my protocals and you are among tho three or four people first of all a dhat of gratitude thank you i you have greatly shaped the protocals that i use and im i know there is far more for me an for others to learn your professor you teaching university and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration muscle biopsy literally images down the microscope all the way to training professional athledes and everything in between you are truly an end of one and just to start us off i would love to have you share with us what you think most everybody or even everybody should know about principles of strength training principles of endurance training and principles of let us call it hypertrophy power in the other cut sort f categories of training this could be very top contour but would you think everybody on planet earth should know about these categories of personal an athletic development well that is a great first question holy cow ah i think i'll started this way i tend to think about i there is about nine different adaptations you can get from exercise i fat loss is not one of those it is a by product but that is not really when i'm getting at i'm d we can kind of categrize everything that and wever er at we can talk about or what the concepts that you need to hit within each one and then you coan have infinite discussion of the different methodologies rt and that that first thing that hit is the concepts are actually fairly few but the methods are maniy right people have said that in itterations throughout time i'm if you walked from the very beginning the first one to think about as wold as call skill this is improving anything from say a gulfswaing to a squatting technique to running this is is simply moving mechanically how you want your body to move jusgong to globally all that skill from there were i getting to speed this is moving as fast as possible the next one is power and power is a function of speed but also function of the next one which is strength if you actally multiply strength by speed you get power and the reason on making this distinction by the way is somebothese are very close and i'm going in a specific order on purpose here for example power is y to set its a function f speed and strength if you improve speed you have also likely improved power but not necessarily cause it could hat come from the forest direction either there is carry over the lot of things youwould do for development of strength and power im they are somewhat similar but there is differences right things t you would do correctly for power would really not develop much trength and vic virsa we get into all these details later whence you get past strength an the next one co a down the listis hypertrophy this is muscle size right growing muscle masses one way to think about it after hypurchopy you get into these categories of the next one is these are all globily endurance base issues and the very first one is called muscular endurance this i your ability to do how many pushups can you do in one minute e things that past muscular endurance you are now into more of an energetic or even cardy of vascular fatigues you have left the local muscle and you are now into the entire physiological system and it is ability to produce and sustain work and we can get toto a bunch differentiations with in endurance but but just to keep it really simple right now the very first one think about this as i call this anerobic power right this is your ability to produce a lot of work for say thirty seconds to may be one minute kond of two minutes that the next one down then is more closely lined what well call your vial to mact this is your ability to kind o do the same thing but more of a time domain of say three to twelve minutes this is goingto be a maximo heartrate but it is can be well past just max hartwik then after that we have what i colong duration endurance sthis is your abilty to sustain work the time doman does not matter in trimps of how fast gont you are going it is how colong can you sustain work this is thirty pluss minutes of nolbreak that as just an high level over view those are the different things you can target and again some of those cross over and some are actually littlea bit contrary to the other ones pushing towards one is mabe a sacrifice something else as a is an over all start that is rough y what we are looking at within all those though they do have similar concepts and terms of there is a handful of things you have got to do to make all of those things work and we can talk about as many those as you want bu t one of them is functionally called progressive overload which ever oneyou are trying to improve at if you want to continue to improve you have to have some method of overload and as you well know you have talked about a lot adaptation physiologically happens is a by product of stress s you haf to push a system if you continue to do save the exact same work out over time you better not expect much improvement you can keep mainnance but you are not going to be adding additional stress in general you have to have some sort of progressive overload and we can talk in detail about what that means for each category but this could come from adding more weights this could come from adding more repetitions it could come from doing it more often in the week it could come from adding complexity to the movement going from say a partial range o motion to a full range motion or adding other variable there is a lot of different ways to progress but you have to have some sort of movement forward if you have this kind of routine wou've built monday wednesday and saturday or something and you just do that infinitely you are not going to get very far t hat's i guess the most highlable over view of all the things people can go after and then we can go from whatever direction you aunt there i love to do the deep dive on each one of these ener a several hours a why i and i magine that overtime we probably will a i'd love to chat about a couple of these in a bit more depths in terms of defining what the progressive overload variables or y after these different categories maybe we could hit the am to most common comminations of these nine things the first one being am strength and hypertrophe and ma we coud lump power in their a maybe not a you are you are the exercise fis yes yones ye but strength and hypertrophy which at least bear some relationship yet and then maybe separately we could explor a sustained work en durance this thirty yet its are longer continuously cause i think many people train in that regime ye am and probably i something a veo two max inarobi e well because i know that a number of people now incorporate am called hit or high intensty interval training i think with the hopes of either shortening their work outs yand or am gaining some additional carty of ascular benefit if we could start with a strength and hypertrophy i know many people want to be stronger they want to grow larger muscles or at least maintain what they have ye what are the progressive overload principles m that are most effective over time for strength and hypertroph tye aulkat i'll leke you go a little step back with every one of those categories i talked about you have what we call your modifiable variables this is a very short list of all the things you can modify the different variables within your work out that can be modified that will change the outcome fancy way of saying if you do this differently then you are gon to get a different result i'm modifiable variables i the very first one o those is called choice sic is the exerise choice you select now one of a im n a go double back here some kind of doing a little bit of conception follow me here as i'm goin up a lair to come down a coupl of layers a i have these fundamental laws of strangth muditioning that that i'll a kind of a lttle bit of a joke but progressive over those one of those laws anothe one of those laws is you are exercises themselves do not determin adaptations here is what i mean if youre i mont get stronger you cannot select an exercise that does not determine you getting strong if you do not do the exercise correctly and'm not een referring to the technique that of course matters but if you do not execute in the recht fashion then you are not going to get that aptation if you choose i ont get stronger ound i do a bench bess well if you do the wrong sat range the wrong repetition rangs the wrong speed you will not get strength you may be get muscn en durance and very little strength adaptation the exercise selection it self is important but it does not determine the outcome adaptation the very first thing you think about if your i want to get stronger are ad muscle is not the exercise choice it is the application of the ex ercise what of the sets or the reps wor the a rest ranges are yu're using that is going to be your primary determin it now some exercises ar certainly better for some madaptations for example i a dead lift is probably not a great exercise to do for long duration en durance you could theoretically do thirty straiht minutes of dead lifting but it is probably not our best choice right it is probably a pretty good choice for strength development i could youre to do lowl repetition i said range i'm you could theoretically do biceept curls for power butprobably not your best choice i single joint isolation movement is is not the best for developing power youv v ever done a bice of cirls fast as you possibly can that is ni can i go well in theory any exercise can produce any adaptation given the execution is performed properly now that we have understood that a little but t exercise itself does not determine the adaptation coming within each one of these categories exercise choice is not important variable because it does lend you two things what movement pattern your in in an't other words if if you wanto get stronger and you are thinking ok a what exercise to i do you need to thank think a little bit about what musclegoups to i want to use and that is goin to be leading towards the exercise choice for example i want to use my quadsmore o a fine maybe you can to choose more of a front squat ti've a variation a goble squat the bar the load is in front of you you want to emphasise may be more of your handstrings ingludes you cn i may be put a barbell on your back or do a different one the exercise choice is important to the perscription because it isgoin o determine a lot of your success you another kind of simpler way to think about this if you 're a beginner or moderate intermediate or may beou do not have a coach you probably want a hedge towards an exercise selection that is a little bit easier technically you maybe do not wnt to do a barble bax squat it is octually pretty complicated movement maybeyou want to do a litle but more of a again a goble squat or even use some machines or a split squat somehing that is litle bt simpler because you do not have a coach you are not a professional otlet the likelihood of successes higher in the risk is now gone lower the very first variable within all of these is the exercise choice the second one is the intensity and that refers to in this context not perceived effort while that was really intense work out it is quite literally either a percentage of your one rep it max or a percentage of your maxim of heart raded or view two max for the strength base things you wnt ta think about what is percentage of the maximum waight i cul lift one time and tht's that is a rticall one ret max or it is a percentage of my heart raigt raght if i tell you to get on a bike an i want to do intervals and want you at seveny fi percent i'm tipically referring to seven if i percent of your max heart raded or viou to max or something that if i tell you to do squats at seveng fi percent that means seven if i percent of the maxim out o wagh you could lift one time or close iinterms o determining one remax i confess a if never have she takin the one remax for any exercise but i have some internal sense of what that migh be oor yuand what range it might be is it necessary for people to ases there one repetition maxim wer before going in to these sorts of programms no not at all i think a more intutive way is to take a repetition range i wu o gou dois a couple of noys there are i equasions you can run and you can just gugle these anywhere an and these are caled conversion charts and it says ok if i did seventy five pounds on my bench press i did at eight times you can just run an estimate to say the oka you are probably going to be able to bench about ninety five pounds for one rimaxts or something that is a very easy conversion chart just pick a load thatyou feel comfortable with but it is it is kind of heavy but not li crazy heavy and do as many repetitions as you can wbut a really good technique and then look wat that number would be converty safefer than doing an one repetition maximem for for that the general public who has again no coaching it is sa prefer a professional o that it is ni any safer but iare i' not even a professionalothin but a trained person with a coach but for most people yo that is a god way to go about it i'm you can also jist kind of do it with feel in the sense that say you want to do a set of five repetitions and you do the load and you think it get it done one or two more and then then you cannot have an idea of of what that number is going to be iif you think man that last one i had to cont a really really really get after it than maybe just call that that number right i'm seyeu do not have to get overly concern in fact when we start getting into these number ranges youare to see that they are all ranges i oht were not kin to give a specific ninety five percent for one of these exactoryes inse it is not that precise i'm for most of em in fact some of my ciperchfy have enormous ranges that you would almost cannotmess thut the intensity in that case does even matter for the most part because that is not the primary determinent i'm some of these your ing to see intensity is to determine and some of these rnicy volume is the true determinet i'm intensity it is a sec en choice was he very first on a manipulliable veryable intensity was a second one the third one as would calle volume and this just how many reps and how many sets are you do if you cnto do three sets a ten that volume would be thirty i five sets a five that volume is twenty five it is s simple equagion how much work he totally doi i the next one pass that is called rest intervals this you mont a time you are taking in between typically a set i' then from there you have progression much as wht we started talk about this progressive overlod are you increasing by weight or reps or restminables or complexity or whatever all of those things i can be changed as a method of progression and maybe you want o go im progressing from a single join exercise a a leg extension on a machine and you want ao progress by moving to a whole body movement a squat that an of itself you do not have to change the load or the reps or the rest that is a representation of progressive overloaed and it is probably a pretty good place a start because number one especially for beginners you want to make sure that the movement pattern is correct do not worry about intensity do not worry about rep branges or any these things you need to learn to move correctly and you need to give your body some time to develop some tissue tolerance tht you are not getting overtly sore iin general soreness is a terrible proxy for exorcise quality it is really bad way to estimate whether it was a good or a bad work out especially for people an that begin or to middle to moderate infact even the that for our professional athletes i'm we do not use sordiss as amectric of a good work out im it is it is a really bad idea for bunch reses on the same token because stress is required for adaptation you do not want o leave it the gem in feel i do not ley do much there has to be there if you think about soreness on a scale of one to ten you probably want to spend most of your time and the three youen post exercise ye in between workouts totally and i i know we will talk about recovery extensively later but if one body parter set of body parts is sore is that an indication that one should stay out of training i would imagine the answer is no an in most cases im and secondarily to that if a particular muscle is sore does that mean that muscle is not ready to be trained again you have answer to both those is the same which is no im you can certainly train a sore muscle you you need ted i guess have a little bit of feel on that right if if you are sore of kay in you are moving around a little biing manis little bi sre you can train if you are i cannot sit on the couch without crying because myc clutes are sore we we probably do not need to train again rit weelas wim fering countis croning yet in that perticlar case i'd say you have actually gone the place of detriment because now youre can have to skip a training session and now you are behind youre actual total volume say cross the month and i cucan be lower because you went away too hard in those work outs had to take too many days off fem between you gin to see tha yourn to cover less distance o in the course of a month or six month or even a year you want to walk a pretty fine line and for most people i would say hedge a little bit on the side of less sore than more sor because frequency is very very important for almost all these adaptations i training frequency which is the last modifiable varable riht frequency s a how many times per week are you are you doing that thing those are im in up r or globle things that we can play with when i'm trying to manipulate and get strength verseis ipertrope or at i want a little bit of both all those variyables are the things that are going through my mind which one do i need to move in which direction that i can get this outcome and not this i'll come over here for example some folks might want to get stronger but not put mussle masso some folks are jis kind i want both and that is a lot of your republic only tittle stronger and lo bat more muscle great but there are in sances were people for performance reasons or for purely personal preference lik got o won o get an youa muscle greay but i wanti it stronger assom if few minute youlate those veryables correctly you can get exactly that very little development of muscle size and a lot of development and strength and this is why we continue to break wold records in sports power lifting and way lifting that have weigt classes there is a top number that we can hit it froms o bodysize but yet we continue to get stronger and faster this is very possible if you understand how to manipulate almost veryables im s that being said we can start off with you want t to go strength d yesterdrayand i i love that you mention the fact that it is possible to increase strength without increasing muscle size youus not dramatically because think it is not just weight class athletes i know a lot of people who for aesthetic reasons they would to be stronger their hearing that having strong bones an strong muscles an tendants it is greit for longevity and for avoiding injury and many other features of of life and and yet they do not want to fill out progressively larger and larger r sizes of clothing and we can go harder to the mechanisms on that piece if you are we can save that come back to it sure i what i' love to both a what i love to know thor was if we could define some of these modifiable veriable yet in the contacts of straings let us say i ossum yes er somebody who i come to you and i say and unless you are say for sake of of a balance here cause she ectihe does do some waiy training i bring my sister in i say me und my sister both want to get stronger yet what modifiable variable should iu how should we modifyd the variables love it are it great ofmna dou inception on you one more time one of my other laws of this will be fast i promise of strength conditioning is in general the default is all joints through all range of motion this is important because it is can answer you very first question on this strength cantergoy in general the ankle should go though the full rnge of motion the ankle the ye should go through he full range of motion than hethe hip the elbow it cetera cetera riht across the work out not in a single movement well ri would hop wenless there is an amazing exercise i have not heard well there are some exercises that we are gin a call more full body think about a full snatch tik you re nto take a lot of your muscles a loter your joins through lot o range of motions i'm other ones an isolation we call these single join exercises imagin an a bisep crow youhave one joint in that particular case the olble moving the shoulder and everything else is pretty much stable this is how ill different ae molth i join from single join movements im but yet across how what d you say does not he hap to be to day but maybe throughout the week try to get every joint through full range of motionnow a couple of quick caviots that i am not advocating using full rrange of motion an allowing really bad exercise technique n i say ful range o motion that is the default that does not mean every single person can do that for everysing exercise it means that is where we should be striving to and that is our starting point youre gin to see a lot less injury and a lot more productivity out of your training session the fact the science is fairly clear on this one strength development as well as i pertry is generally in hands tha large arrange of motion of training i'and the mechanisms are somewhat understood on that im that being said if you have to get into say a bad ragt a position with your say low back the spine is a very good one you'r in general the spingesates very neutrals we call it now no flection no extension speching he lumbar region if you if you are doing a say a dead lift and in an order to take your knee through a full range of motion a dead lift you have to compromise your back position that is no boy not cavioss erside do not kill me in good positions on e doll till yourselves yenportantly why that matters is if we walk through strength the very first thing o ma go through t the exercise selection let us choose an exercise at which ideally has a full range of motion or close to it that does not in duce injury for you that you can still maintain good nack and low back an imposition and everthing else im you feel comfortable with you can feel strong but you do not feel all my gosh if you have never snatched before having you do a snatch for a maximum even now seventy five percent that it is terrible idea your nock can feel confident is can be a train rack i would rather put you on a machine bench bress seen gi feel stable i feell safe here and i can just express my strength exercise choice in generally in general full range of motion and you want a cond of balance between the movement areas this is an upper body press this is pushing away from you bench bress things that oper body pull pulling an implement toward you a bent row pull up im the pressing should be horizontal perpendicular to your body as well as vertical s this is lifting a weight overtoppe your head lifting away away from you the pull version is pulling horizontally to you and pulling vertically down pull up things that im from the lower body we typically call these hinges it sort of funny muscle thing that no one can laugh at but maybe mein you here is well categarize muscles as our movements exercises as pushes and pulls right a squat is tends to be push wat you are pushing away the ground a dead lift is a pull whoc ere pulling the implement up to you but reality every single exerciseis only ever a pull cas muscle does not push things away muscle can only contract and pull on itself and again supernarything tht must we put ad an mos that is don no but i think its it really important point because it also am speaks of something tha you will get in too later which is that youow pust eror chain anterior chonly im and if that is a mysterious to people w become clear i before long pus eror chain anterior chain a makes a lot of cense to me because of the way it is grounded in the firing of motor nerons which is altimately wit controls muscles it isos o iron nerves all the time exactly it also depends on the lends through which one looks it life and and exercise of course i lends is primarily nurous son it i that i but i realize tat he imports i this idea of a pushing a m a perpendicular he body overhead pulling both toward a toward the body and from overhead that just makes really goot into it iv said especialy since a lot of youere just listening to this and nout watching it soin your mind folks you can think about im pushing away a plun shore overhead i'm lifting something overhead and then pulling toward a your mideline or toward your body rather and then pulling yourself up a pull up in the p class for those ye the lower bodice this same thing right its some sort of pushing away a a squat or a split squat or lunge or something that and some sort of again we will call pull or hinge dead left or remainiin dead left or a handstring curl or something where you are contracting and calling pulling the thing in and you coun s put these into a thousand ifferen canteguaries if i you are really in that field you can want to ad a bunch o other ones but that is is a rough conception if you are going to do a single work out you could choose four exercises and you coan choose one of each one press upper body press one opper body pull one lower body hinge one lower body press and then now we be a decently well rounded thexercise i'm that is your exercise selection and if you are taking those through foring to motion you are a pregat spot ter's close as you can the next what is intensity if you want to develop strength this comes back to one of my favorite sciences of all time happen to be nerve guy actually in generally i to shit on nerves as much as i possibly can cuton a muscle guy but i have to give hennaman some credit here i know that it as beinsize prince of course right this is a series of papers inickan the nicgois an nature at least some of them ye ye in nineteen fifty four o fifty six or something yeareyou can fact check me amsure y will im but he basely outline this idea that look it a there is a certain recruitment threshold needed fur nur ons to fire and we have muscle fibres in we will call fast which muscle fibres an solders muscl fibres and in general you are going to activate the slow twitch one's first because they tend to be associated with low threshold moton o i's not exactly that way but it is its clunsen oup right well the only way tha you activate some these higher threshold nurons is to demand the muscle to produce more force and it is fairly specific to force right is not something you can do over an endurance thang right unless it gets really extreme and the tig appens im in general the only way to use these big chunks of your muscle which are incredibly important for aging by the way one the major probles we have with aging developing our development of aging lated issues with muscle is the fact we lose fast which fibres preferentially and then we have major problems as we go down the line because we have lost a big chunk of our strengthin size you want to make ur these fibres stay alive and in fact ook e if that being said the only way to develop strength is in to challenge the muscle to produce more total force if you are fairly untrained or new i guess i shure ta state is all the beginng as well one more inception than i'll stop when it comes to this level of detail er of excise perscription a a fairly untrained per con is gone a respond basely the same to every single thing you do in fact we have done this in a lav many times we have done training studies doing things thirty minutes of cicling ind seein huge increases in muscle strength and cize which is not a prerscription for most people tons recizes but people at ae really untrained if you did plough metrics or strength training or endurance running they all just get better at everything that caby got kind of a cide if you want to be more intentional more specific to the to the goal of strength you need to produce more for specificity matters right we have size principal to help understand this and we have our lows of specificity which say said principal right specific adaptation to imposed demand the adaptation you get or the result of your training is going to be reflection of the demand that you imposed if you want to get stronger you need to impose a demand of strength not repetitions this has to be the load has to be very high i'm in general your probably looking at above eighty five per cent of your wone er at max if you are moderately train may be seventy five per cent we will work lowly trained again everything works but in general we want to be pressing a load that is very high because the intensity demand is high that is going to force you to do a low repetition range you cannot do twelve reps at ninety five per cent that then it would not be ninety five per centin your oner max by definition true strength training is really going to be five repetitions per cet or less strange that is where most of it is going to occurb pespes phisy we have covered choice intensity and im repetitions riht the total amount of set tat you do it is really cot up to your personal fitness level right i'm if you did as little as three cents per exercise that is probably enough work sents totally yehave totally work sets right get fully warmed up and build up to that eighty five per cent do not just walk ino the gem and theready five per cent on a go thank you that is a that is a important distinction i'm work your way up do some ilike a very classic warm up thing would be a sadaf ten at fifty per cent a set of eight at sixty per cent a set of maybe eight again at seventy per cent and then maybe a set a five at seventy five per cent two or three or four sets kind of building intensity and lowering a rep range and then you go after your two or three working ents i'm also in terms of restonables now because we are trying to the primary driver of strength is intensity it is it is not the vollyu right its the intensity in order to maintain that we have to do a low repetition range but in addition we also have to have a high rest interval because if we start to we have any amount of fatigue in cur and we have to then eise or reduce the reps or reduce the intensity we have lost the primary driver we have lost that main signal the number were to throw out typically is to to four minutes i'm to imagine you id you you are set of bench press and you did five repetitions at eighty five percent you probably want a rest two to four minutes before coming back to the bench a doesnit mean you have to sit there on your poeme act fact please do not every on will thnk you for not doing that i promise i'm you cannot engage other muscle groups as wil you call supersetting you are doing your bench press and while that two minute clock is running for your chest to rest youven go over and do your detlefs and you you can kind of move back and forth and this is how you can make strength training it not seven hour work out if your professional out that you areging to take that time because you want a maximise the out come i'm su we have done this action or lot to superset will reduce the strength gains but by a tiny mount and most of us do not care enough relative to it is going to triple the length of your training session it is not worth it fom the average pers and i will tell them the as superset for someone who is trying to break a wood record in way lefting or pirlipting i do not superset interesting ye i think i've found that i'm i do not recover particularly well from strength and i percharpy training i do not work out or the next i from work out to work out unless i keep the total duration of those work outs i to say no more than sixty minutes of work af real work ye ye maybe seventy five pass seventy five i find tha i just starts od at's i hol i've to introduce additional ras days er i just get weaker over time i i'd set i cont af a limit at fifty minutes and then i i usually violate that land then up doing sixty minutes i'm i'm excited to hear that one can superset exercise is as long as they work different muscle groups of course ye otright i'm i would not want to to bench pressing over head press superseded cause you can e can i think that is is goes without saying for most people but just to point ed out but that i could i'm do some put pushpoll pushpoll n without compromising total intensity that much and i' i'd certainly would be willing to give up a lit a a rapturer there or a few pounds herer there i'm and may ask whether r not i'm in doing that one gets any even tiny bit or a more of additional benefit in terms of cartio vascular work because i imagine after all a even a one rap max which i've never done as a much a minite let us i get three raps on the overhead press and than i get i'm four raps on a waited pull up and hoing back and forth no doubt going to be breathing harder than if i was sitting there texting away on my phone in between sets yet of course you aint sentin fact in general one of things that all present of my class is a giant list a efact on the top s all these diffrent exles adaptations i started the conversation went on the the vertical column are as many of the physiological potential adaptations one would get changes in indogenist p h a blood pressure emphatic changeis bone tensity all these things writing os have this gentlist and then you can run a matrix and you can start to look at iofok k if i do speed training and my going to see changes the nerve nervous system well very much right that is the primary actour reason those things work very little change in the muscle system it is almost exclusively explaine by the central or perfal nervous system rang on that same token are you gen expect many carty of ask gradiptation from speed ananswers know because il thog we did not cover it speed is very low intensity very low reprange very high rest well as you go to strength and then you go to high percharfy you start seeing more and more increases in cart of ask gradaptations because you are doing exactly that right you are restarting to reduce rest and you arestarting to increase volume but you aregong t lose things bonemen al adaptations be cause the load sirs to go down you can look at this matrick kind understand if i'm a person who wants to kind of maximives the adaptations i get across my entire physiology for the a least amount of work you can choose these different adaptations to go wafter that are ging to kind of land on these things right and and exactly s you mention if you are going to take five minutes rest between each rap let us say the exstreme you are going to do three sets of one repetition for strength at ninety five per cent youregoin to take probably five may be seven minutes betwen each attempt you bettere not expect many changes in your resting lood pressure athere is no carty of askers strain there you egin t put it together in a circuit well ging to lose some potential strength adapttion but you are get to gain something there all these things are it is not about good or bad or right or wrong it is always about what at advantage you want what disadvantage do you want and i can cut really in to the chase here on one o tese things cause we will get to this eventually if you want to know the ones that are going to generally give you the most physialoni ough to adaptations across the most categories you are almost always looking for a perchabe trip of training and then's this anarobe of conditioning pece ill going to that is going t hit the most systems at once that is great to knowand we should deafinly i go a lobit deeper on those types of a what the modifial were verybles are for those categories cause i think that i'm gessing the vast majority of people want to be a bit stronger may be ad some a lo bit a muscle or more am get make sure their heart is healthy and et cetera a this is wonderful n i think is clarifying certainly a lot for me is for strength lhat's i gess training frequent frequency what should determine training for youuld see and i had the great a benefit o long time ago when i was in high school actually i paid for a a session over the phone with mike men sir oh e lee mike mens ar soa to be friends i a li o tra at the time i was pretty young and my mother kept saying ly wise is grown man calling the house and we would talk all the time about traing but he try to convince me to train once every five to seven days a very few sats very high intensity am and i must say it work incredibly well surelit was i think with my recovery a'm quotion which was not very good a thing is improved over time bit was not very good it was remarkable but of course this was the time when i was full of the most an a word ain my own version of a an allextioi outs if you really had he id a long arch of puberty an you were untrained ni was mostly untrain a been running cose countries and scape ward an in playing socker and doing wh t all the things that are the antithesis of greouse it was literally unpeople priz impossible to something forty pounds a muscle inside of twelve months it was crazy i ud believe but but and then of course that stopped working over time and then you start going down th the u'm the odysy of trying to fying the thing that is can a work that well in yew eventually realize that it was because you were untrained right a training frequency is is crucial let us say that people are doing these whole body work out as youve describe them not alternating upper body lower by cause there is many ifferent splits if we tauht does not pride does not make sense to go into i'm splits in right now but how often can canon should one train a muscle and how do if a muscle is recovered locally and how do if your nervous system is recovered systemically oc this is a bunch of really anges in questions i'm not sure exactly what right you on a goes i'll start here u'm as i mentionearlyor sorniss is not a good barometer of excise quality because some types of training ore going to induce more sornes as sum are going to inducless that is important to this conversation because when you ask about had you nofl muscles ready to train again why the question is what e training for if you are training for hypertrophy right muscle size muscle grol we need two headge towards recovery because what you are trying to do is cause a mass of insult there allow then protine senthesis to occur building of new tissue which takes time forty eight to seventy two hours by kind of out a minimum that proscess needs took her if you are doing actially more strength and this is a differentiation between hypertrian strength then you did not induce actioly much damage in fact you are generally not going to get very sore from true strength training very little unless you get really heavy did a lot the primary driver of hypertrophy is nolt the same primary driver of strength we talked about that arag that is intensity driven it for vol for hypircth beat's not intensity because we have different mechanisms we have different outcomes even nother closely a line strength is not on a cause lot of soreness therefore intensity is the driver therefore frequency can be as high as you want you can train every single day the same exact muscle if speed or power or strength ar the primary training training tols because you need stimulus there is skill as skill as well right practice that that as much as anybody developing a new motor pattern requires a lot of repetitions right you do not need a tremendous amount of rest that is not it is not a damage thing right it is a repatterning issue strength training in fact if you look at again true strength professional at leadst the're going to train the same muscles basically every day wel got a squat every day is that because the the primary mode of adaptation is recruitment of these high threshold motor units it is it is mainly nurral at nol at once can say that in this i get all fisty l i'm not saying that that was assue there was a question war if we were o line put in combets with ther bustion war we wour ofy withot a block you i just that is ot already one probbly twice im ol get the early adaptations to exercise specially straing training our heade towards the nervous system no question about it people always say central nervous systembut it is probably more purferal whatever sem antics probably but pedantic it is nerve if you train to day to morrow morning your nock can wake up with the actually increase in contract o protins and muscle youre muscle might be a bigger due to some acute swelling but you could have an in an pretty acuge that persists change in and the nervous system will call it that allows you to be stronger within a couple of days sustained hi perchfees probably more along the lines of four weeks wer we can see that right we can actually see changes in the ultury sound ow you are making changes immediately that proaching synthesis processis happening ik very fast and i's gon o last it jist takes us time to measure it in terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle sizes that being said the first four weeks we typicales they are primmarily anervous system after that now were see starting to see most of the changes coming from the muscle side of the equation wit strength development it is a commination of three areas in fact all muscle contraction has these same three things it startst off oth some signal right from somewhere in the body whether it is allway up the top or at the level of the spine depending on if this reaction or an actural conscious control from there that some signal hastic tell the muscle tho contract as signal is one two it is muscular contraction and here is a lot of variables inside the muscle tissue itself that determine its functionality and if we took an individual biopsine took a muscle fibr from you and took when from me and we took those muscles out and put them in a petry disio and i tied one end to a fore stranstucir the other end to a thing tha pulls it and we soaked it a bath of calcium and the munch o other stuff even if they were the same size your fibres might contract a lot faster than mine even relative to size i or not or slower or there is verious properties the intrinsic fibres themselves determined a lot of functionality from there muscle fibres do not caus movements muscle fibres simply contract they are all surrounded with connected tissue and that is all surrounded with a bunch of more connected tissue that all surround to do a muscle that muscle is in surrouded with more connected tissue that all comes together into a giant tendent that tendan attaches to the bone it is the pulling on those tendin that action move the bone the costumeand movement that is aryau three ary one the nervous system arya two the muscle contractionary three some sort of connective tissue thing change is happen at all three up those levels and we are not even now talking or even enter the discussion of bou mechanics than you changed say the penatian angle of the muscle which is the angle at which the muscle fibres lay relative to the bone rit this is bas if mechanics as it pulling perpendicular to the bone is a pulling horizontal to the bone or some sort of angle all of these things do termane human performance whenyou are talking about again that strength development you can see tremendous improvements in total force production by manipulating all of those areas and you have not touched changes in muscle size if you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion whether this is sorcaol plasmic or contract al protines you have given yourself more opportunity to produce more force it does not guarantee you produce more force i body builders are not stronger than power liters you ven know they have more muscle but body builders are probably stronger than most people there is a relationship between muscle size and strength its in this not a one to one guaranteed ratio and that is generally because the although the muscle has been aided they may have not change the bou mechanical considerations ay may i'm not change the connected tissue nor the nervous system and that is why we see this giant relationship that our value is pretty high between strengthan and pertry but if you really want to get to the ends of it it is not and that matters to your actual question ten minutes ago because again you can train strength daily on the same muscle but if you want to allow for that process of connect a contract ile protines to to add and grrol then youven a have to llow some recovery because if you go back into that muscle too soon you can have blunt the response you gen a stopic an a cut it off you have all kinds of of problems going on in the cell that are gotin im just attenuate that that growth response i gaveyou the answer for strength train the answer for a pertify is probably less than three out a ten on level of soreness you can go again in general you are probably looking at seventy two hours is the opthma window if you trained your your shoulders on monday you probably w dn't on a train in bagain on tuesday if i perchifies ago maybe wednesday maybe thursday's best something an every two to three day window is is probably and we do not we live it more now about why that is the gene cascade the signaling response happens will the signaling happens instantaneously right within seconds the gene casade is probably in them peeped in the four hour window the depending on which gene you want ao look at but is this kind of a snap shot but the proaching senthes's process is twenty four to fortyeight hour thing and it tends he cint of look let that thing finish and let that signal go back the base line and then had it again and then head it again and nows long as you are providing the neutrians the recovery should happen and you should be able to sustain the same work output in the training session the stimulas stays high and the recoveries ther r and you can now continue to grow mostle you mention forty eight to seventy two hours for hypertrophy what if be for whatever reasons athe the training split a life style factors et cetera somebody say let us use your example trains a shoulders on monday am ideally they would train them again on thirsday in theer particular instance somewhere wednsday or thursday but they do not they wait until saturday or sunday for whatever reason maybe it is more compatible with their work work another exercise scadual whatever the reason are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gainedwher they missd a window to induce further hypertroph it is probably better think about the latter it is not that your lost it suceyuve just come lost an opportunity to to make more progress im i will save you a little bit and can i going back to your hit programm this is the original high intensity training tha the mense are thing right it is not the hit with one eye not the high intensily interval training but high intensity training at re one set to absolute failure to maybe too for each muss the group twenty men at work out dividing your by in the three into a three way split and then literally training my ashing six times a month which must be would think that is absolutely crazy there is no way that is gon o work and i can tell you it if you are untrained you you grow a weed just if you train hard enough even i r trained look at the people mike trined he put a lot of body builders on really high levels now they had the same similar help you had at that time for any way to be very clear i was not ae fa has othoniss and abot in fact i w ainess was just as good ii probably was i was it measuring my levels there but i probably would i grew easy and gene in general itend to grow pretty easily am from wait training but theed but an i should say that to mike's credit and i think this is an important message tat he was the one who really said look ununles you'e gong to make a professional career out of it yedo not run the health hazards of exagenos mormons it it' certily not at your age he deturred me from that which was great because it never entered my mind it just was one o those things where i miht mencer said do not do it and he clearly done it right i'm soe speaking from an infortaned place it never entered my mind but also i was what was really wild as i was continuing to run across country a and there was it there was a a traide off there at some point of bit nor when you are young you can get many people can get away with to with what at this age would surely place me into a state of overtraining even at low volume wal yet well i mean the the whole field on interference effect has changed quite a bit i recently whige we cand come back to if you ont i'm but distant to finish out the the ido here wit that last question im if you want to take five days or six days fon between each mossgroup you can do that fact if you look at the research it is gon to show that frequency is not at important it will something it is unimportant but it is if you can handle changes as long as you get to the same total volume you can do that you just have to do a lot more work in that one work out if you care about the six week eight week thing yif you are i'm in this for the next sixty years it is probably o ke ri i'm but it can be there that the challenge with splitting up your training sessions for ipertropy into smaller numbers once or twice a week it is just difficult to get that number it is typical to get that volume done i'm volume wise the more recent medanalysies aregoing to say that youre probably looking out around ten working sets permussel group per week seems to be cott the minimum threshold that you are gon one a had if you did three sets of ten at your sholders on monday three sets of ten shoulders wednesday and three on frin tat's nine working sets if you wnted to duse three different shoulder work a exercises on monday and hit your nine sets it is not really acting you be dot much different the probalem is tan is kind of the minimo you probably want ta look for more fifteen to twenty and in fact well trained folks twenty twenty five that becomes very challenging in one work out ifact defuncule you ocan bel to do it rit and that is where it is not frequency thatloks it kills use tos uffect you have got to get because a total driver of strength is intensity but the total driver of hypercrview's volume assumed you are taking it to fatigue riter muskine ar failure it is just hafe to get enough done if you can i and if you want to set your scendrul up that way you probably remember if you do those types of training sessions where youre just goin a completely exhaust a muscle it is going to be tit it is can be sore for while you your your prob'bly not going to come back and that is sore the logic behind that will tust take the ting to tremendous failure and give it six days fo recover it can work is is not the best i think is one oing to think about formost people it is also hard to do those work outs without a training partner if you really want to do them grand stimulans and headphones and all kinds of others tear well away the ye stimulants are not i do not certainly do not recommend those it maybe a cup of coffee r to if that is your thing but im and maybe some of the safe for supplements but certainly not you sorts of stimulants that the guises in the seventies and eghtyes or noing its or sill ise or still use a you talked about repetition ranges broadly for strain training five or less yeyou said frequency could be as often as every day yet rest two to four minutes maybe even longer if you are going for one repetition maxum for hypertrphe sir what are the repetition ranges that are effective and what are the ones that are most effective if one is trying to maximise some of the other variables people do not want to spend more than an hour to seventy fivlin its in the gim because i think that a while the reranges might be quite broad as you lude to earlyer there is the practical there are the practical constraints ye what what repet ition range is or per cent of one re petition baxim om im should people consider one thing about hypr rit i'm the quick answer there is anywhere between five to thirty raps per set that is going to show across literature pretty much equal i birch feganes i'm and we can have areally interdiscussion about why that is but i'm just remembering one thing from a second a go it i wat to give a better answer for the requency you can do every single week for strength ar every single day for strength if you want though what is probably mentablly viable to twice for week permuscle hamstrings strang twice week that that is a good number to get most people really strong you can do every single day you do not need to o i whi want to make sure that i was not saying you have to train a muscle eight if i per cent every single day to get strong two is a good number threes great but probably even too is really effective got it this explains to the high frequency of of training for strangth athlets that is always mystified me yoad the very long work out to make sense pek is very long never naven' train twice a day even thittle squat in the morning squat in the afternoon everyday with they are eating in their sleeping the po doft have time for anything else lat's weather prose that is a job right that' what they do i'm ap your i perchapy i'm strength training programming itis somewhat complicated because of that is not the danger but you can have to pay one way or the other right the risk is a little bit higher cas he loads higher and you have to be little more tectically proficient when it comes to hypertre training the way i explain it is it is kondi idiot proof the programming is idiot proof the work is hard though youe usual range anywhere between your five reps an thirty can you get' somewhere n there perfect it is all equally effective you cannot screw that up the only caviat for hypercrby is you have to take it to muscular failure and you need enough rest for the adaptation and procingsensis it ocur yen if you recover faster you can may be doit more frequently and if you do not may be less frequelt and by that logic should people perhaps experiment and figure out what repetition range allows them to recover am in concert with the training frequency that they can do consistently my recommendation is i think you should actually set your a use the repetition range as a way to have some variation because most people do not want to go in tho gemity three sextend he ganto get very borne very quickly and i i think you should actually intentionally change the rept schemes for simple sake of having more fun it is a very different challenge the mechanisms that are in ducing hig perchby are different but there is only a maximel monigrowth that one can get right and you have as best we think it now and and some people actually well the spows that we know really clearly about the mechanisms of mosliperch we do not it it is still very much a guessing game but the three most likely drivers are one metaballic stress two mechanical tension and in three muscular damage you do not have to have all three one is sufficient you can have a little bit of one or two and you can con it se youget it to play here wev were t talked about the muscular damage a gan it is very clear more damage is not better but it is some what a decent proxy right u get a little bit of sornass is good yous do not get sorts compromising your total volume rit a mechanical tension is contalic strength this is why if you do even such a five or eight and your conicloses that strength en you will gain a little bit a muscle not optimal muscle gain but you are gingto gain some because everything in these my physiology is not cut off at four raps and then five raps is at different thing right it is it is always a blend think of it as a a fading curve and you get closer to the end it fades less effective as you get closer to the middle it is more effective anywhere between eight rep's per set the thirty it is equally effective past thirty it is gen a blend out past eight te five to forto threetscen a blend we know less or there metable extress is en the damage is the othe or sarry me canical tension is the one that is heavy a muscle damage yele one a third one is metable extress and this is im i get a e bit of an airy of scientific contention but something is there i know somethings there we just were just cont of fumbling to figure out what exactly it is and this is metabale extress is the burn right it it is there i it is why blood flow restriction training probably works that is done very light ser no mechanical tension there is very little damage but somehow it induces a go at amount of hypertrophy very painful yuly boy i tried this i 've a friend forer specihal operator who was on the east coast and took me through a blood flo restriction im training protocallin at harken i i do not think i i actually cried what o probably but i might have cried out once or twice it was unbelievable especially the lower body moveme yes i now was a humid day i'll claim awill bit a gelt no but no it was brutal it was really brutal and i ol ot te best year your life in still brutle oke well that manes we feel lov it better it was intense i and im and a people should know that it is important to use the proper cuffs for these things i do not have any a relationshiptaning the companies tat sell these cuffs but the reason is that yashly eed to block particular avenues a blood flow you cannot simply sinch owful muscle weu cannot turnic get a muscle and train not a g can actually i kill yourself that way i an gt boodclot yet you and im if your interest in bloodflow restriction train aimagine you have some content about this or will at some point but also there there are resources on line that people can et out yet a a question about hypertrophy train i think many people are wondering about train to failure or do not train to failure assuming good form ye assume a good fom great im the answer is both you want a train to failure but you do not need to go to extreme failure you do not need to necessarily go to that a partner has to lift the barble off my chest but you have to get close you have to drive either heavy stress damage right or or pump and i really easy practicall to think about this sun i heard mike is your tell runs coming on retisence peurtization years ago out line this at a and i see talk and it was beautiful i thugt this is a most eloquent way to explain the context about traingri pirchfe only tolook for three things in your work out and let us say tht youel how on a particular muscle to grow that is say you hat your glutes to get larger o when ofre doing your glued exercises nowver one are you feeling the glue to contract ook ae does not have to be there but that is a good sign if it is ok a let us say i did not really feel my glue contract i felt it more my clods or my back o ke did you feel a big pump afterwards now i dn't rally to a pump there either words ordering o ga grigt ofm with three next day did you feel little bit of soreness there at all no i did not wel tat's a very goo inda catre did not feel it durin the work out you felt no sort of pump and it did not get sore do not expect much growth did not has tributed the work across a bunch of muscle group alljust likely other muscle groups were too involved right especially if you are no but man my back ot really wel that is a really good indication of telling you what the hell was moving and in terms of targes if you were to put i get a one ta you ten scale how much should i feel it burning during anything less than a three kate's probably not doing mytray but it does not seven is not a ten is not better than seven you need to feel it but it does not have to be whole my gosh i'm dying here sornus same barometer right if you can get three three and three you are probably in a prettygood spot five five and five is may be better but you do not need to go much past that i want you to feel the muscle group either working or if you i did not feel e much when you rey to pump the next day got really sore then youe gour still you knoing ont a good path i i gain really sore is in who little tender but next day it is okey they after that i could ike oul train no probeb that is really what you want to go after and im terms of understanding is this likely to produce some growth or not excellent excellent very clear perameters and recommendations i know a benefiting men benefit a lot of people if you be willing to throw out a few sort of sets in t e ret perameters that could a act is broad guied lines op people who want to a explore further it i realize that with all these modifiable veriables that there is no one izes fit is all for strength i love this five to thirty for hipurtrophy tha but o thing do not thin i've ever done a thirty reps at of anything but but now that you have hrown that out that i see it is a bit on at all in possum about thirty you areging to get an insane pump you get a burn crazy but you will not get supersore as om can tentions tolot low it is light you you can you can get away with those things and you it is hard because your mind is go wonder you d get it reptwiing you' ma come done and you' now there is there is a lot left here to get thirty were a set of ten is is much easier you just o qitoom more toomore sat thirty's i got sixteen more s it is awful but you are not counting is work it is tot tair pri and people tend o dis kind on check out thirty's possible but alittle bit excrame extreme but iw'ld recommend a all of em that it is a really fun plat you can do different in the same work out two by the way you can do one set of ten a push ups and then take litle break and then to a set of twenty fine ley you can you can mix in masc these things i'm there is no magic recipy that has to happen for all thos or do it different mondays are my sets to ten days wednesdays are my set of twenty days and fridays are my set a thirty days and you can have all kinds of fun there and it is hardess grew up great that phrase is always reassuring for strength is very a sets in reps pro to call that you have that is a pretty sure fire wait a to just think about a really fast answer for power weill spee power instrength is what i oes call thethree to five concept re i pick three to five exercises if you are feeling better that day choose in the higher end if you'r feeling less that day or you have a shorter time frame the train go less theres to be three cets or thre exercises rather or five exercise most three to five exercises do three to five reps three to five cets take three to five minutes rest in between and do it three to five times a week that can be as little as three sets of three for three exercises three times a week that is that is a twenty men ute work out three times a week it can be as high as five sets of five for five exercises five days a weekso it is very broad and allows people to still stay within the domains of strength and power while still being able to move and contor tor their lifestyle and an soreness and time in all those things the only differentiator to pay attention to between power and strength is intensity if you want strength this is now eighty five per cent bluss of your macx rim if you want power it needs o be a lot lighter cause you need not be move more towards the velocity and the spectrom because power is strength multiplied by speed while getting stronger by definition can help power you probably want to spend more of your time in the forty per cent te seventy per cent rainge pluster minus that is it both tem concepts we the work everything else the exercise the reps the the frequency all that can be still in the tree to five range just change the intensity depending on wyshout come you on the nervous sistem obviously plays an important roll at the level of nerves controlling the contraction o muscle fibres but of course we have these upper motor ner ons which are the ones a reside in our brain that control the lower motor ons the control muscle and this takes us into the realm of were the mind is at during au particular movement and to me this is not an abstract thing i can imagine doing work outs that are mainly focussed on strangth er mainly focust on hypertrophy and in the case of strength an mi trying to move waits and when i'm trying to generate hypertrophy it mit trying to quot in uot challenge muscles in other words if i just trying to move awaight away from my body o you push pushing a bench press or an overhead press i do not know that i want my mind thinking about the contraction of my medial dealts i think i want my mind in getting the weight overhead with the best proper form best excuse me and proper form and certainly with hypertravy training best improper form i's going to be the target as well but that simple or i should say subtle mental shift changes the patterns of nerve fibre recruitment can we say to get stronger fokcuss on moving weights still with proper form and safely and to get hypertrophe fokus on challenging muscles still with proper form and safely it is very fair yeas is a snapd on answer it is a very fir thing to think about im intentionality matters for both in other words if you look at some interesting science has been done on power development and speed development the intent to move is actually more import thn the actual movement blocity if if you are doing say something for power or strength and you are doing just enough to get the bare up that will result in less improvements in strength than even if youre moving at the exact same speed but you are intending to move faster and this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters if youare coaching enoughi through a power work out ospecially and they are doing enough to just lift fifty per cent the wonder at max it is not going to generate as much speed development as them trying to move that bar as fast ti cannot even if the net result is a same myr byvelocity terms out nerves matter that is i men i a si i say amazing but as a nersantis if i say amazing the nerves mar what is amazing to me is wtif i understand correctly what you are saying is that even if the bar is moving at the same speed same waight yeuif my internal representation my thoughts are i'm trying to move this as fast as possible youverses i'm just trying to get the bar away fom me and and get the weight up i'm going to get different out comes yet this is quality of workright this is did you do enough to just check off the box or did you actually strive form adoptation i similar concept act your works rit pertrophy in terms of there is a handful very recent studies tat av look that will call the mind muscle connection and this is doing things imagine a by sepcrel and you are simply looking and watching your bisips n you are thinking about contracting at harder even thoug you execute the same repetitions at the same exact intensity and national indications are the mind body connection are going to result in more growth then not you just gave i authorization for for people to look at their muscles pleaiding in the gim please do yeh of course right is is but thesolity is still ruled out i'd rather you look atyour muscles in your form i'm fine ofh it im those are inition we do not have a large depth of research to support that and may be some suff will oming counter but it it does it matches what folks thot community of the same for a very long time ri here is actually some stuff on simply flexing an between if you vercing a body bl ther that they will do their set of bice of crilles and thn e'll get ou ma flexinal check andtat they'r littly this is arnald did right this is if you go back to pumping in iron wore college wait rooms i can say i he for some reason there is something about that age group ye there is a lot of checking of bisepts in college way rooms for reasons that es escape me if you ever interact with my wife yo she will be the first to tell you i cannot walk past a meror without check on something ot that you cannot i cn i cannot ok not hurt me i'm got i cannot iwell then i'll be careful not to desparage then has nothing to do with the hypercrap ovut 'v dislike i'm a muscle gat some always thinking and tinkkering ary whatever but yet it is a i thnk it is very much worth your time to do a higher quality training session be more intentional be present then just executing the same as ik work od i think that is gloably very clear to be to your d vantage if you thinking i'min it i do not won t work out to day i got all this going on or a tired of whatever i'm just gon to do the work i nnways get through it oke if you can go what though i'man a cot fifteen minutes out of this thing h get my head right i'm a good too twenty minutes of quality work done that is that is your best option by far you alluded to the fact that am even just looking ato particular muscle might a benefit in terms of the number fibrs you can recruit or exits potential for hypertrophy ai've heard before and i certainly i have experience that muscles that for whatever reason genetics or o sports that one played et cetera muscles that a we find that we can contract to the point of almost the slightly painful contraction seem to grow more readily than muscles tat we cannot recruit very easily and im and there and the reas i mention sports that we played earlier as i'v b just afte watch yhe olympics to see that you swimmers obviously are very goody engaging their lats am you look the chimness they seem to be very good engaging everything ye and they go through a fuge number of different dynamic movements that explains that am i find that if people say oh younw i cannot get stronger in this or my a whatever body party is weak interms of iiminability to engage hypertrophea i seer that oftentimes that can be because of an inability to ject that to engage those upper motor ner ons to deliberately isolate those muscles im are ther ways that people can learn to i engage particular muscle groups more effectively over time forsake of hypertrophy or strength or for cases of trying to overcome injury potential or injury because in balance als ar bad i across the board yet this is actyu very common and i think every one is probling on to this there is some part that you just cannot get going for me that was lats that was a r enboyd my back muscles for years i could not activate my lats or my ronboys seze the the muscle groups that connect your shoulder blades o shrut a squeeze your shoulder place together that set a muscles ther cull your ronboyds i'm your lats of course or more vertical and and pull your cot up and down a no matter how many lat pull downs i did bent rose pull upsi could never see any developmenthere no increasein strength and it took me prubby decade to figure out how tho held actually get these things on in fact if you would hav asked me even in my collegers as a collegebl uplayer a flex your lats show me your lats you would have seen no no movement there i'm when i was doing a pull up in that paricular case the only way i can get the bar to move was be was by using my biseps i sa senagis muscles suppose to be a secondairy or terturary muscle in that movement but for me it was primer because of my over strength in my biseps comcoupled with my lack of activation in the lats you are compansing the same movement actually a kind of easyly to think about this is imagine doing a bet row imaging you are you are bent over cout ob out o forty five degree or horizontal angle andyou are a pull a a barbell to your belly buton i now you can actualy do that exact same movement with very little back muscle activation by simply flexing your elbows more and you think you are the barbols going all theway down as comingall they up to touching my belly and you think you are doing a great back development exercise hen in fact because of the way to you'r executing the movement you are gttng very little back development and this is an a really good example of why someone has done a specific exercise many many many times be at failed to see development in a muscle group which goes back to earlier part of our conversation which is why exercises themselves do not determine theadaptation it is the execution the matters right it is the technique et's the rep range all those are going to termine your actual result if any time you were your you are banging your head against the wall and thinking why am i not getting movement here growth or strangt whatever it is almost one of those it is guarantee to be on of those areas right you'r probably not getting i'm the muscle groups to actov a in that particular example just because we are here try iimagine doing that bent rode instead of pulling the barbol to your belly squeeze your shoulder blades together first as far as they can possibly go and then bring your elbows up with out changing the angle of your elbow tho werds without bringing your hand closer your shoulder keep that same angle come up as high as you possibly can and then finish out the movement that is going to guarantee a a utilization first of the back muscles and a a finishing with the biceps i'm at the end which is how that movement is supposed to go how do you coach in to that well it can be a number of things whenever i'm dying nosing movement quality i look for a handful of things but very first one as a wareness you be surprise how many folks when you simply tell them that muscle group right there and maybe you givem a a tactical prompt you touch it or you put something against it i'm this is actually why iam jumping over th ace but this is why athings a belt work very well for actually increasing of dominal strang a a mis conception ut there as if you wear a belt when you are lifting then the belt can a does all the work for you in your abs get weaker that can happen but the exact opposite can happen as well if you take a belt for exampleing and you sent it down really tight and then you just completely disregard your midsection you will see a loss of strength in your midsection bcause now the belt is doing the work butf you put the belt on just a little bit kind a tight werl yu get some censory feet back and you think about using that belt is a way to activeate the cor musketure you will act to see higher and if we look out en g actavation the cor muscles would be activeated higher to greater extent then when the belt is off because a propriorceptive ye hundred percent and for those thati ar wondering what purpriacept if he back is probyo set if yo back is that i their nerves a that extend out to the muscles that control muscle contractions but then there are censoryin puts from the skin and muscle that go back into the nervous system in those work and in concert and that that he back is proprioceptive i thing it it literately translates to a knowledge of wear one's limbs t are and what is happening on those inamase yet i've am seen i do not you i do not have a training partner but i've seen a in jim's weares some will be training in some on would tap the muscle of the person who is doing the work in order to at with this is concentual tapping of other people's muscles not a walk around any tuching people's muscles please am that to provide that popraceptive fe back that that person doing the exercises it becomes more aware of the muscle that theyre spost to be training and it seems that that is probably an effective practice ye a i give you two examples toll go o the back with that pulling movement andw then i'll stand the belt treagly quickly a very easy example that you can do right now ow listening andi learn this from bryne mackens heare mutual frend rt if you take your hands and open am up im you make an ell with both your hands nd now take those and put hem around your waist just above your hipbons now what i want you to do is press out as hard as you can on your hands with your cork and you can feel a lot of coractivation most people think coractivation is the front of your stomach right your six back but you need to do as great a cylinder around your back it is the front it is the side and it is the back if you take your two fingers point them now put them just outside your bellybun can you move your fingers why just moving your hadmuscles ninety per cent of people can sict do yes same exact thing now go to that same position just above was called your aasia o your anterior superiorics by right up that frontier hipbon rin the front can you now move great fifty per cent of people are not cnto getty movement there really take your thumb and go right above your pasies my what ps iis posterior speriot i expine right now can you move most likely now sor riv i do a many low back extension do not just with your core muscature verily ye maybe it nin prsanty people cannot if you cannot perform that contraction you cannot stableige your spine only wait to get stablization you'r spyine is then to go through hyper extension and now thare's a compression stratage you'r putting in your spyine it is better than rounding your back i can going forward but over extension is not great either you wont to e able to flex the musketure in a cylinder fashion you have con con control if you go back to our very first things and with your hands open and you put im my here and if you are i cannot get activation if you pay a tention your thumb right now just move your thum and now you see activation back ther ra bon't now if you can imagine turng that on just a little bit and now notice how i can do this by the way at the same time i'm talking ifyou have to go we dn't hae control right s you have to beel the separate breath from brace now if i can put my possessself in position and and kelly starit as alwa said twenty per scent you me twenty per cent activation here and now i can squat i can hinge i can jump i do not neen to be lock down o on to prer sent scream to be able to brace my spine that is can be in effective and wasteful on to be here with a belt provides that propra septive feed back orei can put it on twenty per cent nd it is justis a reminder if i do not press against the belt the belt slides and falls down a little bit it is not on superteight if it is on dang tight doing the work and forget s we just want a little bit of feed back there same thing with your upper back for having a difficult time activating those romboys of those lats somemon can do a simple thing whre they take their finger put a right betwen your shoulder blates and you just tell them things hase squeeze my finger squeeze my finger as you are doing your bent row ver your pull down you can touch the lat you can do i'm just visualization stuff just imagine a three de rendering of that mustergroup and you are watching that muscergroup contract it is very powerful and very effective i'm to do it a touch am a visual all the stuff can help get people i to activate outside of simple awareness im typically e centric overload it is a very effective way for a activation of a difficult to target muscle the lowering of the bar or the lowering of the weight the movement of theway away from the body it is not a cssarily was lowering casat can a depends on whater sure by doing rat miss things a pullup case if if if i'm going to do a pull up and i have poor lat activation i can still get the pull ot muscle movement executed by contraction of the by sebsance things that however to make the movement simpler i'mw an to goall thway to top magin stepping on a box or something going all the ay to that top withtoat pull op position and starting from thate i want you o simply lower it unyour control and yu just simply breaking the movement down into smaller pieces that allow you to to focus on the execution more it is going to be great e centrics are greate for strength development very good for hypertrupy and allow you to folks on control i i i'm wiling to bet a huge percentage of you out there whof i've never had a sore lat you not done a lot of pull upsand things that if you do that escerntric only youll probly wake o the next ting on ol gah i feel it there and that is the sign even if you did not feel it in the work out but it got a little sore the next day keep down that path and an eventuallyou be able to do a concentric maybe take a brak maybe do an iceometric we just whole that position an eventually work that into it and to a progression where you can do the concentric es centric and have some metric portions and get activation that that may take you six weeks may take these six months but that is generaly a pretty good strategy for learning haw act thay a musclegro terrific suggestions is it true that e centric a emphasized movements might require a little bit longer recovery ere they lead to more soreness than thecentric movements yet thet they typically can bu theyre also higher force out but very good for strength development but they are going to lead on average two more sorness more pretential for interest tell you a desruption that is can be associate with pain there is there is not as much o people will explain muscle soreness as a result of mycrotrama and mycrotares the muscle that can happen but that is not the norm most the time it is things destruption of calcium that is gon to lead to excess of swelling ecessof pressure and that is cing to be then translated as extreme paints that is probably explaining more muscle soreness then actually mycrotrama rufic i was going to get to breathing later but maybe just for now if we can do a a a brief we will foy into to breathing as it relates to wait training is there a a prescriptive for how to breathe during resistance training here i'm thing with waights no necessarily body waight only movements although i suppose it could be that applies seventy five percent of the time just seventy five per cent the people what i was taught and i'm hoping you can teld me this was wrong because then there might be more benefits that awaiting me but is that i should exhale on the effort an inhale on the less sir effort portion of an exercise is that true is there a better way to breathe there is a better way to think about it number one if you can breathe an brace in this conversation goes away you can main remain a you can maintain intrid muscular intradominal pressure whi'll breathing then i do not really care when you breath very challinging to do at very heavy waights if we flag this on two areas of a paradime paradime one over here you are ging to do a cet of thirty and you do front squats where a barbell is sitting on your throat if you do not take abrath this is going to and one way in one way only you passing out clearly has to be some breating stravity the other end of the spectrom is let us thay yu can i do a vertical jump you do not need any amount of breath there it is never can happen right the question is what about the middle d i'm doing some sort of strain training there well number one make sure you are brace and then you can get away with less need to wory about it i'm in general a a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold during the lowering or ecentric or most dangerous part of the movement and then you can exal on the concentric portion if the bench bresses are example if you held in bract lowered in a control and now start ed the concentric pushing away for it and then you wanted to take an expiration during the last half the concentric portion that that is ano case trategy if you are going to do a single rep you doft need to worry about it you you can just avoid or omit breathing entirely you can be just fine if you are doing more than that especially three to four to five to seventy you can have to have some breathing strategy a very common one is im probably every third breath i'mant t do ex cele the third reset rebreathe something that if youf you' you need to breathe after every one at docay but it isgon to get wastefulkcou you hve to take time and between reps of sitting there if it is a squat that is different i perss a dead lift if you are resting the bottom that there is little bit a game here in general those as that seventy five seventy five contraly thrown out if threw out breathe in do the lowering an exhale on the out if you have to last reps do not worry about more reps than you need come up with some sort of breathing strategy about breathing in between sets a and maybe even after the work out ye this is only i thing a lot of people overlook and because the it is the case that recovery has to do both with the specific activation and a to muscles and the nervous system but also the tacks on the nervous system can also take place between sets imif you are really geured up between sats and you go to dreddle and as high and between sets ore close to it as you are dduring your sets you can imagine that the recovery would take longer or at least that you are not spending a drendlein in most sufficient way if there is such a thing ye far you are not nta see any aftly that i work with just breathein between whether it is in between anings or in between rounds every single one them's going to go back sit in the stool and there not immediately be into a breathing rertane a very intentional one the're litop at different for ratly depending on the sport even a p ja golfer there is ging to be a we just set our ball yore moving the next one were gog to going to breathing strategy every one omit is it is a huge area a potential benefit and consequence if you are just ignoring it i'm in general we want to do any sort of calming breath we want ta restore it depends on if the it is pensil wore combating or combmanding low oxygen or high seal to that strategy's goingo be little bit different but in general that is a huge time opportunity to get better in fact om people can go back and listen to some of your earlierpitols o you talked about wil you have spoken about i think on the show when a norposticity works and if you are losing that opportunity post exercise you are leaving gains on the table if you well not only are you to see everything out thay set i work with mostly have a breasin tratity in competition we are not going to just finish a work out hig five drink water and walk out f o you there will be a down regulation strategy that is heavily involved with some sort of light control as well as breath control i'm the individual prescription on that there is a ton af variation with what you can do the easiest thing is do something that calms you down most likely that is going to be moved towards as much neils or breathing as you can possibly do and ia really easy rule thom is a double exhal length relative to anhow if you need to take a i for second in hale double that time and breathe out for eight seconds a box breathing is find equal in hal equal hold equal ex hale equal hold for second in hal for second acts hold at cecor et cetera a triangle is fine too there is a lot of ways you can get really complicated what bryane mc kenzio will do in rob those guies have youget all kinds of systems for in hale lex si control in can be op tomise but some strategy of calm i'm we are gone almost always put you on your back or close andthe were n to cover legth i'm we can do some we have done actually a number of a musical interventions as well but you can as just as simple as sit down a lockroom if you have to and just breathe for five minutes that alone is can be productive that is great ifyou are breathing in the locker room for five minutes i sujest closing your eyes or yu get some funny looks and if a you will still get funny looks but you will not see people looking at you exactly a i love this and i started doing this because you and brime mc kenzie informed me about this and it completely change the rate of recovery for me i realize that i was leaving work out both endurance work out and strength apertrophy work outs feeling great but looking at my phone getting right into yoail and meatingri not concentrating onl my breathing and all i did was to introduce a on your recommendation a five minute down regulation exhaile emphasied breathing a a a bunch of different brady's physiological size box breathing extaile emphasized t twice as long as the in hal coma component for five minutes and i noticed two things one i recovered more quickly work out to work out no question about it yet the numbers am told me that and the other is at i used to have this am dip in energy that would occur three or four hours after a hard work out and i always thought that had to do with the fact that i generally eaten a meal at some point post work out turns out it was not the meal at all ye it is at that that a drennland am ramp up during the work out i was in clamping that at the end and i think eventually it isly thrashed and then three for hours later i'm a having a hardtime even reading what is on the screen in my computer thinking mabe it is the screen maybe was what aight lunch turns out the down regulations allowed me to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever yet it is really been quite powerful and saw it grateful to you for that nd i think this is something that i think ninety eight per cent of people are not doing and it is only five minutes you u you hae to o five give me three if you really have to push it give me three and you can even do this you can safe time you can do this in the shower f we have to you are you are done you are finish drink awater whatever has to be and you are getting a shower you rering you ready just give me three minutes the shower it is not ideal but as little as that it can pay huge divitence you need some sort of internal signal that were safe throtdle down here mor an a move on that has to happen ii it co gone on here but i i think we are maken the same point cin on over again it is this big deain to it and you are saving energy im in the energy here is nurl energy i think fighters do this good fighters learn to do this between rounds yesprinters learn to do this between events i think human should learn how to do this between any i sort of interval type activity including work shgagemen i men is osuch a powerful too do this for one minute after every important whether it is an individual high volital interaction or if it is as you jistid a nice forty five minutes sprent to work and your deep intorit when ever find just give me one minute set your larm just one minute and that also well pay dividence i love it and as i said it is made o ea outsize a different positive differance on my training but also activities outside my training which is for me i'm not a professional lathlet i train for health and because i enjoy it but when a really hard work out starts interfere with the ability do the other things in life that is not a good situation this is ruly terrific there is a lot more in each of the those categories of strength and am hypertrophy but you have given us a tremendous amount of valuable information there maybe now would be good time to shift to endurance and of the four types of endurance im it maybe could remind us what those are what do you think or the two that most people are seeking or pursuing in terms of health and aesthetics right i' ma realize that we probably have athletes out there as well but think am when i think health in the satics i think o cave the ability to do sustained endurance thirty plus minutes of some on going activity how does one maximize that work i whater the modifiable variables and then maybe could tell us what the the other major category is yet that people ought to have in there i'm kit whem starting off with exercise choice one thing as soon as we cross into the endurance world and this is true for all for those categories exercise choice seems to be very concerned with ecentric landing you do not need to avoid it but you need to recognize it relative are compared against those other strength and speed onces the volume is low onmose ones o you have some e entric absorption its oa kav but as we sort of talked about five minutes ago more ecentric means greater chance to muscle damage sortess if you take something and magnify it across thirty minutes or even five minutes but af maximal exertion you have a recipe for blowing up you can imagine i have not run and forever and i've just of listen to this seerman lapodcas and a'm okake omin to get into my zown toe training whatever and i start jogging i mut do i no i remebe when i was i used to buility to twenty five and you just do a twenty five minute jog the ar nount of e centric landing that just occurred on every single step becaus yu're never with running even slow running you are never have two feet on the ground the same time it is a one foot land one foot land youre entire body mass pluss gravity unto one leg at a time repeated now hundreds of times that e centric landing is gone to cost tremendous sornis you are quads ar gin ta go you'r a probably genyget shinsplince which is with this isn those entirely cause by ecentric landing im in when the tissue is not ready to tolerate that if you are not landing correctly this is when ne pain happens back pain shoulder neckpain cause wem compensation any time we start pressing to fatigue let us be very concerned with there mi initial i recommendation is start with activities exercise choicewise that are mostly concentric base think about a cycle when you are riting on a bike you are pushing the petal but yu're never landing and absorbing it you could go out into a forty five minut bike rie you are not goingto get that sore because ir's not a lot af ecentric load i'm swimming similar thing here wright there some ecentrics when you are hand it is the water but fairly menalmost mostly a push push push push push no load rowing similar thing mostly concentric i'm pushing a sled is fantastic going up hill running or even walking hard up hill all good cause here very minimal landing relative to running down hill which youl be a very very bad idea i'm to start when yif you are hch first jumping into these things progress your volume for endurances very slowly if it involves ecentric landing it really bad strategy we be to jump in and do say circuit training class tat involves a bunch of boxjumps right this is not a good way a to do your first bore ray into conditioning you are going to get incredibly sore because you are jumping in landing you are not looking at three to ten ex bodyweight in terms of absorption with a single land even if you just jumping be careful of that i'm in any of those endurance areas of exercise choice what to pick pick the one tha you are most technically proficient an becaueyoue cnto do it a lot its can be lot of re petitions whatever one you feel the most joyin if that is rowing great that is pushing a sled it does not really matter i'm you can do this actually with waights as are preferred way by the way with our athletes we might do a thirty minutes circuit where we do a five minute farmers care ry with a petty likhe ways you just in a carry some waits in your hand an uscn a walk up and on the street for five minutes ayouou jus set that down and the youre gong to do say a three minute plank and n you to pick that up when yu'regotg ndo body weight squats lik slowly and just temple and you non do handful of different exercises the out thes do not get superboard or a very simple one at the thirtyment work out ten minutes on a trid mell ten minutes on a bye ten minutes on orar for those yoither a my got i cannot do thirty straight menues r running o break it up in to three or four diferent exercises that ar all fairly save that is how i would do that long duration piece ot it frectise choice and then in terms of heart rat during that that period i mean how much tention shuld we pay to this i the don a very broad am prescriptive i've thrown out on this podcas a fow times pase on my rea of the literatures for most people that are oriento toward health including people their workng on size and strength gains i pertpen strength of course a that getting a hundred and fifty two a hundred eighty minutes have called zone to cardio ye a can just have a cop just barely have a conversation but if one were to push any harder you would be able to that kind thing its just a as a a va generic recommendation that almost everybody should follow in order jus keep their cardy of ascular system healthy but i know there is a lot of new aunts there and some people would to be able to run continuously for an hour at speed right i'm ye i'veyous not sprinting but what are some of the am finer finer points on yet long distance en durance i how often should one do it ookay a frequency con do ita daily i even when straingth doing strength and hyper no question wth i thing is an important point for people here icause a lot ofyou will tink thathey are going to greatly di minish their strength and hypertrophy nd youre gaims as it is often called am by doing in is own to cardio zon too you have almost no ability to block your hpertropy zon't too truly its leally within that category if your talking about conversational pace there is very e fact there is strong reason to think that is not an influence ipertrophy for the overwhelmin te drorting people an might even help it by increasing blood flow to the very absolutely a does it matter let say some one's doing primarily strength and hypertrophy there they are primary goals ar strength and hypertrophy and then they are going to do hey're gingto hit that hundred and fifty two a hundred eighty minutess own to cardio per week assuming their breaking that up into three or four sessions does it matter if they do it in the same work out before were after does that matter a i tend to do just by way of example for people certainly i'm just one a one example i tend to do a resistance training one day then i'll do zon to cardio next i jog cause that is the thing i prefer then i'll but do straint hupper to re train the next day and then in jog for mis own too cardio and then i take one ful day off a week i've never actually done the zon to cardi on the same day but were i to do it on the same day would it matter if i did it before after my my strength of percha returining not really you are gin to be just find interference of facts the interference of fact is what the scalled this is all the way back o nineteen eighty a bob pickman stoff right and an he was actually working in a lab with john alazi whose one of the the fathers of exercised bou chemistry and the sore the story goes it i hickman came in he was the strength training guy and and lasin almost all those initial exise physiologist were conditioning folks right it is almost always swimmers and runners a that is why a bulk of the exercise physiology historically is is shaped in that direction in tose sciencis were interested him hickman was there in the labin in the how much of this is myth or not whoretheyknows but the story goes i that this sort of chipping back and forth and yeuknohow from a piago postock kan haw that rasing works lttle bit and eventually lyca got usto running with us and he was you gossor lifting with me and con it goes back and forth well whens n that ecquasion it is not the postock right it is the pe i gets itin is hicmans is ocay finds we stretch running with lazi an n eventually such realize i'm getting weak i'm losing strangth tan i got jus canp i thnk is his bench pr specifically was going down or maybe a squat and can murber who knows it is even real but point is 's going along and themintialy sorts to crat alitle bit of animosity and i's actualy on is good for me and then bababa and they did what any good sciencis or do and said well let us find nout right and that he run a really famous experiment where he took a group three groups one group did a a endurance piece r at the steady state cartya one group did a strength training piece and then the third group did both f those work outs combined not a reduction both both volumes stacked on top of each other and the results are efairly predictable in turms of the endurance group only had the greatest increases in viel to maxs an endurance marker is the strength training group by the greatest increases and most slie perturve but where the interesting part was an where this whole field started was the combined group since his concurrent training is what a sgenerally called you'r oing concurrent things and typicay that means hypertry in strength stacked on top of some instay statein durance in the same work same same same wort ao our block or same weak it does not really ik an be got cind of all these well the concurrant group saw the same improvements in beal two macts as the endurance group and he is lik woka the strength training did not compromise the endurance atptations however they saw much lower increases is strengthan i pertory and it was the conclusion was the edition of endurance work compromised most of growth and strength development however the edition of strength training to your endurance work well not compromise your endurance gains now that second piece has been shown countless more times right if you an endurance atly adding strength training is almost always going to be massively beneficial very little chance of jecturemen fon it is why every durance out ladies can have some sort of strength and power component to their training the controversy though came in the interference effects o how much in durance training really blocks muscular development and for ye ureis myself included was we preached hard you do not do not do these two things at the same time a my friend my colleace even meric has as a really nice reveuarical jimmy bagley those two gites put this cing ound you go read that a were they cover all these things they have got some nice figures in ther but the general answer here is interference effect is sort of real but it is probably greatly overblown it matters you talking about a twenty minute jog at conversation pase that is probably doing very little a with the assumption that are you doing in eascentric bass exercise running wil then you cen have more of interference effect than cycling that makes a tonocense if you think about a right what is your total energy in tic if your eating sufficient calories you can still be an anabalic state if the edition of extra energy expenditure sall it realy is mark the cardio put you in a negative energy state it is being it is goen become very difficult to go through annibalism those things matter a if you are talking about doing running a few lapse aroun the tract as a warm up that is not interference effect what were really talking about as a big volume performed consistently now after hickman came out this paper paper nineteen eighty people followed it up in the nineties in to thousands with mechanism and we started o look and see we sare to se ha thereis this sell sidnlin pathway that goes down calle m tor an d that is what leads to muscle growth and then on the other side of tht equasion as a thing call am p qu which is more asso ciated with mitocondreobile genesis an endurance and there is as little moleculon between at the time most people would point to t c too well turns out am pqu activation is fine if you active at m tour as no bearing on m p q but if you active a the m pqutes can actof a t cy too which in hiedam tor and it was we had practical outcome i eed hickman you are gingto get weaker now we had mechanism s that story became very very strong at this interference effect this is how science should work right when you see mechanism match up with practical human outcome strong as we on iet was still wrong them it w just took more science right this is why we always have to give science a bit of time and a u have to be willing to to follow right and again even me in the field who has a practicion of background and science i felt very strongly this is a big problem it just dinteroun to be the case a nough studies came out whereo my oq it is probing not that bigadeal unless the eastt the movement is heavily ecentric base the volume is very high youre trying to macim ie mostl growth and energies not controlled if that is not all the case interference effect is probably not something most people should worry about a when you specially whn you compare that against the well roundedness that you need for total physiological health probing ot big o very reassuring me dear because i do enjoy lifting waigts that i rea ly enjoy running and i love running outside i believe i used to experience the interference effect when i used to do a very long run on sundays i would just go for out for you two hours or yot that i do not know that i ate enough for who knows i was feel i enough for a more a my love to eat but that long sunday run always made it hard for me to make fraggressive yeum i gains in strength and hypertrophy in the gim where as when i cut that to thirty minutes three or four times a week i do not see any interferance of at at all proby bereal and i have not trained specifically for endurance in a very long time i do not i have not experience the non interferance effact which as you said before most if not all endurance athlets probably ar at leas should be doing some sort of strangth wore just to keep the under carriage strongness i think yet there is buncariesi apotye t what are some proto calls that people could explore for continuous indurance training and ad i've thrown out this hundr or fifty to hunder and eighty mitzon to cardio but that is really the u that is really the kind of kinder garden of endurance yum and there i'm pri bein generous is by the nursery school of endurance that every one should do what sorts of other proto calls i realize thit can be very gold directed but is it unreasonable for instance for somebody to do four hours of z of continuous indurance training with intervals in there is well to get it kind of all around hart health and the ability to go long distances ye i'll answer this to is the very first one the tackle the the long duration andurances however pert f it im you asked really about heart rays on a to me that is almost whotaly a rell of it it' at does not matter right if you are moving your moving that is that is the functional piece here im i you want a push it and go at a non conversational pace that has tremendous health benefits if you ant o do it a litlebislower fine if you are out the pace where you can have a conversation to me i do not even count that is exercise that is not to is not a padorative by the way im that is just general physical movement it is extraordinarily clear you need a lot of that you need a lot more that than we get you can do this in a couple of efficient ways just taking your fone calls moving if you got a thirty minute call every day or most days the week and you can do that wile moving you have checked not that whole box but a pretty good trunk of it and that could even be done inside hondry t resising back and forth i'm a big pacer the a yet you meet to you pro me saw me i come walk up and down all over the place im most the time when i m i my office working i com i'm shattle box saying i come to an airs closs not even intentionaly i'm dislike you have one of those tread mills under the dus i do not but every lab i ever came through somebody did we 'did an episode on at work space optimization and the date on those tread mills yo aprty interesting they devilly increase alertness for which for obvious reasons that even a low bit of movement is goin a generate no not bit of a drennle and pacing around moving taking calls moving get a ox when you can and then in terms of building in durance i say somebody wants to quotin get into better shape yet they already mayor may not already have some size and strength that they are happy with and they just want i get in they want improve their health yet i wecanel is that hundere fifty hundred an eighty but this thing tick over into a different proto call ye o kase i think the way that i can outline a weekly schedul just as a conceptional model here im that longgeration stuff is not even counting as i mention i is to say this is what you need to do as a human for we have not improved if you are extremely unfit you may see some changes in crnt of ask cor elp ther for the most part this is jost knocking out the general physical practice you need to be iron functioning whatever that time to mean is it only care im is is not a huge concern of mine what i think you need hit or these notes you need to do something once a week that gets you to a maxim hurried now i do not have to literally mean max but clotes this means really sucking for ever really as high as you can possibly get you can wear a heart ry moner if you want but maximum hart rate the the rough oquasion we say is two hundr and twenty minester age if you are forty years old you are maxim hart rate is probably about a hundred and eighty beats per minute now i can tell you flat out right now im my max hart rate is close to to ten which means i'm can years old take tha number with a gran asaul i have had a bunch of professional outtleats who arein the're twenties and ther max harrites one seventy five and they are way better shape than i am maximum hart raite is not a good proxy for physical fittens it is a rough number an easy way to do it as if you have a hartrae monder anything that do the hardest work out you can possibly do see what the ighest number you get as as soon that is close that is if you wanted to start it two twenty master age that is fine to i do something thou where you yup this is death i this is really really challenge or howlon however long that take you that can be thirty second go on an arodine or air sault bike that could be a im i do on of the things where you kind i sprent run as hard as you can der in the straight away on a track and lock the corners con of an old classic back whent a nou an i ere kids interval training they 'll do that ay more i guess i do not know how i wer to talk about it in p class we had to change and if you did not bring running shoes yed to do it barefoot oh i love in a i love your teacher ye it was not a we or football basswall baseball teems were not that good but im anly running cross country just ust where i drew up o a rutal brutal coaches that yet they would make the the all kids do these runs yet it can be in the the thirty probably seconds at a minimum it it is hard to get you to a true heart rate max in shorter than thirty seconds you dn't get to total sock an under twenty seconds but getting to a true hrt ate maxis is probably to take more than thirty seconds it does not really matter what you want o do it can be again a sprent up hill it culd be w you are talking that con be purpiese to death an whateer whatever you want to do till thos havenanmy centric component ig at et yoro ye no question about it im but if you do to actual death by the way if you just did i'mn to do as many berpieceas i can for ninety seconds it probably will not take you much longer in that to get to close to and it is that do work out could be once a week get to bax art right touch it i lov it touch it i's not the best but it will it will work i and what are the specific benefits of that provides oo gan earlier in our an our chat wer we outlined the rul specificity specific at a poinadoptition to impose toman if you are never getting to that high of a pace you are never it would be trying to get stronger but only going to sixty per cent every carty of ask or adaptation that o curs with grn omasker training is to simply going to get to the toper end by doing this if you just start at the hart itself stroke volume increase thisis amount of blood that is ed out pur contraction a cartiac out put resting heart rate if you go o the endithelial function you are talking aby nitrickoxide release and you will thelial health in general i caplary mot o conjury allway down you just walk through the whole system pullman air exchange to the longs all of those are going to benefit by being challenge to their maxium i'll teach you were your vomit reflects ye right but do not know com stress is what causes adaptation right if you push your k here is a difference if you did twenty five minutes of steady state you are not challenging the same thing as what we just talked about i'm the way that i explain this is if you understand the point the point of physiological failure then you understand the place of adaptation that is it if you and i both go run on a we do to both did a veal to maxtess classic veal two max tests is going to take eight twelve minutes and it isgon look something this or e eg n gt in a treadmell and we are git a run and every minute i'm an a to slightly increase that treadmell either the speed of the grate most the time its o speed right we we get to a high grades say ten per cent grat or something and then we go five miles forhour five point too five point four my and we just go untill you cannot go any longer now lit say you an i did that and we have the same exact time frame and we we both went eight minutes i'm the time you last is not the thig that we care about right it is that this the volume of oxtion that you breathe out is what determines it fellet say n t the same time to main and we hae the same vial to max to say hey ware both fifty mill leaders for kilegramper minute which is a woll cat number but that is nothing to be extremely proud about just because we hav the same number does not mean we have the same plat point of physiological failure and this matters because it' can answer the what do i do about it then question right if you got off and i and i s er t asking a series of questions and our andi biscuts an whide you quit and why why dids you jump off the tread m why jyou stop and you were my chest i could not catch my breath i thought my heart was going explode ook kint gregt if you ask me and i said my legs er on fire was breathing hard but i could not take another step this is a very rough indicator of different places of physiological tis ruption now what i've seen a lot with my professional atleats specialy fighters there ten they are going to generally fail their legs becausethey do not often do a ot of strength training in their legs they do not do a lot of leg work thei'r fighting on their back literally a lot or on top around their nees there there legs ten to give out before there some one who fails in the cart of ascers system tet say you did a lot of leg training i'm typically can adurance outhing whos that is not can be teir ssue it is this cong to be the cnt reach a heart wraihed bentilation threshald that is they can no longer handle if i put you on th exactsing train protocalls it is not can be is effective because you are going to always fail at your legs and hever gon always fail at there cortof asker system i ned to flip that rightiyou ned to put you in a position to where you can reach a true heart raid or venilation challenge why your legs are still hanging in there i'm or the opposite the training protical is based on that point of failure im the adaptation is in the same thing if you are failing because of your legs then you might see a greater increase in complinization in your legs wrelative to somebody else whose failing in their i cartivascosistem they may see a greater change in and something on that side f the equation that it itmatters how youre failing at all times what i love about this is that it is it is sounds it is a thermometer for where one is week in needs work but also provides a stimulus to improve the very thing that you need that is that is the tewordan to just get real brass tax about it it would be once a week out ninety ninety seconds near maximum heart rad i'll make what i do more could i do five or six of those ninety second bouts no question you can do i'm is long as you touch that maxhart right i'm good right i deal world probably four to eight in that single session ideal quit right if that takes you twenty seconds or ninty seconds it is fine i'm if you ougt to do thirty on thirty off you oghto tdo twenty on forty off forty on twenty out those numbers do not matter and is there an interference effect of this on the other sorts of train that we have tokt a intends to be complimentary there thereis the the evidence available suggest that this high interable stuff is is more likely to be complimentary ty pertry training i'm probably because i lactate and some other cool things i'm which are very beneficial molecules of people on understand they they think it is bad it is actually a hugely beneficial thing 'm it can be interference can providing your friends if calories are not accounted for our frests on account of for and other things but in general it is it is probably ok i'm i would not at it to your oquation if you do not need it for maximizing i pertrivy but for the person who wants you tistget well round i physiology the i would not hesitate 'm to do these even the same session or different sessions trific and if that is done once a week and the hundrer fifty to hundred and eighty minutes or of his own two cardiofs done in the rest of the week iu y ever since doing their straint tan i pertury training we would hope what other sorts of endurance practices could one in corporat you mention muscular endurancs the t e it would a walsit or the ability do a plank yo was that is tat ombtlhing is that useful for anything yes thit be doing planks and wallsit nono it is extraordinarily useful i'm lett st hold on muscular durance i whn a finish one more thing on this side if we are building this week of endurance i'm once a week hit that number if you can do repeated bouts and we talk four to eight that is fantastic if you cannot mustle the the if you cannot manage the mental energy every week do it every other week it is still very good right cause ii get it i'm a working person too is sometimesyou dislike i cannot those work outs feel incredible afterwards but man they are daunting if you love thi stuff you could do it four times a week if you hate it though it is not realistic to think you can beable to knock this out you gan ain ap doing seventy eihty per cent which is not can get youthe benefit sojust do not do ityou really have to git that is you got get up there close il have some one chase i would say the i'm i to wheldn' doing this this kind of work in in my mind i'm thinking that i'm basily being chase by somebody with it with a sringefull of poison yet and wather other ways out of the situation and for the benefit of what we are talking about the one i'm referring to is just just run yet yell my motivation is typically if yu just get this done we are done in a couple o inutes just get done do not go here for nothng to do it uent you show up check can ant's over really quickly breathing down regulation after hundred per cent you have to right it is easy tugeky if you absolutely cannot do it do it every th wek that is twice month you e twice month can be done on the road can be done at twenty minutes do really good thorough warm up do not just jump into those by the way right away it is nok can be as beneficial really nice good sweat brok i really god warm up and then give me four minutes o hard work of ore done right get out o there i'm if you want to use a bath or hot firmolstress to kind eight in that warm up process find gettin us on i getting a hot bath ge really hot get up there warm up nock it out twhole thing is twenty minutes post five mis breathing you rout im mon st aur doing this it is but you hot a pike right there i've got els sort evereevery room in this tudiois as he every piece of equipment it seems i want that once a week relistically every t week if i have to i want that physical activity piece call it what ever you want long duration thing id deally you will do as much o that toughyour knose only you noc mell do the nterval stuff it knows only the men of do not nen try but if you can go that whole thirty minute time or twenty or forty minutes whenever its can to be i'm that is actually good way to regulate intensity go es hard as you can wi'll still being able to breth though you knows only if you have to open up your mouth a little bit fine but try to stay there what you will see is very quickly you will beable to increase your work out put while just bringing therails which has a bunch of other be ont to benefits the other piece i want is this middle ground which is can you sustain hard work for at to twelve maybe as littleas four minutes i'll give you four to twelve minutes is does not have to be quite as high as the first one you do not have to get to hart in max but can you get somewhere in the eight percent range and can you hold that for four minutes maybe give me two minutes two minutes o rest and do that twice something that i ideal situation is what a runner would do is wwill all mile repeats cause hey're running four or five minute miles whatever time it takes thim to finish theye cald arrest that to one to one work to restaratio five minute mile rest five minutes and go again that is probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks that well the five minute part is unrealistic for most os ever may oud be in a eight minuteseight minutes fine probably something thatnar particular case just do theight hundred meter do eight or meters you something that takes two to six minute to work i' it is a lower intensity than the max of but is a much higher work load i'm that is probably going to give you you might even argue the most carn of ask your benefit because it is sustained work out put and that is very critical the downside of kind o that conversational pace it is physical activity it is movement it is blood flow with emphatic drainage it is not very card of askerli challenging te your you are just not gin to get an optimle health rm just walking actively two to six minutes of a hard work of hard work with then an equivalent amount of rest in between then then repeat how many terms once if you have to if you neds to be one rap if an easy be a six minute thing and then down riggly breath twice if you can do that six times eight times whatever whatever you can really do and you can just take that thos long of the training session as you want or short i'm exercise choice can be what eve wou want again you can do slod pushes or could be a kettle bell circuit or any combination of things where you are just you'r working andyou are not giving yourself an break you have got to be able to hold on at a very high waste product production level tas well as a hide demand for energy and then bring it down and breathing during this two to six minutes of a hard a output is mainly through the nose or combination knos and mouth rea tat getting too technical wells probably i it but you tell me if its technical i'm you'r ging to try to maintain nasel only as much as you can but you can lose it a some point i'm is you youn go through ther bryan an and robs our system and learn more and you can sent coinsee what you are o be in if you have to go nose in mouth out or soething that but i do not really care to much honesty in that range i'm getting most of my nees only stuff at night and training in everything if you have to open up the throttle there to get the work done that is o oh then noble actually go to your anse your question which was musti an durentes ogo back that piece muskger endurance is incredibly important for general maintenance of coint health an other words i'm you have got form follows function right it is a very classic science he physiology saying meaning you have got a couple of different there is a bunch but to make it easy two different types of muscle fibres fast twitch and slow twitch faster fibers tend to be but there not always bigger they contract wit t a hire velocity it is why they recalled fastwitch but they tend to be mork litic and thus fatigable slow twitch are tend to be smaller theu'll not always theyare more pact it mine of contrary there were generally better it burning fat as youill but contract ith lower velocity well we have these two type that we can regulate function mor you have some muscle groups that were going to sor i we go back up a quick secondeach individual muscle in a human body has a combination of some amount of fast and some monoslow that percentage of fast fors slow differus from muscle tho muscle it also differes from person to person easy example is your calf musclthere is there is three but there is two primary muscls in your calf wonce all the soleliest one's a gastrog the the gastroct is one or if you take your toe and point at toward your face and then flects that is te one that pops out youan on the medial side the inside the soleliest ta we call an anti gravity muscle and it is generally about eighty per cent to eve ninety per cent slow twitch and that is because it is supposed to be contracted lightly all time smust be on permanently it is it is man to keep yo we call it anti gravity cause it is meant to keep you erect up and moving youre spinal erectors supposed to do this various muscles for postural or are generally slope wich muscles sorecses be on all times not produce fast not produce force but do not get tired the gas rock is the opposite it is not activated very often but hone i's activatis it is meant for extreme prepulsion this gives us the ability to reach up and scratch our eye ball and alsol punch somebody right we have to bil to regulate foresalp but which is going back to henaman rih controlling what we use when we do not use while also not wasting energy which is the the downside of activating a big threshold motor non is it is it requires a ton of energy i'm more eficient mote ofe energy but the total amount is really really high muscular en durance is going to help those slow twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch predominant muscles maintain they are working job if you lose your muscular enduranceability in your spinal erectors are your calf ouagainst our slumping into bad positions youre ging to be getting a putting joints in in am movement pattern that they are not going to be th most happy wit it is more than about than be able to dis maintain a two minute losquat it is about maintaining jointegrity and allowing that muscular ture tonnot fatigue when you ask it to do heavy and fast what i mean by that is you have got a whole combination of muscles in your shoulder and we will jenlycoltes the road teater coff muscles well let us imagine those slow twitch postural muscles get fatigued and they stract to lose contract ti'le tention and then you to do something heavy or fast or an inmurg situation those are already pree fatigued you can relying more upon the fast wich musulfibres which are there less for posturae integrity you are likely to get out a position and this is a whole recipe of co wis my show their is hurting got my back that is very oftin a case of the soldi wich fibres the sulcies muscele groups losing muscular ndurance neen to build that backop that they can control and hold the joint in the position n the fast which fibers icanincontracted force i'm hoping that what i'm to say next meats of what you said a accurately my experience is that getting injured a lifting wags or even doing house work or yard work almost always happens when i'm not paying attention fatigued that is kind of obvious but also getting inposition to initiate a movement setting down aweight or lifting weights off the rack or or picking up dunbells that is almost always when i seem to activeate this lower back thing that happens every nearlace or eight months and what you are saying if i understand correctly is that this muscular endurance from wallsits or planks or thngs of that sort may be gogive us a few other examples he of of these can helpluss because they actually prepare the system to do what we normally think of us the more intense work it is it is really that it sounds its really the architecture of of the body tatincludes nerves and muscles andeverything else of course that let us thegue limbs and another kind of action end of the body do do its best work ye letit itrest its own power and force yet we have ectualy landed on one of my final laws of strength condition which is similar to one i seter ter right i said exercises do not determine adaptations application determines at aptation sound similar but it is quite different there are no good or bad exercises there is only good or bad application here is a great example of that my you di not get hurt dead lifting because deadlifs are dangerous you only get hurt dead lifting because you either got in bad position you got bad position because youeither started in bad position this is one of thing you just said or you ended up in bad position you did too much volume you did too much intensity or you did too much complexity those last three things all hurt you because they result in the first one which is out of position or another way think about this if is not a a invisible change in position is stress got put into a part of the system that should not absorb that much stress you did too much of it you did it too heavy you got fatigued and you broke position you got too heavy see you broke position you yu made the exercise too complex you put too many moving parts in it you put too many joints in it and you got on a position you did that too many times over time now we have led for either in acute injury bam your back pops and you foronfloor or dislike man as thing is hurring over time all these the result the same thing you cannot ever blame the exercise for causing the problem is always either the user or the coach you programme to way too much here and i cannot handle that position or you yourself whent into i too much if you are getting is little tweks and in problems going on you have made an error in one of those things simply back off reduce the complexity rigt im gov yourself morstability less moving parts do less volume do less intensity in fact if you look at the people from the physical farupy world in terms of the pain literature it is very clear that just stopping a movement is very rarely going to work but you wanted to was back off all the way down to just below that threshold of that is what aggravates it and you want a train right there that is going allow you to do two things and we one tissue tolerance and the number two deesentinization a lot of pain suffand you can prome speak a lot about this is especially things low back pain is there is not necessarily often much damage there it is a lot of hypercentitization i'v just painsing a pain signal oh manting the movementirely does not get that signal ticl why you need o train just below that signal and desensitize it you want to make sure that the muska endurance allowas you you'e just putting volume right below where you starn to get a twik and it is beautifully effective for that i've experienced this right side lower backpaint for years sometimes shooting down the hip the two things tat really helped a we are doing anter to work you a hat's off to neese over tos sky and patrick who has't ouno crate a lot of popularity round y am tib work but i turns out joints full range a motion youare abotte spot yethe something about stablizing the stuff from the knee down help my back and then also some some neckwork and a friend's min are always teasing me that my gim is filled with t the most bazaar equipment inna doesn' look any other ta lot of is just desin to keep me healthy an and still training but a i love this idea of of getting right at the below the threshold of pain activation and not simply going into to complete a non action or just taking nearly rask as that action can be detrimental a i'd love to talk about a few items that support training of all kinds and where there is a lot of confusion and indeed a misconception and mystery and just get your take on these and and i just want acknowledge at the outset that for some of these there is a lot of science for some of them there is less science but theres certainly is a lot of am experience in in your campan and those categuories or cold heat and hydration ah because obviously whether not your runner or whether not your straing training you are human being i you neen to hydrate a but in terms of work outpot and a physical work out what may be incognive work out but may we tackle hydration first i there is what i what i call a i think is now come to be known as tha the galping equation which you really do deserve credit for because i think that pea pill am realize that there are range of solutions out there but there is a really a desperate need for a straight forward solutions that work for seventy five per seven people sevety five per cent of the time hidration is key babbe you could under score just how how key it is for us and then what is the galopan equasion as as i call it that i think others are now referring to it ye iget i'm benefits ifidration slash consequences of a mishidration we that sehydration romyou physiology has or mediccurvs my nat tive bly thy we think about this intromstoxicology what this means is at some point giving you a dose of something a testostrons very easy example if you are clinically deficient or low into stostron and i give you a little bit in i brings you back no normal range you generally see an improvement in health and functionality taking you though from normal to superhind does not always necessarily provide additional benefit in fact if you continue to go its can ot provide detromen rad everything has is cur and then some things are hormetic stressers which means i gav a small short fast insult is actually beneficial becausein you come back bigger faster i stronger and that is how i aptation warks basiccor mes ocame hidrations the same way at the end the curve here if you are under hydrated by all know you could di right you have to have things in fact water is the only thing that is you biquitous across biologis in terms of every living thing has to have it there is no other videm in mineral neutrian that is required among all living things with exception of water that you ive you a pretty good indication of it is importante right you gt a have this thing down here the bottom if you'r d hydrated i give you more its beneficial effects however if you are up the top already and i continue to give you more water pass that now we run into actual problems and we can give what is called hamp on a tremium it is more common than people realize ithe tremia being actually not referring the water but that the sodium concentration being too low and you have probably talked about that a length of of why that is an issue if sodyan batascium balances inside outside sell come off you hartstops i mustl contraction ends an all these sing some you do not want to be over or under hy drated understanding the this rough equation i of loosely calculated one day is helpful for that i'm i think the most contex is is talking about how much water to drink throughout the day and how much water to drink during exercise the the very easy answer is half your bodyweighten ounces per day is a very loose guide lane for total amount of fluid concumption if you a two hundred pounds aim for a hundred ounces of water i ga very easy number if you hit that you probly osy ninety per centi oure good night present the time alone if you then go to exercise you needto tan account for that fluid loss with exercise and in general you want to consume a hundred and twenty five per cent to hundred and fifty per cent of the amount of weight you lost in fluid another words if you worked out and you were two hundred pounds naked and you an did your work out and you dried off and you weighedyourself again and now you are hundred ninety eight pounds you lost two pounds of water as thirty two ounces you want to drink back about a hundred and twenty five per cent of that staid of drinking thirty two ounces i want yhould drink forty forty two forty five something this i's oneof the reasons why is unless you are drinking something that is i've tonic meaning the same exact concentration in your blood that you'r in your fluid you are just gingto go closer that hyp wenter tremia iyou aregong to get a bunch of barer efector reflect responses and you are going to actually think you hve to much fluid an you can you are neiht it out wits i' not weighing myself before an after work outs and om is there a short hand version of this that iyou know after training for an hour i should drink at least exrevounces yet that assuming it is at at cat of it istallera you no i'm not sweating superheavily yei in that particular case you could probably gos something if every one in the world dis il twelve to twenty ounces that is probably pretty decent and they are probably doing that ye ye and whent oot electurolights aid consuming salt patassium and butbut that thing only works thoug if you are coming in at ofp the midration then this is the probleise is why you have to you have to flag this starting with a good total daily myto water because if if you are coming in and you are all i drink two or three glass of water a day then you might we need to rink fifty or sixty ounces postwork out could youre weig behind that all twelve ounces or works if you are already generally very well hidrated and if people are drinking youon't for to six glasses of water aday but they are also drinking a lot of kaffine in any form than they are going to be xcreeting wore water in most cases right well because kaffines of diaratic ok kinny is but kinni is not either it is not the diaretic that we used to think about it as im it is still fluid consumption it is only a diaretic if it cause you to screet more fluid than actually was being antic im if kaffin in take is in a normal range i do not i dn't have to worry about the diaretic effects if some one is drinking twelve cups of coffee day it work work an orther taking kaffine pills or something now the excretion is gon out kicked tha coverage now we are now probbs recaus thre's no fluid consumption with the affine pill in general things tea sumption i'm not superworried about those things you can count those torture tota total fluid and take if you want s if you are i drink sixty ounces of water blus twenty ounces of coffee and then now this i you can ad not all lappen youre to be totally o k natural for you also have probs with synthetic forms of kaffin wers natural forms of kaffine natural forms are are a pretty o k youe lost noy et cetera ye all that settle form as were it gets drinky always e always right general i eat real food and things you be just find i'm the last piest to consider is you are diet quality matters because i the fluid content in your food can very wildly something a bagal im might be you five to ten per cent water or something a water mellon is ninety eight per cent ninety five per cent something in a huge raint even meat is very high per centage a fluid in tike i get to really high even after you cook it there still a lot of flod in there if you are eating a whole food mostly whole food basedyet you are in dogenous hydration is actually pretty high already just from your flod if you are eating a very highly process de hidrated oversalted diet you have you'r way low on hydration just in your food you have to fact or all these things in a fact one things that happens to us constantly with folks that go from a highly process low quality diet to a high quality one is it just te just pean on stop what the hlls going on will you are actually have brought in sixty iditional ances o water an you'r diet relative of what you used to have and you have gone from ten grams is sodium there to four to two sometimes once sometimes yeit is a very low cause you are not salt are you salting your food no ok a well we do not have sodymen take that wer weigh down everything that were considering i's based on thuts lets as sume some one's eating a a pretty well balanced i at their drinking sixy ances o water n may be gaffy in coffee in to e things that im we do not exactly know the otal amount of sodium oneshun and take it is very clear high sodium concentrations are still associated with a lot of negative health out comes especially in combination with por physica activity and combination with lowful quality and all ther comobinities that is a very bad thing you need be very careful about those things i'm if everything else is o ka we'rol cape playing of the little but higher salts in fact your you are probing to feel better you eun to fel generally pretty good im you just it seens to be very clear if you are over weight highly stressed and you do not have elot of thse things ticked off and you have known cormobidities you really need to pay attention to salt an takeit can be very nasty i'm that being said what were generally going to look at folks is are you at least can we categrise you is a low sodium or high sodiumswater if there is a whole list of electrolights you can look a that are gong to have something two hundred o foreign miligrams perserving there is a whole list o these things i'm if you are low sodium sweat are you are unprobigana send you after one of thos if you are high sodium sweder thre's a lot of electr lie supplementsthat are closer to six or eight hundred even even a whole gram i'm persingle serving size you want to play with that i'm a very if youre low sodium mor high sodiums soeder we ash ave at episode on salt we put out deat wors coming out soon if has not come out already which is i whenyo look a the hazard ratios you have salt and take i basically your probabilit y of really bad things happen to you goes way up as you get towards you would a lot of sodium in taking ten twelve grands o a day and im it and this is translate te teaspoons of sault et cetera but also very low sodyouman take is a problem no cloviti i say it is not a perfectly ou shape it is cut of a jay shape a gerver a cut a hocky stick shape more r less but i'm how would i know if i'm a low sodiumer high sodium wye seein goat ijust ca wic my sweat or have songone else no hand the you find a superfriend wo lick your sweat for you a same waow no no willing volunteers that i'm aware of but would i be able to tell yet i'm you can get what tusting done actuallyouhave a a number of options i'm the kindof the original one that most of us use in the background for many years as called lebylin i'm they will send you out a little patch a weare that and in the lab and th they will measure at directly lav i sent a back is a hundred an fifty buck sir doy benyu into low medium an high semany the'reget at do that buthere on tg go you very there can to tell youexactly the miligrams and nd the cund actull tell you what products as suff and i'm that they are exactly match doyou do this with that with professional laugh we have many times yesterson i'm you can do a more consumer great version gaterad has a patch for twenty five bocks you can get two of em you can put that cat patch on your left forearm and down lall the gatera at and ou can do a work out measure right there and click it over and the willtell you exactly not only hirelo with agan the will tell you the mligrams of sodium ther're in your sweat and unin can figure out again cin a high medium or or jonston thery much better on ay a slightly higher sodium in take most be i'm but in my cobrhidrate i do ecobridrates one one of those that it is pretty moderate by trhinat clean food i ii' notice an i tend to be slightly low blood pressure again to miterate that the warning there that if somebody is a preha pretensionor has i pretension n robes you really dou need to be careful with your sodyouman take but many people seem to find that they feel better when they increase or sodim in takin theyre still in that healthy portion of the have ratio most of the athles i's a in general urnergo higrer in salt when they come wen run the stuffon were hand sault alm almost always a very few times have i got ow when you cut this back when the exceptionathat onces tat come in tat het porting yerels an o mi i get your fifteen miligrams arery fifteen grams a day causeyou are eating nothing but garbage work to come down yoere to fill way better and all this bloating and everything else thats can a happen go down'youcan do that theire actuolly more there by l censers that are coming out i'm there are not a vailable yet but the're coming very soon in this space ther cang be il give you real time matricks on i'm salt you can pay attention to those i have not seen one use when personally i do not want a i'm thispous but how gooter bat it is but i know that those are coming i from handful of companies an easy way to do is just look at i'm wear hat or wear some sort of head band or something and do your work out take it off if you see a just huge white band or if it is completely clear and that is cany tell you big white band you are probably a high saltswater completely clear very little coming out that is great an out i can see tha the posts on instogram now people showing there the're salt band of from from from sweating aivsy salt is is essential for many physiological functions you doft hant too hih e too low but if you are losing more make sense yo would need to take in more half of my body wai in ounces as a just foundation of of a fluid in take coffee an tea could be included in that but that should probe mostly water or think similar to it im what and then during exercise you the how do i want to think about this again let us ay am a let us ay him a high salt out put than id want to drink may be forty ounceis water with or wore more yet i'll get i'll'll do this easier om let us talk about pree and midnposts what to drink pr if you you come in having hit these rules you are drok and pre work out can be as little as five or six ounces basily a couple sips of water fine i'm if you come in poorly highdrated than you may be need to go more twelve but here is the deal if you start off a session in a bad spot you are nok in a canp catch back up you u just you are you are in trouble let us say you come in you did you fall a direction five hundred milegrams salt before five hundred ilegrams after a very easy rule a pick whatever source you want that is a couple of sprinkles of table salt if you want him a land that is fine you will have two hemilans actually a fairly low sodium salt 's not the best for for this purposes i'm if you are hier salterswatter little more if you want to go choose an electr light of which there are infinite i'm you can look on the packet and i'll tell you you' two hundred fifty milegrams for serving or four hundred or six hundred or whene rapidly but around five hundred pretty five whenterposts is a very general rule and then during is thinks to you i my famous gallopin aquation now that is is all the world i'll i did as i took the literature in a said lcave in general the researth shows pretty clearly two milegrams for kilegram bodyway tor fifteen men at seems to put youin a pretty con spot most people do not think about kilegrams or milliers kind ust run that over and the turns out it is about your body weight to bide by thirty an ounces that isthat is all you have to body weighin pounds divided by thirty ye exactly right you weight two hundred pounds divide aby thirty and that is number mounces you knownt to go every fifteen or twenty minutes i'm getting that amount every fifteen to ye twenty minutes throughout the training youand now in the wit room that is pretty easy to do yes theire rest intervals but you people will need to do this while running your cycling i and that can cause a la bit of gaster distress yeif you are not use to it is i right you can you can learn to run with it with some water in your belly you hundred per cent the gut is very trainable in a lot of directions but in terms of fluid as well as carbahidrate which another thing that is gingto get people i'm but that is the out very trainable it will be un comfortable anniturally but yu'll you will quickly get into it the better solution for those folks just calm in high draded an you do mightnot evenen ny water you could probably per form just fine im the ones that do not have as much of an opportunity you really have to emphasize walking in i'm we hav this problem with our professional golfers ther've plenty of time to drink water but there is focussed on the shot an there is a lot of aryables coming out once o hit their shot and moving on the next one they are thinking about i mea ther going over score card of a hundred eighty five yards away can i go a hundred eighty four an a half yards cn go undrd e six yard what is a slope without wer was the wind up here wats wint up there wats itlike it is just ther jus thinking and they just forget youven now they have four and a half hours we have to make sure that they immediately get off the course we go right into recovery it is hard as we possibly can they wake up the next morning the're good spot we crush recovery and now's i ca if you can remember to drink this gregt if not were still fine if it is not a bideal and you have time in a a a lifter because i dol it that probabe fiders to i we can only drink much in the mil of a fight i couple seps o there but we we cannot go mix im two milater si can you geta couple sips an yet il yet forgotline s no cani happen we have to take more mneps is before and after strart you'r re covery process immediately and then come in the next day that is your window and then whateveryou can get in during the work out that is fine to if you are a higher salt sweater seyt on five hundred five on hundred may be o seven fifty seven fifty if you have a longer bouc of exercise especially if it is hot i'm or humid then you might want to consider some salt in the work out as well and three hundred milegrams turn the work out totally fine i'm it is a nough if it is a really long work out and it is really hot you are going to lose pounds during it you need a specific stratity if you on't lose less than a pound you doft nen to wory about it you can be is nok n to be enough of a detriment for you really care i'm that is a kind of a rough rule now if you are two hundred pluss pounds may be that number moves from one pound e two pounds but really the number wil look out is what one percent of your bodyweight if yofr losing more than one percent of your bodyweight we ned start carrying if it is less thn one percent it is not can really paid out much of a difference a for myself im because i do not get supertedncle i do not wear any deviceis besides a risk watch to what i watch thanks i ye do the very attached to this watcers attached to me i suppose my body weigting pounds divided by two that is what i'm a try and get across the entire day as a cond of base line and then my body weigh all we n pounds divided by thirty during the work out y every fifteen or twenty minutes that i'm going to try and consume that amount and then i definitely do better when i increase the amount of sault that i'm taking in an we have five hundred to a a five hundred milgrims to a graham of sault am several times a day actually but im not eating that oftand which leads me to another question which is i prefer to train fasted or sen me fasted meaning firsing in the morning a h or within an hour two of wakin we ovy seidin passing whele i m ust sleep or having not eaten anything for three or four hours before i just feel lighter in tie morter our energetic a if that works for me s that o car a or should i try is it better to eat something before one trains personal preference easy easy answer there it depends on of course how hard you trained well the training was was port your involved with how many till it counts to seta but in general personal preference for the average person the pr handles niney persent of the yem questions about that cold cold showers ice bas and cold immersion up to the neck i always a prefacis by saying there are not a a lot of studies there are some but not a lot of controld studies looking at cold showers cause its harder to control the variables of where people stand i would say if you have access to cold immersion of some sort ice bathricald immersion gray but if you do not cold chowers would be the next best thing the lord goes that if you do an ice bath or cold water immersion after strength or hypertna training that you are short circuiting some of that the lore also goes that cold showers might be o ka and my interpretation of those data and that discussion is that all that is probably true but i have a hard time imagining that the effects are robuse that it can completely prerevent strength gains and mypertrophy such that my stancs for myself is try and do the cold exposure training away from the strength and hypercofy training but if you cannot do it any other time right afterward probalising in a throw my whold system att a wack aand prevent the improvements n my deluding myself im coupleof caveyots sooner or one i to say have a personal fested interests and cold iv been around this su for a long time im being involved and being an adviser for exp t and beingin a space a long time ofm a big believer in cold special cold water deliverate cold exposure hundred percentright that being said a i do thank getting in to an ice bath immediately after a hypertry session is getting pretty close to you just should a done the session it is detrimental good to know i would not do it i guess is the most bluntwy to put it om if you ere ha i i am not superconcern with growing muscle and i want these other things a come with cold waterimersion fine it is not a zear is not zero its not taking you backwards how much does it cut you down i do not know we dn't know that tid be a difficult number to come up with is it one percent roduction now it is more than that is it a hundred not even close i do not know where it lambs though it is enough though for me to go in general best practices do not in the ice i mean i after work out how long should i wait well in theory the best ance we coun give you would be for hours because of what we talked about earlier to day ov of going oll came immediately you have got the signalling cascade that takes seconds you have got gene expression that is happening in this rough for our window after the genes of gone often now you jus goin to the broaching sinthes's process the signals word be there in it is gone back down o baseline then reintroducing ar introducing cold here is not goigto disrup that signal that is a very i' non scientifically founded because we do not know at this point at all what is very clear those if you get off your work out go right ne the ice it is probably ten per cent a tenuation of growth i dn't no maybe more depends the person some people if you look at th individual data it is a pretty bad it is enough to words that that is a really big deal the benefits of the ice i do not think now oft way the benefits of of typertrbe training what about cold showers i do not think cold showeris aregoing to do much i'm if you have been in both that this is ere not plying the same game here an ice bath or cold wat or true cold water immersion up to the neck with limbs in if for one to five minutes is a completely different stimulus than in the cold shore especially also compared di similar trial it is not even the same same thing here i'm in general i would say do not do those cold shower i do not realy care can you work it outslee do not do them same time that'uld be my hope right i'm i wold actually prefor you the cold before i you really had to do it i'm certainly wll wait you up you attlin burst no we have playe withot actuall years ago i'm doing that i'm there is actualy some funstuff you can do with the endurance piece with cold stufp but it it is totally not feasible for most people couldr get at o geaging water everywhere that can jump on your by can just get shit and itsist a giant mess it is fond met yet i would say walkwayfremit if you can' that is actually s where i stand based on the data i'm base on my intuition and anexperience i do not ind'll hiek is a good thing to do now having said that that is mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy strength it is not as clear there are some date to show it outr block strength at aptations but because of wh we talke but earlier than mechanisms and that drivers are different and i do not think it is as big a concern i'm fore strength development though i would still generally safe you can get away with staying out of the ice immediately after the work out and you can least wait a few hours that is the better approach less concerned with strength more concern with hypertrophy and terms of interferance effect i'm if you can do it on off days or before or any other time that is that is the place to land that is generally when i tried to do it et's jut's got it thrawing out extreme case as i get as that question a lot what about the use of a ice bath or cold water immrsion we are cold shower after endurance training oh get a couple of interesting things here you mentioned we do not have a tremendousmon a data on cold water emersient over all a lot is is moving i'm there have been some papers to show that cold water imerge and cannactual in hands monocondrobal genesis and actually even for endurance stuff it is been showinto to cause improvement endurance aaptations relative to noht it is not enough for me to be truly confident and tht' satemen yet i would to y that repeated not not that i have a problem with the paper the methodology that thit use an ot ptic or study but is us s i is a weird things i wanto see this repeated more often i have less concern with doing in immediately post in durance cause you could even argue that there may be some benefit i do not think you need to goouto your way to try to make youre eat an ice immediately afterwards and thinking you can to get some mass of adaptation i'm we use ice a decent amount when i can get aplet to do it but this contect is different number one when we are in camp and we have got a world title fight coming out or something else i'm we have just pitched in it and a maj r basebo game i am not concern about ipertrophy i am not even concern a strength o eltmeni am now pushing tort recovery there is a paradime that i think its important with all these things understand which is are your pushing for optimization radaptation when you are pushing for adaptation you do not want a block the signal for adaptation this means less recovery youe not going to feel as good and you probably should be hedging towards stress when you are pushing for optimization it is the opposite i' if i'm in season and i had a picture just throw a hundred and twenty fiptitthes i'm not trying the cause adaptation i'm trying to recover as quickly as possible because four days from now we got to do this again and i got to do this across a hundred and sixty two games im i' youe con a play sixday five days in a pegiac off turnamen and you can have to do it again every week for a bunch weets in aroug i need recovery as fast as i possibly canso fom blunting adaptation fine i'm non ectrytine to do son 'm tryn optimize if you spend all your time in one of those two areas you are goingto have problems you need to be judicious about thinking is this a point mi life or training cycle that i want to cause adaptations or am i trying to optimize you spend too much time in won wone the other ones again you can have problem that is in generally how i will treats i'm the ice for for all those adaptations what abut heat yeh when thet n elframe this question differently because i i'm sure there are number of ways in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things i mean he can in access can kill you ye it can shut down fortility it can a in access right it can do all sorts of things but it can also increase growth ormon increase is a violation improve one's ability to swet which can be very beneficial in a number of contects yetfor the typical for seventy five per cent of people seventy five per cent af the time when do you think heat is most useful and here i'm referring to drys on or wets on a i'm not specifically talking about in for rets on o because the datof there le and clear to me and i i do not even know that my cense with him for atisawnus as they do not go hot enough for my particular taste you and i have a similar taste there oge ar not crushing two hundred past on i'm not interested right and in my cense o about im for rets on a is that maybe have not seen the data s that i' but that a lot of people it cause they the way they look in the an forets on it feel school feels youre doing something unusual now in for ed lifeire beneficial for other reasons i can for my to condural health in the ratinas er it the good da a but im for red sawna to me they never goes hot enough i'm talking about two hundred or hot er maybe a hundred eighty two twenty obviously do what safe folks and heat all the warnings about pregnent ye people not going sie et cetera i soon by your lumping in hot water merchanis hot water mersiana hot baths hot san a when would you when you think most people could leverage sana or hot baths to benefit their training and fitness and and health ye ok i have a handful of things say about this topic one of em is you never have a hard time convincing people to get hot et ron't feels good i can hot bth lite can you take more hot showers sure i no problem they are right i' there are a handful of studies that of look at ithis immeditely post and it seems to even augment hypertre after hyperch of ro train ind getting in the sa enough for twenty minutes yoha whatever whatever needs to be i we do not have a good titration what is the number men its wise we doft have a temperature tigration hot shouer would would be a second that would be a week second best i would say to very week say a hot bath i think a hot bath its probably a lot closer to what you are looking for in actual con t goes back to our nitial conversations theoretically you are just going to aid an blood flow seeging to put more neutrians in more wayste protic out metable extress all that suff is going through bthat is the thought any ways we e far from malents plausible absolutely possible i'm something people will do feels good i'm why it is a with cold and hot i want a caution you iagainst a couple of things this is true across all physiology but you need to be really careful about moving percentages from molecular to outcome very careful for example it is easy to see a paper im that says iof kine we put you in hot bath or something and we saw growth hormone increased three undred percent that is not going to result an three undred perscent increase and muscle size right in fact threehundre per cent mi results in absolutely no change in physical size right and reason of saying this is becaus eit a lot of people in the space that will missapply the mechanisms and the tho grossly over estimate what these things can do in what they do do because they will find something that i'm imyou know this you have done no sell your work to in the lab if i see am towar doubled im i think sheditan work i neen to see tennaxs increase before i nowice even physiologically relevant reading that paper reading some on sociar meuplesier wha it increase am toere thirtyeight per cent i'm midin't work nyou are what t tuge that is not thirty eight per cent increase in also size stat's a very important point when i make because i'men a talk about the benefits here a second but i'm ii do wh i don what people be fooled an to thinking that this is some crazy miracle i'm the same thing with the son im in terms of general health healthout comes it is a clearly a beneficial thing this is a really good idea to get hot a lot it is not a substitute for exercise to it is a very importantci t ancient if the aunt if the options are nothing or sana get in the san really really good idea if to the exchangeis though i doft ned to work out because i did the sana bad ythis is not a winning solucian you and i son't kno som maniacts that actually work out in the san i we do ya no i do not necessary recommend that that actually u would probly kill a a large number of people but ou canrthi d can be worked up to ye it certainly yet i wh every time i talk about that i i flag that because it is just too easy he tha't go oh i think doctor you were in said if i just gett the san i i'm have to work out no the is worsh of never devi is ni that and i defully not working out in the sana if i'm in the san on either sitting or i'm lying down and i'm trying to make it through i tend to do three twenty minute bouts ye a cross the entire week i aim for sixty minutes per week yet of heat exposure i would be juonnton if i said i've never worked out the sna us you are one of those yv he will do eir squats the will bring the air di'm bike in there i'm i look at te san as kind of a time to get lazy in thisweat totally find i'm going back to o question potentral aight plossible a we ne jus see more recs for drawn that to really get in do not i to put the some practice i think if you try it very little harm ii g stroggle to se it downside if you makes your hydrations on quoit right now you got a factor in the fact you just kicked out to re three pounds if youare you at two in er plus pounds i soon or roughly i f you'e in the son for twenty minutes i would imagine you cn do two three pounds yi usually im i'm hover somewhere round ti two twenty five ye i drink im i drink a thirty two ounce right ve s water with the electrolike solution that is pretty high sault afterwards and sometimes during and sometimes after that if i do it late in the evening i'll go to sleep and wakem in the mill night wet just feeling parched it is amazing how much will one loses in the sana ike a normal sweat rate for somemon two twenty five especially and twenty minutes on a sana i would absolutely expect you to do three pounds easy without i should be dreathing more probab even more water yet you are probably half the water that you ned to get and you mention the the possible benefits of doing it after straingth hypertraphy training which are make sense for plausible mecinis yec reasons and not no official dat o their yet what about after endurance training assuming somebody hydrates well enough and the'r not over heated from their endurance work ye could also be a benefiye il more and more would i'm thinking the framework here is in an ideal world one would train and then do sana y or heat exposure of some kind in durant training wore strngth hypertrary trainin andthey u sana and then do cold exposure on off days are at least four hours away from the from any kind of training or if you had to do it close to train doing t before train ye i love the cold the morning wa we vact yure on this experiment on professional ot thing till we dof not tracking with things gate our pea which is a globle metric of iover all fatigue oke and yu've your provy talked about that before a bit problems with it bit roughly idea wrobse ahtr be in general higher the score the better rih low atrof es fatigue i well if you wake up and take your ahtrof e in the morning and hn you get into ice what is gong ao hapen is you an see that number plum et the second you get out that is going to fall off the earth wich means roughly you have moved into a sympathetic a splace surprising you get in thirty degree water you grn to go very sympathetic very quickly however if you continue to watch for ahtre of e for thirty sixteen ninety and up to two to three hours post you will generally see a in improved eight ore of you score relative to where you started it is it is back to this hormatic stress are right a really cold shocking exposure we will be a net result of you being more relaxed throughout the day in genra and we have seen that now a very consistently y cross years with what amplys i i think it is a great weigh to strarture day you will not need nearly as much coffee after spending three minutes and thirty degree water ther degrees is pretty predon n cold i was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes the dell lidn bring a thermometer but it fell somewhere in the low fifties but fiftyn moving as really cold yell water's moving ye i that is really col that is right the therma layr that at that a surrounds you when yu sit still in a cold water immersion i'm incurging people now if they really i was the joke that you people to look real stoic and tough when they are in there theyre just grinding through with no pain it all but that the stillness is actually of reducing the ye tha stimulus if they sift around a little but you break up that thermma lair that is where the real action we weave joked about this for years do fifty degrees with the worlpool jet on now 'm in pressed tat that is hord you sit in thirty five degree for three a minutes igest but with expeto i've seen i cannot eve tell you how many hndreds of people from all walks a life on all age that we have been able to get in thirty some degree water for three minutes fifty degrees with a worlbill going that number gets very small yet if you do not have access to a whirlpool this is this should be reassuring to you can some people say i do not have access to ice and ice cannot shu get pretty expense of you are doing a fifty dollar i sa a everyday you can fill your baths up with m cool to cold water get in but just make sure that you keep sifting your limbs and it it is chilly ye and this the studies on the very well astep now well establish increases and dopemin an epan efferon that a cur in cold water sporsure rathly done at an hour in sixty degrees fair n ye and it you do not necessarily need at ice cold or an ice bath but immersion is really better than the cold shower the cold shower is kind of a it is the it is it is kind of the expressor shot the aversion nyet no that is tha its sort of funnyc ause if you look out most of those anatural studies and you think man how did they get people to sign up to spend forty five minutes in fifty five degree water fifty five degrees is cold oun if i's not moving an o gan an not spend five minutes ant a beggon hour if you have ever don ice basts at that tempertare i are not after a few minutes it is not that bad but man tht's a protocol tyet's it isit it is kind of an ena cold endurance protocolic it is one thing to get in for one minute to three minutes a you'r getting out you could sing a song you can do anything to distract yourself but forty five minutes to an hour is is intense amaybe th i do not i do not think they paid the subjects but anyway that the that study was yon thing of europes i forget where it was done but am anyway they the were hardy subjects wont t talk a bit about over training engaging recovery yet a ther couple methods that am i've heard about and that i use am based on some data that i've seen but mainly discussions with really informe people yourself prime mackenzy a kelly starr at an others the to that i'm aware of for gaging recovery of the nervous system and kind of systemic recovery or am grip strength especially o gripstrength on waking in the morning yand a the called cormodac i tolerance tas the ability to do a long controlled exile after a few a rhythmic deep breaths just t which i massuming taps into both a mat one's ability to mechanically n control the diafrim but also how well one is regulating carmodaxide first question is is this stuff am fiction fact or am a commonation of kind of anecdata as i call it are there any pure refu published ata is your lad working on these things and am am i deluding myself using these tools or er they useful it is not fiction at all there are i'm wut wut seel two tolerance s less published data we have run a study ing our lad looking at the association between the su to tolerance and well be calls trait and state anxiety i an nos are in the publication process is what i'll say idrat you cannot really talk about that stoffash and an tell it tout but in general id say as reason i'm still toing it a'll des rit a'll just leave yet wassuming its not a clinical try man i think sharing am preliminary findings fine sons we high them as preliminary yet i'm not a reviewer but i look forward to reading the paper yabit as you no scientific at thic lik you nee to be careful about saying tellming people results before you have come through that pro life which is why i'm flaging this i o these results are not yet pure pass through the pure review process your hearing about it prior to pure review yet having said that tim there is enough in that feel tham not the first one into that field and i i 'm very confident that that is that is a real thing i'm in terms of actual tracking recovery the big picture is this when we run through a full analysis when we when we have an out thet go through a bom a bonma likelarathic program were in a run and weril got three major categories can countegry one a w called visible stressers andthen we have hidden strascers and the we have recovery capacity any time the total strass load out paces recovery capacity you reather going backwards in your physical ability or your reducing adaptability now you have lovers to pull here you can reduce stress intake or you can increase recovery capacity right what we want in an ideal situation is to be able to implement the most stress possible cause that is the driver of adaptation recover from that now we get the most adaptation and aptation being simply a change whatever change you want to be that is that is our gold standard rights pine lhy act some people have indogenous differences they jus recover better they do not theyre genetic factors but let us talk about the onesthat are manipulatable if we go to the stress side of it you want the thrattle to be pushed as far down on the ones you want stress from and as far off of te ones you do not wanstress that the adaptation comes in the exact erea you want an yofre not burning gas and something you do not care about because you are just you are you are taking that total stress bucket too high i'm recovery capacity over there here is how you can do that you can run some analytics and measure what we do with every one to these these very comprehensive break downs to figure out what is that physiology look hidden and visible and then what is the recovery capacity once we have that blue print we can now figure out what of the two or three things we need a track that are these indicators of what we call performance anchors an anchor is something that kind of drags behind you ore below you that slows you down the analogy being let us see weare going down one of these amazing canyon roads and will not say which canyon werein you can stay hidden here im an youre cars going down into certain velocity and you want to go faster most people's us first impulse is to hit the gas the accelerator we want ta push well that is fine but if you are foot is on the brak and you push the accelerator you might go itl a bit faster but nember one you are wasting a loto literal gas to go lobi faster and too you are burning your engine you migt you are gong to blow the easier solution is just take your foot off the brak you are going to go faster by just stopping yourself then if that is not fast enough we can hit the accelerator everyone last to just pushd down right more stimuluts more optimization bing ming mingming m here our first analetics are whereare thse performance anchors what is dragging you back what is hand what is putting down the brak i won to move those two or three things out ofthe way and i'llet see how far you get oh look at that youre recovery capacity has gone away up you are dapt you are adaptations ore happening faster now or we can do more work because youre recovering quicker we are trying to figure out in those buckets and we have a whole host tof things we measure bile markers and surveys and everything else we go through to find out what is there after we have one that now we'r just going to track a few of these recovery markers along the way to figure out what is globily happening that could mean grip strangt i'm i have some folks who we'r in a tescripts ringt daily all thers we are gon to look at ah arby or combinations we may look at performance mectrics a a force plaht soing into a vertical jump every single day i were to see wetethat is at we have use the taptests before which is how many times you can tap your finger as fast as possible it is a rough indicator of sench a nervous system it it us tey one mitittor exactly and this is aps you can do on this tapis fingers fast you can it is can say you would id sixty taps to day and your you'r average is seventy five i that cause it taps in to a nopot intended am into upper motornor on capacity iis a lot of things grip strangth obvious to have to send the deliberate signal to my head to grip but at some point the lower motor on seregoingto be taking over the majority the work the signal is probably one and done whereas i am tapping is going to be a repetted of set yo am sending of signals from upper motor nerons yet somemony athlets i work with we track blood every day we track yorine every day we track am ideally accommination of subjective and objective metters everything from how did you feel last night to environmental censors of their bedroom a full pastees going on running actual sleep dike nosics not or ring nothing agens or but lke full analec an some emints is simple as how you feeled to day and mos ha britcal dump iht we are going to put people in a position to succeed err to figere out what is the lever that they ned to pull as well as what is their aptitude what sport ofthey and what we realistically get away with and some of em will take machines with them and will do blood every day and yurn and all kinds of stuffin some of em it is ata lot lower for myself i i'm not pleasant mentioni for i'm not a bifan of devices a n where the wis ris watch i tend to go off feel which is not a it is not the ideal objective way to gage things but am part of my reasoning for this is my colleague from the psycology department a a doctor a lea crum at's done some studies where they have am given pep deliberately given people false feed back about their sleep told people you did not sleep very well or they have told peoplel you slept really well and performance can be driven in the expected direction based on feet back independent of how well people slept ored in sleep now that does not manyong to take some one that only slept two hours or was not of every to a thirty seconds cause of apney and tell them they slept great and the'regingto perform great cognive tasks but you can take someon who slept very well tell them that the recovery quotion wasnat very good and their their output is going to be worse that is my concern about a lot of devices out there not to name specific devices but it is still unclear to the general public what the specific algarythms are to generate these recovery scores right and many of the thngs that reportedly am track sleep orn't tracking sleep not a tracting heart rate and breathing which are corlets of sleep dap but that is different and again i'm not nockin those i i think the sleep trackers if nothing else have provided a form whereby people are very conscious of getting good sleep it is were knowing the total clork an take up your food youll go whow i'm ashaly eating a lot more than i thought cobrati or lassin some cases but often the cases that 's more i think for the typical perse and i'm wondering whether no myself a because i'm not a a a competive athleader sonly not a professional athleep am beted with myself i suppose but no one else morning pulserate i tend to take when a an waking m if i wake out of a really strestsful dream i might relax a lobitmen just take my pul strate con to get a range and see if its spiking for whatever reason i do not rtend to measure grip strength although i'e heard you can jisuse a classic a scale yem old fashion scale with the cerneel now old fashion am or some other more technical deviceis probably a god a there is a low cost one the other and then the carbondoxi tolerance yes we have n'n eally talked about that in in specific ways my understanding f it is its afor deep slow breaths and threw the nose out through the nose and then a big in hal as maxaxale and then time duration of exhale through the nose and then stopping the stop watch at the point where longas are empty not necessarily as long as one could hold thei breath did i get that righter you mo okan i guess we should credit you and brine mackenzie a those gas yeand and the folks a under a brin's umbrella for a really establishing this as a really good metric when and how can i use the carbonox i tolerance test to gage re coveri upon waking am post training session yet withot ve goo tine a nomeral one answer is whatever you do to be consistent do it under any good signs experiment do it uner thexactsime conditions and you cannot that generally means somewhere in the morning s that iswhe yofre probably going to have the most controlmostability i'm going ya you would take any horv or other metric wake up get in a control get stablize take o matric got it can be prett good got it dy em by card teting soda am rumor has it and data has it that it can a should be a pretty effective training tool very effect could you explain a little bit of about how it works and how one might explore using sodian by carb to anhance training out put in a couple of derin contact ye there is a handful of these youviquirously effect if supplements for performance din by carbonates one of them it is a very in genius idea cause it is simple effectively mostof contraction happens because insimatic function occurs within a fairly specific p trench right if hoeu gets extremely a citic it does not it and whether you are running through a robic calisis r anarobeck or anything else all these things require even eigh t p hydralisis requires ai t p s and andsim hasti at ansims do not function well outside his fairly special range what happens is generally fatigue this the sensations of fatigue are actually cause by some signal that he were strying to run on a p h re getting in the wrong arrange you are not out of gas usually you not too low on oxion you are not running low an musclik caginiat you'r typicall gan se sign or feel signals of fatigue way prior to that mostly being p tes that being said what if we could regulate pghe better enter by carbona right a without going too far in a matabolism effectively what happens is is you take n inhal and you are mostly breathing in oxygen owe to when you extale your breathing out see o to they difference s you have gained to carbon somehow well all of your carbohydrates in your body come in the form of long carbon chains in fact that iswhat a carbo hydrate means it is a one carbon molecule that has one water molecule ttach its to carbon that as been hydrated in the case of bike glucos blood sugar it is a six carbon molecule rit in terms of fat which arethe only two places you can get most of your sellian energy carboydrates in fat that is also a big long block in chain of carbons whether you gettingyour energy from fat or carbo hydrate you are going to split those atams no the words you have got six carons attach tr each other and in this part o chemistry tes extragonic when you break that carbon bond break one of those carbons off from the other that is going to release energy just if you had a pencil and here and i snapped it ou go bang and pop i broke the bond that were connecting that graphite the next piece of graphiht and that released energy as i put energy in a system et cetera ook i as a result though we have now had say five or si carbons chain together we broke one off the end which its not how works but making the point and now you have one free floating carbon use that energy release do they go make eigt p then go make your muscles contract but now you have got carbon floating around you can associate freefloating carbon with being at a hyerociti level it is not chan happen the only way they ging to go through this process as if your body says do we have an oxygen molecle available tht we can bine this to immediately yes we do that carbon attachus to that oxion molecule you cannot just put seal to in the blood because of what we just talked about se ou ot bind it throgh this by carbon at process it is on to go through your blood is goino going to longs it' an t go back into its carbon ox and molecules can a trancs go through the alvio i ino the longs and you got exile you went from carbon this by carbonit system back into carbon exale inhaled o two plants go the opposite by the way therecant breathe in the seal two therere cleave off that carbon stack gost carbons together and that is how they get larger im in you'r in your blood those six carbon chains are called glucos if we store that in our muscle we call it glikeagens we take a bunch of lucos and stack it together and a plant we call that starch that is effectally what it is right's e you take a bunch of carbon from t e atmosphere stuck itall together and that is a starch i'm if you want to do in the form of fruit we take that starch from the ground you put it up through a the tree go all way up to the top put it into the flowr break it up into these big huge trunks of starch in to little forms called frutos or glucos that is why fruit has frutos in it and that is why tubers and stof have starchion basely starch in an animal is adernus ook it all that to say if that is happeng and we know that a by product specifically of vanarobic collosis meaning the break down of carbohydrates for fuele a typically in a very fast pays with low oxygen of illability the downside of that oquation is acid production we know that that is a problem as i i start the conversation off there intentionally what if we could reduce the acid build up ni you now p h kind of works i went and cot a double negatives there right you n want too much acid build ut then could we prolong and sustain energy im in a more effect to pace especiall in this anarobic i'm interval kind of environment and again that is important because in those things failure is not a result a running out of fuel or oygen it is a result of fatigue building up way too quickly is i also true for resistance training e may be blor of the the treation vosilate system that can be in issue it could simply be in issue of force production you just do not have an a force we ceare not out of energy you just cannot muster enough i 'm force you do enough reps and it is can to be an issue there i creating foster withon't be the big wonter demanting i'm to come back a little bit to the beginning then i'll i'm circling this altogether intentionally llright well the way that we produce energy is going to be in two primary categories anerobic aneroba corobic meaning with oxygen anerobic meaning without in terms of muscle contraction you arepretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat now fat is going to be exclusively a rubic meaning imany use fat from te entire body roughly equally you are doing a sprint up a hill and your hand srings or your glues your quadron fire you cannot you are not distgoing to use the fat that is directly in those hamstrings youe ging to lose it from the entire body it hase to go through pollicess it is in ta stored form an not upwos tissue got o get broken down put into blood blood's gon to have to go through your body get taken up in a muscle takean up through muscle into the moto condure there wen't have to go tro this process call bate oxidation remember carbohydrates an glucofs especialy is this six carbon molecue fat if it is in the form of a try gliseright it is it three carbon gliterall backbone and three you on't try one to three fatty acids three carbon backbone and those fatty aces are just big long chains of caron that is all it is right we are gin at break that thing down put it in the blood move it up move it into our moto condure you cannot walk those things across a mount o conjur while te're too big you have to do is cleave them off into little chunks and it turns out we break em off into two carbon chunks we call it bata as in too move those in a moto conjure if that can go through this little then call crebcycle or tracs ila gaci cycle and you kick out a bonch of energy out of that you had two carbons as result of that process you cn agenerate too carbon to oxides but remember you can only go to that process if oction is vailable ecaus you have to be able to place those carbons on to something or acid gets up way too high too fast this is oneof the reasons why fat is a nice fuel sorce but it is very slow it is takes physical time to move from the back of your shoulder in your blood down your hand sraying up take up take up tak in addition it is required oxien vailability if you need engy fater you simply do not have the time to bring in the oxygen transport it through go through capilaries exchanged through tissue et cetera car a hydrate on the other hand is can o be stored locally in the exercising muscle self and specificall in te cida plassum ta's glakogen that is gluke as likagen in the stora there what is can happen initially you are initial demands for exercier for fuel are goingto come from the glikagein store with in the muscle fiber itself it is sis con to break right there and you tn be off the races youat the six carbon molecule yu to break it into two separate three carbon molecules i' eep bome that breaking provide you a tiny bit of energy very small but sum now your to take those two three carbon molecules and you want to be able to oxidize them as that is your only next step but order to do that you got to go those in a mite condrea you got a break one of those molecules off then you will be back to your two carbon molecule tist you do with fat that is gongoin to mato condre and then'sgoingo go to the exact same creb cycle two carbons et cetera but hold on if you do not have sufficient oxygen or sufficient mita condry availability and you'r stuck at that two three carbon placs what the do you do you have problems right now we have to say o ca wait a minute we have to a three carbon molecule and we have a bunc to this acid build up now acid functionally is is hydrogen that that is what pgh potental hydrogen is what peach stands for a right if hydroges building up as a by product of muscular contraction and the you'r having the three carbon mlecule what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogens and those three carbmolecules by the merical proovator perofic acidraght if you take a perovic acid and you grab hydrogen put on on top of it we now have a different name for it it is called hydrogen proxa lactate band gall right that is what lack da lac to gacid is right we have now built that up never one reason why lactit is not causin your fortake its actially preventing it and that does not wanch o other really cool stup but the point is that system calling last long that get's overwhelmed very quickly what are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen well if you started off in a normal patrange you do not have very far to go before you have now gone into that level of too much acidity if you start off in a more basic and a basican a mean simple i mean cemistry right and more a'lk line then that same amount of increase in p h is no longer now just put you back in your physilege caran sotoyn by carbonite whether taken as a cream or a powder or beaking sota or anything else can simply put you in a more alkline state even acutely this is something you can take right now before your your work out am you are going to delay what we call delay the progression of fati and owould o would people start to approach this practice i by understandias y can do this with commono storebout baking soda no question umthere is always a conc urn about gastric distrableum that it is a very effective laxitive i'm sometimes in it and unwanted laxitive effect but how would one approach this before let us say i'm i'm going to i've doing the mile repeats ye exercise a a mile repeats a protocall that we talked about earlier i'm doing that for a few months and now i want to try the sodian by carb ye proch im well hidrate it hothly and well rested iray to go when am i get to drink this u sodyam by car solution what how would i make the solution i let' say i'm i take ten ounce as water ye how much by car do i want to sod him by carpshire put in there can we come up with it tut is it half a teaspoon is a teaspoon here is o men to tell you you will thank me by starting lower you can always go more later to little pinch you cannot go back obout i start with a quarter teaspoon fine half an honesty half as fine half a teast toonly finds is all that set will that down i read a study recentliny that showe that people will hit there u the the pak benefits of this at different times but it is somewhere if i if memory serves me correctly somewhere between sixtey and ninety minutes later i moigt want to drink it on the way to the track it can it can be as low as twenty oki maybe as i get to the tracks and somebone to do some warm up with some walk and jogging i i say forty five menutes ok tht's that i'm just a very rough standered but yet you are right it is it is individualized im and you probably want to play without a little bit if not somewhere in the neigborhood of twenty to an hour ok and then the perceived and real fatigue if done correctly the perceived and real fatigue ought to be reduced yes i can do more work without feeling exhausted will i feel less of a lack hate burne yet done in air quotes for those listening i realize that is a very crude way to describe a complex physiological process eum fantastic can sodyim by car be used repeatedly for longer duration training yet and if i were goin to use it with wait training for whatever reason maybe i'm doing circuit type training or i'm doing the superset type straingth training that you talked about before pushpole pushpole whers a lie bit more carty of asculyrly demanding ye then maybe i sep that throughout the work out make sure there is a bathroom nearby it sounds cause i do i am aware that a many people gets pretty serious gastrict dos hask me very quickly ok gray whell sons agan amazing training tool i reallyappreciate you shrink cause i think it is it is one that does not get a lot of air time these days cause it is been around but sounds it has some pretty impressive i ye use yoknw a sort of funny about that is i may i get it pop colture is what it is but still to this day if you want to talk about sor your most effective general hell slach performance somplementation it is the same three to forto five in v been thre it is because hey work really well without going into the chemistry of each one in the practice each one ecause i definly want to get you back to talk about ti it nutrition and supplementation oh yum at some point but i think we would need a full couple of hours to get that right ye at least if you as a teeser would you mind just listing off the other am supplements that you have found her very effective for for many people soting by carbor baking sods one what are some of the other one yet i wi'll go cind of reverse order bateto alenane as another very classically effective one im similar idea e suin my carbonit sos its it is going to bid alennes going to come mans can be converted stored as called carnesine in the musslein carnessine is an interest on your buffer another words it is is going to delay the build up of askit i'm fetet blocker if you well very effect a very cheap very safe 'm well studied the top one low of all of em by far that has an incredibly strong safety prophile it has it is a cheap it is a simple form to get has a important magnitude of effect and is affect of a cross multipl domains of physical halth and performance and it is because of that it is my crown jeel it is in my opinion without question the michael jordan of all supplimentation and that is creating mon idrat it effects many things we typically think about it as its muscle sto or you you talk cind of you quickly were talking about the creating phosphate system but we have to realize i the mass majority reserch on creating phosphate is not ins more performance and has not been for twenty years it is in clinical and it has everything from effects on the logical system to there ave ben associations to mental health and depression and to be very clear i am certainly not saying you can take creating and cure anything and i'm not saying it iscan a stop you from depression or anything but i'm saying thereis there is a lott a researcth in these areas and thers for reason people are doing it i completely agree and if you are willing i'd love to have you back for us to do a discussion on creatine and the brain or creating in the nervous sisdonthere will be a lot of fund and maybe we can do it a kind of a journal club in advance of that ares tha do not now journal club is where im scientists a read a munch a papers and then argue about them discuss them and try an extract tha the kind of i'm iagreed upon center of mass if you will ii think ai've long been taking five grahams of cretim on a highdrate per day for mainly for the cognate of a fact it i'm i sense an effect that is otleasy anecdatea but think they are a lot of date out theirs is yit it t is enough at you are not yofrenot crazy there is enough there and in fact thras enough mechanism now i'm to understand the metabolic needs people thin the mati a musslook i rite some gong to think about them tabolism needed to fuel muscle but we forget cells im uncells ra blood cells and nerve cells ast ra sights brain all the stuff requires energy and it is all going through mhe tabilism superinteresting we we will do the deap dive on that soon i've a final question for you you are involved in a really interesting i think really cutting edge project that i first learned about from you i do not know of anyone else doing anything i'm as forward thinking and frankly as relevant to the general population because of a my interesting people getting better sleep and o how to do that of whaiting stressllor anyhow do that tell us a little bit about what i believe it is called absolute rest right this is something that we have been playing with behind the scenes im for a long time than this typiy have high performanseff works right people wont exclusivity and and this as been built i'm effectilly what happened is a friend of mine codybirkart non if cody but af fame d out in texas ye yenassa nasaga ye i do know cody wonderful just down the road thinker i'm every one's interested in sleep right and for forever i ud how were using with athletes but everything available tells you how you are sleeping nothing can tell you why you'r leeping that way and we we got together and bolder and then i met some his former colleagues computer science folks i'm harvard emdy im and some really impressive teck folks and we were just thinking about idea and we came up with we'stry to realize the problems or it we use first principale thinking s oen my favorite approaches a if you have not for me with that go gogthat thi just a recipe to solve problems this first prenciple thinking and we justarter to think about man all the sleep tecas is there it is real i do not need to convince people that they need sleep everone's done that you need high chol to sleep but how can i from ide solutions and withthe people i work with i cannot just tell them your testostrons down or your sleep down o rec i need to beaple to be this is down and heres why and here is our solution that that is how our high performance world works enter absolute rest this is saying iok whatare the actual nodes that go in to high effective high quality sleep every one is psychology there has to be some sort of screening dignostic for are you nots sleeping because of simply you cannot control yourself i nyou have done a wonderful job of giving people tools or if you cannot quite your mind before sleep to this if you wake up and you cannot go back to sleep here about your things right we have some screens that we can do in theire some that suff we can do to analyze this is a psychologicallition it isit is not you are in a control and we have different tricks we use and suff i'm hen yo mack we talk about but it is not that ok is it physiology which is no number too do we know what you are dopman levels are do we knowhat your ceratonan levels are what is melatone and look what is this what is a dranal and what is quarters all quarters all being the primary driver i'm what what is this relationship to e where are these things at whet it a measure all that and intract that reamesh that during the day prior to sleep an ti magere that next morning and even sometimes throughout sleep and whe ere to figure out as is a physiology prom if it is thand we have clear corrections if not were t go on the next up which is is his possibly apathology you have some sort of sleep disorder were in around full pet what is call pest soppoisynography afull the exact same stuff you would get any sleep clinec i' it is ta scensor that is goingto go on merimeasuring e g e o g an were to have a muscle activatient anser to see if your legs ar re moving and everything else is going on and w ceu get a full dignosic and i if any ones or done this the amount of a sleep issues that or happening in people that the do not even realize is extraordinarily hig were to figre this out on one very quick example we just to this with ae professional atly an he was having two hundred eighty roughly of these episodes per night and to be categorizes and episode the have to meet these four specific right to yourya oxtion saturation ventilation changes brain changes to sectur in any hit that overturnity times to night and whak this technology allowed us to do his figure out what position did all the things occurrent well in his particular case most of them are happening was on his back and s we have bought a a very simple tat pello basically thet when on his back that kept him from sleeping on his back and we sawn eighty five per cent reduction an sleep awakeness issues the very first night now we did that tust ostron eventually tripled after three months by just im proving sleep an all we did is move him on was left o right side huge improvements im just by understanding where the problem occurred and why it occurred tere we dodn't have to change hardly anything else he had the basic hygene stuff down and temperature and and all that stuff and he had his chilly pad and all that to keep the think we could not fix it years by the way this took us two years of just trying everything were man and i us lykei i wish wish we coan get you to sleep better and we i pulled out every trick i knew and it jus as soon as we' built this gener all my got it is all he is not over weight by the way toas havin he is not iron officient is not have any these other clunk a classical symptoms that e associated with badsy soplimitation everything we have done a thousand protocalls that fix it over night if it is not psychology it is not physiology and it is not pathology the last one that people do not have any idea about his environment and what you do not realize is we have a box we can sit right next year bed yust plugget in you do not have to do anything and it is gn run full environmental scanps it iscoan a look out the temperature in your room itscan lok at the huminity in your room it is can a look at the volid organic as ince ses to things that are sleeping out from your mattress 's can a look a particulates in the air in possibly alargens and things that are floating around that are closing your nose off you cannot sleep at night and and your mouth breathing and you have talk the lot i'm sure on the previous episodes about why that is back it is can look at your seao too cloud we have ou've tockty we have reay set this point oupright your inhaling o to buthin your exhaling seal to well during the day and when we are conversing you have a quite a bit of force withtout exallation right but at night it is just barely seeping at your mouth what happened to seao two sends to cloud up and build around your face and the you ant a rebreathing that seo too and this can cause at a large number of sleep propemt you are simply re breathing in the panic o whether you fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage the sealo two round your faceis a big issue this stuff has all been known by the way with the astronots for a very long time it just has not translated into the to the commercial spaces of course gonded art i y perform our space sill we can measure that as well and we can figure out i for the most extreme we can actually come n to a bedroom and rebuild an entire slee aboptimization i set up and controlth entire thing but fom most folks the manon we can do is ronfold dignosics in chahov is tis environment related is a pathologies or something else sos his a commercial device that people can eventually acts us it is now a where can people learn more about absolute rest absolute rest nokkom very cool am and just evertful discloasure i was not aware that you had done this prior to to day w you would mention i was to ask people scientists or otherwise i ways love to ask you whatting most excited about lately and the sonds i can amazing technology am and just to be really clear and that is not something we are working on that is that is landed that is landan we are ready to go great well an that is one of the things i appreciate about you is that you'r you are willing to sometimes speculate but ou always say speculation but in general your you seem the kannagy were that you are going to be public facing about something for gan to make a statement there is got to be quite a bit behind it you are nit an a allude to the inten years we might be able to do this or in five years you are very data driven konnago yet well the people i work with wee nieng answers riht we do not have that time framan we typically have may' we start the season of four weeks that is is maram ot well as i said i appreciate that about you but iis but one of the many things i appreciate i think a the listeners and i can well appreciate on the basis of to day's discussion what a enormous wealth of information you are how clear and im and potently you communicate that information and also how you can a take a huge cloud of information and still to still it in to protocalls that ought to work for seventy five per cent of people seventy five per cent of the time which is an immensely valuable am thing to do for me and from the listeners i just on to say thank you much for taking the several now hours i lose track of time of which is a good a reflects all good things several hours to take a break from teaching takabriak from research takabriak from the other important commitments of your

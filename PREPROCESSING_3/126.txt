jobidin tries to do his empathy routine and howii but fails dramatically democratic officials try to blame the wild fires brutalit young climat change and republicans continue to prepare for wednesdays jeope tobate and venshpir this is the benshfiro sho to day's show is sponser b expressfee pian thousands mylicter to already secured doere notwic day to join them atexpress fee pianta com flash men you can check your calender as you will see to day is august twenty second he fires in laheina that actually wiped out the entire town it may have killed a thousand people those wild fires well you knw they happen non august eighth it is currently almost two weeks beyond the wild fires maybe thousd people dead hundreds people dead for shore including possibly up to hundreds of children in fact the mayor of malley says he has no idea how many kids ashey died in these wild fires in lhina here he was iiatear o many choert ai aawayawa ter a teryhinaai awe othing bout about you no idea how many kids o armisin i the president of the united states though he was on dication he was in rehubof beach delaware and here is how the rules of politics work gan if you are the president and major natural disaster happens on your watch and youare apparently not within i shot of the thing then we say that you do not have empathy and that you are very very bad this was true of george joby bushrann came to hrricane catrina itas true of tad cruws when it came to freezing temperatures in tacas and apparently it is not true if you 're democrat if youare democrat you can do whatever the hell he wants jobidon when on vacation rehubbith beachtollawar he was as specifically about the death told in laheina and he said no comment and then he wrode round on his bite and he hads himice cream an he sat on the beach a week and then he went to lake toho in nevata and dom he sat there at the mansion of a major downer and then he took the trouble to finally fly to malli now you would imagin this is when the fame jobiden epithyu would make its appearance he hears the thing about jobidon he is not empathetic jobiden is a very selfish creature if you look at jobidon'ste entire life history what you see is tha jobidon kars chiefly about himself and also about people in his immediate familial circle he is always been willing to use his power in order to corruptly enrich all of those people including himself he does not see political power as wait to quotin would help the little guy as he pretends he ses away to help him in his family and h people he is most close to and if that means denying the family name to a four year old he will do that to but he is been able to get ahead because the media hve beenable to shield him based on this fo supposedly roguish charm that jobidon once had na i've never seen it i do not understand why anyonman find jobine charming but this was the li about jobidon for four deckates when in reality he is just waers filled with with boldly i mean that that is what jobiden is it the prommis that as he get told her all of the layer is of charm are worn away there is nothing left a bunch of the except a bunch of false old family stories that he trots out and woove empathy and treally quite ugly when you see it it is really ugly the first time he went to somebody is house in the person had died a soldier a died and he talks about beau the first time he did that he got lobut a sympathy for him and then after he did it time and time and time again the simpathy started to wear awaye well this time he was visiting lhena and he proceeded to tell a story about how he knows what it is to lose a home he knows what it is first of all let me just as i' said before explain how morning works in the jerish community we have very formal astd rituals for morning a'm n orthdoc jews we do something called shiva shiva means seven seven days after somebody dies for that seven days you literally just bring people food you do all of the minyanam all of the all the jewish prayers that you have to do our done in the home of the morners the morners do not leave their home for a full week everybodys comes an visits them they talk about the person who died and the first rule if you arey person who is visiting a the house o morning is keepin moutshot you do not go and talk about all of your personal experiences because that is awful and selfish it isuch he not empathetic if you walk into the house of somebody who has died and you start talk about how exactly what it is how they feel because you also had somebony who died that is an incredibly arrogant and selfish thing to do its the first rule of visiting a house of morning literally the first rule jobidon bricks that rule he does it early he does it often and then not only does he break the rule he does it with stories that are nots even related he visits leheina and up people had the relatives burnedto a crisp in laheina an people literally lic the worst wild fire disaster in modern american history by longshot and jridon's first responsis what if i tell a story about how my house burned own now to understand thi story in proper contact wor you have to understand is his houston burned down in fact jobiden he is told the story before and the story is false what actually happen is that one time there was eit small kitchen fire cause by a lightening strike in his home it was under control in twenty minutes his house did not burned out nobody was hurt nobody died but to jobidan empathy means pretending that he cares about you while talking about himself that is the nature if who jobdn is here is jobin an laheina yesterday i wan to compar difficos but we have a little sense tilla i a to los ahome yere'sgo now fifty years giwas e washinto o me te press e suny sundy liy strock at home le its ou in ofho a big pon he whire cim up under e or home ihe a ceci just this make a long storys yor wi lost my wife why sixy seven curve i my ca al kina fine i watch the fire fiders where thereis fonger not is all expression i grew upright acrok her from a fire hall an clemmo gellower the hell's wrong ith this guy sisy what thehl's wrong with him men side from thi sinility what is wrong with him is human being this luck not the first time he is trott of this out in the middle of talking about fires he pparently did it in to thousin and at thirteen also he also did it apparently in two thous in and twenty two when he is tige made another wild fire i's constantly trotting out the story ol get a few weks back my family are's lot a lightening here in the sato floria i some lightening got groundded near our house and it is that a small fire outside of our kitchen is a true story aithen it was put out the fire fites came we left our house an hour we came back how is that relevant tallhina it is not it is not relevant at all because what did not happen anything tragic or horrifying it is hatly good story do t it is a what is wrong with you what is wrong with you and the reality is that old age strips away all the pretensions jobidon cares about jopidon everything is refracted through the prism of jobidon he is a person who owns only one surface and it is a mirror apparently because all he cares about its how to fects him how affects his family and what is he have to do seen go back to vacation toholl it' ifyou real about this what is he really have to do it is an amazing amazing clip an the fact that ly imagin for a secon i know bletthi's kim al the time but it is true becaue the medio ar corrupt imagin if donald trump had gone to the sight of a wild fire that killed a thousand people maybe and talked about how one time he almost lost his car because there was a small kitchen fire in his home can you imagine now jobiton is on th s repeatedly over and over and over and everybody in the media heep trying to treat him as empathetic old uncle joe he is not empathetic he is never been empathetic jobiton has always an frever and will forever be about jobiton which is why he is used his personal power for the corrupt purpose of enriching his own family that is who he is e beyond that obviously the guys ailing ill get to that

isabout to keel over i here is a bryan shats at gently trying to gui the elderly gentlemen away from the podium while offering him water getin no ti my goodness my goodness what a country we have created for ourselves man we meant we ent we make great political choices in this country we really really do well meanwhile the democrat's a medya they have found theire angle on the howywile fire it is not the incompetence of all the local officials their democrats we cannot talk about thei'r wild in competence this by the way is true every time there is a natural disaster that strikes a left en area the country if hurricane catrina hits new orleans and the mayor there i's just absolte iis ranagan and he is the worst mayor in modern american history and ten thousand people bi because i crappy mayor and the governor is also i democrat wel thn you blame the president of the united states and fema obviously if you are a governor in a north eastern state an a hurricane wipes through your state and floods the place then you blame climate change and if you are in hawi you do not blame the emergency management chief ho apparently did not sound emergency cirans as wild fires neare lahina we do not blame him we do not blame many the people were in charge of water management and concervation in a howi we do not blame any of the public officials who left o munch it ry grass out there to burn at extrordinary heat and speed we doft blame many those people of course we blame climatechange now the reality is then virtually all f these circumstantes when it comes to wild fires when it comes to hurricanes when it comes to firtually any natural disaster they are two issues one is the actural natural disaster the sizenscope of it and the other is how the public officials built the place how public officials exacerbated or mitigated the problem this is true pretty much everywhere if this is why in earthquag of five magnetue will hit aron and ten thousand people die but an earthquake of five magnetubil hit california and nobody will die because the bildings in california are built better than th buildings an rod it is a public officials actually matter an awful lot in'strmens of the regulations in troms of the response all that stuff matters extraordinarily when a comes to particularly nastural disastlict is the one thing they have to be pretty good at when hliy the re rally bat at it which is wiv thousad people dide the chief permanantiah submitted his resignation citing health reasons going county officials a day earlier to news conference antiah defended te decision not to actuvate the sirens saying the out door alarms our prigt are yous primarily for tunamis oh not of help people because people are train to see higher ground when they hear the ciren well i mean everybody would elease looked arounding on od crap a giant fire coming down the hill his resignation was accepted again this follows hard on the fact that we we now know that the water was not released t to the area until too late but as we say when it comes to me tha narrative somebody else house to be plames it cannot be the local democratic officials that cannot be allowed and cannot be the president for a lack lusta response or no commate while he sits on rehuboth beach we cannot be that it must be climate change this is the narrative their gonagowath why governor josh crene who is the governor of the state where thesicart is is climate change is the real probem here when your tieant glo bill warmen are you sying that clim at changed amplified the cost of human error yes it did a there is always going to be incredible things that people due to save lives from the fire fighters from citizens and is always going to be decisions that are made that i'm sure are not perfect in the moment a and but when you have fire that moved more than a mile a minute and what happened i'm told by some of the survivers they were at the initial fire it was put out some time late the afternoon in lina and then the fire fighters had to go to three other fires had started because of the conditions when they left the fire stirred up again and then when the storm winds from dora which were that strown swept it out it just destroyed everything it is the climate change you see it was all about the climate changings tut the earth gradually warming ofer the course of the next hundred years or hoi sent our bran shatsy to the saming tact says it is the new normal of the new normalis a thousand people ling in line apparently sen what do you think the most important specific lessens are that can be learned from this to make sure a tragedy of this level does not happen again well i think we all have to understand that a severe whether vans are going to get more frequent and more severe i'm owhy is tha place im that is experienced volcanic eruptions and senomis and hurricanes and tropical storms and we have hod a few wild fires but nothing that a threatened aa whole city am nothing that flatten the whole city and i just think this is the new normal for not just the state of wy but for the whole platter for the whole country this i the new normal dises is just city's getting flattened by wildfires j insley the governor of washington who is been big on the carman limitation band wagon for years now he tod the exact same thing hes ays well that the big issues we

right now has o is climatechange clausing all this the answers now it is not who says that the washington post even the washington post is no this is actually not climate change jeff nasters medeorologiss for yele climate connection says if youhad together a whole bunch of influences that is how you get a disaster no one thing makes it happen the links between human cause climate change in fires are well establish because globall warming means plants can more easily dry out but there is one other issue which is that in howye it is also meant more rain ah that one of the things that is tappened is increased humidity in howie some immediate analsis th winds observed in hhy he have found dors presente may have only increase the goss speed by about five miles per hour which is not sufficient to explain what exactly happened year the hurricane and its intensity were certainly not the man effect fueling the fires as for the trougt conditions that covered more than a third of mally county where the most destructive fires burn there is note terect sine their product of climate change said abbey fraser an if fileaet faculty member a university of hawi why there is a long trm tren of the climing precipitation howy there is not enough evidence to suggest his the productive anything beside normal climate patters and fluctuations in the pacific she said precipitation patterns there are heavily influence by elnenio which return in june and by longer trm pattern known as the pacific a decato oscillation olenos known for bringing driar winters wbut it is rival does not explain the currn conditioners said said fraser in the summer it can bring it more precipitation than normal to natural very ability is just really strong an hawi what exactly cost it well i mean part of it is the fire prone grass as an envasive species than been brought on to the island in order to allow for grazing some of it is failures of local public officials but here is the beauty when your democraticalocal official you can always have the media available to explain away your problems by blaming the earth whetl what a wonderful what wonderful privilege to be a democrat it is thus on it is the earth it is carbon it is life man it is not you sucking ued your job ever ever ever accan meanwhile speaking of people hare sucking at their job the presidents of the united states continues to preside over an economy tht is really really on the verge of someping quite bad treasury yields continue to clime meaning the price of bonds is going down that is how you end up if the higher treasury yields ripingis the way that yield works is that it is the difference between the facial price of the bond and the return on the bond that means the people are still investing in the stock market but it is ken of weird because the called inverted yield curve continues to predomonates the' ten youre yield clothes if four point threy three nine per cent above the nearly sixteen year high it is at last thursday rising yields have weight on stocps ithall three mator indicees logging losses last week yet the the rout and bonds as been led by longer turm it treasuries an otherwords people are not trusting that the government may be able to pay back those bonds or they are there very doubtful about the state of the long turm economy meanwhile car prices are about stiganosdive according to the walster journal five years go ther dozen models of new cars salling for less than twenty thousand dollars in two thousand twenty three there is only one for the average american payng off a new car curn prices demands forty two weeks of income and you are about to see the prices nosedive when it comes to cars you are lso seing hiring slow down pretty significantly pay for new hirers is declining it significantly according to the walster journal pay for new hires is staring to shrivil after years of hefty salary bums requiring workers to reset whie financial gains to expect from switching two a new job again the red line the red la the red lights are all blinking at this ploint the only cquestion is wen the economies in atep ah ye you have to feel if you watch the economan on daily basis that what goes up must come down and the effects of in inflationary economy in a stagnating economy with little innovation little investment those wages are cincome do pretty fast right here which means sat one thousand times jobidon is a very very vulnerable encumbant he is not with us he is unempathetic he is a nasty crup person and he is presiding over bat aconomy what 's that mean u find

wednesday by pulling data americans prticular epublicans wood love trump to participate in the in the nebate he is not going to according to the latest pulling data some seventy three per cent of americans in the republican party with to see trump join the debate twenty seven per cent agreed with trump that he should sit it out but only nine per cent voter said they would trumpsopponis to place an emphasis i'm making the case agains donal trump very few people ire can be watching tht tobate hoping that sumity attax donal trump that baseclee is can be chris christis jobread this his designated lan in the republican primary whatever of that exists tnow he is showing in pulls in new hampshire by the way acchristy is is running very week in iowa but right now according to the latest polasen from new hamper he' howing at fourteen per cent in new hampshire which is his best poll showing yet christy for his partis attacking trump with elacrity suggesting the trumpit is coward ownay christy presumaly will make that case at the debate and dou' be interesting see how people on the stage respond to all that meanwhile democrats are just roting for casualties on the stage according to the yor times after europe fretting about presitent by nds political standig in their electoral chances an twenty twenty four democrat's ard a moment of high confidencs has re publicans prepare for their first presidential dbate on wednesday they will be watchig with bated breath in the hopes that the republican candides en brace the likely to be absent donalca trump tdefend him over its four criminal intitements in dorse national restrictions on abortion and call for cuts two social security and medicar in democrats at dream senario even without trump on stage democrats see the republican white house hopeful hopefuls as the avatars for what they describes o party an thrall to its extreme elements nobody is roding for the debatesto gloff thorels more than democrats praying for mister bydon's re election ja mesina the campaign manager for barockle bomisis all i want is these people to say the same stuff they ben saying on the campagn trail an nationalty the please continue to double down on a six week abortion man thow be wonderful thank you for doing this well because they are rooding for casualties it is worth while noting how many of them are pushing rivals to governor rondo santus in florida the poll's right now show that santus is trailing trump by a wat there is some evidence then iwa there is life left in to santus according to the lates pulling dade up in iwa the trump campaign is a doing slightly worse in iwa than theoretically they should be j an sells are the fanes iwa polster who put out new numbers in iwa it shows that trump right now is a is at forty three per cent meanwhile the santusis in nineteen per cent sellser says that the finding s indicate the races closer than it mad for seam that is because in the iel caucus is a voders second place choice matters it let' say that you are rondasantis youre the first troice o nineteen per cent of the people and then youv oe for timscott and timsgot is not one of the top too and that means that you are going to now get a boots right becauses let say tha you chose timsgott an in to santus and then scot's vot gets tossed out it is rantroys voting and then that second troice boat goes to do santus theoretically to santus could be the winner in iwa then woy register note sixty three per cents of likely jeo be caucascore sattis support trump is their first er second choice that footprint is on par with sixty one per cent who say the same fort to santus also half of re publicans in that iwa poll are saying the mine or not yet made up what o the med you have an interest in they havean interest in fragmenting the field obviously the more the field is fragmentud if they believe that trump is the best person for them to run against which seems pretty evident then there interest is in propping up other people whar not to santus whell right now the candidate of the moment who is not to santus is a vake romasuamy this presumably is why ceven mad and no friends to republicans he is a former senior adviser to mit romny a who appears on emison besy regularly he says that vevake is the is the person wit the highest potential on the stage on wednesday whos yo wrin wy ank ha at amy of it fin cand i tollthe ti in caa tin a tetentio pe pipanga taa ton you i think the greates potential for this to bay com trum te vak for suam romsuamy because if you look at his rapid fire aproach and you look it how hes he really crys talliz as as massage in all this table teving interviews the end of the daties to base te talofy on persformances and his ability to really crystallize as masage an deliver that message and mhake teople think wile this as a fighter this as somebody who is a couldna thik the fig o that the the themicrast in the perce thaccess s of the las as hard tis anybody up there that i think his probably has the greatest potential for to morri and meanwhile thivid axel rod is also propping up the vake romasuamy ight t let us yeur to lethes the vake is not going be president of the united states this election cycle in fact there is an article out to day suggesting that vevake basically ran in order to actes as stalking horse for trump is according to a report from abisynews romaswuamy two doners itched himself th candida who could make serious waves in there publican primary to meeting when met with some skepticism romaswammy argued his candidas he could also diswaye to governor tances from entering the rayes in the lead up to his announcement romaswam would tell several other conservative activis he believe tat if he ran it couldn stop to santus from running or impact his viability as candidate if he did enter the race a i it is worth noting that if ta vake really were gainingi the pols agains donal trump you imagined inal trouble nicknamed him already right donal trump has never been shy about gloing after people he considers to be rivals instead all he has warm words for e vake do democrats which again i know the vake i'm frinds of the vake very nice guy has lot interesting ideas but it' sas something when david axel rod is praising you to tdisguise interesting thing about that to me was the reference to rama swammy yhou started off as and unknown and has provin himself could be a much more effective cultur worrier than the santus himself and an going af ter the the wok anso on he is just been much more compelling hav it t just again democrats are proping up the vake meanwhile by the way the vake is zam he is he is stepped on his toes a few timecs yere but ni't gettng fort of national attention that his positive spin is getting right now for example the washington examiner as an entire article about the vakes fliplops on a wide variety of issues according too the writer gabe keminsky he says romaswammy an ex farmasuitical executive who rose to prominence following the publication of his twenty twenty one book woke ink inside corperan americas social justics is polling in third place in the jopy primary behind to santus whenself is clocking in double digets behind former president donal trump romaswammy has faute position himself as an outsider but dom the reality is that dum again he has been on all sides of a variety of issues the republican told then your post an mid august he be opens to a valuating pardon fror members of the bidin family in the interest of moving the nation forard if ou relected presiden and then he declared no i do not have any plans pardon hunter bidan it is planned to trash when you strike the swamp the swamp strikes back when fox news roun a story to days later in ougst the headlan romaswammy breaks with jo pon tree d criminalization of har drogs quot i'm in that direction where he said qhat i think in the long run 'm tung about over the long run peri of times te criminalization seriously is an important part of the long run solution here romaswammy also label bat planted trash ya again he has sliped lopped on foreign policy two months ago he is danied to the washington for beacon who is open t aning military financial support to israel after the autlesided footed from the campantrail where he repeatedly where he reportedly expressed to contrary view and then he said tht it was false reporting in june and then it was report thre was mis understanding and thenhe told the outlet on saturday that he now supports facing on most age to is rail by two thousand an twenty eight he is said that he e's open to basically moving microship production out of time won sema conductor in topendence he said after that are commitments tawan our commitment to be woins gon military conflict will change because thit is rational e and ourself interest again bavak is e super smark ee bevate no question but the notion the is ring a fully consistent campaign not much and of course he is been flirting a little bit with some interesting teuries shall we says he did not interview with the atlantic nowt lessent full credits of avake for going into unfriendly medeo spaces in speaking to people who of their candidates wll notspeak to and n he gets full credit for this buavake also did say apparently to the atlantic he said quo ie thinks legitimate to say how many police how many federal ationts were on the plans tha the twin towers maybe the answer is zero it probaly is zero for all i know right i've no reason to think of's anything other than zero but e for doing a comprehensive a sessmen of what happened on none eleven they have anot eleven commission absolue that should be an answer the public knows the answer too well if we are doing in january six commission absoluty those shuld be questions we should get to the bottom of here are the people who are armed here the people wo are unarmed what persend tof people who are armed or federal lawn forcemen officers i thing with probably high actually right then he said i woutd take the truth on nine eleven a'm not questioning thi's not someting on staking out anything on i want the truth about nine eleven which is again very can a weird take i do not i do not know what he means by this in any case the is o be gaffs or if to san to set it itwould b a major media story the vaca saying it in sor count of flying under the rate ar because the media have a stake any very competitive primary that dis not in clue trump they have a stake and trum runing if fifty per cent and every one else being it fourteen or fifteen per cent i am glad to see than the run up to the are in see debate now finally the fox news has informed the trump campaign that' surragets four trump will not be allowed to attend the first re publican debate the borrwing of trum surriguts according to the near post fom onestays debate comes one day after trump confirme to not participate in the event the post is con firm surguts for any candidate who did not make the stage will not be allowed at the debate a releast in the spin room it is not a trum specific ban the ex commander she sell th suns ils from junior said he would be attending he show down as a surigut for his father camberly gofo as also expected to show up at the event and run media for the forme president too were a carry lake by rontonalts mat gets it all been a planning to attend apparently apparently there is still going to go to the events there working on a resolution fox news in the arn see to be allowed the post to bate spin room but the truth is the tion be aloweden the pin room either i mean here here is the the only people allowe in the spinroom should be surrigutes for the peoplewho actually did the debate pretty obviously be's otherwise why ould anyone go to abate that is i's i sm lig a mistake to go to any debate just do not go to obate send send a couple of your surriguts ripp on everybody in the spin room that is the easiest way out hopefully fox news in the aran see find some testicles in to ni trum surragets the ability get inthe spin room because again the spinroom is for the people who play the game it it is very bazare to have surragetes for a person who is explicitly denying the importance of the debate in the spinroom to just crap all over all the other candidates an meanwhile speaking of preseden trump he is slated to turn himself in in fulton county georgeob on these fannuwillis reko charges he expected o that the day after the debate and

donald trump and tere is a great way for you to quash all talk about a debate where you are not going to be here is a great way show up for your rehest in fulten county georgea sup again dut has som packable time you have to say that donal trump knows how to work at camera that is for damned short according to sian n downl trum plans to turn himself in to be process of the folting county jail on thursday following his agreement earlier monday to a two hundred dhous n oler bond and other release conditions i'll be going to a lanto george on thursday to be a restat trumprote on truth sort social apparently several codefendence in the george a racktseering case of also greed to the terms of their bond ageemens with the das office trums lawyers gen for little through finding and maris a golburg met with the daes offs on monday before the details of the bond agreement were released other trumplers a ben working behind the scenes on the approach to the bond the release conditions outlinded trums bond order are more extensive than those laid out in the others approve earlier monday in the case according to the judge quot that fennin shall perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or hurr to be a co defind or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration in justice the above shollan clue but are not limited to post son shal media or repostof post made by another individual on social medias o an other words if downl trump retreats something threatening rudituly on y or ripping on redijulion ear something then theoretically they could haul him back to jail they culd tel you a violated you are bond his team is saying this violation of free speach i should be allowed to say basedly what i want because your interpretation of intimidation of witness might jus bee me it migt mi open an onest take on what is going on ith co offennincs that seems fairly reasonable actually this is the highest bond of any of the defendens which again is sort of strange given the fact that donal trump is the least likely person in human history to abscon from justice i do notn i do not even understand the lodgic the donal trump is going to be running away from the the country wat what what what is what is even happening it is funny an its donal trump actually put out what was a very very funny statement a on this he said the failed district attorney of footan county fanny willis insisted on y two hundered thou's nola bon from me i soon therefore she thouhti was a flihtrisk i'd fly far far away maybe to russia russia russia shure gold dome sweep with ladimer never to be seen or heard from again but i' be able to take my very under stated air plane with the gold trump of fixed for all to see probably not iare you much better off line commersial i'm sure nobody would recognize me i wuldud's funny i mean yosastr not dontrums ay funny funny man that is some funny stuff right there im yot donal trump obviously him showing up in cort in alanti is going to be the cover to the days and almos as mater what happens in the re publican abate barring some sort o catic clismac circumstance meanwhile as we say in the poles trum continues to lead by leaps and bounds the latest south carolina polt has a from traffelgot has trump up thirty four percentage points on the rest of the field heis still leading by some twenty sum per centage points in iwa he is stilleaving rest the field in new hampshire by twenty sum per sentage points d dos megleed now that is non stopping trump from attacking othe republicans a ot even mean other candidates i mean just other republicans generally i right now he is attacking governor brying kemp of georgia which he is tried this before cam got reelected over stacy abrams the true governor of georgia he ought reelected over her by crushingher to trump's great dismay by the way mean trum tried actually primary brancap well now he is attacking brankemp for not firing fanny willis which again i he doesnt have the power to do he says governor kemp of georgias fighting hard against the impeachment of the crooked ing compit ant highly partisan to e of footan county fann willis was murder and other violencrime to massively eskly cri'min lantes worst tan nation she sholed be in peach for many reasons not just the wich hunt i did nothing wrong willis should focus out in out of control murder not i will get trump over a perfect phone call georgia does not served this giant murder wave i'm i do not understand why that is brying kemp's fault i ththere is not even a majority support in e stay legislature to im peach fanny willis ait this point but ye again it is is free fire in every direction from pressing and trump as always now one of the things that that the multiple invitements of trump continue to underscore is the jobidn gets wav pretty much anything anything in everything all the time it is pretty incredible an te media continued cover in baccarry sellars he says there is no evidence that that joe had anything to do with hunters business obviously untrue how much more evidence you need joe hunter literally sess it we have a secret e mail address of joes two hunter onu crane matters we have partners of hunder bidon openly tustifime that joe was involved in hunder's business to the excenthat he would stop by meetings and phone into them i don' i do not understand but what nature of evidence would you re quir at this point democrats ar saing if hunterbiting committed a crime hold on accountable but two a addiction touch is every single family in this country o oer the overwhelming majority there av in this is a an a very interesting needle that republicans a trying to thread by persecuting some one with an addiction if while having this addiction he committed crims then punish him but there is literally no evidence that this ties back to the president of the united states and i think that what about is 'm is going a fall flat i is we had into the selection persecuting a man within addiction persecuting a man with visit did the huner bidens victim juny's a life long victim hnder bidon a mean sure every jobs ever held us because hes daddy was either a senator or vise presidents of the united states or president of the united states sure he is made millions of dollars being a useless derli drug attic piece of crap but he is a victim guys you drugadics we should all feel super duper duper bad for him demanzing how the words white privilege that baccarry sellars is eager to utter hunder virtually evert circumstance was just go absent when we talk about the greatest scion of white privilege in modern american history hunterbidon meanwhile by theway hunder bidons legaltime is targaning wade fort the iras whistleblowers member the iras wasteblors who blow up his sweet harddeal well now apparently according to the ner times while mister bidon's legalteme agrees that iress agints affected the deal his lawyers have contended to te justice department that by disclosing details about theinvestigation to congress they broke the law and it should be prosecuted at seim of lawyers for one of the resatien send to statement it appears that fa one for the courageous actions of these whistleblowers but nothing to gain n everything lose hunderbide never wouldhave ben charged at all hunderbdons lawyers obviously and revenge are now attempting to go after the whistle blowrs that is pretty make meanwhile other legal promis surrounding jobidon's campan according to the washington for beacon and andricar president jobidon's favorite super pack has a twelve million dollar gap an it is financial disclosures according to a washington free beacon investigation prompting legal experts to call for immediate investigations into the troubling discrepancy future forward which the bdon white house has in dorsed as the pre eminente super pack supporting the president's reelection bed in twenting twenty one claim to receive just three point for million dollars in cash from its affiliated dark money group but that group non profit future forward uussay action reported in it is twenty twenty one iras taxerturn it provided fifteen point three million dollars to the superpack that ear that is missing twelve million dollars that should start a federal probe you woud imagion the group is led by formerobomac campan officials it is qu ietly raised nearly four hundred million dollars thnthe past five years s run adds at supporting bidn and democrats in battle ground states we will see we are all of that money one agan more corruption as sociated with the bidin campaign for shore an as we say an jobidon in unsympathetic elderly gentlemen following up on the fact that he goes to hawi and talks about how one time his kitchen got set on fire and his corvett almost got burned apparently a gold starmom who met present an bydon on the memorial day following her son'steaf from the terrase to tack a toplo airport according to daily wire said the biding responded by sug gesting she take a photo with him when she wept during their meeting that is em the most empathetic thing i've ever heard i think shud there is been a lot of grief there' nothing watching your chous i m front of you in frontof the world she is recald when she met bydon he said i can understand if yor angry i sood face to face with ibeldiboll began to weep she added saying it should never ave happen this way he stood there stoically sh remembered nothing out of his mouthaccept well would you to get a photo with me apparently she told by on the only picture she would take with him as if he stood with her at her sons a tombstone at arling ton national cemetery bidon said i cannot do that because secret servicemul lebby ah jobiden he is just the best is just the best a time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that that i richmen north of richmon has now ta beuede at number one at the top of the billboard charts ndespite thep medias rage over in unknown musician becoming a very very famous person for riting a song that its very critical of the governmental left it is doing really really well now again it is amazing how everybody's in favor of rag to richer story in music long is it is not in out of work miner it is an out of work miner a person who minds the earth then that person's bad and we should we should have no sympathy for this person according to the near times rich men north of richmen ad int pennly released track by a little mon performer build is oliver anthony music became the number one song in the united states o top tits by superstars tailors with morgan wallan and a live ya rod rigo the songwas up loated to you tho but justo weeks ago a caught fire with conservet of commentators including mat wallshenlor angram rescribed it as an authentic expression of working class struggle the some critiks winsed it anti wellfor sentimens that seemd a hark back to the raganera oll my god dofr not a lod be anti wellfarguies stop being anti welfare or were not going to a low you a workin class person to have a successful song you have to be pro wellfare in order for this towore or presumebly you have to cut a song about the matchac of transcenderism or something that that is the best way to get a song to to hit number one and be feeted by the near time to the same time rich men shoulds the top of bilboard's top one hundred single chart with seventeen poin five million streams an hard forty seven thousan downloads according to tracking service luminent after jason aldene's try that in a small town it is the second country song in less than a month to rich number one after sterring political controversy an sparking download sales it is also the first time that an artis has ever madeed de bu a umber one on the hot one hundred without any prior chart history in any form that is am ya again it shows that when conservatives and a people who are not in the cultural main stream flects their market p our they are able to make an outsized cultural influence the song is certainly worthtlissen of the i if you recall back to the early days of trumpism it is really can of fascinating gothink backs two thousand fifteen two thousand sixteen when trump was really gaining a lot of street credance and incredibility in hewas picking up huge support there are all these pieces after trump one in two thousan't seventeen abalic who are these people voted for trump and they sent reporters from big cities into the wilds of iowa to discuss with the regular folk as thoughthey were steve erwin checking out some strange form of kangaroo what exactly these weirdos thougt and they wanted the now for a moment for a brief moment in time is one books jdy vans is hill billy elogyes started making in roads were people are all maybe thse people think differently than we do may they have certain moral values that we do not hole maybe they maybe they are afraid of the peculiar morality that we are bringing to them that suggests that men can be women women can be men and that basically individual subjectivism is the hight of human experience and then it all went away then i ll went away within about six monts it was nonono trump one beas a russha was not because there is any cultural moment that we are missing here it is because of russia well every time one of these can of cultural moments reaches up in grabs left they freek out and instead of trying to understand whereis rich men north of richmond coming from what is this mean instead of that they just freek out ther all my god look at these hix he is crazy hicks who stuff this how dare they we must have the absoluty antimolotic warblings reana we we need them we need we need people dry rating on a screen that is the only way that we can have a mator head it was just a guy with a manjo playing about how his life is tough because it turns out to much ofhis money's beeng taken away from him we cannot have that that is that is superduperbad a good once again for oliver anthony good for rich men north of richmond im i i could not be more pleased about a that that songs continued durability in the market place they speaking of an alternative morality is time for some things i hate ali a net benning the wife of warn baby she has a daughter her daughter thinks that she is a son i know this because actually i've met their daughter a long time ago i had a younger sister who went to a theater camp at the theatere camp was the daughter of warn baby and ta an netbenning very nice ked obviously i ked with some with some troubles and a this kid then decided that she was a boy whell now we get parentsing advice from a net benning about how proud she is that her girl believes that she is a boy according to entertainment to night a mahin a tnat benning is a proud momen progressive activist was long been inspired an influence by her own son stephen she reallysantly spoke with the hollowy reporter and reflected on her public support of the elg b t ku plus minis tovota by san community i have a tron son he is such an inspiration to me says an apenning certainly what is happening the political world that is trans people is concerning in dir it is only going to get worse as we go into the election cycle she says for me the real transition has happen is the ripling in this country has ben more and more mobilized on misinforming people about the elgi b t kep plus mines ofvouted by san community they een villifying our community creating promise that do not exist crating in sowing hate and fear as way of rallying their base she says the're trying to star up all this fearin people about trans kits and parene their trying to legislate that this should not be scarry to anyone else it is a private legitimate complex deepest spiritual physical psychological eperience that must be respected and honored to love youre child much as the greatest way to learn abut what transpeople is all about i gets say this because i'm the mother my son is incrediblly brilliant he is someone ie to admire i've learned a lot when he first came out again it is very strange how half the kids in ellas holliwood community are queer identifying very strange it is a very strange genatic bottle macan must have nothing to do wit the caulture or anything i thid this expenential increase in trancs identifying youth in heavy blue areas vhe'r very strange very stranht again suggesting that dum the height of heroism is obviously mental in motional confusion is really a massive issue in america and the fact that we have an entire media that are dedicate its that proposition is even more bazar mea george tekay a the guy who is famous because he was on star track and then said omi on some commercials now he says that dum it is very akin they that that looking at the yet trans gender debate meaning we should not cut generals all small children he says it is crucial tht we learned from history pushfor change and use our votes to secure beter future and then he likened it two japanese in ternment he says quote more ominously in the name of protecting trans kits and in defines ovall expert opinions politicians hat the state level of band cridically necessary trans metical care leaving desperate parents and families of that alternatives it was not only ignorant it was deliberately cruel it is leaving to untold suffering for young people already burned with the weight of successfully transitioning they are a group that suffers the highest raits of suicide among teens and then of course this turnd in to a call to vo democrat everything is political including whether children should be able to be treated with hormons sterilized anza and then mutilated a ya i mean maybe it is that value system that people are denying actually could not could be that argagizes threst the shi continues right out nacomomus will be jumping into the melabag if you not a member

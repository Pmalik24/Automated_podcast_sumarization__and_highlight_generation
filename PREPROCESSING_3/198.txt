my kids and the things that o do for them every day i mi shall they brush the tese and i make sur they do the mess home work and these is one of those things suddenly that the fact that we have got a

different things that i stata to from that point on i'm trikit by that moment rebecg actually talked to one of our producers of you to cornfelt who in the last two months has interview dozens of people who have had these wake up om as hay the review her these happene in all kinds of different ways an yet yoot to all kinds of different people all of whom actually nead a point to tell me they did not consider themselves environmentalist in any way prior to their wake up moment owel yet it is more they were just walking around and got bunked on the head and then everything changed people describe it wakehe not been a bazara world were everything's the same but the way they feel about it is totally different the wake op reorganizes their priorities completely in fact lots of support groups have popped up in the past two years to hell people deal with the immensity of these new feelings what uppen rebecca in rebecca's case she totally changed the focuss of her career pavited it to climate as she is she also cut back on eating me decided she needed to get an elector car or have no car ah and those of the kind of things that would a fact the rest of her family her husand and her kids and what i found in these interviews is that this is where the trouble comes in for many people when their families haven undergone the same transformation that they have ray teminc sens ye everyone mention some version of this this one gi gland chlir i talk to after his wake of themend he tried to convince his whole family frother sisters nieces nephews to all see this the way that he now did and to come to climate rallis with him the common reaction that i got was well i did not know you were passionate about this enviromental stuff or your really into this its urually interesting am it is great it is great i really support you it is great that youre into this nd tat was just that was frustrating to me i'm not into this it is just what is happening it is if there was a trock barrelling toward us that i was tried to get is out of the way you would not be why us perpassionate about trucks i just did not know you into trcks was is always the thik i think it is really great that you f this interests note this is just what is happening i was i uye just keep running back and forth the yelling it people a do you ruin your relationships and i realized to that i was pretentially impacking relationships that er the most important thing to me in the world for no benefit no benefit because because it was in changing anyones mind it was in working glen decided to leave his family lond but other people told me that they could not back off in the same way and it is how a huge impact on from their closest relationships that isea brings us to to as programm a the idea fir show to dake came from a vevis interest in these families were one person sees something that feels big and important and percint and the try to bring everybody long and t it is just bad for everyone weeva one story that whas a story about a surprisingly effective way to deal with the problems of the world harge and small do you be easy chicago is this american i i mariglass sey whet us that one one point five degrees of separation soviva was interested in the told that having a wake up moment this could have on a family and she heard about somebody who had a moment this over a decat go and let him to quit i job dedicate his life to activism he tried to put his family into it and what aforded was the most extreme example of things going badly in a family that if eve heard of the pretty much destroyed his family he did it was strange from them the guy is named michael foster whn aviva reached out and asked me if he would talk about how his climate active asm had damaged to his relationship with his wife and children he was totally up for it bre tol oviva that he let his kidside of the story was as shl more important than his he hon ws crucial that she is talk to them which course of evel wanted to do both children are now young dolts they were glad to talk what apit in their family is not neserly typical of a climate activis mike's activism shifted the wholes center of gravity of the family in ways that are definitly a particular to his personality but the immense end of the world stakes of the issue wut what sent mike andis wife milinda and their kids down the path they went here is abea mike and milinda were never the kind of couple who saw idto eye on the big stff they met when they were in high school an texas they both did speech in debat and would see one another at the competitions though the weren' early friends mike who was not even jolical christian at the time carried a bible everywhere led prayer circles before the tournaments while milinda and her friends would smoke weed out back i mean his story is that the first time he wule remembers meeting me was when a he had just finishlating a prayer circle and he met me and i had a button this is back when you wore buttons and it set not saved and his mind just kind of melted that some one would proudly were not saved button that is my story how dare she tell my story at my mind melted it did not know that there were people al there who could just be happy and funny and and saying yar not save each felt the other was this kind of exotic bird or something totally foreign to tham but also sort of mesmerizing and an they went to the same college near by they started dating mike was no longer an even jolical christian at that point but mlinda says ther relationship was still very rom com opposites a tract they broke up and got back together all throughout college and then found each other again and their late twenties at that point mike was a child an family therapist taking kids to the out doors to do a kind of wilderness therape and milinda had a corporate job was making good money we were together for a few years he had asked me to marry him a few times and i was i do not think it is a good idea for us to get married we are just too different but mike felt familiar and a way the only first loves can eventually linda said yes to mike's proposal they got married had two kids and merson stella lived in siato at this point climate changed was not a big part of their lives beyond the basic stuff i mean we were we were really green we were kind of cartoon green seeatl family whatever steryo type you have that was what we were doing they werecychled composted these energy efficient lipewulbs and then one day mike heard about this new documentary he wanted to gosy we n a trosom of beon an inconvenient truth mike convinced milinda to go seeat with him for their datnight sitting there in the dark mike felt algor had taken all the dots of information about climate change the mike had picked up over the pass couple decades and arranged them into a pointoless painting of our future and tha picture was grimmer and mere dramatic than he thought and then at the end of it it it has the creditrol and during the credits it wi on this black screen have these little white letters that say things plant of tree change your libols drive less and that is it rik you haves to spent an hour and a half learning that the world is ending and nobody's doing anything and you are supposed to plaint a tree they resthis kind of you mike majyour maj your disconnect of ah wad a minute that is that is not in a do it that is not even clas before the documentary mike thought we had time now it seemed clear to him we were just a few decades away a from a ratically different planete mike started poring over climate research reading every day he travell to california to go to a training led by a gore himself were he learned to give a slide show about climate change when he came back from the training mike showed his kids a slide show and presented it at their schools emeris mike solder kid who by the way uses a pronoun stay them rememers being excited by that this wasn'n two thousand twelve emers was ten at the time i felt kind o minor celeberity satis right because my dad was a guest speaker than i needed everyone to know tha that was my dat the presentation were having to day av my dads doing that i i hear that mi dads can becoming next week to do a presentation in class mikh an is kid start climate club set their schools mike also teaches emerson stella the slide shell and they all start going around to teach it together both kids threw themselves into the work remeris the importance of the topic immediately resinated but stella who as eight had a much simpler reason it was a way for me to get his attention if ike asked a question he would be paying attention to just me rather than the family which i guess is kind of sellfish bid at the time mowas dad look over here i i can ask questions about climate chane jems mark news of mike's slide cho spread and he started being invited to present at otheir schools pretty early on mike decided that kids were the answer his active ism would focus on them i was already a special te as at ther afist and he figured children have the most at stake here there opened the message and a dults will be able to hear the science from them differently then'll hear it from other aduls mike's first big step down that path he organized a march with the national kid centered climate group called i matter he says a the atal police gave the marchers a forteen motor cycle escort to pike place market emer san stella both spoke at the marc emer said they would never talked in front of many people before he helped me write my speech in han me practice it a ton se prsided to speak ther kis everybody's attention was on me stella the younger one found all the attention a little overwhelming the mainthing i remember a was looking at my dad to kind of folk gis mi gaze to steady you yet i really looked at him to kina not free gett in tis speech and all the ones after id mer says that mike gave each of them specific rolls to fill rolls a emer says they naturally fit into stella was the one that would make the audience ghool michaee she is cute a o a aa a and then i was one who as supposed to make the audience go oh oh ka wa it was a one to punch stella disarmed them and a you an inivit kill ya bvasically ya i think i was a little bit supposed to scare people yo e ask yed and ah in w wa bys ya ta they say e for malinda watching mike in the kids give speeches and spend much time together it was really nice they are having fun and working on something that felt inportant she was not around much to hel she had a big job at a tella communications company they kept are busy and on the rod alot at the time but she jumped in where she cud she made a web siht for mike and did a lot of the behind the scenes le justic staff she is got at mike ot more ambitious and brought the kits along they started organizing for plant for the planet a cid run organization with a go of planting a trillyan trees the whole family recruited friends to join mi quit is job to focus on climate work ameris in stellamat the governor in the mayor they were lead plaintiffs and a law suit against the state of washington to curbamissions they are in an h bio documentary about kid climate actives but none of that stuff felt enough to mike he was thinking more about the way he and the family were living at home mont and i had an agreement i was the vegeteriand i was the one doing they makes the world better staff and she was the one who was working at the corporate jian pay in the bills and i was fine with that im but when i'm doing these climate talks and i mean wike one day would be five talks and i'm hearing myself going over this material and really grasping it what i'm saying it became harder for me to be okay wit the trip to hor wy harder for mike to be o ke because airplains imat much carpendioxide i wen out on a lamb and i was this this this has no integrity for me and i cannot just go along with our agreement other he bly talk to who wenthrow away tut momen they also got to this point thecame to believe that we have to change our behavior and all kinds of ways to avoid the worst case anareas and we have to do that knowing individual action will not be enough one family driving an electric car ar giving up plastic straws is not going to do the job any serious climate slution will require an overhaul of our energy sources at a global level but it will also require as to live differently without that the situation will not change and nots for things get messy deciding where to draw the line in your own family the kids really wanted to get a cat andos well i grope with pets i think ther'd be great and he said no we cannot do that i'm trying t understand why he says that the carbon footprint of a domesticated house pet ar ridiculous that is all the process meat the patsy and the cans and plastic the food comes in plus catletter dog toys crips to the bat we are not in support that there ether cannot be pets in this house the family ended up settling on getting chickens which turned out to be a good compromise because the ids loved the chickens and mike was happy the chickens produced eggs because i men they woulnd be supporting factory farms that produce supermarcet eggs but flying on plans became a real point of contention in the family milinda wanted to take the kids to dismy world for vacation yus were not going were not he saigna werd never getting on a plaine again i were not i miss that mimmel what what and i made the mistake of saying but i fly for work and he us exactly and maybe if you did not fly the world would be a better place to mike flying felt an exissential threat to his kids futures and tavery ones it was unbearable for me to continued doing the things that were goin to makes their life impossible actually impossible in the near future at the time did you have any doubts about the lifestile changes you were making because youre sort of having to balance really believing in the cause and also axcepting that you are dabed with two kids ind maybe one pet dousn't actually make that bicg of it tif ference in the grand scheme of things but it does make a really big difference in my kidslives how did you balance that thare was really impossible to bounce because i'm not talking about a cause because i'm talking about their survival and the thinks there gin a suffer when they get older anyway says i'm sorry am getting into the preaching mod and we are trying to talk family here but but to me it is the same thing milinda cut flying for work but nobody else flew and milinda did not all these changes but she did not disagree exactly clyme a change is a noble cause that was what i was telling myself this is for the world this is for a better future for my children and their children why am i being such a bitch about it one of the biggest wayis climate activ as'm change this family is haid a turned mike into a kind of stage tat performing with his kids all the time with all the tention and friction that comes with that it was es pecially intents because mike's climate work was all about kids he needed his kins to be the face of it hes emeris i started having issues if my dad when it was he started feeling more a coach than a dad and he was just bringing more and more and more things it is i would wake up in the morning and he would be were even in two hours there is a presentation here is there nots you have to speek write a speech now emeras had lways giving speeches driting them but mike wanted to see their speeches ahead of time and practise would get angry if they did not let him get mad afterwards if he thought they did not hit the right points in front of crowds mike was always complimentary up their speeches it is when if you were in a theatre production and the director gives a talk after the show or something i was the actor i'd played my little part and then he would come out and be i'm proud ey didn'nt amazing job on in mis michael foser and i ma crod pop er rit now a i i knon't know what to say at blo me way every sing ton a and than once the audience leaves its time for nots once they are not looking then you talk about what you did wrong and everything that youhave to do better next time an to put it politely since milinda was oft working much of the time supporting the family she had no realse sense that increasingly this shaid become ameras and mike's dynamic untill one day the kids had a speech far outside of town milinda drove the family to and from the speech since she had a highbred car and mke's elector car could not make at that far ameras had given a speech and i thought it was brilliant at you non the momp and we got in the car and i was driving and mike was in the seet next to me an the kids were in the back and he was yelling because ameras had not let him read the speech before they gave it and he was saying you should have let me read that speech before wecaus i would have told you at the time i would have told you that you were missing these poinchs and got down if you would let me see that you would hae done a better job you missed your opportunity you flucked it up and you missed your opportunity i'm trevy one woke let me just say i thought it was great what do you even listen half the time no sike aking back linda points to this moment is one of her failures that she letther kids give speeches after this but at the time mike was confident in what was right and milin did not trust the feeling that told her otherwise i'd will maybe this is their dynamic maybe this is how they communicate that they flare up and they not that the kids ever yell but maybe mike yells but move that is how it works and because the next day the're worken on it again and he is a family fairfest or a hol thers ild in familyes they are up as you kow there is that hanging over my head too of he knows he is the expert this is just the beginning of their family breaking apart and one of the reasons mike was eager to speak with me is because he feels pretty in the dark about what happened but splid his family up and left his kids bitter that at this point theyhave not spoken to him in years he does not get what he could have done that was bad his family still wants nothing to do with him said he feels that he is an agatha cristy novel he knows he is the killer he just as know i dea how he did it mhen we spoke mike never contested any one's memories of what went down he told me if they said it i believe it he knows he has a temper linda taid he is always had one in college he is have blow ups though she always knew how to calm him down but mike and milinda and the kids all agree talbursts ramped up considerably after mike got into climate activism linda said he was never physically violent with her or the kids but the frequency and the focus of the blow ups changed i would just go for my erot a ninety and you would not see a common and all a sudden it was you kno inside me if holt okay the world is gon aand because of this it because it because of something somebody did or said or whatever if we if we cannot if our family or you and me cannot do this one simple thing then how does the world get to remain living rit coul li this takes always felt that high ye i sometimes he would just be okey we i am this person who is in this roll trying to it say hear's how we get to live on earth for the next ten thousand years and i cannot persuade my family to let go of the star bok copor whatever the thing was at the moment o case within the world ent that is what it actually felt tou ye more than once mke called stella a fucking betch and a cun stella said before mie got into climate activism he would yella her about the kin of stuff any parent mite for lying about brushing her teeth or saying up lat pass bed time but in knows instance is stella knew redad still levet her now she worried about that i had a good father for years wefore the climate change started there were flaws but it was only once lake it it was climat change where hed put much of himself into it and wanted me to put much of my solf into it that i really got the feeling that he is love was completely condition stella remembers when she realize she was over climate activism it was or nine in a holf birthday they selebrate half birthdays in their family and in selebration they would planned a dinner at one of stella's favorite restaurants but before they left the house something hop and disat mike off and he started ranting about the state of the world stella said that when her dad got into climate talk mod there was nothing to do but listen fifteen minutes tick fy then thirty then forty five i just remember thinking i just wanta talk about what we did at school to day i wante talk about this cat i saw on the w home i wante talk on my half birthday and feeling it was not an option for me to talk because he was talking stella never told any one she wanted to quit activism because deep down she felt she had this personal responsibility to stop climate change secretly emris was feeling the same way the more istary realizing that i did not want to do it the worst a person i was horrible things are going to happen to people because i'm not willing to do this it felt i was the worst person in the world it was all guilt all the time and fear is fear of him and fear of the apocalits stellas carbon foot prints started to haunt her when hermam drove her to school when she drink a glass of milk even when she exhaled sometimes she would think allam doing is putting more carbon dioxide into the air she started having nightmares every night of the world burnin or f oceans rising and flooding our house or going to the grocery store and finding the shelves completely bare becauses drauts had killed off all th clans mikan milinda bot told me they had no idea the kiss or feeling this bay at the time which emersons stella said omake sense they were god at hiding when i asked mike about how bad the kids felt he said he never meant to make kiss kids feelds bad as they did ut he also defended guilt as a tactic guilt is seriously underrated guilt and shame keep people from murdering each other and honestly guilt may be one of the fe tings thit could keep lifeon earth going for the next ten thousand years if we cannot feel guild er shame about what we are doing and wearn how to do something else it is a it was over a long time ago one way to hear this story i's at di's not about climate change but about a dad the sort of goes off the dee ben for reasons that have more to do with his own personality than anything else but i cannot dismiss the role climate change plays in thi story i thing the grim picture of the future that might carries in his head i's actually more accurate than the picture most of us carry around mis genuinely hard to figure out the right way to have feelings about climate change it is easy to lose perspective whend the problem is vast and woven in to every part of how we live how we get to work what we eat an mistakes are high i talked to other people who had wake up moments many of whom are reasonable and kind and not alarm is by nature bho alienated their families and in lots of cases lost their families and the wake up their new found clarity mlindon the kids see all that but alsoblieve it did not have to go this way milinda said that to me in our very first conversation mi could have don is climate work without torturing his family that is he didn' need to cuss out is kids coming out how the most ambitious are you be most successful thing you ever do as a political activis in ougt to be the worst thing you do for your family that is a minute chicago bub a greadeal when our programme continues it is a smare from lie from myr glass to day's programme the end of the world as we know it if you just turning ain wherein the middle of a vuto cornfeld's story about mike foster in his family and i was climban activ ism which o changes in ther family and ultimately divorce and his estrangement from his trew kids we has not spoken with in years we will pick up where we left off both of his kids stella and emeris what a quit doing activism with her dad again here is o be t h it takes about two years of going to climat meetiuns and speaking at ralliys with their dad before stella and emeris confided in each other about how they really felt about it what they actually wanted here is emeris i remember we were out on the back porch going inside instella stopped me and she was she whispered do you think mamma dat or can i get a divorce and i was i do not know but i kind of hope and she was he too and that was really yet after that it was kind of better cause we had that solid arity stlla started doing secret research about parential custody to figure out the odds that she and emeris would get to live wit their mam in the event that her parents did get diforest she started dropping hints she was just beginning six grate around this time and our school offered these electives to port groups here are bunch of different options and one of the groups was for kids of divorce parents that was a group stellasined up for when milinda found out which group stella had joing and asked her about it stella shragd in said just in case things continued this for a while evernd going through the motions untill it all came to ahead one night emeras wanted to go to a fall out by concert mi consisted they come to the monthly plant for the planat meeting instead nthe meeting was over emerson stella waited by the car for forty five minutes in the cold before he came out we started driving home i think i was very obviously sulkaing and ultimately i told him that i was annoyed that he had taken long to come back and that i had not really wanted to go to the meeting in the first place and he just lost it he got mad stella remembers this night too he was shouting in this car just yelling you are ungrateful you do not realize how much i do for you why cannot you just go along with it for one night what is your problem what is important about this fock in concert and he was driving ratically he would pull the car over superfast and turn in start yelling at us again unprompted and what are you gos doing at that woi wou're literally both of us are just sitting in the back seat malls closed eyes wide crying absolutely terrified i'd never seen him that angry and i had seen him get angry a lot and sae how when we came home we just got under the cars fast as we possibly could and ran inside to get to our mam because it was the safe zon and a game of tag or something it was she meant protection from him i was in the famly room in the door flew open the kids came running in crying sobbing and there dad came ru ning in after them screaming at the top of his lungs and i woa wa what it what is happening here what is going on nd i went upstairs to talk to the kids and thyou said they were afraid they were ging to die in the car an mi what the hell happened milinda made up her mind not long after that night she told mike she wante a divorce my calls it a climate divorce milinda says no if anything climate change kept them together longer than they should have been a i i feel i i looked passed and axcepted much more of what was bad because it was in service of climate change if he had been a kulinon conspirator it would have been easy for me to say no not doing that but it is clima change i him bt wths but mike an milinda get divorce and mike moves just a few blocks away the kids get to live with their mam full time as he would hoped and she establish some sort of new relationship with mike they tried cup around the family therapy but according to the tharapist nots the first round crashes and burns because mike keeps interrupting to explain climate change and the importance op his work to the tharapis and they try again n months later stella gets up the courage to tell mike her big secret for the first time that she does not want to be a climate activist any more tha she was only doing it because she felt he gave her no choice stella figured he would say he was sorry and she prepared herself to forgive him but instead mike seemed angry he did apologize but the thing he apologize for was that he had not invited her to more climate events that she would be more emotionally invested in the cause see the way he did a word to listeners who might be sensitive to this this next part of the story mention self harm ut i just remember feeling i'm never going to escape him and wanting everything to just be done with becaus i was tired of having tod explaine these things that i'd gone through and having to think about him and having to talk about him and talk to him and having him not be who i needed him to be when i needed it it just all became to much about an hour and a half after the session with her dad stella attempted suicide she spent the next eight days in the hospital she told her mam to keep her dad away from her she did not even want him to know she was in there for me it was the first time that i said no i mean it was not very dignified i was kind o sceaming and crying no do not went a man do not let im an but a i think having a complete break from him were hu just stopped being at all a consideration for a week but also having had the power to remove him was really critical for me i told mike what stella said how their conversation and tharapy was a breaking point for her just before her suicide attempt he said he had no idea he did not remember apologizing for the wrong thing for saying he was sorry he did not get her more invested and climate work i wish i could remember saying it ah it sounds the kind of stuff that would have come out of my mouth and i'm d what a shetty thing when she needed something else after th at mike stopped trying to contact stella shen't wat him to and the therapa said it could be dangerous for stella he laid low hoping the kids broquet and waiting for an invite to return to the family stella says that with the burden of fixing her relationship with her dad lifted she started doing a lot better freed from climat work she had time to do things that she actally liked greeting fannacy novels she also got a great tharapist and started taking anny to presence which she said of really helped and was stela feeling sturdyear seemed mike and the kids might possibly find away to rebuild hav a relationship of some kind however fracture until this next thing happened which brought about the end of their world as they knew it it was a fall of twenty sixteen a little over a year after stellas suiside attempt anshe reached out to ask for a meeting with her dad and emeris and the therapes in the meeting stella and emeris told their dab that for them to consider having a relationship again they needed him to stop toing climate work for a while hr stella he said he would and that it madn't we really happy it felt chan emeras was struck to maybe if he could get rid of that than he really does care about us ik he must really love us if he is willing to give that up a few weeks after that after mike told us kids he would stop doing climate activism he did his most extren climate action ever protesters man nually turned our five oil pipe wides to day one of the five protesters can be seeng her turning off the pipe li tall the north to cordu the grust mi travel to north vecoda webroke pass the fence around the keystone pype line and turned a vave shutting off the flow of oil he was arrested on sight and at that point charge with six fellonies and two misdemeanors which combine could land up in prison for more than ninety years i was mad i was mad here is emers again man i was pissed i i mean it that was tha point where he would sink he would stop deoing all this for us it is all he is going to prison heres stella that moment really just was it for me i just did not care any more it felt relief because there was no small voice in my head saying but he is your daad you have got a love him i was complete and whole and did not need him and did not want him a bunch of the charges were aither dismissed or amended but mike ended up spending six months in prison he told me he did not realize his kids were asking him to stop climate activism right then he thought they meant some dat he said he had no idea this was the last straw for them the valo turning propelled mike to fame in a new way especially in their little green seatle community lenda says than the story was he is a hero look what he is done he is a hero he is a hero and there was a article the local satle magasine which painted him as this marter and he talked about how he sacrifice his relationship with his children ford the plamnet and they they trid to say that ow we did not could not flyany more in the marriage brook apart and and he had quot sang something you nobationly i just annoyed the fluck out of them ti that is it is such a simple viewpoint he did not annoy the fluck out of us you were as annoying his fock but you actually wounded us you harmed us you hurt us after the siatal magazine article came out climate people would come up to milinda and the kids and tell them they should really talk to mike again they should forgive him tbecause he is doing such important work but emers does not see his work that way i think it is made it that his name means something but to very few people it is a subset of feople who ere already inclined to that stuff but he has not achieved anything i mean with he is climate stuff i said that thav turning had no effect the oil got there a couple hours later ahum he is made a series of empty gestures and spent years posturing as a hero and a family man and has jest destroyed everything i think that was actually meaning ful about his life i think on some level he knows that and thats part of why he is destressed about having lost his family i do not know i guess i wish him well but he can fined meaning that he is not family at this point they has were we are done with him it is been nearly six years since mike and milinda got divorce there is been essentially no contact between mike and the kids since the valve turning the first time i talked to mie our interview lasted nine hours mostly because almost every question i asked about his family he ended at veering into climate change how bad things were hall known was doing enough how many and demic species face extinction this century the fact he told me four times in our interview he oscillated between extreme sadness over his non existent relationship with his kids to anger about the state of the world tho agitated concern that i had not asked him any of the right questions yet hecause i had not asked him about the science but what it was gon o take to change things the morning after our interview i woke up to an emal from mike ane asked for a do overe he said he would accidentally gone into climate rantomod instead of speaking as a dad he said quote i cannot live with what i said i cannot i rambling sound monstrous idiotic we tried again he told me he did not agree with his family that the problem was his personality and the way he handled his activism he tought there were things he could have done better but the real problem was that he and milinda were not on the same page i told them i did not think having two parents him would have solved things with the kids he did not see it and did not understand why his family could not have brought up how they were feeling with him i i'd still news to me thet there afraid to talk to me about this stuff i i understand we have you have cond have told me that there were these moments when i got angry and i was really really scarri to them and a big person in wittle kids todally get that and take responsibility for that and yet the apologies the talks the hugs the bed times there whatever the living life that happened in between these whatever months of not being angry i guess i was i was under the illusion thit they could talk to me about anything tit sounds you did not at the time realize how your behaviour was impacting them but there are a few inner actions that seem even at the time you would have understood the impact emeras mentioned that you had called stella a fucking bitch and a cun when she was really little ten ye which that feels that weu would understand that was horrible that was a nightmare i coand see howd be hard after that after dead calls you a cunt she never say anything yot him to make him angry again yes absruly absully and i did anything in everything i could afterwards to make your right but come on you are right it that was a thing that you cannot take back ye i live with that i'm broken i do not know wh 'm here the thing i of the most is the thing i'm farthish from things for milinda and the kids o pretty good these days sella just turned eighteen she sais there climate nightmares only come every couple weeks instead of nightly and she is off a college just fall a milestone that for a while she never thought she would reach emris is nineteen they work on about teaching kids about marine life and maritime skills he job they lave though they skip out on teaching the lessons about climate change they said they are not ready to do that yet while i was out in siatal doing my interviews the summer the pasific north west as in the midst of the most extreme heat wave and the regions recorded history cabelines melted rods cracked in the heat over a hundred people dat stella told me that during the heat wave she had to sit in her room and repeat to herself things are bad and there is nothing you can do about it until the feeling passe emera says in low moments there dad's voice pops into their head and tells them they have not done anything with their life that all they do as turn oxygen into carmen melinda and i did our interview in her office the only place we could find centural i see erewas a hundred six degrees outside she told me the irony is not lost on her mike was right about the climat she said the har stand up on the back of her neck wand she thinks about it

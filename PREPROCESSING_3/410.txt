welcome to the huberman a science science acetoe i'm indrhubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin today we are discussing nicotine nicotine is one of the most commonly consumed substances on the entire planet therere literally billions of people that in jest nicotine on a daily basis most of those people consume nicotine vio smoking and in particular smoking tobacco tobacco contains nicotine and icotins a bunch of other things as well which we will talk about and the burning of tobacco liberates nicotine and makes accessible to the various cells and tissues of the body but of course there are other sources of nicotine as well some people consume nicotine through dip that is placing tobacco on the enside of the lip were in the cheek some people consume nicotine via snuff which is liteally the shoving of tobacco leaves up the nostrils and allowing the tobacco toaxis the nervous system and other airs of the body by permeating into the ucosal membrans as is the lining the the soft lining of the nasal passages and of course thereare nictine patches nicotine gum there is nicotine and pill form there toothpicks dipped in nicotine et cetera to day we are going to separate our discussion of nicotine from a discussion of smoking and vaping and the other forms of delivery for nicotine we will be talking about smoking and vaping and other routes of nicotine administration both for sake of highliting their detriments to health and believe it are not in certain cases keep in mine very specific certain cases the possible health benefits of delivering nicotine through specific modalities turns out those medalities do not include smoking cigarettes or vaping and we are going to pay particular attention to vaping today because vaping use is on the rise in particular in young people and vaping use and the fact that most tobacco that is consumed through vaping includes quite amount of nicotine has creati cenareo where nicotine because of its ability to change certain chemicals in the brain can actually lead to a dictiin for a number of other substances related to vaping and vaping associated behaviors if all that seems a lot to get your arms in your mind around right here at the outset do not worry i'll walk you through this regardlessof whther not you have a backroun an biology or not i promise that you will come through the end of this episode with a deep understanding of houndnicotin works in the brain an body some of its benefits some of its potential drawbacks and you will have clear optics as to why smoking and vaping and other forms of nicotine delivery have the effects that they do on your biology and psychology before we go any further i just want o highlight a key take away from a previous episode which is our episode on focus and in fact was a tool kit for focus during the too kipfor focus episode we talked about a large number of behavioral farmicalogic another interventions that you can use to increase your level of concentration and focus for whatever purpos cognitive endeavors learning languages focusing in school on work et cetera or physical pursuits now one of the key take aways is that there are really two key protocalls that it believe every one should understand and know about and why they work because they are effective and also because they dovetail nicely with some of the information that we are going to talk about to day which will explain why nicotine is effective in increasing focus these two protocals are as follows data based on studies done in wendy sus ukiy's lab at new york university course wendy was a gueste on this podcasts can check out that episode if you but studies done in herlaboratory point to the fact that it daily very brief in fact only thirteen minute meditation can vastly increase focus and focus ability not just immediately after the meditation practise but at all other times as well again this is a meditation practise done daily for just thirteen minutes it is a very simple meditation practice where one sits or lies down closes your eyes and directs your attention to a place just between your two eyes and red above its on your forehead but just inside of that and please understand that your brain does not have sensory receptors unlike focusing on your finger tips and the sensations there if you focus on your brain you cannot acsually sends anything in your brain except your thought the idea then is that you continually bring your focus back to that location just about an inch behind you your forehead over and over again and it is the refocusing of your attention to that location after it drifts that succeeds in increasing your focus ability again notjust during the meditation and afterward that at other times as well this thirteen minute a meditation is exceedingly simple and exceedingly effective it should be performed every day but if you miss a day just go back to doing it do not tospare too much and you will see these pousive effects sav the data also increase effects on mood and other posive asects opt mental health an performance that is the first tool in protocal the second toolin protocal relates to the general what i called aerow model of focus as was a model that i created in order to simplify the vast amounts of data on focus an concentration and how they are created by the various chemical systems within your brain weare going to hear a lot about these chemical systems again to day in the contects of nicketine and they are as follows you can think about focus on any goal or any endeavor as an arrow such as imagine an arrowich has an arrow head and a shaft and will add a third component to it in a moment the head of the aerow meaning the direction of your focus is largely set by a seetal coling which is a chemical in the brain the shaft of the arrow is set by a chemical call a drenaline also called epina from those of the same thing in the brain typically it is refered to as epinepron and in the body it is more commonly refer to as a drenaline but those of the same nearo chemical eponepron slash odrennaline represents the sh aft of the aero and its providing the energy for which to focus and then we can put behind that arrow little propeller or a motor if you and the propeller and motor in the contects of this norchemistry model is dopamin which provides on going motivation it pushes that arrow forward continually as you strive to focus on a particular thing this particular aro model that is your ability to increase your focus can be enhanced therefor by increasing a ctocoling epineferan and dopamine simultaneously and there are a lot of different ways to do that but one of the more effective ways to do that vi a supplement protocals i called alphag p c alphag p c taken in three hundred meligram form ten to thirty minutes before about of cognative work or about of physical work wi'll increase your focus by way of increasing a cito coling and to some extent increasing epineferan as well the dopamine increase will have to be ac either through cognive processing that is telling yourself you are doing a good job and moving forward because thoughts really do impact your levels of dopamine or some others sort of pro dopamine or dopaming increasing protocall also discussed in the tooll kit for focus and our episode on dopamine for motivation and drive the ke thing here to understand is that the thirteen minute ay meditation is a very effective way to increase focus capacity and then in the short term if you want to provide a boose now and again to focus three hndred miligrams of alphag p c can be very effective their very sorces for that than will link to one of them in the shonote captions by no means an my saying that you need to take alphag p c a number of people will certainly opnop to and a number of people might be saying well i've heard that alphag p c can increase focus by way of increasing a ctol coling in norapineferan or epinefran but it can also increase t a o which is a a kind of a negative marker of cardiac helth and cardeovascular health for that reason i and many others will take six hundred miligrams of a garlic capsil which can offset that t meo increase it remains uncertain as to how much alphag p c one needs to take before increasing tamao levels to a point where it is of concern tht you would even need to take the garlic capsil but i just mention it in any case because it is a pretty simple fix garlic has other health benefits to of course and for most people three hundred meligrams of alphag p c takin every once in a while i certainly do not oincourage people to take alphag p c every time they want o focus i always emphasize behaveral tools first then focusing on nutritional tools and on occasion using supplement base tools to encourage increase levels of focus and then of course there are a ver pres number of different prescription compounds that if your working with a bord certified physician they could proscribe you if you need additional tools for focus things riddleand ataral modaphinal armodaphinel vive ants et cetera for many people are going to be important an may be even necessary or people with eighty eigh t et cetera but that is a categoryan to itself and as i always say i'm not a physician i do not prescribe anything iofm a professor s i p profess many things and to day i just want to pass along or redirect your attention to that episode on focus and hi those two tools the thirteen minute a day meditation and three hunder milegram alphoci p c for increasing focus capacity and for acutely that is temporarily giving an additional boost for about of focus and of course if you choose not to use those protocalls that is perfectly fine too theree certainly no obligation they are simply available to you should you choose to try them and if nothing else you now have in mind the narro chemistry of a sedo coline at peneperan slashodrenaline and dopomine and that will really set the stage for understanding just how effective and why nicotine is effective at increasing focus motivation and even as you will soon here working memory and cognive capacity before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zerocosto consumer information about science and scince related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassim the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephosites in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science back to electorolike ratio of one thousand miligrams that one grahm of sodium two hunder milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element dot com slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elementi doccom slash hubermen let us talk about nicotine and how nicotine impacts our brains our bodies are mental performance are mental health ore physical performance and our physical health and once again i want to remind everybody that we really need to separate out a discussion about nicotine from the discussion about the delivery device for nicotine in other words when we are talk about nicotine we are not necessarily talking about smoking although we might be there are things associated with smoking and with vaping and other means of getting nicotine into our system that have their own effects both negative and in some cases positive indeed later we will talk about how you can actually use nicotine to get over smoking adiction this will not come as a surprise to many people but what perhaps will come as a surprise is the fact that many people actually used nicotine substances or nicotine itself in orer to relieve nicotine addiction will talk about that and what that looks an offer various protocalls for you later in the episode i also want to mention here at the outset that i have a longstanding interest in nicotine thact early in my scientific career i did research on nicotine and its roll in brain development and i've had a long standing interest in narro plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience and experiments that have been done by close colleagues and friends of mine really emphasize the fact that a sedo calling an in particular when a sedo calling activate called nicotinic recepters something to learn more about in a little bit thact can actually serve as a gateway or a trigger for directed rewuiring of the brain this is fastening we think of nicotine as something that we take but actually we have recepters that is locations in the brain to which nicotine binds and can exert its te facts and those receptors did not come about because of the existence of tobacco ticoxistence of vaping pens or because of the existence of anything in the outside world the fact that therare or nicotinic receptors in our brain and body tells you that a sedo calling in nicotine themselves have very important rolls in normal brain and body function much that i often to point tom an anecdote of a very well known nobell prize whenin narrow scientists i will not veal who they are theyre not a facul dymember at stamford but many nero scientists now of this person and many people i the outside world know of this person and they are also well known for their love of nicotine i once sat in this persons office and he i will reveal that as a heap consume no fewer than three pieces of nicotine gum during that relatively short conversation of about forty five minutes and that was surprizsing to me and i asked him why he was taking much nicotine through nicotine gum and he replied that for years he had been a chronic smoker which on the one hand had greatly impaired his carty of ascular health and his fitness no surprise there will talkal a bit more about what the underlying reasons are but most everyone if not everyone knows that smoking cigarettes or smoking in general really impairs long health theres tis simply no question about it there are some more or less unhealthy ways to smoke but the quite honest message is that smoking of any kind is going to destrup lung and ethelial function lung function blood vessels and forth it is going to moe it harder to breathe with vigor take deep bras duliver oxygen to tissues et cetera that said he also pointed out that the data on nicotine specifically or pointing to the fact that nicotine can be can be protective against certain forms of cognive empairment and that is why he continued to chew nicotine containing gum and he swore by the focus enhancing and motivation enhancing effacts of nicot ine containing gum now that is not a call to arms for you to run out and start choing er consuming nicotine containing products we will talk about those products later in the episode some of their potential advantages some of their potential disadvantages now i share this anecdote because it nicely separates nicotine from the delivery device through which nicotine arrives now i have not talk this individual in a few years am to see whether not the nicotine is working to stave off any kind of alcimers or nurgigenerative or a cognive impairment that woul come with age tis a gentleman is a getting up in the years and sines a quite sharp none the less but then again was always exceedingly sharp the point is nicotine is a substance that can both promote cognive function and under some conditions if taken to inappropriate or i should say to extreme dosages can also impair cognive function toay we really have a nuants conversation about nicotine one that include some of the benefits some of the drawbacks in particular for children certainly for people that are pregnant for people that have a dictive tendencies and for people that have depression and any other kind of mood disorders when i wi'll tell you soon is that nicotine can be very powerful as a mood modulator and many people who have tried to quit nicotine mainly through the form of smoking well find that their mood can drop substantially nicotine does a lot of things in the brain and body and i'd to begin by talking about what exactly nicotine is and how it impacts your brain in body what is nicotine and were is it found obviously nicotine is found in the tobacco plant but nicotine is also found in night shades that is tomatoes egplants and sweet peppers although the concentrations of nicotine in tomatoes egplants and sweet peppers is vastly lower than it is in the tobacco plant you actually can also find nicotine in potatoes now why is nicotine present in potatoes and tomatoes and in the tobacco plant at all well niotine is a plant alkoloid will get into alkuloids liit later but it is thought that these alkaloids evolved in plants as a way to prevent insects from eating them and without going into a lot of insect biology the reason or the rational behind this explanation is that nicotine is not only a substance in tobacco that people use or in the various medications that people use but it is also used as a pesticide because ican dramatically dissrupt the nervous system of insects it can render them in fertile which is not to say that it renders humans in fertile runasay again it is not the case that nicotine renders humans in fertile but it can make scertain insects in fertile it can actually disrupt their moter function and their brain function and the reasons that it has such different effects on insects in other words it can kill them or prevent them from reproducing and therefore explains why plants probably evolve to have this plant alkloid nicotine in humans because of the differenceis in recepters for nicotine where there located in the types of recepters the effects of nicotine on humans is quite a bit different and again it does not cause in fertility in humans although i will talk l bit later about some double blind pereviewed studies conducted inhumans that indicate for instance nicotine can reduce penile girth that is the girth of the penus and can lead to certain forms of sexual disfunction and those changes are largely down stream of changes in blood flow and enditheleal cell function and o thea cells of the cells that make up blood vessels and other vascular type tissues within the brain and body nicotine is found in these plants and what we can know for sure is that it some point in human evolution somebody or some group of people either and here i am completely guessing as a jusso story but some one or some group must have inhailed the smoke from the tobacco plant or put the drid leaves of the tobacco plant against some mucosal tissue any of the different mucosal linings of their body by which substances can pass through that is right any of them u mucosal soft lining tissues of the body will alow certain substances not all certain substances to pass in that is why people can put tobacco in their mouth an a certainmounted nicotine makes it in the bloodstream for tobacco up their nose certaimounted nicotine gets into the bloodstream i have not heard of people putting tobacco and other orifices of their body continuing mucosil tissue and iam certainly not suggesting people do that but you get the idea and how nicotine gets from these plants these dried leaves into the blood stream burning tobacco leads to a heat induce change in the availability of nicotine and this is why smoking tobacco or vaping tobacco simply by heating it up alows the nicotine to be liberated and go into the blood stream simply by inhalin into the lunks we will get back to smoking of various kinds later but ri now tets just keep our attention on how nicotine is pulled from these plants and into the human body now whether by inhilation or whether not by placing in contact with the mucosal tissue the mouth or other mucosil containing orifice of the body the nicotine then gets into the blood stream and once its in the blood stream it only exerts its effects because it binds to certain called nicotinic recepters oceso the nicotinic recepters are of the acitocoleanargic variety i know this is a lot to think about in a lot to heare if you have not heard about this but its actually quite simple any one can understand this a setal coline is a molecule a chemical that is that is released in the brain and body and when it binds to recepters that is little parking spots on cells it changes the way those cells behave those cells can increase their activity and release other chemicals they can become electrically active they can do any number of different things when we injest nicotine it gets into the blood streament eventually some of that will get into the brain and some of it gets into the body and in both o the brain embody there are these called nicotinica seido calling receptors aw the called family and indeed they are a family this is how we refer to groups of receptors of related design and genetic background just humans you have a family of these aseidocalling receptors that are of the nicotinic variety may be on one street in your neighbourhood the jones is in another street the chos and another sreet well in your body you have the nicotinicosito calling receptors and then you have the call musker in a casdo calling receptors today it is really simple nicotine only binds to the nicotenic a sido calling receptors and theire bunch of different ones on a bunch of different tissues and the differences in those receptors dictate what sorts of effects the nicotine will have on those tissues let us talk about with those effects are and let us do that by dividing the effects of nicotine into effects on the brain everything from the neck up and on the body the called central nervous system and the parifery although i want point ou that your spinal quart tis part of the central nervous system soing fairness to the reality your brain and spinal cord are all central nervou system everything else is considered the parifery now there are a lot of different nicotinicosito calling receptors but for those of you that want to know you af fycionatos or fear altricurious about this the main effects of nicotine in the brain are mediated by nicotine binding to the called alpa for bate to receptor alha for bateto receptor even if you do not care about receptor sebtipes that is going to come up later when we discuss why nicotine suppresses appetite iffact one of the major reasons why people do not want to quit smoking or they quit smoking or another form of ingesting nicotine and then they relapse they they go back to smoking or injesting nicotine in some other way is because indeed nicotine will increase metabolism and reduce hunger in large part by binding to this alpa for bated two receptor in a particulary the brain wered dnt return to that inall bit but if you have ever heard that nicotine kills the appetite indeed it does it is not the behavior of smoking itself as not cas you always have a cigarete in your mouth that you are not eating more food i suppose that might be a minor effect there are direct effects of nicotine on both appetite that is it reduces appetite and direct effects on metabolism that is it increases metabolism through its effects on some other airs of the brain abody will talkin about in a moment and within the brain nicotine binds to this alpha four bated two receptor in various locations in the brain and there are three and maybe a forth that will talk about nerochemical effects of nicotine after you injestit first things first when you ingjest nicotine by smoking nicotine containing tobacco or if you plice tobacco in contact with the mucosal lining of the nasal passages of the mouth takes about two to fifteen minutes for that nicotine tenter the bloodstreume smoking hets the bloodstrine faster vaping even faster should mention for ariety of reasons and placing tobacco directly in contact with the mucosal lining is going to be the slowest now as i mention before nicotine gets into the blood stream and then because nicotine can pass through the calle blood brain barrier the b b b which is basy offence surround the braine because it can pass through the blood brain barrer it is going to have very rapid effects on the brain in these four major categories of nerochemicals and neral circuits the first of those categories this is a very important one siys one that was brought up in the episode on dopomine motivation and drive and i think not just all scientists but all human being should know that within their brain they have what is called the meso limbic reward pathway the mesolymic reward pathway if you just wan o call it the dopomine reward pathway is as the name suggests a set of connections between a brain area caled the ventral tegmental area you do not after remember the namesof these things of course but if you want to that is find to the ventual tagmental area or v t a connects to another area caled the newcleas ecumbents now it hears what is very important nicotine triggers the release of dopomine from the neucleas ecumbens this is what gives nicotine its rewarding properties hit increasees motivation it tends to give a not subtle but very transine increase in feelings of well being and alertness and motivation d that is because the increase in dopomine cause by nicotine directly within the neucleus ecumbens nicotine also triggers the release of certain or chemicals from the ventraltegmental area itself and those impinge on nucleas ecumbens an increase dopamine levels further this is what makes the rewarding properties are sometimes referrd to as the reenforcing properties of nicotine powerful this is why many bilians of people in jest nicotine in one former another it is also why nicotine is hard to quit because thereis a potent increase in dopomine from multiple nerral circuit pathways within this mesolymbic reward circuitry now within the mesolymic reward circuitry thereis an interesting feature the are accelerators that ecentrly push out mare dopomine get more dopaomine release and their breaks of the call gabar urgic variety gabas an hibatory ner transmitter do not need to know too much about to just understand that nicotine both increases dopomine but also decreases the activity of gaba and this is pushing on the accelerator for dopomne but also removing the break there is a two pronged effect of nicotine on reinforcement reward dopaomine related pathways the feel good motivation pathways and that is an increase in dopamine and a decrease in gaba and again that is all mediated through this mesolymbic reward pathway involving the ventrotagmental area and the neucleus acumbens if you can canceptiualize even just five per cent of what i just told you or even if you can just remember nicotine increase as dopomine and that is why it feels good atd makes you want more of it you will have everything you need to know in mine in order to understand both the why nicotine is highly used and indeed abused why it hard to quit and that will point to avenues as to how to quit or reduc in take and it also points to how nicotine can actually be used in an anti depressint way should you choose and we will talk about what the verious criteriare for choosing that but just understand nicotine increases motivation it decreases negative feelings of mood it increases posive feelings of mood and motivation i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic grens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional neens i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking thletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets o bein the probiotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by gup microbioda that communicate with the brain the mun system and basicaly all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic grens contains a number of adaptedgins vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes cripe if you to triathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock colm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athltic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera nd they will give you a year supply of viteman d thre k two againd that is thathletic greenstock calm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply o vitemind three k to the second major effect that nicotine has in the brain is that it increases a setal colling a seto cullingit is a nuromodulator that exists in you and me is released from multible sites in the brain and the two major sights are the neucleos basalus these are collection of nurons in the front and base of your brain and from some brain sten mareas and tere are buncha different ones back there in your brainstem which is indeed in the back that release a seto colling that include then locus serulius is kind of a minor sighte the podunculo pontine nucleus their bunch of these of different areas the para by geminal nucles there are bunch of these things back that we do not have to gointo all the names but just understand that their little pockets of nuron's nerve sells located in the front in the back and some extend the middle of your brain but really in the front in the back your brain that can serve two major rolls here they are a seetal colling released from nucleus pasalus leads to it a sort of spot lighting or high lighting a particular nural circuits in te brain what do i mean by this will it say your working on a puzzle itsaits a cognve puzzle namies that you are doing a word puzzleer nowdays i've heard of this wordal thin amon twitter and pularawiys posting their wordle thing i have no idea what it is but i'm guessing it some sort of puzzle i'm gessing is a crossword puzzle and here if i'm wrong i not educate me tell me what wordle is somebody put in the comments and tell me if i should play it or not here is the deal when a seto colling is released from newcleaspisalus the nurons are there in the base of the brain but they extend axons which are little wires elsewhere in the brain and when a seetl colling is released it tends to be released at particular locations in the brain that are associated with whatever activity we happen to be doing if i'm doing wordle here i'm tong about as if i've ever done int doing crossword puzzle or wordle well the nurons that were involved in tryn to figure out the solution to that wordle or crossord puzzle are active and then a setal colling is released from the little wires the litle endings of these cells in neucleuspisalus and all of a sudden those nurrl circuits get a boosed they become more active and believe it or not our ability to perform that crossword puzzle release focus on that wordle or crossword puzzle gets enhanced it literally increases are are attention for that and not anything else is in hancso sit litrelly a neurochemicale attentional spotlight nicotin increases a seat of colling and thereby focus in concentration and mental performance not by changing the nurrl circuits that are activated persay but rather by making more aseeto colling available at those release sights it is as if the spot light er got more intense the high lighter is more intense than it would be otherwise and shuldalso mention because of the call farmoco canatics the time course in which nicotine has its effects which are pretty short lived talk about those in a momentthis enhancement in cognive per formance and attention it is goingto be very transit probably on the order of about thirty maybe forty five minutes the half life of nicotin depending on how it is ingested and whnthe not have food in the gud and what else is in the bloodstream et cetera con be anywhere from one to two hours but tipically the effects of nicotin will come on in about two to fifteen minutes as i mention before and then will last anywhere from about thirty to forty five minutes this is why in the old days and still to some extent and ciriareas of the world but less in the united states and cetainly in europe as well we do not see quite as many people smoking cigarettes for reasons we can discuss later but you would see tese chain smokers who are trying to maintain constant levels of nicotine and their brain in blood stream now perhaps they did not know that nicotin has this oneted to our half life but they could sense no doubt the cognive and the physical effects of nicotine including this cognive inhancement effect and high lighting of nerl circuits effect and they would notice they would smoke a cigarette and then for the next five to forty five minutes have heightend focus than they would start to drop offs in they smoke another cigarettes another words the're trying to maintain a constant level of nicotine for whatever activities they need to perform oviusly chain smoking because of the terrible effects of smoking i'l talk about those terrible effects bympture you have heard of them before a cancer a depletion of just about every y organ and body tissue to the point that it can actually be measured how many years of your life your peeling off interms of life span and healthspand by smoking well the terrible effects of smoking are indisputable but the positive effects of nicotine on the circuitry a part of the reason why people would chain smoke in the first place rather than get one big peak of concentration and focus and then just lit it disappear after forty five minutes oc well we have as a senaria where dopomin is going up in the mesolymbic pathway that is why smoking or injesting nicotine in any other way feels good and makes us feel motivated and then the increase in e seital calling especially from nucleous pisalus in the front of the brain is the reason why it can increase our ability to focus on particular types of endeavors particular mental work that were doing or may be in particular physical work although i should mention any time on parring the words nicotine and physical work it is obvious that because of the ways that smoking impairs long function those two things really run counter to one another another words if you are thinking about injesting nicotine through smoking arvaping in order to improve physical performance a that is a terrible idea the logic is n'nt there and the health detriments are certainly there the third nor chemical pathway that strongly activated when nicotine is brought in to the central nervous system into the brain is epaneffrner in particular norepan fran which is related to epinefrn now earlier i said epand efran is the same as e drenalan that still true norepand efran is closely related to epand efran an for to day's discussion or gan to use them interchangeably although i realize as i say that that the medical students and sombiologi students are probalican to have a minor seizure when i lump nor upand fran an epn efran i do not do that to be too much of a lumper you known science we tok about lumpers and splitters lumbers of people it to over simpliphilobit splitters of people that reatly to detail you seelat a splitters on social media from time to time they will say wai you did not mention the alpato bade a six receptor subyi ocel i get it and i am all for having splitters in the room but forsake of today's discussion and for ease of digestibility of some of this to ton to point out that norepan fran epan efran and a drenaland i'm going to treat as a common pool of similar in fact very similar molicules that all have the same net effect at least in the contects of this discussion and that is to increase levels of alertness energy nd arousal and the way that nicotine accomplishes those increases in alertness in arousal and energy within the brain by trigguring the release of norepan efrn from a litte cluster of nerons in the back of the brain called locus serulius tiny cluster of nerons that offers up ri should tay has because they are always there from birth has these little wires these axons that extend many many places in the brain not every place but virtually everplaced and can sprinkler the brain with nor epan efran essentially serve as a wake up signal elevating levels of energy and when that combines with the aseidal colling from neuclius pisalus which causes attentional spotlighting increases in concentration and focus and with the feel good properties of dopomine an the motiating properties of dopening and released from the musilan bic r word pathway now you can start to get a picture of wine nicotine is such a powerful molecule it is making people feel motivated ind good ats making people feel focuse and it makes people feel alert when they would otherwise feel lobit sleepy this is a really powerful compound in fact going back to our earlier discussion about focus and some tools for focus and i encourage you if youare interested to please check out the episode on focus theire number of different tools and protocals there to increase focus but here we are ting but one molecule nicotine found in plants tomatoes and potatoes in the tobacco plant and it can be symthesized in a laboratory and ingested through a patch or a gum or even a pill or a toothpic dipped in nicotine one molecule that can trigger activation of all the circuits for focus and motivation in one fel swoop that is remarkable that is absolutely remarkable and here we havena even touche on some of the psychological components of focus right wether not were interested in something whether not werecited about it or not this is a very very powerful system powerful in fact that i think we can really place nicotine right up there at the top right nex to caffine as the molecule that has fundamentally changed human evolution human consciousness and human experience even if you'r somebody use never injested nicotine this absolutely has to be true because you have these nicotin ic receptors which is to say that a seeto colling that is naturally released without any external trigger within your brain and body or i should say without any trigger from nicotine in particular is binding these nicotinicasit of calling receptors and is creating these effects in your brain and bodies just absolutely staggery now earliar i mention the appetite suppressing and indeed metabolism increasing effects of nicotine and while that is a fairly niche component of what nicotine does i mean it is of an important one but it is not the major reason why most people consume nicotine to take a moment and talk about that now because we are in the brain and we are talking about the effects of nicotine in the brain and seems to meet the appropriate time to talk about this now we can have this conversation about nicotine and appetite and metabolism in a very simple and straightforward way if youd to learn more about the biology of metabolism and appetite and how those things are mediated by nurl components not yould self your liver et cetera we have episodes on that but really the nurl components of hunger and appetite encourage you to check out our episode on hunger and appetite but in that episode we had a discussion andits one that olgees briefly summarized now that you have a collection of nurons that sit is right above the roof of your mouth or calle the hypothalemus hypomeans below and phalemus is right above it hypothelemus the small collection of nurons in the hypothalmus to a number of ifferent things related to sex behavior aggression mediating the temperature your body et cetera but all appetite and suppressing appetite and within the hypothalmis there is a compact collection of these little nurons which are referred to as the palm c p o m ce nurons and the name comes from the fact that they express certain peptides and we will not get into that now but the palm s nurons have a very profound impact on whether not you feel hungry or whether or not you do not feel hungry whether not your appetite is suppressed turns out that when nicotine gets into the blood stream and then into the brain some of that nikotine binds to nicotinic alphaphor bate to containing nicotinic receptors again these subbuents are receptors but base of the niking binds im on those parking spots parks there and as a consequence these palm c po m senurons increase their electrical activity and appetite is suppressed and that is because the palm s nurons have outputs to various areas of the brain and body controlling everything from how full we feel to whetheror not our blood sugar goes up or down which can impact or hunger and believe it or not whetheror not we have a tendency to want to move the jom of our mouth in order to chew food yes believe or not the nurle circuitry associated with appetite and suppression of appetite actually dictates wheather or not you prefer to or i should say are more bist or less by us to moving your mouth that is chewing which makes perfect sense when you hear it right one way to supress appetite is to the jaw shut nurrwly or at least make it less likely to open your muth and put food in it i should that reminds me of a a story or dis interrupt myself to tellbry story that the is a famous noboloriate who one the noble prize for something totally distant from appetite but once turn to a friend of mine at a meating and said i discovered the biological mechanism for losing weight and my friend said well of course it say in jest fewer callories than you burn wright callories in callories out fundamental rule of phlermodanamicsan and base lo the fundamental rule of weight lostweight gain or weight maintenance and he said no it is actually the gene that controls whether not you open your mouth now he was making a very nurty joke if you did not registers as a joke that is about as funny as neurow science or biology jokes get there are couple funnier ones without one's kind considered on the funnier sides this is why we are not considered chomedians but the point of the matter is that whether not you crave or desire or impulsively want to put things in your mouth and chew it will actually dictate how many calories that you eat and i find it remarkable and indeed important to know that these plm se nurons are actually inhibiting the opening and the movement of the mouth for chewing when we smoke or when we injest nicotine in any other way you activate these palm senrons you suppress appetite but impart you do that by actually limiting the impulse to chew incredible at least to me now in addition to limiting appetite by changing one's desire to injest food and chew it and actual craving of food by regulation of bood sugar et cetera there do seem to be some quite direct effects of nicotin n on metabolism and the effects on metabolism are not enormous thies are increases in metabolism that are bout two per cent up to about five per cent but i want to emphasize that those are transien increases in metabolism none the less people that quit smoking often find that their appetite goes up they sometimes gaine weight they sometimes do not depending on whether not they offset that increase in appetite with increase physical exercise or with decreased food in take in other ways but there does seem to be this direct effect of injesting nicotine on metabolism which i find is interesting because if you look in the literature one of the reasons why people are reluctant to quit injesting niccotine if for instance they want to quit using the deliveryo device niccotine thats causing such proms for their health smoking or vaping or whether or not they find themsells quote in quote addicted to or have the habit of injesting nicotine in part that s likely du to be the dopomene of facts ri because jopomine is highly reenforcing and rewarding it feels good people wont to do more of it but it is also that for many people and here the data really point to the fact that a lot of the younger female smokers or younger female vapors or when i say that of course i mean younger females that vape are doing that because they the appetite suppressing effects which of course opens up an entire conversation about the sociology of body imagery et cetera atopic for a future potcast o keso nicotine has certain effects on the brain by virtue of the fact that nicotine binds these nicotine aseedl calling receptors and those receptors are found on some but not all naral circuits within the brain and we talked about some of them already mesa lembic the pomsineer ons et cetera now when we injest niccotine it goes from the blood strein to all the tissues in organs of the body has it do that in amazing it can pass to everything that brain the body it does that because nicotine is fat soluble and now when any time people here the word fat they tend to thing about body fat subcutaneous fat or may beth thing about diotary fat when i mean by fat soluble in the contect of nicotine being fat soluble is that the cells of your body have an outer layer called outer membrain and it is made up of lipid of fat very particular types of lipits in fact nicotine has this remarkable ability to move through that fatty tissue not all molecules have that ability but nicotine does i can move relatively freely through the brain and body and relatively freely from outside of cells extraceller space to interceller space it can get into cells it can do that when the brain we talk about those effects and it can do that within the body now any time were taling about the body we can be talk about any number of things but to day umun refer to the prifery and the body emoro less the same way but keep in mind in the back your head punintended you have your brain your eyes and th spinal cord and those three things make up your sentral nervous system the pariferal nervous system and the parifery which is the rest of your body t contain the organsand forth outside of the nervous system ins ecou liverer and your stomac et cetera that is what we are going to talk about now because nicotine has profound effects on the organs of the body that are separate from but that occur in parallel at the same time as the effects of nicotine on the brain sos talk about what some of those effects are when nicotine makes it into the bloodstream again within two to fifteen minutes of injesting it depending on the delivery device your heart rate will increase blood pressure will increase and the contractability of the heart tissue will actually increase what that essentially speaks to is in increase in called sympathetic tone and when i say that i do not mean an increase in sympathy for others of the motional sort what i mean is an increase in the sympathetic activity of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which is a real mouthful and mindful of ideas but all you need to know is that its a generalized system that increases levels of alertness and physical readiness makes you ready for action mikes you ready for thought its balance by a whole other system called the pari sympathetic nervous system which is basically the called rest in digest system which is a system i nurons and organs et cetera that put your bodyg your brain into a state of not being able to think clearly to digest and to fall asleep caso nicotine increases heart rate blood pressure and contractability the heart it is can t cause more bloodflow in theory although it also tends to constrict blood vessels in many locations in the body this explains the decrease in pinile girth effect of nicotine in particular nicotine injested by smoking or vaping that is right smoking and vaping reduces pinus size and also will have damaging effects on the blood lining and etheleal tissue over time it actialyis impairing blood's ability to get to the pinus chronically as well as to other organs of the body but when people in jestinicotine acutely unless hey they do that by nicker at patch or by toothpictipt in nicotine it will have some of these same effects but when not smoking tobacco when bringing nicotine into the bloodstream through other mechanisms many if not all of the destruction of the endotheleal self function can be by paste but the effects on pinal girth the effects on reducing blood flow to various tissues is still present juring the effects of nnicotine which is i mention last about one to two hours the half life is about one to two hours depending on a number of factors not interesting for to day's discussion when nicotine gets into the bloodstream it is making us more alert its preparing our body for readiness the heart is pumping harder eponeferon that is a drenoline is released from the adrenal glands which ridatop or kidnis everything is pointed toward cre ting more readiness to move more readiness to think and again this is happening in parallel with all the effects of nerchemistry that are happening with the brain that we talked about a few minutes ago an what is interesting about nikotine is that while it causes this global increase in readiness and alertness and attention and mood et cetera it also has the effect of somewhat relaxing skeletal muscle now that might seed counter intuitive to those of you out there that already know but i'm about to tell the rest of you did not know it previously that your muscles are able to contract because of the effects of a seetal colling released from nurons in your spinal cord that spit out a seeto calling on to the muscle and bind to what nikotinic a seeto calling receptors put into plain english nikotinic receptors are also the ways in which your muscles can get activated therefore why would it be that increasing nicotine would cause relaxation of the muscles nw that has to do with some of the nerl circuits that are upstream of the muscles and askd to do the lobit of how the autonomic nervous system is arrange and frms t a which receptors go were a topic and con a rabbit hole of conversation far too deep for right now at least in the contects of this already somewhat a detailed discussion of the effects of nicotine but we were to zume out and just think about the effects of nicotine we now have a very clear picture reward pathways are turned on attention is turned on alertness is turned on you feel better than you felt a few minutes ago your blood pressure is up your heart rate is up your preparedness for thinking is elevated is well and yet your body is somewhat relaxed that is a very interesting state of mind and body interesting because it is somewhat ideal for cognitive work if you'aeging to sit down and work on a book or you ging t sit down an trying figure out a hard math problem or youe gong to write a letter that is been really challenging you for you to write or maybe tht you arereally excited to write but that you have been uno slow to get out the door for whatever reason here i'm talked about my own habits of precastination well that state of being very alert but your body being relaxed is almost if not the optimal state forgetting mental work don because of your feeling agitated in your body and you want a physically move your bodies very hard to do cognive work at least the sorts of cognive work that involve typing your riting of these sorts of things it is also the exact opposite of the optimal state for physical performance which is one of yes also alertness yes also motivation and elevated mood that is all wonderful stuff to have in mind literally when you are exercising your competing in sport or something of that sort but under those conditions you really also want to have a fasts reaction time a low latencee for muscle activation thatyou can make cordinate muscle movements in the ways that you need to which is of course what is required of physical endeavors that tells us a few things first all it tells us that nicotine is going to be general ly a bad idea for a pre workout tool or for enhancing physical performance however it is apt to be an in fact is an excellent tool for enhancing cognitive ability and of course that triggers my mind to return to the enecdote about my noble prize whening colleague who in jests nicotine by way of nicotine containing gum in order to increase levels of cognive focus certainly not for going out and playing sport in fact despite the fact the he is very very tall ye often points to himself in in an appropriately funny way that he despite being on the basceball tim of his highscoys you a probly the worst player that ever existed and they only position and there because of his height and i gess his head was design to a prevent a balls from entering the basket in any event nicotine does seem to be very good at enhancing cognive function at least in the short term which is not to say that it is without it side effects which we will talk about and again those are sideiffects ther independent of smoking your vaping or other forms of injesting nicotine for instance dipping or chewing tobacco is known to cause a fiftyfold yes fives y ar fiftyfold increase in mouth cancers things lucoplakia and just generally is terrible for your health i am sorry to breakot you but if youre dipping er your using snaf for things to that sort you certinly ofm ni can i tell people what to do m an that is not my my rollin life but you are dramatically increasing the probability of an ora cancer or of a mucosalining cancer of some sort it is not just that smoking in vaping ar bad for yor health these other forms of delivery from nicotine can be bad for your ealth as well nowd whether not in jesting nicotine by way of nicotin containing degum or patch or toothpick or other method is dangerous for other reasons is a discussion that is important right now it appears that provided the dosages are kept reasonable without about w reasonable means or later and the frequenci is kept relatively low not relying on these things constantly there may in fact be some benefit to injesting nicotine from time to time provided that you are not still developing your brain now in reality ner a plasticity goes on throughout the lifetime your life is actually one long developmental ark is not development occurs in then stops but certainly for people before puberty juring pubeity and probably for the next fiftein to twenty years after puberity avoiding nicotine is probably a good idea of course development is your entire life is not development starts in than ends but certainly for people that are twenty five years old or younger injesting nicotine as a way to enhance cognive function is probably not the best idea certainly please for those of you that are fifteen years old or younger injesting nicotine in any form unless it is prescribed by your doctor for very specific clinical reason to me seems just a terrible idea based on all the date of that i've read and the reason for that is it is going to create us in ai rio of nicotine dependence in order to achieve heighten levels of mood and alertness et cetera and that is bad whetwere effectively talking about is an addiction for nicotine directly not necessarily the delivery device method smoking are vaping although it could pull that in as an addictive or habit forming behavior is well but you want to let your nurl circuits develope to the point where again unless there is a clinical need for prescribed drug from a license physician or cecitras et cetera that you are not relying on chemical enhancsemen of these circuites for people who are twenty five years or older and again as not strict cut off but roughly twenty five years or older but for those of you that are thinking about using nicotine to enhance cogna function as adults and your brain development is slowing down right never ceases but is slowing down or has slowed down to the point where we would say developmental plasticity is largely over and your now an operating th in the contacts of a dult nerro plasticity well in that case there may be instances in which increasing a seetle culling dopomine et cetera by way of nicotine ingestion might be a good idea but certainly not by smoking vaping or by direct contact of tobacco to the mucosa lining tissue of the mouth or knows co dipping or snuffing for the last twenty minutes or we been talking about the biology of nicotine specifically how it impacts the brain how it impacts the body why it feels good why it can enhancs focus and we have largely set aside smoking vaping dipping tobacco and snuffing and the negative effacts that those all have on mental and physical health working down from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet we can say that smoking vaping dipping and snuffing negatively in pact every organ an tissue system and cell of the body by virtue of the fact that they all damage the end otheleal cells again the end othelial cells of the cells that make up the vasculature which delivers blood and other nutriants to all the cells an organs and tissues of te body and those endithelial cells are strongly and negatively impacted by all of the practices that i just described on the way that that happens very zolobit from each one to the next for instants it has been estimated that cigarettes contain anywhere from four thousand to seven thousand toxins now the word toxens is a real buzzword these days you her about detoxes an toxens but more specifically we know that it contains carcinegens these are cancer promoting compounds for instance we know that the tar in cigarettes even low tarcigarettes as well as the ammonia within cigarettes as well as the fermalbahide contain within cigarettes as well as the carbondioxide thats generated from smoking those cigarettes are all carcynegens carbondioxide also has the negative effect of depleding the amount of oxygen that delivered to any and all of our tissues by way of the impact of carbondoxside binding hemoglobin and preventing hemoglobin from delivering oxygen to the tissues of the bod while ther may be four thousand or forty five hundred or seven thousand toxins depending on which cigarette which papers they have ane rolled in whether not their filthered or nonfilt er the type of tobacco et cetera et cetera there are tremendous number of toxins and there are some very potent carcinegens within that long list of toxins again emmonia tar for maltohide and carmondioxide being the mose potent of those carcinegens now the fact that ther carcinegens and cigarettes sometimes lead cigarette smokers in particular the cigarette smokers that have the hartestst time quitting or that enjoy their cigarettes the most from saying well this in everything as a carcinagen or everything kills you well certainly that is not a true statement and while there are other carcinegens in the environment inviremental hazards solvens and if you even if you work in a laboratory for incance we use in the laboratory deana intercolating dizese are literally dies that allow us to see the deana structure of cells and see the protines they may can se the arnaes they make and it is very important to were gloves when you work with those things because as the names suggest the intirculate the achi get in between the strands of deana and separate them they are mutigens they mutate d'ana they are often carcinegens as well we have them in our laboratory but we take certain precautions to not have them negatively impact our health safety protocals and on we hear that ther carcinegens in car exhaust and bus exhaust and in all sorts of things pestosides and that is all true in the argument of probabilities one would say well if there are all these other carsinegens in the environment why would you compound their carcinagenic of fact by smoking or vaping or dipping or snuffing but that usualy does not get people to quit smoking ore doing those things because of the powerful reenforcing effects of nicotine itself again nicotine is the reenforcing element by way of triggering that dopomine reenforcemen pathway the musolymic reward pathway and of course there are all the other additional effects of increased focus such as increased ability to pay attention to work or to others that lead to other rewards and than it becomes the situation of compounding rewards soas not realy about the cigarette it is about the nicotine ands not really about the nicotine it is about the dopomine that the nicotine evokes and than's not really about the dopomine that the nicotine evokes directly persay but also about all the posive effects that that increase dopomine results in we can easily circle back to the negative effects of smoking vaping dipping and snuffing and say the endothelial cells are desrupted the endothilial cells are involved in delivery of blood and other nutris to every tissue of the body and smoking vaping dipping and snuffing contain carcinegens which are cants are promoting and because the epidemiological studies are out there we can actually arrive at some very clear numbers as to how much life one will lose from ingesting nicotine by way of those four delivery devices or i should say any one of those four deliverye devices although i should also mention that many people are vaping are also smoking cigarettes as becoming increasingly common lot of people are using vaping in one contaxt and cigarettes an another dipping in one context fvaping in another but even for those that only smoke or only vapor only dippor only snuff the negative effects or dramatic and calculable it is thought that for every pack of cigarettes consumed per day see could average that out if youre a to a day cigarette smoker or i more o packadays ecigarette smoker ar two packaday for every pack of cigarettes smoke per day we can reliably estimate a fourteen year reduction in life span cigarettes are literally peeling years off your life now because of the way that the brain works in the way that human beings anticipate the future and can be grounded both in the present and the future or the present in the past such as how the mine works right that is why we can think about the future but also realize where we are in time and space to day because of that many people say well i enjoy cigarettes ar i enjoy vaping and least while i'm here i'm enjoying it and that is because the doplamin system is not very good at understanding opportunity costs that is what we would be doing in those fourteen years and what we would be enjoying and the enrichment that we would get if we were to live into those fourteen years at some level the smoker the vapor is being rational when they say ye but i enjoy this and the years lost i i cannot really register that because it is hard to register what you do not have in what you have never had ion the other hand we can also point to the statistic that there is this fiftyfold increase in mouth cancers from dipping and there are nasal cancers as well that are greatly increased by snuffing and from smoking and now we know based on data from vaping that the endothelial sell damage and the direct effects of damage to the lungs from tars and even if people are vaping which tends to have lower tars than do cigarettes even for people that are vaping greatly increased probability of stroke of periferal vascular disease this is priferal pain because rememberg uo blood is delivering not jous blood but other neutrients and its clearing things out from tissues thereis an accumulation of literally toxins an debri that sells generate all the time which is healthy but then tenormally is cleared away by the end of thelial cells and by other celtypes of the emian system that is all increased in people that engage in these nicatine delivery device behaviors rates of heart attack rates of stroke rates of cognive decline are all increase on ou mights a cognive decline i thought that nicotine increases the likelihood that we can maintain healthy neuronal function and cognave capacity and might even increase cognive capacyin a potent way in the short termin indeed it does however cigarette smoking in vaping are now known to dramatically decreased cognave function because one of the keythings about the brain is that it is the most metabolically demanding organ which means it consumes a lot of glucos or even if you keed to ganicini keytones you need new t rions getting to the narons and other seltypes of the brain and nervous system in order for it to function properly and when you disrupt the vasculature through this endethelial seldis function yet things interstitial which just means in the spaces between disfunctions o snotchous beating up the endotheoselles themselves but the spaces between the selves its being distruptivis lot of debris that accumulates there and as a consequence the bran just simply will not function as well sees are getting short term memory lapseas you striging working memory lapses working memory is a sort memory if some one tells you their seven dogept for fone number typically now days people to share theire info but seven dogept fonumber or sequence of mumbers are an address and your inability to remember thats your walking back to the kitchen thinking you cannot remember what you were trying to remember just a short moment ago that is working memory working memory suffers longter memory projective or interrograte nemmemoryies into the future how can you member i can remember things in the future that have not occurred yet well this is more of a memory for future plans or ideas and planning for things that are to come what we can very reliably say is that currently more than one billion billion more than one billion people consume tobacco in order to get their nicotne cause that is really the reinforcing element within tobacco more than one billion people consume tobacco in the form of cigarettes every day a growing number of people more than half a billion people now are starting to vape the estimates range from two hundred million to five hundred million and there is lotted debate about this because a lot of people are hybred smokers and vapors meanting they do one or both depending on time of day and location as i mention before but now you start to see how you can get to the number that billions of people are consuming tobacco because of course you also have your peopl that are dipping in your people that are snuffing and as i mention before you have people that are engaging in multiple of these behaviors billions of people on planet earth anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of human beings incredible right andyuwhere from one eigh to a quarter of human beings are consuming tobacco in one form or another in order to get their niccotine one way or another and as a consequence are pealing ears off their life dramatically increasing the probability of cancer stroke hart attack periferal naropathes braindis function meaning cognive disfunction memory in parment secual tis function there are number studies have looked that increases in cortes all and while miner those increases do exist decreases in growth hormon and while minor those decreases exist but even setting aside the negative impact on endergan on hormon factors it is very very clear that smoking vaping dipping and snuffing are among the worse things that we can do for our health right they are among theleading causes of preventable death and debilitating life conditions which may lead you to the question as to why in the world would people do this well it turns out most of them do not want to in the best surveys that one can find of if you could quit smoking if you could quit vaping would you what you find is that at least for cigarette smokers seventy per cent seven zero want to quit they would love to quit and yet they find that to be exceedingly difficult and the reason they find it to be exceedingly difficult is because of all the brain narrow chemistry that we talked about before the reason i spent close to twenty minutes talking about dopening in the measil linbic pathway a seedo culling and nucleous basalus and epineffron and the relaxation of muscles in the prifery and the increase in readiness in the body and brain is that all of those combine to make nicotine one of the most powerful an potent cognivinhancers in to some extent physical and hance ar although as hy mention before the total number of physical exercise or physical sport promoting effects of nicotine is very very small if not i zero there are certain conditions under which one might imagine using nicotine specifically for cognive enhancement were performance of complex motor skills what sort of outwave an negative effects on the narmuscular system are ability to generate cordinated movements is actualy an excellent study looking at th effects of nicotine not by smoking delivery but by different delivery mechanism in which they looked at performance of hitters in baseball ahesparemonst kind of an interesting one even though these were fairly skilled baseball players what they have them do is hit aball off a tea it as i recall growing up i admitly i did not play much baseball but you start off on tea ball n then you you would go i think it was to pitching machine then thy would yus actual pictures who throw the ball bu in this case it was a couple of different baseball related tast that have people hit the ball off a tee in but they had to direct that hit toward a ball a top another tea it is fairly precise targaning that is required or to knock that ball off the other tea this is an activity that involves not just motor output but cordinated motor out put in not just cordinated motor output but directed cordinated output that require some as we would take top down processing i this isnit the kind ofthing that can be done reflectively is is the kind of thing where the forebrain the prefront ol quartecs in particular has to be heavily inbalved in order to suppress certain actions and then create other actions the basic take away the study is that nicotine delivered by way of nicotine gum not by smoking dipping or snuffing was able to increase cognive performance and motor output a rare circumstance were a specific set of demands that involved both cognitive engagement and physical engagement showed a slight but significant improvement but again in most cases nicotine is just simply not goin g to improve physical output if it is delivered through a smoked cigarette through vaping through dipping or through snuffing if all these behaviors are terrible for essentialy every aspect of our health frankly and whe you look at the lirtures terrible for pregnant women it is terrible for kids it is terrible for older people its terrible for younger people you really cannot find a scenario in which smoking vaping dipping or snuffing are good for us and yet people the effects on the brain and they feel quite addicted to them even if they say they are not most of those people would be unwilling to give up their practice of nicotine delivery for more than a few hours in fact if you look at the effects of withdrawal and we are going to talk abut what withdrawal of nicotine lookslike you find is that as soon as four hours after th last ingestion of nicotine by way of cigarette or vaping or dipping or snuffing what people stare to experience this imagitation craving for nicotine of course and while craving tis kind of a vague concept it is actually a very specific biological mechanism it is the dropin dopomin that starting to occur much that thereis a drop and dopamin below baseline that is the increase in dopa mean that would normally be experienced from smoking vaping dipping or snuffing is now not happening and in fact the levels of dopamin are droping below where they would have been even without performing that behavior that is what craving is and withdrawal is an increased sense of that craving as well as a lot of negative stuff stomac as or nausia or irritability and often collections of all of those because these nicotine delivery approaches are terrible for our health and also because as many seventy per cent of people who smoke would to quit but either feel they cannot because they have tried and failed repeatedly often or because is just to scary meaning the reinforcing properties are too strong in therefore they cannot imagine living without them or the withdrawal effects are to strong and they cannot imagine living with those well then is their hope for quitting smoking vaping snuffing or dipping and the short answer fortunately is yes thei are excellent ways to do that and some of them are single event treatments a we are going to talk about those shortly but before we do that i want a high light one very brief point which is that nicotine is not the cause of cancer nicotine is not the car cynagon it is the other things in tobacco or associated with the nicotine delivery device that are causing cans or and i should mention the other negative impacts on our health in particular by way of destrupted and ethelial blood vessel function now that leads us to this issue of vaping because as many of and probably ar thinking as i've been delivering this information people do not vape tobacco the way that vaping pends are designe is that it include some liquid it involves heat and it does not involve the burning off of tobacco in fact there is a constant updating of the engineering of these vape pends that they can be very low heat in some cases they use even nonheating approaches to vaporize the nicotine and allow it to enter the blood strean very quickly i must say in a lot of ways vaping resembles crack cokaine the reason why vaping and crackokane are similar is the speed of entry of nicotine into the blood strean this is not an episode about cokaine but i just want of very briefly touch on some of the delivery routes for cokaine because they parallel a lot of the delivery routes for nicotine and we can learn a lot about drug farm of conatics and dopamin if we look at the parallels between cokaine and nicotine a prephasis by saying cokane is a terrible drug it is actually a schedule two drug in the united states which means that it has very very limited yet still present medical application many mainly as an anaesthetic and certain laboratory and hospital conditions but aside from that it is very clear that cokane is one of the most debilitating drugs that humans can use because of the way that it impacks the dopamine system and it basely creates a loop whereby the only thing that can really trigger dopamine release is cokaine and as i've said before the way that i define adiction as its a progressive narrowing of the things that bring people pleasure cokane certainly falls into the category of addictive drugs strongly addictive drugs and in fact it has the additionally pernicious feature that after using cokane for some period of time the amount of dopamine that is release becomes progressively lower and lower and lower that people can never get back to a state in which dopamine release is ever as great as it was the first time they did cocane or prior to doing cokane now with a long period of no cokane use whatsoever and protecting the dopamine system in a number of different ways people can often not always but often recover their dopamine system if not completely the near completely by all meanes if you have a promlit cokaine quit find away to quit get treatment get over that one way or another we have an episode with an expert guest doctor onolempki whose a physician and the chief of the stamford school medicine dual diagnosis ediction clinic tworld expert and dopamine and addictive substances and eddictions of all kinds can find that episoda huberman laped out calm it is filled with information about how to get over different types of eddctions including cokane ediction also chook out her absoly phenomenal and indeed important book dopamination which touches on some of this as well and in the shownote captions for the episode where doctor lempki was my guess you can also find some editional resources related to that cokane is terrible that needs to be acknowledged it should be avoided and ye should find a way to quitted if you are currently using with that said the delivery mechanism for coqane strongly paral parallels the delivery mechanisms for niccotine that is people will snort coqane which is a lot snuffing or dipping that is when peopll snort coqne their bring coqane indo proximity or into contact really with the mucosal lining of the nasal passages which then allows the pcyclactive substances to permeated to the blood stream very seldom do people eat it although that does happen from time to time people will inject it than as cle mainlining which is a very rapid entry into the bloodstream because its direct application to the blood stream by way of injection and then there is crack coqane which is essentially a vaporising of the coqane from a from a call coqine rock that somewhat resembles vaping of niccotine while the vappen involves a liquid that sold te cartridge that contains in nicotine and often other flavors as well flavorings i should say both crack coqane and vaping cause very rapid increases in te relative substances that are psycholactive in the case of coqane that would be coqane and the increasein dopomine in the brain and body i should mention and in the case of vaping there is a very rapid increase in blood concentrations of nictine much faster than occur with cigarette smoking or other modes of nicotine delivery that speed of onset turns out to be a critical perameter because the speed of onset of nicotine is going to also determin the speed of release of dopomine in the neucleas acommons in ventural tygmental area that mesalymbic reward pathway and with the mesolimic reward pathway it is not just about the pike meaning the maximal amount of dopomine that s release but it is the time course how steep the curve is how quickly that dopomine increases that is going to determine how reenforcing how habit forming and indeed how addictive of particular substance is one of the major important differences between vaping and cigarette smoking is that the onset of dopomine release from vaping is faster and even a subdle increase in the rape at which dopomine increases in the mesilymic reward pathway can make a given amount of niccotine much more habit forming and addictive this probably explains the fact that many many more people in particular young people age twenty five and younger are vaping at phenominal rates now people are starting to vape and just about ever you see this in restaurants you seed on the street indeed you even see in the class room ow this is actually become sort of sport of sorts o the certainly not something ine courage in fact when i learn about this from a college student o new college student is telling me that many college students aractually bringing vape pends into the classeromi think this is also happening in high schools and even junior high schools this is a really concerning practice and here i am not trying to come across as the the anti vat bing crusador but i must say given the negative effects on one's health in the long term but also given these exceedingly powerful reward properties of nicotine entering the blood stream quickly and dopaming being released very quickly from the musolymbic reward pathway what were seeing out there makes total sense young peopls brains are essentially getting wire to the expectation that dopamine is going to be increased dramatically and quickly under their control except its under their control only in a very narrow set of circumstances recall the definition of adiction a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure weaken change that statement to all say a progressive narrowing and specific canetics that is specific time course of the things that bring you pleasure nthat is a bit of a nurtier statement than a progressive narroing of the things that bring you pleasure but what were going to see in the next few years i believe is an entire generation of young people for which a very large percentage of them are going to be seeking out a pattern or feeling because to the person taking at here not looking at their dopaming levels rising in their blood their experiencing this as an increase in folkas an increase in alertness and increase in mood and well being that is very ratid very dramatic and that simply cannot be recreated by any other substance and that' very concerning scenario concerning because that musolymbic reward pathway is the only pathway the only pathway by which you can achieve the rewarding properties of any kind of endeavor not just vaping of course it is the way in which people achieve satisfaction from reaching a relationship goal or an athletic goal or an educational goal any kind of goal or sense of satisfaction and it comes is no surprise that vaping as strongly associated with increased levels of depression especially when vaping yuse drops off why would that be if people are getting much more dopamine much more quickly from vaping shon they be feeling better ah that brings us back to the critical and i shoulds a defining feature of the dopamin reward pathway for motivation and well being which is that initially a given substance will cause let say an ait out of ten again arbitrary units but ada out of ten increase endopamine but with repeated use what ends up happening is that even that similar or higher levels of ingestions sare not just one innelation a minute but may be to innolations of minute or innolation every thirty seconds now its level fore out of ten activation of dopamng and then three and then to an eventially it drops below base line now the whole system can be recovered by abstinence from nicotine consumption but the doping ae system is applied to everything all sense of well being all sense of motivation during the period in which one is abstaining from nicotine and vaping in particular people do not feel good they feel miserable that is why it is called withdrawal it is associated with a bunch of psychological and physiological set symptems that all lead back to trying to get to the same levels of dopamin release in the same patterns that were experience when one initially started vaping i'm not trying to paint a dark picture here but frankly the picture is very dark i'm very concerned about a practice of ingesting something that powerfully modulates the dopamean system with the sorts of connectics that one sees from ingestion of crak cocane in young people that has all these other negative health effects that in the short term is very powerfully rewarding increased focus well being et cetera but that over a very brief period of time leads to a state in which the entire dopamin rewarded system is impaired and can become permanently impaired unless one intervenes in a very deliberate way people are directly controlling the rate of dopamine and the frequency of dopamin release by the duration and frequency of inhalations off the vate pen and that is an incredible thing because what it does is it sets up the mesolomic reward pathway for an expectation that dopamin will be delivered allin that schedule that is one of the things that makes vaping in particular hard to quit vaping is actually harder to quit than cigarette smoking for most people does that mean that cigarette smoking is vairly easy to quit for most people no seventy per cent of people who smoke cigarettes report that they would to quit if they thoughf they could the successrate of quitting smoking when people try to go just cold turkey just quit with no assistance whatsoever they might tell their family and friends hay im quitting that is it is exceedingly low it is five per cent five per cent of the people that say that is it i'm not smoking again despite cancer diagnosis a'm not smok again despite the fear of the negative health fects a nut can ever smok again despite the financial cost the a health cost anyway told list off t e a fuge number of things that it does their negative but you already know these or you' heard them it makes your skin wer it a as a mention it it i lowers lobido it destrupts hormones it destrupts vascular function brain function does all these terrible things and yet most people who tryind quit simply cant and of the five per cent that succeed in quitting a full sixty five per cent of them relapse within a year that is a very depressing picture but it is not to say that people cannot quit in fact they can there are couple of methods thathave been shown to help people quit some are behavioral and some are phormical logic just wone a touch on the behavioral one's first because it turns out that there is ey quite powerful method for quitting nicatine ingestion by way of cigarette smoking which also carries over to vaping this is beautiful work that is been done by my colleague in fact close collaborator although i was not involved in the research that i'm about to describe at stamford and his name is doctor david speople he is our associate sure of psychietry he is been a guessed on the huborman lad podcast and he is a world expert if not the world expert in the clinical applications of hypnosis now when i say hypnosis a lot of people think stage hypnosis which is the hypnotis trying to get people to do certain things and says certain things non sirly against their will because they actully have to agree but the hypnotist is dictating what the person thinks says and does clinical hynosis is vastly different from that clinical hypnosis is where the person the patient actually directs their own brain changes toward a specific emotional or behavior of goal work from doctor david speogle's laboratory done in nineteen ninety three but that now has been repeated many many times as carried over into some more modern studies in ou will provide links to those studies in the shownote captions that you can accis them those studies have shown that using a specific form of hypnosis people can achieve complete and total cessation of cigarette smoking and there is no reason tobelieve this does not also carry over to vaping through one single hypnosis cession and the successorates are incredibly high when one considers that normally it would be only a five per cent successorate the successorate with this particular hypnosis developed at stanford chool medicin by doctor david'speagle is twenty three per cent of people who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking now in the old days which actuhl was not that long ago now before the advent of smart phones and before the inernet took off to the excent that it has now this was done by having some one come into the clenic and doctor spegle himself for one of his collegues would take somebody through the hypnosis nowadays you can actus the hypnosis ere's a wonderful ap that was developed by doctor david' speagle and others it is called reveri are e ve e r i have talked about this ap af few times on the podcast before because their are hypnosis scripts within the ap for enhancing sleep for improving ability of fall asleep if you wake up in te mill the night for focus a number of other behavioral an emotional changes there is also a function in the revery ap for smoking cessation which exactly parallels the sort of inlaboratory and inclinic approaches that doctor speagle would use were you to show up at his clinic or his laboratory instance that is not possible for the large number f people out there if you or somebody else is trying to quit smoking or vaping or dipping or snuffing for that matter i strongly encourage you to check out the revery ap you can find it easily by going to reveri dot calm it is available in various foremats some of it is available free some of his behind a paywall but given the tremendously negative impact of smoking vaping dipping and snuffing the hypnosis for smoking cessation that reverye has seems at least to me as a very powerful and worth while resource please check that out if you are somebody whose trying to quit in jasting nicotine by any of the four methods that i just described now of course there are other methods that people have used to successfully quit smoking or vaping or other forms of nicotine delivery and is actian excellent review on this topic before diving into a few the specifics about some of the pharmicology of using nicotine itself to quit smoking or nicotine itself to quit vaping or the use of various things even escess orise and to depressencs to quit smoking or vapin is one a point you to a review article that if you to get a complete survey of all the options that are available there is an excellent review on this it was publishjust a couple of years ago in twenty twentyn the title of the article is pharmicalogic approach to smoking cessation and updated review for daily clinical practice and even thouge it is mainly focust on smoking cessation i it carries over quite nicely to vaping and it details an number statistics the fact that every year seven hundred thousand more people die because of smoking relay diseases there again you have the the negative health effects om that younger people are smoking that women are smoking more nowadays and that even though you see less smoking typially in the uess ind canada and even in northern europe some places the still many many people are smoking who would to quit but that seventy five per cent of people a lease accoring to this re view earlier ias at seventy per cent but estimates are as high as seventy five percent of people tra to quit smoking relapse within the first week the first week they just go right back to it that is how powerfully reinforcing the nicotine as rememberits the nicotine in the cigarette that is powerfully reinforcing but it is also the oral habit the motor habit there is this thing about density of censory receptors in the lips people bringing things to their lips on food cigarettes other lips in some cases et cetera there is a reinforcement pathway related to that for or obvious adaptive reasons and as a consequence there is a reinforcement both from the behavior and from the dopeming released from the nicotine itself and as i mention earlier from the posiive reinforcement that comes from increase focus the money that you make through ork or your attentional abuility or the fact that your alert and people feel present all of that funnels back into posive reinforcement behavioral reinforcement and in what we would call addiction this review covers all of that and then steps beautifully through nicotine replacement therapy and various compounds several of which i'm going to talk about now which have been shown to increase that number tht we talked about early of only five percent of people who try to quit with no other support pharmical logic or hypnosis or otherwise just say that is it i'm not cin smoke again i'm not in avap again only five per cent of people succeed in doing that and even among those many and up relapsing later there are couple pharmica logic approaches one of the main ones that is received a lot of attention ind recent years is breu priperone sometimes referred to by it is commercial name well butren now beu priperone is a compound that increases the release of dopomine and to a lesser extent apinepren and some other narrow chemicals as well it is use for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation now i want a point out again i'm not a s a chitris i'm not telling you to take opriporone a ca well butron but omen lo give you a little bit of the contour of whats typically done in terms of bu priporone administration to help people get relief from some the withdrawal symptoms of trying to quit smoking or vaping or other forms of nicetine ingestion typically beu priprone is takin in three hundred miligram per day doses divided into two dosages of a undrd fifty milograms each or sometimes thereis a slow release formula the dosages will vary from person o person when a really emphasize that there is an increase seizure risk with beupriprone it only occurs in a small fraction the population but none the less is a real concern for those members of the population for those of you with seizure risk when it or not that is going to be a valid concern in terms of potential side effects the other thing about repriporone is that has to be used with caution in patients to have liver disease or renal disease that can impact the amount that anyone can take many sometimes people have to take a much lower dose if they have renal disease or liver disease ensometimes they cannot take it at all sometimes if people are taking benzo diazapines for whatever reason or other seditives theire contraindications there beu priprone is inta you n and of one size fits all or magic bullet for quitting smoking none the less for people that can take it safely and again this is a prescription drug abord certified sychatrist or othe physition is going to have to prescribe it for you if it is appropriate for you and it moves that number of five percent successorate to about what one sees with the clinical hypnosis to about twenty per cent of people will successfully overcome their nicotine or i shuld say their smoking or vaping addiction now it is important ask why this would work iht i mean it is not as if bu priporone is increasing nicotine per say what its doing is ittapping on that mesolimic reward pathway increasing dopomeanor at least allowing dop ofmine levels to say substantially elevated enough that people do not experience some of the drop an dopamen that leads to the withdrawal symptoms the lessening of mood et cetera and it is no coincdence of bu priporone is also in antintopressent it is a commonent a topressent for people that experience negative side effects with the called escess arisze the selective ceretone and reuptaken hibiters that prevent them from taking those things lessen lebido or appetitor in some cases increased appetite or any number of other side effects that some people not all but some people experience with essessorize theyl be prescribed well butran u priporon as the generic name i well buton being the commercial name again beu priporone is what they will be prerscribed instead with the caviats of seizure risk renal disease liverdiease at cetera the autcomes with well butran for smoking cessation are pretty good of m if you thing about an increase from five per cent to twenty per cent that is pretty dramatic and yet i also want a refer back to the incredible success of the clinical hypnosis approach again you can find that at reveri dot calm the clinical hypnosis approach has a successorate of twenty three per cent it very closely alined with if not exceeding the successrate with bew priperon of courst there are other phormicologic approaches to quitting smoking or vaping all of them generally circle back to increasing dopomine end or in nor up in efferant in order to offset some of the withdrawal symptoms of smoking sensation or vaping cessation a very common approach for people to tryind quit smoking or vaping is to use nicotine itself to try and prevent people from seeking nicotine through a cigarette or vapepen what i mean by that is people using a nicotine patch or nicotine gum or other nicotine delivery device that is not cigarettes and not vaping in order to maintain levels of nicotine in thei bloodstreang which of course means maintain levels of nicotine in their brain and body to the same extent that they would if they were smoking or vaping maybe even gradually taking down the total amount of nicotine in their brain and body by reducing the number or size of nicotine gum pieces of the injest each day or keeping the patch on for a shorter amount of time or getting a lower dose patch that releases less nicotine total or over time all of those approaches have been shown to be reasonably successful get to the numbers in a fuments but reasonably successful in allowing people to quit smoking or vaping again most of the data is on cigarette smoking because vaping is a relatively new phenomenon although quite troublingly it is a very rapidly increasing behavior especially in the young population says one kind of lumping these two things together because i think very soon we are going to need and all out campaine for how to counter vaping addiction what o we know about smoking sensation using nicotine itself is the patch best is nicotine gum best turns out that a combination of approaches is best somewhat surprising but is very clear from the lierature that i was able to find that using nicotine patches for some period of time and then switching to a gum and then perhaps switching to in a nasal spray that is going to be the most effective then the question is how long to continue each of those and wether not to overlap them it seems as if doing one for about a week in the switching to another for about a week in thet switching to another is one rationable and reasonable approach that many people of use successfully why would that be well it all has to do with the different rates of absorbtion of nicotine into the bloodstream and then the downstrem consequences of that on the dopomine a seeto coline apinefferan and other systems of the brain and body and while there has not been an extremely detailed study of the exact connetics of how the nasal sprays verses the transtermal patches verses the gums et cetera work there is a logical structure to it that will immediately mike sensitu first of all the transtermal patches provide af fairly steady state dopa men release across the day and often thas people are wearing them at night is well this is relevant because if people are injesting nicotine by way of smoking and vaping you hopefully they are not waking up in th mill the night just to smoke or vape or believe not some people do that but of course while people are asleep they are not smoking or vap ping they as sol you do not falsely with cigarette your mouth you burn the hle house down but exceedingly rare to have people are smoking in their sleep people wake up in the morning and because the half life of nicotine from smokingyour vaping is very short anywhere from one to two hours they are essentialy in a state of withdrawal at the poin whre they wake up in the morning how can i say that well remember whith drawl sets in about four hours after the last in jestion of nicotine by cigarette or buy inolation from the vapen people are waking up in nicotine withdrawal and then immediately going in to the behavior of ingesting nicotine or very soon after waking for most people nicotine patch is going to be very effective for a week or again talk your physicion about the best approach for this but then switching to a nasal spray or switching to nicotine gum for about a week which is going to change the canatics of that niccotine absorption to the blood stream and change the release of dopaming another norow chemicals within the brain that is going to keep the system intentionally off balance that it never comes to expect one single pattern or amplitude of dopamine release and that is a very powerful way for a let us just call it a quitting method to work because as i've always said the most powerful schedule of dopomine is going to be this random intermittent reward this is what is used in the casinos in order to take your money and generally they do on average they take your money more than you take theirs and they take more of it ah not just more often because they use this random indermit an schedul thererenomin ormen schedul is one in which you do not really know when the peaks in dopamine are going to arrive and there is not this expectation and craving and then all a sudden when dopaming is released its extremely high that is how they get you to continue playing even though bay sen youre losing money in your dopamine is dropping they elevated every once in a while nicotine replacement can be used in a similar way but in a benevolent way in order to help you get over smoking or vaping by keeping the total amounts of dopamine variable around the clock and by changing the amount of dopamine that is released it seems to help people behaviorly and psychologically becaus they do not come to expect having a particular amount of dopamine in their brain and blood at any given time and this is an important point because it brings us to this notion of homiostasis homio stasis is this tendency for biological systems to try and reach equilibrium goes up goes down et cetera and to some extent to the same degree i'll talk about this renow the contect of niccotine use withdrawal and then the period in which people no longer crave nicotine you can imagine that if we were to measure your heart ray your blood pressure nd your over all levels of alertness and well being in mood let' just give that some value let' say t runs from zero to ten again arbitrary units sus just take all those physiological measures and the subjected measure of your mood d let us measure it av four times an hour across the day across the waking hours but we would find as a line that would kind of you' squiggle a bit may be a nice text comes in that you really maybe you get a not good news and your youre kind of autonomic arousals all over the place but on averageis kind of squiggly line where increases in the morning cause that is typically when body temperature and autonomic rousal increase and then towards the afternoon it is goint come sloping down and then right before sleep thoyll be an increase again oun if you have ever felt that you cant arun around a lot before sleep in the it goes down that is kind that typical contour of autonomic arousal mood et cetera across the day removing of course life o ens and things psychiatric illness and depression and et cetera that is the typical ark of that now let superimpose on whatever that contour is for you nicotine get a ll bowless says we sail o bit of nicotine from smoking a cigarette or from taking ilation on of epe pen what ends up happening is is there increase in blood pressur increase in hartray increase in mood increase in elertness all things we talked about earlier over time the body starts to a just that the base line upon which that nicotine induced increase in arousal would occur is actually reduced right why would that be well the body in the brain your physiology seeks homiostasis if there is a big increase in all those things blood pressure and mood et cetera typically your base line we will drop a little bit to compensate for that over time after a couple days ore even weeks of injesting niccotines let' say you you wake up your typically take and intilation off your vape or you would have a cigarett around nine or ten a m you do that daily you get used to a certain level of mood and alertness and well being for that time of day and then if you smoke again in the afternoon let us say you also get a custom to a certain level of mood and alertness and well being for that time of day again it will very to pnding on life events but your system sort of gets use to it and your base line will drop to compensate for those peaks that the peaks are not quite as high as they were when you first started using nicotine now you decide toquates and now what were talking about is transitioning from the consumption to what we are going to call the withdrawal face now what happens as you say that is it i'm going cold turkey i know there is only a five per cent successory but on jistco cold turkey or somebody will say not omnuse the revery ap or somebody says no omni use you pri perone or another method or niccotine patch or somethingof that sort well setting aside the nicotine patch or the nicotine delivery device and only focusing on approaches for getting through withdrawal that have no direct effects on nicotine a case an not using the tine patch but say the hypnosis or you pri perone which can increase dopomi but it does not increase nicotine directly what happens the day that you quit that homyostatic mechanism in your brain and body that sets your level of mood and arousal et cetera does not know and has not adjusted to the fact that you are not bringing in nickotine you are not having that cigarett you are not having that inelation on the vapin what ends of happening is that base line which has been adjusted down to offset the increases in mood and alertness et cetera when you smoke or vape is lower than it normally would be that nine am cigarette time or vapinilation time no longer feels above base line it actually feels below base line because what your seeing is the lower amplitude of arousal that was there to offset the increase you were getting from vaping or smoking and then in the afternoon if normally you have a kind of phase of your after you really enjoy you outside you have a vapor cigarette you normally feeling relax are you go out at nigh you to vapings a note not canto do that any more you are going to feel much much worse then you would have had you never started smoking r vaping now that is not much help to any one a whose already started smoking or vaping but i say this because it is very important understand that the reason why relapse rates are high within the first week seventy five per cent of people relapse within one week and over all failour rates are ninety five per cent is because people do not expect to feel even worse then they did prior to ever smoking or vaping that first week is absolutely critical and the beauty of understanding this is that if you can get through that first week either by sheer grit or by finding other methods to increase dopamine healthy methods i would hope and certainly cold showers i spas have been shown to do that by the way an this was described in doctor onolempki's book dopome nation cold showers can increase dopamin exercise posive social interactions it is very likely that people wel need to use other healthy methods to offset that reduction in dopomine if ever they stand to get through that first week and again if you can get through that first week chances are quite a bit higher that you will be able to maintain the cessation of smoking or vaping and of course hypnosis things i be priperone can also assist in that be priperone by way of increasing dopamine pharmicologically hypnosis through changes in neral circuitry that are not completely understood but seem to involve a remapping of some of the calld default networks in some of the networks that are involved in kind of understanding of your own internal state the stuff gets a lobit complicate were in a return to this and t upcoming episode of the hubren lapocast but there are indeed legitimate changes in neral circuitory caused by clinical hypnosis that can at least partially explain why it is effective in helping treat or allow people to stop smoking and vaping for those of you out there that either here or are saying yourselves i just cannot seem to quit smoking or vaping or dipping or snuffing hopefully and understanding of ho ll that homio stat this process works and the time course of nicotine depending on the delivery device hopeully understanding that will allow you to develop a protocal maybe involves hypnosis maybe it involves just understanding that the typical times in which you ingested nicotine through any of the different approaches of bringing it into your system iare going to be particularly hard but i do not just mean particularly hard mean particularly hard an you are going to need to do something specific to offset that decrease in over all autonomic aralsal and dopomine et cetera hopefully and understanding of that will allow youe to get through that first week and if you can make it pass that first week you stand a very good chance of never going back however i did consult with doctor davidspeagle and anticipation of this episode regardless of the method that you used to quit smoking or vaping snuffing or dipping there is good evidence that a routine maybe once a month or even once a week hypnosis type approach to replenish or even enhance the norral circuits that are allowing you to stay away from nicotine is can be a very good idea and given that it is a purely behavioural intervention i can see no reason as to why people would not want to do that going and reinforce you tighten the bolts on that circuitory that are allowing you to not feel the impulse to smoke not feel the impulse tovape and just a very brief mention there is a vast literature on the fact that when people have quit smoking or vaping or other form of consuming nicotine that when they can sume alcoholl there is a much higher probability relapse their interactions betwe now call in nicotine that will cover in future episodes but for those of you that want to quit i want to assure you despite the fact that niny five percent of people fail with the appropriate tools and i to think with an additional understanding of the underlying biology and psychology and what you can expect and when to really dig your heels and when to reenforce your system with more dopomine through any of the number of the different protocals and tools that we have offered here an you can find elsewhere and other episode to te hubrmnla podcast i have high degree of confidence that you can quit smoking or vaping dipping or snuffin to day typical of frankly all episodes of the huverman lapotcast we covered a lot about the biology of a particular system we talked about the biology of nicotine in particular we talked about vaping and smoking dipping and snuffing and the negative health consequenceis associate with those i whent i re emphasize that nicotine is not what cause is cancer it is the delivery device that causes cancer and the other negative health effects that is not to say that people should we in jesting nicotine through any diferent methods simply to get at cognive boose there are certain cercumstances where that might be appropriate you will for the occasional work about certainly not for physical exercise i'm giveng what we talked about earlier but of course there are more and more approaches to increasing not just nicotine but a seato colling generally in order to achieve cognim en hancemen or physical enhancement rushes a physical performance enhancement some of those we talked about earlier such as alphag p c in any event nicotine it should now be clear is an immensely powerful substance one of the most commonly injusted substances on the face of the earth and has been for a very long time ad now that you understand the underlying biology and the way in which is changes your psychology and physiology that should come as no surprise if you are learning

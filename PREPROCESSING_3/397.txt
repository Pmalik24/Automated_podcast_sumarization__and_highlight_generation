welcome to the hubermen lapon cans ca science scince tace to s for li i may drehubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicin to day we are discussing kaffine kaffine is one of the most widely use substances on the planet estimates are that more than ninety per cent of adults and as many is fifty per cent of kids that is adolescence and teen agers use kaffine on a daily basis kaffine is an amazing molecule most people are familiar with kaffine's ability to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue and indeed it does that but what most people are not aware of is that kaffine acts as a strong reinforcer what i mean by reinforcer is that when kaffine is present in a drink or food and yess indeed kaffine is present in many foods even unbenots to us when it is present in drinks in foods we actively come to those foods and drinks more than if kaffne were not contained in those foods and drinks it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks and indeed it even reinforces our liking of the containers they are consumed from and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks that contain kaffine that is kaffine is notjust a stimulant kaffine is a reinforcer and it is a reinforce are that place an active role in almost everybody's daily life we can say that wi confidence because as i mention a moment ago more than ninety percent of people are consuming kaffine and most people think that they consume kaffine because it makes them feel more alert but there are many reasons why you are consuming kaffine and i'm not going to tell you that consuming kaffine is necessarily bad in fact to day i'm going to tell you about many of the positive health benefits of kaffine including neura protective effects ant i depressive effects and certainly performance inhancing effects both for mental performance and for fphysical performance now that said there are certain situations in which you want to avoid kaffine and there are certain people who might opt to avoid kaffine that is especially the case when one thinks about kaffine not jus as a stimulant but as a reinforcer in fact kaffine is such a strong reenforcer that if even tiny amounts of kaffine are present in certain foods and drinks you will very quickly come to prefer those foods in drinks over other choices which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what sorts of food and drink choices your trying to make to day i'm going to inform you about how kaffine works at a mechanistic level i promise to do that with a minimumuf nomin clature in such that even if you do not have a background in biology you will be able to digest that information easily and then i'll tell you how to use kaffine to your advantage or conversely how to avoid kaffine at certain times to your advantage todays episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools that is the use and leverage of kaffine to improve mental health physical health and performance before w go any further into o days discussion i want to tell youabout some recent results about a molecule that is found in certain cafinated beverages and that has been proving to be very useful for both weight loss mental performance and controlling blood sugar levels and that is g l p one or glucogon peptie one glucugon peptide one is found in the brain and body it acts both on the brain and body it does many different things but one of its primary effects its been discovered is to reduce hunger and it does that two ways it does that by activating certain nurons in your hypofalmus that isthe brain region that controls hunger and satiety it makes us feel full at the level of the brain it makes us feel sated that is and it actually makes us feel full turns out that g l p one acts on certain receptors in the gut to make us feel as if we have ingested enough food t does not nesserely make us feel as if oure gut is distended but it makes us feel full that is really interesting because if you think about it when we eat our stomach fills up obviously and that information has to be communicated to the brain such that the brain can then send satidy signals that actually shut off our hunger and believe are not the brain actually activates signals to reduce the desire to che when our stomach is full an g l p one as i mention works on the brain to create these feelings of satiety as if we have had enough and to reduce our desire to eat more and g l p one acts directly on the got to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut which then is communicate to the brain really there are two parallel signals being sent when we have g l p one present in our system a little bit of relevant history on g l p on who was actually discovered in heela monsters these are these a reptils that can go long periods of time without eating and a very clever scientists acide to study why it is that certain animals heelamonsters can go along period of time without ingesting anything it is because they produce very large amounts of g l p one they isolate the peptipe from g l p one than they looked for the analogous peptide in humans and it turns out that does exist and as i mention it is released in both brain and body to make you feel full and sated why am i telling you all this well today we are going to talk about kafine and there is one particular kafiing source which is er bamate and there some other forms of ts similar to erbamate that stimulate the release of g l p one significantly there are also nowadays drugs which are called analogues of g l p one these are drugs that mimic or are identical to the kind of g l p one that you would make and those drugs are proving to be very effective for the treatment of certain forms of diabetis and for the treatment of obcity but they trigger enormous amounts of g l p one pathway activation those are extreme cases for people that are really struggling for weight los but the clinical trials and the data that are out there in the general population ow are very very promising for g l p one analogues er bamate t provided it is not the smoked variety and i mention that because a number of people have cued me to the fact that erbamate ts come in s moked varieties and non smoke varieties in the smoked varieties are thought to perhaps be carsonagenic that is procancer causing i advise people to avoid smoked varieties of yeur bomate t but yerbomate ts are known to stimulate significant amounts of g o p one release and they can be effective as a weight lost to mainly by blunting appetite and again they do that both at the level of the brain and at the level of the gut now all of what i just told you as been known for some period of time but there are new set of findings that were just published in sell reports medicine sell press jornal excellent journal which indicate exactly how it is that g p one stimulates both cetiedy end cantrigger additional weight loss through other mechanisms and i find the mechanism to be really interesting and actually really important given some other topics we have covered on this pod casts before the basic finding is that g p one whether not its stimulated through the release of a analogue drug that one is prescribed or by drinking your bamate t for instance and stimulate release of your own called indogenist geo p one yes it makes you feel more full at the level of brain and body but it turns out it also stimulates thermogenisis nothermogenisis is the active utilization of more metabolic energy and fat cells in particular called bage and brown fat cells are a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body the basic background is that you have white atapostcells white fat cells you have bage fat cells and your brown fat cells in the bage and brown ones are fatcells that you actually want more of they are not abundant under your skin there abundant really round your clavicals in your upper neck they are the ones that generate heat and the bage and brownness of them is actually the consequence of having a lot of mita condria in those cells when g p one is elevated in your system it turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells and helps convert them into bage and brown fat cells that is it takes fat cells that are not doing anything useful for you except being stored energy and i think most people out there would to have fewer of those white atapost cells theyare few of you out there that as shall need more of them that are too thin too lean but most people are suffering from having too many of these white atapost cells well when you ingest your bomate t or you were to take a g p one antalogue or stimulate g p one in any number of different ways yes you stimulate increase ta tity but youre also stimulating the conversion of these white fat cells into bage and brown fat cells which makes you more thermogenic and over time rases your bazil metabolic rate you are burning more callories even at rest it also makes you feel as if you are more comfortable and colder environments at rest this is very much the same as the mechanism that is induced when you were to say take a coled chower or do regular ice bats are get into coled water regularly that too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells to bage and brown fat cell ls i these findings very much because they provide a mechonistic coherente they provide that is a really nice story as to how something g o p one could be effective for weight loss yes on the one hand g p one is reducing appetite and that of course will help people maintain or lose weight but it is also increasing basil metabolic rate and we now know how that is accomplish its likely accomplish at least through this one mechanism by the stimulation of conversion of these wight fat cells which do not do much for us at set at as energy storage units to these metabolically metacondrol rich bage and brown fat cells which you can thnk of a sort of the oil in the candle that allows your furnace your metabolism to burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate that is the mechanism and the basic tool take away is that if you are somebody whose interested in losing weight and you want to leverage the g o p one pathway drinking a cup or two of erbomate t early in the day would be a great weight to stimulait g p one release there are other ways to stimulate go p one release you can get it through certain forms of exercise in particular fastat exercises is actuly a vote in favor of fastat exercise there is a debate as to whether not fasted cardio burns more fat than nonfastic cardio in the the data basically say no it does not really matter but that does not really take into account the longer arc of things go p one release that needs to be taken into considerations ho could do fasted cardio you could drink eurbomate t keeping im on the erbomate t does contain afine will talk more about the specific forms of stimulants includen cafine that mate has butmate would be a a great weigh to stimulate go p one release and then of course for those of you that are interested in more robust activation of g o p one then perhaps you might want to consider some of the new prescription g o p one analogues that are out there but that is a more severe a stimulus for go p one of course and for everybody regardless of whether not your chinof lose weight gainweight or maintain weight think we are going to be hearing a lot more about g o p one antalogues and drinks and supplements one things o that sort that stimulate g o p one in the very near future because it does appear to be a very important bialogical mechanism before we begin i'd to emphasise that this podcast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and scine related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of today's potcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the alled electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dhidration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to l ectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that one gram of sodium two under miligrams of potafsium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolites and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lok if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elementy dokcom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pafck with your purchase again that is drink element elemementy dokcom slash hubermen let us talk about kaffine si mentioned earlier kaffine is consumed by basically most all adults every single day and consumed at very regular times each day in fact if you were to take a look at your kaffine in take or the kaffine in take of somebody close to you what you would realize is that they are do not do well if their kaffine in take arrives even ten twenty or thirty minutes past ther expected or usual in take of kaffing that is pretty remarkable and it brings to mind ideas that we are all quotinc addicted to kaffine or that kaffine is somehow bad i'm certainly not going to make the argument that kaffine is bad first of all i may regular kaffine user i would not call myself a kaffine abuser but i am i regular kaffine user and kaffine is known to have certain health benefits i listed off a few of them earlier but i'll mention those again now before going forward kaffine is known to have certain ner protective effects and that is because of its ability to increase neramodulator such as dopamine but also other call katicolomines nor up ineffrin if you do not know what those names mean these are molecules that increase levels of alertness motivation and drive and then therefore not surprisingly the large skale analysies of the relationship between depression in kaffine shows that provided people are not drinking much kaffine that it makes them overly anxious that regular in take of kaffine is inversely related to levels of depression it may have some anti depress in effects and those could be direct or indirect what o i mean by that well you could imagine that people are in jestin kaffine and they are more motivated to do work and pursue quality social interactions then the probably that they will have depression could be lower it could also be that there are direct effects on the khemical systems of the brain that relate to mood and well being that could offset depression it is not clear whether or not the effects of kaffine in kountering depression are direct or indirect none the less there is a relationship there and it is an interesting and positive one or i should say negative correlation positive a effect over all on mood and well being to be exact now it is also the case that kaffine can improve mental performance and physical performance this has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies i will review a few studies on this in particular to day but jo just give you a sense of how kaffine works at the level of it is timing and impact on mental performance and physical performance when we inge s kaffine provided that we do not have a lot of food in our stomach and that our bloodshuger is not particularly high generally we experience and increase in alertness within about five minutes and that increase in focus in alertness peaks around thirty minutes after ingestion of kaffine and persists for as long as sixty minutes now this is assuming that one takes kaffine in pill form or drinks the entire kaffin drink within a short period of time but a litlbit later i'll talk about how you can consume kaffine at regular intervals while doing mental work or physical work in a way that can further increase mental performance and physical performance but let us just touch on what kaffin an take really does for mental performance an physical performance perhaps the most robust finding across all of the studies that ihave examined is that kaffine reduces our reaction time that is it improves our reaction time it doesnit make it longer it makes it shorter for instance in a laboratory study where people were asked to a hi a lever every time they here a tone you can greatly reduce the time between the tone and the pressing of the lever if people injest kaffine about thirty minutes be for they do that task now that seems a trivial task but this is also seen in the domain of sports performance and even in kognive performance where people have to arrive at a particular answer to a question and the answer to that question has to be pulled from their memory banks within the brain there hippocampus for instance a brainstructure volved in memory and if you are asking people for instance to remember the kapitals of different states or cities or to remember certain historical facts they will do that at a particular rate but if they have injested kaffine within the hour prior their ability to recall that information is much much better they are fast er end it does not appear that accuracy is reduce in fact in many cases accuracy is in hance and that is because kaffin both works on the reaction time systems of the brain and body i'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit but it also stimulate certain nuro transmitters and called neuromodulators within the brain and body that give the neural circuits in the brain that are associate with learning and memory a lower threshold to activation what does that mean that means that we are better able to access the brain circuitry involved in learning an memory when we have a certain amount of kaffin circulating in our system this makes kafine and incredible performance enhancing compound and i could give you tens of thousands of examples of this in humans but before i do that i want to just touch on what we know about the existence of kaffine in nature and what the existence of kaffine in nature and its effects on other animals tells us about what kaffine does in humanse because as i alluded to earlier what kaffine is doing for us is not just making us more alert improving our memory improving our reaction time and on it is actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience and it is acting is not just a powerful reinforcer of the kaffine contai ining drink that we drank but also the mug that it is contained in plus the person that we might be sitting across from when we consume that kaffin and on and forth if it is a litte bit hard feu conceptiralize what a reinforcer is and why 'm calling it a reinforcer let me spell it out in three specific ways we often hear about the word reward and we think o ke if we do certain things and we the outcome thand those certain things are rewarded right if we are doing something we receive praise the praises a reward and therefore we are more likely to do that thing in the future ak a lot of parenting is that and a lot of lifeas that however when we hear the word reward we often think about something that feels good to us and certainly if we have worked hard and we get some praise that is natural for the praise to feel good to us or for instance if we awe work very hard and we get a certain outcome a tropy a financial outcome a degree outcome recognition et cetera all of those connact as rewards but those are all conscious rewards we are aware that they are happening reenforcers are little but different because the word reinforcement can apply to conscious rewards of the sort that i just described but thereare also many ways in which kaffines stimulates the release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers but those reinforcers are subconscious that is we are not aware that they cause this preference for the activities that cause their release the study em about to describe beautifully i believe in kapsulates how is it that humans came to consume kaffine and why kaffine exists in nature and the powerful effects of kaffin as a reinforcing agent both in animals insects and in you an me and the title of the paper is kaffine and floral nector enhance as a polinaters memory of reward keep in mind that kaffine is made from plants we say dug but i think some of us do not realize that the reason why there is kaffin and coffee as because coffee comes from plant is a coffee bein certainteas which of course are plants people brew kaffine is contained in those tees such as ye are bomante well why would this bitter substance because in fact kaffin is quite bitter in high concentrations fi with his bitter substance be something that insects or animals would want to consume at all turns out that in most plants kaffin is present in small enough quantities that insects and other animals and in fact we cannot actually taste the kaffin if i were to give you a little bit of pure kaffine yes it would be a stimulant for you but you would say that it tasted awful it is in a kategory of compounds that would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors on your tomgue and would make you cringe and pucker and essentilly walk away from whatever it is that contain that kaffine and from the experience that contain that kaffine well in nature kaffine is present in very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors within flowers beans and plants and what this paper really points to is that kaffine in nature is acting as a reenforcer for bees that are consuming different nectar the way that it works is that bees of cource go from flour to flour and they are consuming the nectar they are bringing nectar and paulan back to the hive and that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony the bees are foraging in a way that includes information about color ind particular ultra violet color things that we cannot see but they can see cause they diferent photoreceptors than we do what the study shows is that plants and nectars that containe very small amounts of kaffine are the preferred sources of food for bees and the study is beautiful because they were able to confirm that they could mask the kaffine taste its they know that the bees are not preferring the taste of kaffine but what they do is they pair kaffine with different fruit sources for the bees than they remove the kaffine and wht they find is that the bees very strongly prefer flavors that contain kaffine not because they could taste the kaffine but rather for the way that those kaffine containing flavors made the bees feel how do those kaffin containing flavors make the bees feel the same way that they make you and i feel a little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work for the bee the more work is the and sumption of more food which then has a further reenforcing effact s what really talking about here is the faft that e kaffine exists in nature in plants it exists in concentrations that are very low low in fact that they are not detectable to the tastes receptors of insects and in many cases to the taste receptors of humans and of course there can be high levels of kaffine in a plant but if the plant also contains compounds that mask the flavor of kaffine well then those plants are going to essentially be even stronger reenforcers for the flavor of the plant kaskes an ouer talking about strong flavors pluss strong nurow stimulant effects of kaffine and the most important point here is that all of these effects of kafine are subconscious it is not because the bee or yeu likes the taste of kaffin in fact most people when they take their first sip of coffe they find that taste bitter and kind of noxious they do not it you may not even remember that because it happen long ago and because kaffine is such a strong reenforceare that very quickly you come to the taste of coffi you might even come to the feeling of your mug in your hand you might even come to the smell of koffi and on and forth and that is because kaffine stimulates the release of certain narow khemicals in the brain in particular dopamine and asental coa ling two neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness in our feelings a well being libit later i'll tell you that kafine stimulates the release of dopeming in a way that is very much distinct from the classical dopeming pathway associated with addiction and reward in fact we can think of kaffing as having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems i'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going kaffine stimulates the release of dopeming and asseeto coling not within the classic called meso lymbic reward pathway that sus fancy nurde speak for the reward pathways o the brain ther associate with things sex and food and drugs of abuse cocana mat them fedemine but rather kaffine seems distimulate the release of dopemine in the parts of the brain that are associated with alertness and cognition meaning the forebrain this is very important wee multible dopeming systems in the brain and body and kaffine seems to stimulate dopeming directly within the components of the brain that are associated with clarity of thought and well being but more clarity of thought now i'm also talking about kaffine as a strong rean forser in that it makes you feel good over all and it does and that suggests that it also paths into the more classic reward pathway but it does that in a very interesting and of frankly almost diabolical way when we regularly in just kaffine it stimulates the increase in dopeming recepters at multible sigts throughout the brain but in particular within the reward pathways of the brain not the arreas of the brin their associated with focus and clarity of thought and cognition it does that but it is also increasing the level of dopeming recepters in the reward pathway and what that means is that for any dopeming that is released in response to a posive experience social experience or any number of the other things that can stimulate dopeming release there r more receptors more parking spots if you will for that dopemine to arrive at and to exert its increases in mood increases in motivation and over all feelings of drive and excitement there four ways the kaffine works that we need to understand first of all kaffine acts as a reenforcing agent it increases the probability that you will return to and engage in a certain activity or consume a certain beverage or food second of all kaffine increases dopemine enasito coling which are both nermodulators in the forebrain which helps us improve our ability to think to modify our rule sets that is to adjust our strategies for different social situations and mental demands and physical demands and third it increases the number and efficacy of dopeming recepters in the reward pathways of the brain that is it makes things that would feel pretty good feel even better and forth kaffine actes at an antagonist to a denasine which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel from the accumulation of a denasine th t occurs as we are wake for mre and more hours throughout the day let us talk first about kaffin as a reenforcing agent againd soas first most beautifully demonstrated in the study on honey bees where the bees prefer nectors that contain kaffine and that all makes perfect sense in terms of the acology of bees and flowers that contain nector ah there is an advantage leasent terms of adaptatchen that the flouer benefits because of distribution of things from the flour which is good for the the flowers and the bees benefit because they are getting food and there is a kind of a symbiosis there but with humans we were consuming kaffin containing beverages for our sake i i do not think we have it in mind nor do the bees have in in mind frankly that we are trying to preserve the plants that provide the kaffine i think we would all i'm suffer werishes a ninety percent of adults would suffer greatly if all the kaffineg containing a coffee an tea plants were gone certainly but most of us are not consuming coffees and teas and kaffneg containing foods because we are thinking about the plants thay come from and we want to help those plants were thing about how we want to help ourselves and yet the point of the reinforcing effects of kaffine are that they are largely subconscious we are not a ware of them now you might say no that is not true when i drink kaffine it makes me feel really good i am aware that it makes me feel good in orer to illustrate how reinforcement really works let me give you the counter example which would be an aversive agentso we have reenforcing agents and we have aversiv agents let us say that there were compounds in nature that exist in plants that are raversive and indeed they are and lets say that these compounds we are present at such low concentrations that you could not taste them let' say you wake up in the morning and you go to your for gerator and you open it up and you are thirsty unso you reach for a nice a rich red containing beverage in a glass jar it looks a cranberry juce ore somethng that sort or even a nice clear glass of water it looks a jug of water glass water and you drink that tase find you maybe ven tastes great to you then let us say about thirty minutes later you feel old queesy you feel oll off feelyt going back to sleep you just do not feel very good you do not know why but you are nervous system is a predictive machine and it has a process in which it back intogrates ar ch ey integrates backwards into your immediate experience that preceeded that not good feeling we can reliably say that there is a much lower probability that the next day when you wake up that you would reach for tht same beverage or for that same container even and maybe if you are in a novel environment may be your staying in an arbean bee or hotel or something that sort you might even find that you do not really the kitchen in which you consume that beverage in the first place dad you do not know why and unles you got very very sick that the day befort it is unlikely that you would have such a strong response that you would entirely avoid for instance water or glass jars can taining liquids et cetera let say you went back to the refragurator and you consume beverage again and you just did not feel while you felt less good than you normally would well even without any ability to taste what is in that beverage and even without any understanding of what was happening to you at a conscious level there is a very very high probability that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage and certainly at that location and in the same volume in the subsequent days that is just the way that aversof agents work and they work by way of activating nurns in the gut that communicate with areas in the brain that give us this feeling of queeziness and for some of you hearing this that pathway and that association with times in which you felt queezy and as if you want to vomit is powerful that you might even be feeling some of that symptomology now for certain people that is going to be increase salivation which precedes vomiting we know that there is a class of nurons in the brain relate to anarea called ery postrema that actually stimulates vomiting and if i keep talking about this i'll probably frt i want a vomit somen to move on from this in a moment when we injust kaffine containing beverages and foods it is the exact opposite cenareas to what i just described kaffine as a rein forsir makes us feel slightly better or a lot better in the immediate minutes an hours after we injast it it is acting as a reinforcing agent not just while you are under the effects of kaffine but for the things that preceded the ingestion of kaffne which is why you return again and again to kaffine containing beverages such as coffee and tea or maybe even foods that contain kaffine even if the taste of those foods is not something that you would otherwise consider especially delicious in fact most people when they take ther first sip of coffee or tea or other kaffine containing beverage they find to be very bitter and that is not because of the taste of kaffine it is because of the taste of the beverage itself independent of kaffin however when kaffine is present ind there they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes in fact they will as i mention early er will invest a lot of financial resources and time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage what they are trying to make sure is not that they get that taste but that they get the kaffine it is that positively reinforcing and the taste therefore takes on new significance new meaning and we come to associate it as positive and infact most of us including myself love the taste of aspressor love the taste of coffee love the taste of your bamate even if the initial taste the very first time that we consume that beverage was either neutral or negative and that is all because of the reinforcing properties of kaffine and then of course there are the more direct actions of kaffine that is the faster actions of kaffine and just o list thos off again very briefly thatyou have them in mind going forward kaffine also increase is the release of dopamin and aseeto coling both which are naromodulators in the forebrain which increases clarity of thought and your ability to rule switch your ability to move from one contacts to another and change and understand the rules of engagement social engagement physical engagement mental engagement and forth and as i mention before kaffine also increases the number of dopening receptors in the reward pathway such that any good thing that happens to you any positive experience that you have we will have a more potent effact on your feelings of well being and last but certainly not least kaffine actsas and a denisine antagonist it reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue and your desire to sleep by parking in the receptors for a denisine and not allowing a denizine to have its pro sleepy if you will affects on your brain and body i'd to take a quick break and a knowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic grens now called a g one is a vitemin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional neens i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve m delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast thereasn i starty taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important ats populated by gup microbioda that communicate with the brain the mun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics anathleti greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste cripe if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athltic green stock calm slash huberman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plane et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d three k too againd that is athletic green sdock cam slash huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o vitemend three kay to id to just briefly talk about a denisine and some of its malecular features and again if you do not have a backround in biology do not worry i promise to make this very clear to everyone first of all kaffine is what is called a methal zanthine it is an it is a plant alkaloid that is why kaffine itself is very bitter yend if i were to give you just the tiniest little bit of pure kaffine you would find it to be extremely aversive i sai these plants that have snuck small enough amounts of kaffine into them or that ave masse the flavor of kaffine with other flavors such that bees and humans want to consume them a while we do not know what plants think a it does seem very diabolical and very clever in that we are seeking out these kaffine containing a plants beverages and foods even though kaffine itself is this alkaloid is very very bitter methels ansine that is kaffine binds to a denisine receptors and there really two types of a denisine receptors theyre these called a one receptors an the a two receptors and theire present differen parts of the brain and body at different levels we do not have to get to far into receptor sebtypes more importantly to understand is that a denisine makes us feel tired because of the way that it taps in to the e t p pathway the eight t be pathway is central to energy production and feelings of overall energy in our brain and body in all sells an organ systems when kaffine binds to a denisine receptors it prevents a denisine from breaking down certain components of the energy production pathway and the net consequence of that is increase cyclic am pe basically when we injest kaffine we are biasing our system towards the pro energetic aspects of these celler pathways now it is really important understand that in biology even if you block a recepter or you prevent the activity of anenzim and at least in this case you end up with more cyclic ampe more energy you are not really getting more energy you are actually borrowing energy against an overall system that is frankly non negotiable what do i mean by that well let' say that you were to wake up after six or eight hours of sleep and to drink a lot of kaffine and keep drinking kaffinethroughout the day throughout the day blocking those a deniine receptors yes you will offset fatigue you will offset sleepiness because that a deniine simply camp function but at the point where the kaffine becomes dislodged from the denisine receptors you will have a massive glut a back logue of a denisine and you will feel extra extra sleepy really there is no way to create more energy in your system really what you are doing is you'r changing the timing in which the sleepy signals and the more energetic signals are arriving and this is's really important understand as as the backdrop to the various tools that were going to get into next in which you can use kaffine for enhansing mental performance and physical performance and other aspects of health but it is very importan to understand this concept that when you wake up in the morning provided that you slept well and enough the night before you are levels of a denisine will be about as low as they will ever be ashi in order to get your a denisine levels really bottomed out you want to avoid kaffine and the first ninety to hundred twenty minuts after waking will talk about why that is because it turns out there is a way to completely clear a denisine out of your system in the hour or after waken but for most people a denisine levels are ging to be close to their lowest after a good night sleep but there is really no negotiating the accumulation of a denisine it is going to occur and going to biase towards feeling more sleepy than you would otherwise that is can occur throughout the day there is rally no way to eliminatead denisine all you can really do is block its func tion it sor borrowing energy against the fatigue that you will inevitably feel now this actily has very important socio economical relevants before kaffine was regularly consumed by human beings we were really slaves to the light dark cycle n this was especially true before the presence of artificial lighting but even before the advent of artificial lighting humans were largely constraine to the outside light dark cycle we need to be active during the day and working during the day and we need to be a sleep at night kaffine allows us to divorce ourselves from that circadean cycle circatean just means about twenty four hour kaffine allows us to do that at least somewhat by way of increasing our alertnes that is spiking our alertness at various times throughout the day and even at night this is how we can have shift workers for instance that can sleep during the day and the drink a strong cup of coffee at eight p m and then work into the night that ability completely transformed our society of course the healthiest schedul we know this with certainty the healthiest schedule for brain and body is going to be to be alert during the daytime and asleep at night there is no question about that shift workers run into all sorts of health problems and thank you shift workers for doing the important work that you do we need you a airtraffic controllers paramatics firefighters police officers et cetera but we know that there are serious health consequences negative ealth consequences that is for shift workers but for most people out there about nine five per cent of people follow a typical schedul o their wake during the day and a sleep at night and yet it used to be before the advent of caffine containing beverages that if you ware sleepy in the afternoon you either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness that youre activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms were governed by these circadian changes in s availability of sunlight and when you slept and you justoft have the ability to injest a beverage that would increase youre levels of alertness because you block at denisine this is important understand that nowadays we certainly live in a time in which we use in fact ninety per centor more of adultan half or more of adolescence and teenators use kaffine as a way to negotiate with to borrow against this natural pattern of a denisine making a sleepy but again you are just offsetting the effects of sleepiness the denisine causes you cannot eliminate the adeniine entirely the important point is that a denisine as a pro sleepy molecule is a non negotiable aspect of your biology in fact it is non negotiable that every twenty four hours you are going to release a denisine and you are going to release the denisine in direct proportion to how long you have been awake the long you been awake the more denisine circulating your system thereare really only a handful of ways to completely clear out a denisine the major one being to get sleep the other is to take a short nap which of course is sleep but its shallow sleep or non sleep deep rest called anes yy are has been shown to reduce levels of a denissine and there are certain things such as viewing morning sunlight which because of its effects on cortes all can quote and quote clearout a denisine will talk about this in more detail in a fuminutes and there is also evidence that certain forms of exercise provided that it is brief and in tents can also reduce a denisine nocious block its effects now that we talk about some of the incredible mechanisms by which kaffine changes our experience of life increases alertness and mood et cetera i want to talk about the use of kaffine as a tool now kaffine is a very potent and useful tool for enhancing mental health physical health and performance but there are certain considerations one has to keep in mind in particular dose now first off not everybody will respond to the same dose of affin the same way but we can reliably say that your body weight is a good measure by which you can estimaight what a healthy useful dose of affine would be for most people injesting one to three miligrams of kaffine per kiligram of body weight is going to be the range in which kaffine can have positive offacts without making us feel overly anxious and give us that feeling that and we are jumping out of our skin and turn the otherwise positive experience of kaffine into an aversive one for those we that are not familiar with thinking in terms of kiligrams and normally thinkin pounds i'll just quickly give you some general estimations that for instance one hundred kiligrams equals two hundred and twenty pounds for me i weig a hundred kiligrams that means that one to three miligrams again miligrams thousandth lof ogram one to three miligrams of kaffine per kileigram of bodiweight would mean for me i could safely injest one hundred to three hundred miligrams of kaffine in a single dose in a single drank if that is the way i'm consuming it or pilform if that is the way that i'm consuming ite and it is very likely that that will be a tolerable dose however if you are not somebody that is a kastom to drinking kaffine on a regular basis i suggest you start on the lower end of that one to three miligrams per kilegram of body weight range for instance if you are somebody who weighs fifty kiligrams that is approximately a hundred and ten pounds and you would be pretty comfortable in jesting somewhere between fifty and a hundred and fifty miligrams of kaffine what i recommend is that people who are considering using kaffine as a tool or who are already in jesting kaffine start to think about the dosage of kaffine that you are injesting or plan to in jest and the timing in which you in jest that kaffine relative to certain tasks throughout your day your weaking and your sleep and will talk about that in just a moment but the first step for you is to figure out how much you weigh in kiligrams and then to go to that number of one to three miligrams of kaf fine per kelegram of body weight and that is a good arange in which you might want to explore the use of kaffine in a single application meaning a single dose now i do realize that some people out there are drinking coffee all day long or having coffeein the morning and en again in the afternoon what a'm referring to here is the injestion of kaffne in a single bout right one cop of coffee or two cups of coffi for instance to achieve that one hundred to three hundred ilegram range if that is what is appropriate for your body weight but to avoid any confusion when i talk about dosage of kaffine what i'm really talking about is not the total amount of kaffine injested per day i'm talking about the total amount of kaffine injested in one sitting or setting that is and if you are somebody who is drinking kaffin multiple times throughout the day you can imagine for instance lessay the appropriate dose for you in order to get in enhancement in mental performance or physical per formance is two hundred milegrams and you are somebody who is doing some work in the morning and you want to have that lift in the morning to be able to focus better and you are doing some physical exercise in the afternoon or vice versa that you would injest two hundred melegrams of kaffin at two separate times per day separated by about four hours now you do not have to separate them you could of you could put them two hours apart for instance but we will talk about half life of kafine and forth just keep in mind that if you are injesting two hundred melegrams of kaffin and that is the appropriate dose for you based on your body weight and then you are injesting another two hundred melegrams of kaffin an hour later you are effectively in jesting a proximately four undred milegrams of kaffin which is going to start exceeding the dose in which you can normally tolerate without feeling anxious in gittery with all of that said there is a range of tolerance for affin that is based on two things one is a pre existing disposition that is whether not you are genetics and nervous system and the backdrop of your life how much stress youre experiencing tends to make you feel more anxious and alert in gittery before you injest any kaffine and the other is how called kaffine adapted you are we often here about tolerance tolerance mean something very specific it is the ability to injest more and more of something with a plateau that is a noning no increase or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing but here were not really talking about tolerance to kaffine what we are talking about is being kaffine adapted a simple way to understand whether not your kaffine adapted or not is that if you drink kaffine and it tends to increase your heart rate and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious the chances are you are not kaffine adapted provided the amount of kaffine is within the healthy range for you that is the ranges we talked about a moment ago however youare somebody who drinks kaffine and you affis feel alert and relaxed chances are you are kaffine adapted and at various times during to day's episode i'll talk about people are kaffine adapted and people who are not kaffine adapted we will talk about the use of kaffin every other day ikno for you habitual kaffin drinkers including myself just the simple mention of that probably sounds o versive om but there is actully great utility to using kaffine every other day as opposed to every day but just keep in mind that some peoplewill dink kaffine and not get much of a lift from it at all other people will drink kaffine and they will feel extremely anxious even at dosages far lower than that one to three miligrams per kilegram of body weight range that i described a moment ago you have to take into a kount individual differences that said one to three miligrams of kafin per kilegram af body weight for a given sitting for your morning coffee or your or your morning your bremate tee is a good arrange from which to start and i do encourage you to go on line and look up the various beverages and foods that you might be eating that contain kaffine for instance some people are surprised to discover that the coffee that they get from some of the more standard poffular venders out there the small coffee or the mediam coffee for instance con contain as much as four hundred to six hundred miligrams of kaffine and the large coffi that is often soldet those commercial vendors can contain as much as one gram one thousand miligrams of kaffin now you may be adapted to that such that it does not make you feel anxious but if you wonder why you feel irritable and you get a headache when you do not get that kaffine or that amount of kaffine at precisely the time that your used to getting it each day that is because you are consuming quite large quantities of kaffine on a regular basis i do recommend whether not you drink soda coffee ar tea that you figure out the source of that o kass of figure out what vender you purchase it from what kind of coffei and go on line and spend a libit of time because the information is out there to discover what levels of kaffin you are actually in jafting now if you happen to be injesting more than one to three miligrams per kilegram af bodyweiht of kaffne that is not necessarily bad however you do wone to be careful about in jesting very high levels of kaffine over long periods of time in your life because there can be issues that start torise and particular a bias towards higher levels of anxiety and depleetion of certain electrolihts because kaffine is a diaretic can causi lusodium andother another things to that sort and also just from simply a dependent standpoint it does appear that if you injest high levels of kaffine that is exceeding the dosages that normally you could get away with him get just as much mental enhancing and physical end hancing benefits that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature you can buise yourself towards headaches anxiety attacks and you can become actually quite irritable when you are not getting those higher levels of kaffine i do encourage you to figure out not just what an appropriate kaffine dosage would be for you but also how much affine you might already be injesting the first tool i to talk about is one that i've mentioned before on this podkast several times and it is something that if you have not heard of will be ver ry useful to you and if you have heard this tooll be for i'm going to add some additional features to the description of this tool that should make this worth while for you as well and that is to delay your kaffine in take to ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking up on most days and i'll be very clear as to days in which you might want to injest kaffing more closely to when you wake up why would you want to delay your caffine and take to ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking the answer that is very simple many people wake up in the morning they drink kaffine within ten twenty thirty sometimes within to minutes of waking and they feel more alert nafturally tha make sense because of the effects of caffine in blocking th effects of a denizing tha i talked about earlier end its effects onother nurve transmitter systems but then what they find is that in the early afternoon in particular after lunch they experience a dramatic dip in their over all levels of energy the called afternoon crash and in most cases the way they respond to that is to in jest more kaffine which indeed can increase their levels of mood and alertness however as we will soon talk about there is a problem within jesting kaffine in the afternoon if it falls within eight or ten or dare i even say twelve hours of going to sleep and that is the kaffine in jested in the afternoon for most everybody it say for ninety five pluss percent of people disrupts the architecture and quality of their night time sleep and i should say that it does not necessarily in pafk o their ability to fall asleep and may be even sleep through the night but that the depth and quality of that sleep is destrupted by consuming affine in the afternoon a libit later i'll talk about how you can offset some of those negative effects if you absolutely require kaffine in the afternoon but there is a huge advantage to restricting your kaffine and take to the early part of your day but not consuming kaffine within the first ninety two a hundred and twenty minutes after waking in fact many people find that if they delay their kaffine in take to ninety two a hundred an twenty minutes after waking up that they feel more alert in the morning and they completely avoid that afternoon crash now that said many people including myself do need a short nap or non sleep deep rest or other form of relaxation for ten to thirty minutes in the afternoon that is natural and healthy i'm not referring to the need for that when i refer to the called afternoon crash ron time on the afternoon crash is a inability to recover energy and focus and a need to consume more kaffine just to make it through the afternoon by delan kaffine in take from to ninety two a hndred an tminutes after waking there are couple things that are accomplished first of all you offset that afternoon crash and this is an effect that many people experience the very first time they start to lag their cafine intake to ninety two a hundre twenty minutes after waking and the reason this work well as the following as i mentioned earlier a denizine ism molecule that builds up the longer that we are awake it is a molecule that is reduced or cleared from our system by sleep when we emerge from sleep regardless of how long we have slept our a denizine levels are lower than they were when we went to sleep the previous night if you slept well enough and long enough those a denizine levels can be very very low but they are never completely zero when you wake up in the morning even if you are one of these people that springs out of bed and is ready to attack the day and here i'm certainly not exidescribing myself i'm not not one of those people attend to wake fairly slowly but if you are one of those spring up an attack the day or your one of the people who moves more slowly into your day regardless there' still some recidual a denisene in your system and this is particularly the case if you did not get enough sleep or enough depth of sleep the night before that the correct ratioes of slow wave sleep in rapit eye movement sleep and for those of you interestin noptimizing sleep ile just refer you to are master your sleep episode of the hubermn labpocast the perfect our sleep episode the huberman labpodcast and we have a tool kip for sleep all of which are available zero cost time stamped et cetera at huberman labdot calm you wake up in the morning and your a denizine levels are low but there not zero and if you did not sleep that well or deeply enough the night before you are going to have more a denisine in your system you might think the logical thing to do is herefor to drink caffine and to block the adeniine that there but what happens if you do that is there is an accumulation a sort of glut of a denisine that hangs around and then in the afternoon when the effects of that caffine start to wear off you will experience the called afternoon crash as i mentioned earlier there is away to clear out the a denisine that is present when you wake up in the morning and to clear it out essentially completely without just blocking it is receptors and letting it accumulate or hang around and the wat to do that is to deliberately spike your cortis all now many of you have heard of cortisall is called stress hormon as a bad thing and indeed chronically elevated cortisall is a bad thing it deplets youremiun system it is bad for 'm cychlo social effacts it tends to make us feel anxious and on end on but cortisall itself is not bad cortisal is wonderful cortisall enhances the efficiency the imuan system it makes us alert and focus at stimulates our metabolism it does a huge number of positive things provided that it is released in a carcatiane fashion that is at the appropriate times every twenty four hours and that it tends to pik very close to waking fact oneof the reasons you wake up in the morning assuming that you ware not woken up by some noise or or sleeping an environment that is too warm et cetera is that your cartesal level start to rise and shortly after waking your cortisall level lls well start to reach their peak and when i refer to a cartisal pulse that is just biology nerved speak for a rise and peak in cartisal you want that qartisal pulse to occur early in the day close to waking and you want that for a couple of reasons first of all if you do not restrict that qartisa pulse to early in the day it will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day and actually a late shifted cartisal peak is want of the hulmarch signatures of depression low level depression and serious depression and it can start to distrup sleep and certainly can distrup mood metabolism and your imune system to you want that cartisal peak early in the day how do you insure that that happens well you wake up in the morning and whether not you oure a bounce out of bed type or youare more groggy you can a wade slowly into the daytype i am you wake up and you do not ingest caffine fine and in fact beneficial to hydrate with water and electrolights terrific in fact i would say necessary to get bright light in your eyes ideally from sunlight i've talked abou this many many times before on the podcast if you wake up before the sun comes out than turn on bright artificial lights but then certainly wants the sun is out and even on cloudy days in fact in especially on cloudyes get outside for anywhere from five to twenty maybeven thirty minutes do some work outside take your breakfast outside if your breakfast eater get something done outside even of it is just to get outside and get bright light in your eyes why well because it is been shown in studies on humans that getting bright light in your eyes in the first hour after waking or as soon as possible after waking increases the peak of that qartisal pulse by fifty per cent five zero and that cartisal pulse yes increases mood yes increases alertness but it does one other very important thing which is that through an indirect pathway it can clear out any residual a denisine that might be present in your system when you wake up in the morning again this is going to be especially important for those of you that are not getting as much sleep or as much quality sleep as you would it is going to be very important for you to get that morning bright light ideally from sunlight get that cartisal peak going other ways to increase that cuartisall peak would be to do some physical activity if you do not have time to do a full work out well then getting some movement you ten minutes of skipping rope or even five minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks or walking if that is all you have time for ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes but that is going to zero out the adenizine present in your system if however you were to wake up and immediately drink caffine caffine itself can stimulate the release of qartisal a little bit more than it would otherwise be present in your system but by blocking those a denisine recepters and because of the indirect effects of caffine on the cuartisall system you actually are reducing the clearance of a denisine that would otherwise occur i realize that is a mouthful just to be very clear if you wake up an you n jest kaffine right away you are blocking the a denissine receptore but you are not clearing it out you are also preventing cortis all from having its normal increase in rise such that it can directly clear out a denisine because cortis all can clear out a denisine and that is what you want you want to be at maximum alertness and focus in your morning and throughout your day and by delaying your kaffine to ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking you set up youre system that you get that morning cartis all peak adili a piqu that is even greater because you are getting your bright light viewing and thend when you in jest your affine ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking not only will you be craving it just a little bit but you will be drinking that kaffine on an already existing backdrop of increased alertness for two reasons one is a denisine is zerode out and your cortis all peak is higher and now when you in jest kaffine you can actually in jest levels of kaffine that a little more reasonable that almost with certainty are going to fall in this one to three milegrams per kilegram dosage and will allow you to feel really alert and will carry that alertness well in to the afternoon hours without the need to drink more kaffine and thereby will prevent you from drinking kaffine and destrupting your night time sleep and of course by getting better night time sleep you are going to zeer out your a denisine even more what i'm describing here are essentialy two tools i'm telling you to get morning sunlight and may be some exercising conjunction with that even if its brief exercise but the main tool of delaying kaffine ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes after waking has immediate effects but it also sets in motion a kascade or domino falls that lead to better sleep and more wakefulness than next night and the next day and on and forth now i realize there are some people who just simply cannot or will not delay their affined ninety to a hundred nd twenty minutes after waking for whatever reason first off let me say that if you are somebody who likes to wake up and do very in tens exercise within the first ninety minutes after waking will in that case it would be appropriate to in jest your kaffine just prior to doing that exercise not a problem not a prom but you should expect that the commination of drinking kaffine very shortly after waking plus exercising very intensely shortly after waking will increase the intensity of that early afternoon and afternoon fatigue that you feel now for some people that is a great thing thay can afford to take an ap or do non sleep deep rest step away from work and forth in that case i strongly encourage you to do whatever it is that allows you to get regular exercise because regular exercise is going to be very beneficial bat we did entire episode a call tooll ket for fitness that describes a couple of different but really one man structure that allows you to get thou appropriate amount of resistance training and cardyvassler training in flexibility training thoughout the week i happen to follow that program and it works very well and it does involve some of those work out to come very early in the morning shortly after waking and in those cases i do in jest kaffine just prior to those within of ten twenty minutes of waking however on other days i personally delay my kaffne and take ninety to a hundred twenty minutes and i've done that am to great benefit and most people if not all people bit try that have reported the same i should mention that some people wi'll find getting out to that ninety minutes to be excruciatingly difficult because there accustome to in jesting kaffine close to waking up in that case may be just push out your kaffne and take by about fifteen minutes each day until you hit that ninety to a hundred and twenty minute mark and that will make it much easier migh take you a week or to get there but once you get there you will find it to be quite easy to maintain no thing is that if you are somebody who insists on drinking kaffin very shortly after waking i would encourage you to drink half of your kaffine then and then the other half of your kaffine about an hour later that also will help offset some of the afternoon crash for easons related to the socal cannetics of kaffin kaffine has a quarter life of about twelve hours that means if you were to in jest a cup of coffee at a let us say eight a m anduless i a hundred melegram caffi just for sake of a simplicity that about twenty five per cent of of that kaffine action we would not really take twenty five milegrams but about twenty five per cent of tht kaffine action wi'll still be present at eight p m that night which is pretty remarkable there is a long ark of kafn efacts this is why it can impede sleep if it is if we take kaffine in the afternoon but again if you are somebody who wakes up and you really need kaffine right away and you refuse to do this ninety to a hundred n twenty menute delay thing that i'm talking about wll then in that case i would drink half of your kaffine upon waking and in a little bit more or or the other half a about an hour later and that will extend the ark of that kaffine effacts such that you do not need it again in the afternoon because you will not experience the afternoon crash because of the way kaffine works i should mention that if you in jest kaffine on an empty stomach it will have a more potent stimulan eeffect that will also tend to increase the level of gitteriness the affine can produce later i'll talk about ways to offset that gitteriness but i'll just tell you one tool now many people out to take a hundred miligrams of theaning t h e a an iony theanin as a way to offset some of that gitterinutes thening will reduce the gitteriness of kaffine which is why many energy drink manufacturers and even some coffi manufacturers are now putting theanine and energy drinks and in ground coffee because no surprise it allow us pople to consume more of that beverage and thereby purchase more of that beverage which is what these venders want without feeling overly anxious in gittery th you can take pillform theanine if you want with your kafine i do not tend to do that rather i control the total dosage of my kaffine i do tend to consume kaffine on an empty stomach because i ou restrict my kaffin an take to the early part of the day and i generally eat my first meal somewhere around eleven a m and then i generally my last meal some time around eight p m or those are those are averages i would say plussermin us an hour and that is not because i'm religiously following any kind of a time restricted feeding is just tho that is tend to work best with my skadual and my appetite but againtet's a general theme there are days in which i wake up and i'm very hungry and i might in jest something am small snack or something or if i'm meeting somebody for breakfast sometimes i'll have breakfast sometimes i will not and on and forth the point is that you can get away with drinking less kaffine to get the stimulant effect if you do it on an empty stomach and if you are somebody who likes exercise on an empty stomach and i'm one of those people well then njesting kaffin just prior to exercise i can be a fankaftic tool we will bit later will talk about some of the physical performance enhancing effects of kaffine but i'll just briefly jump to a point about that is we relate to morning exercise if you are somebody who regularly in jests kaffine and we can define regularly by if you injested kaffine every day for the last two weeks you are regular consumer of kaffine or as if you are somebody who only in jest kaffine somewhere between two and four times per week well then you are not a regular consumer of kaffine you are an intermittent user of kafin whel youre somebody is a regular user of kaffine the performance enhancing effects of kaffine are going to be most dramatic if you take two or three days off from drinking kaffine which to my mind as a i donn't call myself a kaffinatic but a regular kaffin user at's a horrible notion to me and tis aversive notion because i do the effects of kafin much but if you really want to see the maximum performance an hancing effects of kaffine you will do either one of two things you will either abstain from kaffine for a few days or three days prior to injesting kaffine or you will use kaffine on an empty stomach it is very clear that kaffine on an empty stomach in hances both the mental and physical end hancing effects of kaffine and of course all of that has to be stated on the back drop of consideration that if yiu h your you are very very hungry it can make it hard to concentrate and some on and forthsoi'm not encouraging people to starve themselves by any means i certainly do not do that but if you want to maximize the performance en hancing effects of kaffine you will consume it on an empty stomach and then as of final point to that kaffine is a diaratic it cause us to lose fluid and along with that fluid to excreet sodium because the effects of kaffine on various processies within the kidney one thing that works very well to maintain mood and alertness longer given a certain amount of kaffin and take and to avoid the gitterinness and and what can sometimes feel a crash or low bludsuger feeling or even blurry vision its to make sure that you consume at least an equal volume of water with your k affine and ideally that water wold contain may be a small pinch of salt or some sort of electrolite drink out or powder rather for me i use element full disclosure they are a podkas to philia and sponsor but you do not need to do that you could simply just have a glass of water alongside your your coffee or espress over your yeur bomate and just put a small pinch of sea salt in that or even just plain table salt and that will help offset some of the gitteriness of kaffine lot of people think that when they njust kaffine they get the gidteriness and crash because their blood sugar is low and while that can be the case oftentimes it is simply because of the excretion of sodium that is occurred when they have injested kaffine i incurge you to hydrate well and to hydrate with something that contains a little bit of sodium ovasy not much that increases hyprotension or something of that sort of a small amout of sodium or an electure drink element and their other electrolite drinks out there that can accomplish the same of course just a couple of quick notes about thenine because there are a growing number of products out there that contain thenine and there certainly a growing number of people out there who are using thenine for the effect that a describe before which is to offset some of the gdteriness associate with kaffine containing beverages or foods and of course i should mention that i've talked about the effects of thenin on sleep at that sleep tool kit that you can find as a free download you do not even have to sign up for anything you just download it from humerin lab dot calm go to the men you go to newsletter you see the tooll kip for sleep you will see that the called sleep stack that ai use and recommend includes magnesium threnate something called apiganine and thenine although that sleep stack is design to be taken thirty to sixty minutes prior to sleep and i make the point there andi'll make it again here that in jesting thenine prior to sleep is not a good idea if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams night terrors or night walk but a sleep walkin scusemi et cetera in that case eliminate thenine from from the sleep stack however a number of people are using thenine and products are using thenine to offset gitteriness from kaffine containing products during the daytime daytime consumption that is a couple of notes about thenine thenine is something that is present in grene tea and it is now been a createas a supplement it is what is called a non protinea minoacids who while there minoacids and protines are of corsominoacids in non protnes and thenine is one such non protinaminoacid thenine tends to stimulate that called gludomate and gludomine pathways ichaly very similar to gludomate ingludomine and it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects of the nervous system but the general effect of thenine is to compete for the recepters for certain narrow transmitters and the nor transmitters on referring to are all excitatory narrow transverse things gludomate and they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking in action and tfeeling et cetera because their present at many connections between eurouns in the brain thenine compete for the recepters for gludomate an and tends to reduce are over all levels of alertness really when people take thenine along with kaffine what they are doing is there really a taking a slight i dont want to call it deprescent to the point where it misleedspeople and makes people think that it will make you depressed the word is lomet misleev but tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excititori pro alertness actions of nurans in the brain when you takeit along sycaffine tensi conico even things out of it i shuld mention that the dosages of thenine that are effective for offsetting the gidteriness of kaffine is two hundred to four hundred miligrams and the studies that i was able to find showed that essentially up to nine hundred miligrams per day can be safe but that is a very high dosage of theanine in fact much that it might increase sleepiness to the point where it wouldnt feel good there are also some posive effects of daytime consumption of thenine that are independent of reducing the gidteriness of kaffine for instance thre's a study demonstrating that seventeen days of injesting thenine at these two hundred o for hundred miligram dosage of at one to three times per day can reduce depression and anxiety there ar also some good date out there showing that thenine can have positive effects on endethelial sells o blood vessels capalaries and on and increase some of the function of blood vessels allowing them to pass more blood through them give them a lobit more elasticity if you will thenine has certain pro sleep effects of its taken prior to sleep it can enhance the quality depth an duration of sleep again if you are a sleep walker or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams from which you wake up in the mill the night probably best to leave out thenine or may be reduced the dosage down to a hundred miligrams an if that still too much than eliminate it completely but thenine can be terrific for enhancing quality depth an duration of sleep it can also reduce the giteriness associate with kaffine containing beverages and foods and it has certain anti depressent and pro and athelial affacts that is it can offset depression it can offset anxiety although those are miner effects of a subtle effects and it has been shown to improve and dothelial sell that is vessel and caplery function and structure in ways thay can be beneficial for both brain and body not one final point about thenine that is worth paying attention to is that the canectics of thenine are such that you do not need to take thenine every time you injest a kaffanated beverage when we injest kaffine the peake effects of kaffine occur about thirty minutes after we drink it and there i am assuming one takes it all at once ind this is a keypoint that come back too later might rather than sipping your qoffees slowly over a couple of hours or an hour if you drink all two hundred or three hundred miligrams of kaffine in your coffee six hundred miligrams of your coffee if you aregetting one ofthose commercial coffees and you take thening along with it thening will block some of the gitteriness and anxiety inducing effects of kaffine that can occur for much longer than the effects that kaffine last the peakanthenine occurs about an hour after in gestion i suppose if you want to get really fancy and really dial in the connectics you could ingest thenine about half hour before youngesture kaffine but i think that is getting a little bit a excessive in terms of controlling your michro environment if you will i think it would be perfectly fine to take a hundred to two hundred melegram kapsul of thenine a long with your kaffi or tea at forth and just realize that if you drink more kaffine or you extend your affine in take over several hours that you do not necessarily have to take thenine repeated times throughout the day let us talk for a moment about when to avoid kaffine and in the same stroke let us also talk about some of the myths around kaffine frince its one of the major myths around kaffine is that it can increase ostio parosis turns out that while there is a relationship of course between kalcium and ostio parosis that is reductions and bone density and it is the case that kaffine can extract kalcium from certain tissues the large scale studies that are out there essentially prove that if people are in gasting enough kalcium through their diet which most everybody is although certainly there r some people that need a supplement kalcium or make it a point to consume more kalcium containing foods but assuming that you are getting adequate levels of kalcium there is no direct relationship betweene kaffinen take an ostioparosis at least not that i'm aware of i know this was debated for a number of years in the literature but the lierature seems to have arrived at a general consensis now that kaffine itself is not going to create or exacurbate ostioparosis provided peopleare getting enough kalcium through their diet that is through foods through supplementation or both some of the other myths around kaffine are that for instance kaffine will reduce testostron levels or will reduce astergen levels other miths out there are in exact opposite to that that kaffine will increase testostron levels in particular freetestostron levels there been some large scale studies addressing the hormonofacts of kaffine they are little bit difficult to do i should just mention that kafiat and the reason they are difficult to dois because ninety percent of adults are consuming kaffine and therefore you can imagine it is very hard to find a control group to compare the kaffine consumers to in particular control group that is well controlled for other things life style diet exercise et cetera however when one controls as well as one can for all the various faftors that could impact wormones what one discovers is that kaffine in take at least of the dosages we talked about earlyer one of three melegrams for kelegramof bodyweight or even up to double that that there are no consistent increases or reductions in testostronor estrogen in men or women that can be directly attributed to the kaffine intake and i say directly attributed because in these association studies one always has to wonder for instance if because people are ingesting more kaffine they have more energy and therefore exercising more and exercises known to have effects on testostron estrogen another hormones whether or not the effects of kaffine on those hormonss indirect and on and forth this all disunderscores the challenges of doing studies on humans in the wild in their natural habitad of livin as opposed to an acute study is its call the bring somone into the laboratory and studying them just for those hours or moments with all that said there does appear to be a relationship between kaffin in take and alld sex hormon and binding globulan which is a protine present in the body ofboth men and women that binds to the sex storied hormones teststron and estrogen and prevents them from being in their free or active form it has been shown that ingestion of kaffine even in the sorts dosage ranges that are considered safe in that we have been discussing can increase sex hormon binding globulan such that it can slightly reduse over all levels of free testasterone and free estrodial in women now those effects are relatively miner but they do exist if any of your interested in reading further into the effects of kaffine on hormones just refer you to a couple of studies we will link to this in the shonote afion the tuddle of the study is consumption of kaffane beverages and syrum concentrations of sex sturid hormones in u s men and within this study there is a reference to a equally sized in powered study done on women both of which converged on the same conclusion by examining more than a thousands on this case fourteen hundred ten men or more then a thousand women that there are increases in sex hormon binding globulane associate with increased intake of coffee in particular but the were able to narrow that down specifically to ingestion of kaffin it is not coffee persay that is causing the increase in sex hormon binding globulan its actually kaffine itself now again the increases in sex hormon bining globulan were not significant that at least to my mind they seem a concern although i think that it is worth noting that if you are going to consume kaffine that you probably want to consume kaffine in a way that is indosages and with the sort of timing that will allow you to get away with injesting kaffine but not to excess to derive the benefits of kaffin without for instance driving up sex hormon bininglobuland too far now why would that be a good idea why would you want to make sure that you have enough free testasterone and free estrogen wel ll some of that is related to the acute effects of those harmones an terms of well being and a lebido and strength and mood et cetera but some of his also relates to the longer term effects of sextroyed harmones many people do not realize this but sexory harmons operate on the receptors at the surface of cells to have immediate effects but they also can enter cells and actually go into the neugleus of cells where the deana of tho cells are contained and control gene expression in those cells the sexstoried harmones testasteron and estrogen are controlling a lot of distecella or functions over long periods of time blunting their action over long periods of time is probably not a great idea but again at the dosages of kaffine tha were talfing about to day one of three milegrams for kilegramof bodyweight a unlikely that the increases in sex hormon bining globulane that one experiences from that are going to be detromental and certainly the posive effects of kaffine that one experiences in terms of mental performance and physical performance and theffact that it increases energy to do the sorts of things exercise that we know can profoundly improve hoarmone profiles itwofold or threefold improvement in hormone profiles in that case it seems that in jesting kaffine is over all a good thing provided its not in excess that also makes this o the appropriate time to mention one of the more impressive effectsove kaffine which is on overall levels of mood and mental health there are several studies on this but the one that am particularly fond of wats publish in twenty nineteine in psychaetry research and the title of the paper is inverse association between kaffine and taken depressive symptoms in us adults and these are data from the national health and nutrition examination survey and the basic take away is that while of course there are a ton of different factors that are going to relate to whether not people are depressed or not life circumstances genetics and on that and here i'm quoting from the study kaffine psychostimulant properties thuch as means the abily o make us feel more alert and positive appear to protect against depressive symptoms and of course they acknowledge that additional studies are needed but this is just one of several studies pointing the fact that people who regularly in gest kaffine and the appropriate dosages do seem to enjoy and anti depressive effect over all i would not want any one to consider kaffine a treatment for severe depression orat least not alone or treatment for severe depression but provided the anxiety in ducing effects of kaffine can be kept in check through us of thenine or making sure that the dosage and the timing of kaffine ingestion is correct then kaffine overall seems to be good for our mood and prevent depression or at least keep depression at bay when depression might otherwise surface or be more severe and of course there are the donts surrounding kaffine intake as it relates to sleep and to put i very simply sleep that is getting enough qualitie sleep each night is the foundation it is the bed rock of mental health physical health n performance sleep and the power of sleep far exceeds any neutropic you could ever take any prerscription drug you could ever take any health promoting tool for yumune system your metabolism your mental function your physical function you could ever take sleep is the bed rock i know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep nobody is perfect about sleep that is importan to keep in mind i think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep of sufficient duration eighty percent of the nights of your life and then as much as possible to make sure that the remaining twenty per cent of nights you are not getting enough sleep for good reasons i suppose i hard reason good reasons would include raising children that is important after all every species a desires to make more of itself and to a preserve and extend the well being it is young child rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason to get a lack of sleep but you really want a strive to get quality sleep most nights of your lifhe which means that even if you are somebody who can quot in quote drink in a spresso and then fall right a sleep that you avoid kaffine in take in the twelve hours prior to sleep i realize not everyone will be able to do that in fact i sometimes violate that i tend to go to sleep around ten p m every night sometimes eleven ocasionally twelve midnight but usually around ten p m every night i confess that my last ingestion of kaffin is not always ten a mr prior to that sometimes i will have kaffin up until eleven a m or maybe noon and very very rarily i'll have an afternoon coffee or espresso or non calory containing soda or tea or something that is of that sort but i really try to restrict my kaffine in take to the early part of my day that is before noon given that i go to sleep around ten p m each night and i strongly encourage every one out there to try and limit their afternoon kaffin in take this is something that doctor mat walker who is an expert sleep research er out of universly calfornia burkly psychology in nurseins department there author of the incredible book why we sleep he is been on this podkasts many other podcasts talking about the importance of sleep you will remind us and all remind you now that the quarter life of kaffine is twelve hours i mention this earlier but i'm going to repeat it again and that means that if you injest kaffine at noon twenty five per cent of it is effects more or less camusing broad stroke here to talk about quarter life twenty five per cent of that is still going to be byo active at midnight that night which will distrupt the early phase of your night the amount of slow wave sleep which then in turn will disrupt the amount of rapid i movement sleep which will descrupt you are emotional processing during the following day and on and forth yet none of this is to say that you have the occasional cup of offe in the afternoon that is going to completely demolish your sleep wake cycl forever but i really encourage people to avoid drinking kaffine in the twelve hours prior to sleep and if you cannot do that within the ten hours prior to sleep and if you cannot do that within th eight hours prior to sleep to really try and limit your kafine ind take in the eight to twelve hours prior to going to sleep at night and of course slow wave sleep ach a deep sleep is the sleep that is associated with somewhat mondane dreams which makes it sound it might not be that important but it is also toe sleep that is associated with grothomone release which is important for protine synthesis repair of all bodily tissues and matabolism and slow wave sleep is also critically attached to your imune systems ability to clear out bactaria enviruses that might otherwise infect our tissues now i to talk about kaffine and its positive effects on performance when used correctly and here we are referring to both mental performance and physical performance the exploration of kaffine as a pro performance tool has beenexplored since the nineteen thirties at least that some of the earliest dacumented literature on this although i have to imagine given that people have been using kaffine for much longer than that that long ago somebody realize that by ngesting a certain plant that they felt much more alertness than were able to hunt and gather or do any number of different things better and as a consequence decide to consume more of that plant now these days we can sume a lot of kaffine in the form of coffee and tea mainly and some people consumint in the form of kaffine tablets or energy drinks et cetera across the bord one finds that kaffine intake at a level of one to three milegrams por kilegram of bodyweight improves reaction time that is it reduces the amount of time to take a physical action or to answer a question correctly with a verbal response it can also improve cordination it can also improve memory although i do want to mention that were as most studies of the effects of kaffine on improving mental and physical performance involve taking kaffine at one to three milegrams por kilegram of bodyweight befor the mental task or physical task there is also a pro performance of fact of kaffine on memory if one takes kaffine after learning certain material ora i should say being exposed to certain material will come back to that in a few minute if one examines reaction time mood alertness focus and memory were the ability to call up information for memory or physical dexterity power output indurance and over all feelings of well being during exercise and exertion kaffine has been shown in numerous studies in both men and women to improve all of those metrics signif ficantly this is all just to say that kaffine is an incredible performance inhancing tool now what is not obvious from the statement that kaffine is a performance enhancing tool across the board and an in men and women and in different kcontects is that the way in which kaffine is taken is very important because ninety per cent or more of adults consume kaffine finding controls for studies of kaffine is really challenging that is finding people who do not in jest kaffine regularly is a very challenging task for the researcher and as a consequence many of the studies of kaffine on human beings involve depriving regular kaffine users of kafine and then examining the effects of kaffine given after a period of say five to fifteen days of abstinence in a person that is essentially experiencing mild withdrawl symptoms because they have not had the kaffine that they were used to getting this is an important point and it is a point that likely exascerbates the observed pro performance of facts of kaffine now all of that is not necessarily a problem provided you keep it in mind and it actually points to a way in which even if youare regular kaffine user you can extract more of the benefits of kaffine the simplest way to do this for instance is to look back to what we talked about earlier in terms of the need to have most of your cortisall increase restricted to the hour or hours just after waking in terms of mood and alertness in performance one of the ways to increase the peak of that cart is all early in the day is to consume kaffine shortly after that pike occurs and this was really nicely demonstrated in a study entitled kaffine stimulation of cortisal secretion across the waking hours in relation to kaffine in take levels we will provide a link to this study it is a somewhat complicated study because they looked at a bunch of different times of day for kaffine in take and i shuld mention this study they used tas three hundred milegrams per day or six hundred milegrams per days that is quite high although for people of sufficient body weight and who are accustomed to taking kaffineites certainly not going to be in excess of what a lot of people out there are taking but basic ly what they observed was the following cortis all responses to kaffine are reduced but not eliminated in people who consume kaffine on a daily basis what this means is that if you wake up and as i recommended earlier you avoid drinking kaffine for the first ninety to a hundred twenty menutes after waking but you do get some sunlight or other bright light in your eyes in that time maybe even get some exercise in that time which would beven better and then you in jest kaffine you will get a further increase in cortissal which provided it is restricted to the early part of the day is a good thing over all for mood in alertness this is a simple performance enhancing tool which is to stak kaffine on the tail of that early cartiss all pique i should also mention however that in thi study they had people do a five day kaffine abstinence prior to being tasted with three hundred miligrams or six hundred miligrams of kaffin the simple tool to extract from this and other studies it is that if you want to experience the maximum alertness promoting effects of kaffine when you jasta early in the day you would abstain from kaffine for five days and then in jess kaffin ninety to a hundred twenty minutes affer waking i wasd still hope that you were doing all the other things that i describe morning sunlight exercise at cetera correctly but regardless it is very clear that a five day abstinence ffrom kaffin however painful that might be will increase the performance en hancing effects of kaffine when you take kaffine on that sixth day now i'm sure many of you out there are saying why would i ever want to abstain from kaffine for five days in order to just get this sixth day performance in hansing effect wether couple reasons for doing that perhaps a your planning to travel to a new timezon and you want to use kaffine as a stimulant to stay up during the day in the new kimezon it is a somewhat unusual kays others of you might be interested in the pro physical performance effects of kaffine will talk more about these in it in lul bit but you want to get the maximum strength increase or the maximum endurance increase from in jaffne in this case three hundred o six hundred miligrams of kaffine well that case abstaining from kaffin for five days well greatly exasserbate the pro performance effects of kaffin when you take it on that sixth day although admittedly those five days are likely to be pretty painful if your regular kaffin user another variation on this however might be to have the amount of kaffine that you injest on a daily basis and then go back to your regular level of kaffine and take on that day in which you need the affine to really boost your mood energy and performance another reason why you might want to abstain from kaffine or reduce your affne and take for a period of time and then go back your regular affn and take is simply to identify how much of an effect kaffine is really having on your overall level of daily functioning and mood this was something that was actually covered in beautiful detail in a book by michael paulin all about kaffine it is available and audible i really enjoyed that book it describes his experience with the decision to completely abstain from kaffine for a period of months although i confess that after hearing that book what it basely made me want to do his never qudurinking kaffine because it sounded as if at least min terpretation was that even after several weeks or months of abstaining from kaffine that he still fantisized to the effects of kaffine but he did mention that when returning to injesting kaffine after a period of long abstinence that it had almost ay a et's not call it a psychodelic property but it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness and feelings a well beine that it really highlighted for him the extent to which kaffine normally was allowing him to just function what he thought was normally inother words many of us do not even really know what or normal bazal level of kognative and physical functioning is because we are injesting kaffine on c such a regular basis i confess that that as much as i enjoyed that book and as intriguing as his description of kaffine abstinence and then the return to kaffine was i do not intend t ever find out personally now a very good reason why you might want to abstain from kaffine for a deliberate period of time and then return to kaffine and take is's for it is physical performance enhancing a facts and here we can look to a really interesting study title of which is time course of tolerance to the performance of fects of kaffine and what i about the study is that while yes it does say that abstaining from kaffine and then returning to kaffine and take can enhance physical performance in a very sphysific way it also says that if you take kaffine regularly you can still see the physical performance enhancing effects of kaffine although they are not quite as robust as they woulde be had you abstain from kaffin the desine of the study is pretty straightforward they had people either injest three melograms por kilegram of kaffine for twenty consecutive days many people are already doing that i realized but they had people do that or insure that they were doing that or others injested a placibo for twenty days they abstain from kaffine without realizing it then after that twenty days of either injesting kaffine or a placibo there pique performance was measured in terms of erobic output but prier to that measurement they had kafine to ase it is twenty days of kaffine and then a twenty first day of kaffine and then thefphysical task on that twenty first day or it is twenty days of abstinence from kaffine and then on day twenty one you get kaffine and you get the same physical task and what they discovered was that the injestion of kaffine increased piqe performance in this errobic output dramatically if people had abstain from kaffine but for people that had consume kaffine all the way through up until that day it is still was effective to injest kaffine on day twenty one but not as effective as it would have been had they abstaind and in fact the magnitude of the what they call ergroganic effect which is the pro performance inhancing effect of kaffine was hir on the first day then in subsequent days when they allowed people to continue kafine and take the take way from the study is really straightforward if you want to get the maximum physical performance enhancing effects of kaffine you abstain from kaffine for twenty days then on day twenty one when you are going to do the physical thing the task you injes kaffine about thirty mence to an hour before you do that physical challenge o twenty days of abstinence is goingto be rough for a lot of people i certainly do not want to sign up for this study in which case you might want to do five days of abstinence as we talked about before and then on day six is the day that you in jest kaffine and do the physical task there are even some study showing that you can abstain from kaffine for just two days for just forty eight hours and in particular if you are a regular user of kaffine this allows you to on day three in jess kaffine at the doseats appropriate for you and do the physical or i should mention mental performance task and perform significantly better than those that have been taking kaffine throughout the entire period leading up to the challenge you do not necessarily need to abstain for twenty days in order to get the pro performance effects of kaffine on day twenty one you can do five days of abstinence prior or even two days of abstinence prior or if that is intolerable to you as it is in my mind to me to just reduce your kaffine and take slightly or even perhaps haf it if you can tolerate that in the week or two weeks or maybe en three weeks preceding some physical or mental challenge again this sort of implies that your going up against a marithon or you are going up against aa series of long tests may be standardized tests in one day there i just really want to point out that there is an abundant literature showing that people perform best on mental tests if they are in the state that they were when they studied for that material a in college highe new a number people who took this to the extreme thinking that if they were to study under the effects of alcohol that they would be best off am consuming alcall prior to takine exams and the turns out to not be the case here we are talking in particular about psycho stimulant of facts of kaffine and other compounce a do not think that you can a drinker be under a the influence of t h c and then take when you study and then take an exam under the same influence in do just as well as you would had you not injest anything please do not let that be the take away however do let it be the take away that kaffine's effects are made more potent by a brief to not brief period of abstinence prior to taking a dosage of kaffine and then the final point to make is that if you are somebody who is not accustome to drinking kaffine meaning you are hypersensive to kaffine or you do not regularly in jest kaffine please do not in jefss kaffine on the day of any important mental or physical challenge or performance because what you will find is that because you are not kaffine adafpted you will experience changes in your thermal regulation in your levels of anxiety in gitteriness and your levels of focus that could be very detrom mental to mental or physical performance you do not want tothrow yourself in the deep end am by injesting kaffine if you are not use to it and i shon mention that for people it are not accustomed to injesting kaffine or are very sensitive to kaffine even twenty five to fifty miligrams of kaffine in the amount that is found in for instansce a piece of certain types of chocolate can nactially cause anxiety be careful there here i'm referring only to people that are custom with kaffine and take what i recommend is to explorer the ergegenic affects of kaffine during your training and then to make a decision about what you can reasonably in reliably doing terms of abstinence and then pulse with kaffine on the day of the challenge i get a lot of questions as to whether or not kaffine has different effects on the nervous system and on performance in particular depending on phases of the menstrual cycle i explored that in my research for this episode and i found two studies both of which we will reference in the showncaptions the first one is entitled kaffing consumption and menstrual function it is actually the relationship between kaffine menstrual function we will do in entire episode about the menstrual cycle menstrual function but the other one as it relates to performance was publishin twenty twenty in the european gernal neutrition which is ergogenic effects of kaffine on peikorobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle and the basic take away of the study frankly a very nice study showed that quote kaffie increase pekorobic cycling power in the early felicular preobulatory enmidludial phases of the menstrual cycle thus the in gestion and again here they use three melegrams of kaffin por kilegram of body mass might be considered in ergogenic ad for women who are in the menstrual cycle during all three phases of their cycle keep that mind women for those of vyiew theire regular users of affine or ear using kaffine to enhance physical performance there does not seem to be any menstrual cycle phase dependent effects of kaffine on performance that is kaffine seems to always increase physical performance regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle you might happen to be it i likes it touch on a little bit more of the use of kaffine for enhancing menstal performance yes it is the case that in jesting one of three melegrams of fine per kilegram of bodyweight in the thirty minutes or prior to during a memory task or on sitting down to doing some studying or learning of any kind physical or mental performance of any kind is beneficial for all the reasons retachobut be for relate to dopomine an the setal calling et cetera but it turns out that it is also the case that spiking ones a drenaline and other call katacolamines this to be dopomie nor epin eferan an epinefran after about of learning can greatly enhance memory for the information that one was trying to learn that is right spiking eradrenaline after learning can greatly increase memory for the material you are trying to learn in fact this is a practice that dates back centuries and was written about in a beautiful anual review of nero science on the biology of memory bygames maga retalks about medieval practiceis of children being taught information and the being thron literally into cold water to stimulate the release of a drennaline and that increase in a in a drennalin while the mechanism was not completely understood it was understood that that sort of shock to the system from the cold water led to better memory and retention of the information that these children had been exposed to an it turns out the exacting thing is true for adults in the laboratory or kids in e laboratory and here i'm not suggesting throwing any one into cold water if you want to get into cold water othere is a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure on the podcast is that it should be deliberate and control by you not by somebody else if it is control by somebody else that mayh be a iuno military a screening or something but here we are talking about deliberately increasing your levels of a drenaline and other katacolamines dopamine or up in efferant et cetera you can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure with a cold shower or getting in up to your neck in cold water of any kind but the other way to do that is to spikure drenaline by injesting one to three milegrams for kilegram of kaffine after sitting down to try and learn some material i confess that more often than not i use kaffin the same way that most people use it which is oque when a sit down ominent research information for a podcast or assembol om some information for a paper or grant and i want to focus i will drink a cup of coffee at the beginning of that i may be ven throughout that or couple of geurbamate at the beginning or throughout that or i'll sip on one or both throughout trying to learn and that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus an alertness and retension of information but it is indeed the case that is the research supports the fact and i've experienced the fact that if i abstain from kaffine while i 'm trying to learn something but then i drink kaffine immediately after somewhat surprisingly to me but certainly in a way that is consistent with the research literature memory for the information that i was focused on prior to ingesting that kaffine is much greater and here i'm talking about as a personal anecdote but this is affii what the datea point you both in animals and in humans anif you think about it makes perfect sense because the way that the memory systems of the brain ar organized is that we go through life experiencing things we encounter surprises both good and bad we go through the motions of things both typical mondane exciting and and novel and not novel and then every once in a while something will happen that will spike our katacolamines dopamine typically of it is a positive surprise a drenaline which can be associate with both positive surprise or posive events and negative events or surprises and without fail increases in the catacolamines tend to lock in memories for things that proceeded the increase in those catacolamines again the katacolamines being dopamine apan efferan in nor up an efference sometimes all three ine combinations sometimes just two of those sometimes just one of those depending on the experience it makes perfect sense that usin kaffine at the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory for the nformation that we are trying to learn if you decide that you want to tryin a extract this performance inhancing effect of kaffine what i recommend would be t o trying of stain from kaffine for a day or two prior but if you cannot to just continue with your normal kaffine in take but then when you sit down to study or learn something to not injest any kaffine as you do that but then afterward to injest kaffine now in theory could probably further enhance the memory and coding effects of a drenaline and the other cataolamines by drinking kaffine and then taking a cold chower or doing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to or had the ability to or doing some sort of intense form of exercise and will talk in a moment about how kaffine exercise the adrenalin system interact but as a brief but relevant a side brief bouts of intense exercise ranging from ten to fifty minutes or have been shown to improve memory for information that one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise this is work from doctor wenny sizuki slap at and why you as well as other laboratories some of the work that is being done it stamfored in the mind body laboratories and our laboratory points in the direction of these kinds of effects as well they all come back to the same general neuro chemical thene which is that when we experience an increase in these katacolamines that included drenalin opening an norpaneffron the memory systems of the brain flip on in a way that try to capture the information and the perceptions in the experiences that we were exposed you just prior to the increase in catacolamines and kaffine but also exercise and also cold water and of course any of those alone or in commination all increase the levels of katacolamines it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense as to why this would work in infact it does work if you want to remember specific information you might consider using kaffine as you move through an absorb ind are exposed to that information but you might also consider using kaffine after being exposed that information because studies ind animals an humans show that that is a potent way to increase memory for what you were just exposed to i shall mention that what i just described also push his back on something that i know a number of people perhaps ave heard about and may be ven used which is this notion of the nappachino i remember hearing about this a few years bactives a sor trend if you will the trend involved drinking a cup of coffee or double estpresso and then going down for a nap typically in the afternoon and then waking up in the idea was that the kaffine would hit your system right at the time that you wake from the nap and that you would be better able to focus an exercise there are couple things about that practise that i do not first of all a it implies in most cases that your napping and injesting kaffine in the afternoon which i realize for many students and for people that are comfortable staying up intil the we hours of the night and then waking up late the next day might be compatible with their skadual but again because of the sleep diminishing effacts of kaffine we talked by earlier not crazy about the idea of people injesting kaffine in the late afternoon in order to a perform better in the late afternoon far better would be to restrict kaffin and take to the early part of the day as we talked about earlier the other reason is that the data on things non sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon and again the rule hereis that you do not haffto nap but if you wanto nap it is been shown that naps of ninety minutes or to last or non sleep deep rest protocalls andyou can find those for inctances one with me speaking you just put enesty ar huvermen in to you too you can hear thats complete les urocost their other enesty ar scripts out there now of course if you prefer those that those can all lead to increases in one of the katacolomines at least which is dopomine that is been shown in really nice nor transmitter labeling study not from my laboratory but from another laboratory but also can improve mood focus and alertness on its own without the ne to in jest kaffine prior to going into those states and in fact in jesting kaffine prior to a nap rejesting kaffine prior to enestiar is most certainly going to reduce the effectiveness of that nap and enestyar in restoring natural levels of alertness and focuss that would lead to the performance in hancing effect i'm not such a fan of the called napachino although if any of you out there have derived great benefit from it a deffling let me know your protocall aman what you have experienced put it in the a comment section if you would i depreciate that there is another very important and potent use of kaffine for nhancing performance and this relates not just to the dopomine and epinefferin and the arousal inducing effects of kaffine and it does even just relate to the effect of kaffine on enhancing frontolot function it does include all that but it also includes those reenforcing effects of kafine that we talked about at the beginning of the episode nd the best way to illustrate these performance enhancing effects of kaffine that stem directly from its association with reinforcement is to highlight a study and the title of the study is blood dopomine level enhanced by kaffine in men after treadmill running and as the title sjestuice was carried out in men but there is no reason to think that the same results would not also be present in women there are some sects dependent effects of kaffine a'll touchon just briefly at the end but those are largely present ind kids that is adolescence and teines as opposed to adults this study is really interesting what they had people do was run on a treadmill and either in jest kaffine again three melegrams perkilegram of body weight or to not in jest kaffine and then they looked at levels of dopomine and other narro transmitters and hormone such as prolacton and quartisal athe basic take away is as the title suggests that exercise well on its own can increase cuartisall in healthy ways p rovided it is not too intense and too long littl note here if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise ingeneral best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than sevinty five minutes or ninety minutes lee being the outer threshold ire realize that there are some genetic freaks out there are people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise but most people do not do well rouh long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to sixty minutes or less that does not include the warm up is going to be beneficial see the episode on a tol kit for fitness if you details on that exerciseis known to increase levels of dopamine court is all and other catacolamins and naur transmitters very potently nd things testaostrone and extrogen ways that we know oure beneficial to us nd of course have all these positive effects on the muscoskelital system and cartivascular fects but unbenotes to most people injesting three melegrams por kilegram of kaffine prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release associated with exercise specifically and this has too important effects first of all that increase in dopomine is great because it provides a long lasting increase in focus alertness and motiv ation notjus during the exercise but also after the exercise and second it that is kaffine and dopamine in commination act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise and the period omedt after exercise more pleasant and infact reinforcing in other words one way to injoy exercise more and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more and to experience a genuine increase in dopamne that is beneficial for mood an alertness is to injest kaffine prior to exercise now this is important because a number of people out there are exercising love exercise love eating grate love doing all the things that are beneficial for their health but a number of people out their really do not to exerise and that serves as a serious block for there willingness and their consistency to exercise in jesting kaffine gives us energy to exercise it increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones that are good for us juring exercise but as ofm highlighting here it also increases the reinforcement pathwaye associated with exercise that is it creates a positive feeling about the general theme of engaging an exercise and it creates a general positive experience of the things that follow exercise i think this if nothing else is a a call for or support for the idea that injesting kaffine as a performance enhancing to makes perfect sense but for those out there that do not en doy exercise in particular certain forms of exercise in jesting kaffine can change your relationship to that exercise in otherwords make it more positive much in the same way that in jesting kaffine alongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutraler may be ven negative can actually make the taste of that particular durink for food positive again this brings us back to the reenforcing properties of kaffine that are subconscious it is not just about the enhanced performance in the test or the inhants performance on the treadmill or with the weights in the gim it is enhanced feelings of mood and well being that ar genuine because of the effect of kaffine on certainaro transmitter and hormon systems but it also is creating an overall mill eu of reenforcing all of the things that led in to occurduring and occur after exercise i do one to point out something that is very important as it relates to combining things kaffine and exercise in order to increase dopamine this is something that came up in the episode that i did on dopamin motivation and drive which turns out to be one of our most popular episodes again you confind that at hubermen lap dok cam linkstall formats with timestams et cetera this also came up in the episode on eighty eigh t because of the relationship between eighty eightst and dopamie and that is this notion of dopamine stacking in the episode on dopamine motivation an drive i pointed out that while there are a near infinite number of things that can increase dopamine release most notably positive surprise a or positive anticipation or experiencing a win am certainly ther compounds both drugs of abuse a food sex a and certain supplements that can increased dopamin to varying levels and to varying degrees both healthy and unhealthy that is all contained in that episode on dopamine moivation ta drive but what i pointed out is that if you are somebody who tends to experience difficulty with motivation that calld dopamine stacking as i called it might be something tha you want to avoid what is dopamin stack ing dopamin stacking would be combining a highly kaffinated energy drink that also includes the menoacid tirosine which is a precurse ar to dopamine plus loud music plus getting yourself really ramped up than an intense work out all of that can be great if you do it every once in a while but what you will quickly find is that the extent to which your dopamine peaks also dictates the extent to which your dopamine will drop after that peakand when i say drop i mean drop below base line a lot of people find that they stack a lot of things to pique their dopamine that then they experience a low and it does take some time for them to return to baseline and i highly recommend not engaging in activities or consuming compounds that are in attempt to eccelerate that return to baseline because all it will do is drive that baseline lower and lower this requires being able to tolerate a drop in dopamy baselime for peard of time et cetera now the resont bringing this up now in the context of this kaffine episode as i just described to study in which using kaffing prior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise and you might be saying as pushieveyou heard that earlier episode weight is not that dopamine stacking are not you encouraging me to stack my dopamine well in some sense yes but keep in mind i'm not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise just as in that earlier episode i emphasise the fact that while stacking multible stimully right kaffine or energy drinks and music and et cetera for exercise or for mental work or for any experience for that matter is ocate to do every once in a while for most people you do not want to get in the habit of doing consistently every time you exercise or every time you go out for instance you really want to be cautious that is you want a protect your both baseline levels of dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine that said for people that want to experience and increase in mood alertness and performance or who want to condition themselves because that is really what it is it is conditioning yourself by the reinforcing effects of dopamine to increase your liking or maybe even your loving of exercise occasionally using kaffine or frequently using kaffine prier to exercise is fine but be very careful and by being very careful what i mean as pay attention to how you feel in the hours and days after that dopamine increase wears off for instance if you in jest kaffine and then exercise very intensely and your feeling great afterwards but then eight hours later or the next day your feeling a li bit lowl i suggest you do not go back and do the exacting thing right away i would give you yourself alobit of time to let that base line of dopamine return to normal again stacking different things chemical and behavioral in order to increase dopamine can be done in a safe way that is beneficial to you depending on your goals but be careful about not stacking too many stimule for dopamine too often that is the kee early in the episode i mention one possible kaffine consuming skaduel that works very well that does not fortunately subject you to long twenty day bots or five day or even two day bolts of abstinence and that is the every other day skadul of kaffine if you look at the half life of kaffine and you look at its effects on the dopamine system and its performance in hancing effects and how a period of abstinence canin fact increase the performance in hancing effects of kaffin but also takint consideration the kaffine can be habit forming and we can develop a sort of tolerance to kaffine well then what emerges from all of that is that being a person who consumes kaffine every other day can actually help you maximise most of the posive effects of kaffine without subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs if youre accustomed to consuming kaffing every single day and then suddenly goin to a to or five or twenty day abstinence i myself have never r tried and every other day kaffine approach although i'm considering doing it based on the literature that have read and i'm considering doing in a very specific way which will be to only consume kaffin on the days in which i resistance train and since i tend to do that about three or four days per week organize in a way that every other day again if you want to see the exercise skadule that i follow including cardy of ascular exercise and weigt training and all the reasons and rational for what i do and how it maps on to the scientific literature relate to heall spend and lifesimand bi tality et cetera you can find that at hubermn labdoc calm and we had a tool ket for fitness that ought to be posted im to our websight before long the every other day scadule of kaffin in take to me seems the most rational one if one wants to maximise on the performance in hancing effects of kaffine without suffering the effects of kaffine withdrawal that are associate with being a regular consumer of kaffine and then stopping kaffine and take such as headache and irritability and forth anot i nor any one in my life a wants me to experience those effects and i'm sure you do not want to experience those effects for you either you'r somebody that decides to try the every other day pro to call or you are somebody who is already doing that proto call please let me know what your experiences with that are at least by my read of the literature on kaffine and its performance in hancing effects but also the effects of kaffine on ner transmitterent hormon systems the every other day kaffines skadual does seem to be the most rational and scientifically grounded one in order to maximise on all those effects in addition to call performance enhancing effects of kaffine there are also the well studied and now fairly well mechanistically understood pro health effects of kaffin now here when i talk about pro health effects of kaffine want to be very clear that if your skadul of kaffine in take that is your timing of kaffine in take or anything else for that matter offsets getting regular high quality sleep of sufficient duration well then you are undermining the prohealth effects of that thing this is true for exercises is true for kaffine this is true for supplementation this is true for prescription drugs again you do not want to be neurodically attachd the idea that you haf to get perfect sleep every night because that simply not true but is absolutely the case that anything whether not's good for you or bad for you in the short term that disrupts your sleep because of the timing in which you are doing that thing is going to undermine your immediate long term health before long with that said there are several well described health promoting effects of kaffine in gestion and once again when i say kaffine ingestion i'm referring to that one to three melegrams per kilegram of bodywaigt dosage there really nice studys showing that being a regular consumer of kaffine can help offset some of the probability some of the probability of developing parkinsons and may be alshimers related to mensha s well these are not terribly controversial data because of the fact that kaffine is known to increase the release of those katacolamines dopomine epinafran and nor up inefferent as well as a seetol colling all those nor transmitter and nermodulater systems are the ones that are known to be defective in parkansons and alshimers although their other transmitter and hormon systems ther defective as well there are beautiful reviews on the nerrow protective effects of kafine and neurotive generof diseases theyre quite extensive and i'll just refer you to one and the references therein and will provide a link to this in the shown o kaftions the title as the am a topic hat han suggest is the nerw protective effects of kaffine and neuro degenerf diseases this was publish in twenty sixteen i'm sure there'v been other reviews since then but includes many many quality references unstudies both in animals and in humans pointing to the fact that specific enzimes that are associated with the health of in particular dopami neurons or made more robust by regular ingestion of kaffine it also points to the fact that the increase in dopaming receptors that is induced by regular ingestion of kaffine that refer to earlier is another way in which dopamine however many dopaminerons remain around in people with parkansons or people who are aging that lose dopaominerons naturally that dopomine can have its mat simal effact because of the increase in receptors for dopamine that kaffine induces end there other biological mechanisms that further support wy kaffine ought to be nerro protective including its effects on the asseeto coline system whichis one of the major systems desrrupted in alshimers dimensia another words it makes perfect sense as to wy kaffine would be nero protective kaffine has also been shown to diminish headache particular when taken in commination with aspiran and that is because of the effects of kaffin and asperan on blood flo thereis also evidence that kaffine can provide brief but substantial relief from asthma i would not want people to rely on kaffine as a life a saving approach to an asthmatic attack that said for people that suffer from minor asthma that kaffinin take again of the dosages that we talked about before has been shown to alleviate some of the major symptoms of ashma for anywhere from one to four hours end i know this is of relevance to a lot of people out there because kaffine increases the katacolamines and in particular becaus kaffine increases dopoamin transmission in the prefrontal quartax the sarry the brain of associate with focus and rule setting and kcontact and taswitching kaffine is known to improve focus and alertness in particular in people who have symptems of eghty ht or other attension and focus issues now kaffine alone does not appear to be as potent for the treatmen of adity as are things riddalin aderall modafhanel and armodaphanen vivants if you a tor h d by head comparison of prescription drugs supplements and things kaffine as well as coverage of behavioral tools and nutritional tools et cetera that kand positively offset some of the symptoms of adiate ple see the episode that i did on eighdieight shee again that is available huberman labdot common all formats but that said kaffine does increase focus and it doesn 't through number difher mechanisms not the least of which is to increase dopomine transmission in the forebrain just as a drug riddlin or aturall would although not to the same extent as a drug riddlin or aturall does before we close to day i do one tat just briefly return to the reinforcing effects of kaffine that we talked about earlier this study on the honey bees that show that beese prefer certainectors because they contain kaffi even though they are not aware that those nectors contain kafine they just come to the feeling that those nectors provide them much that they associate that in a subconscious way with the flowers themselves and they come to those flowers or human beings for instance children that in jest kaffinated beverages come to adore the taste of those beverages and beautiful studies have been done that describe how children an adults truly cannot distinguish between the taste of a kaffinaded and non kaffinated beverage and kaffie can be placed into essentially any beverage in order to give us a preference for that beverage or food in fact the studies have been done with yogert if you put kaffin into yogert of different flavors even plainyogert which most kids do not they will come to prefer whatever flavor contain the kaffine even if then you remove the kaffine from that flavor now eventually their preference for that flavor will be extinguished but all of this is just to say that many of the things that we whether not its coffee or tea or a given flavor of food or given experience or even exercise occur because we in jest kaffine in conjunction with those activities now these are not tricks that your nervous system plays on you tese are real neuro chemical reinforcing effects and i think that we would all do well to think about and to leverage these reinforcing effects much in the same way we would do well to think about and hopefully not leverage aversive effects of certain compounds right the simple way to put this is i or any one could get you to dislike something some one or some place by making you feel slightly less good lower mood do not you enave to make you feel nautious but less good after injesting something or having a certain kind of interaction or being in a certain environment very straightforward to do that because of the way that your nervous system is wired for conditioning however there is the positive side of all this which is that it is very straightforward to reinforce the experience of a given food including its taste but all the contects around it the container the texture the people you consume it with where you c onsume it et cetera for instance i wonder why we are not parring kaffine with brockly and that here i'm not suggesting that people actually do that experiment or play that trick on people but you have to sort of imagine that if kaffine is this incredible reenforcer of all sorts of things in particular things that we in jastin would want to injest more of if it is pared with kaffine well then you actually can use kaffine as a tool to increase reenforcement of different things and you can avoid kaffine as away to further reenforce things that youwould to stop and here i to just give the example of sugar cravings a lot of people askme how do i avoid sugar cravings i've talked about the use of all gludomine for that i've talked about making surgar getting enough essential fatiacids and essential amenoacids as a way to reduce sugar cravings please note however that if you are somebody who likes to havyour sugar whether not it is a piece of chocolate or your desert et cetera i'm not saying that is bad but if your trying to reduce your sugar cravings ask yourself are you ingjesting sugar along with kaffine could be the kaffine contained in that sugar containing food chocolate or it could be that youre having a cup of coffee along with your pastry and then youre struggling with sugar cravings well think about it you are not just being reinforced by the sugar and the effects of sugar on dopeming which are real and both conscious and subconscious through the gut to the brain dopeming system and direct on the brain dopeming system but by coinjesting kaffine you are also further enhancing the reenforcing effects of sugar the flipsides all this is that you could use kaffine as a way to increase your appetite force certain things actually know somebody i will not reveal who this person is but they are quite prominent podcaster who in jests a hundred and twenty five to a hundred and fifty melegrams of kaffine in tablet form in tablet form along with erbalty and use us as a way to develop a preference for erbalty because they found that coffee was giving them other effects that were not good for them it works quite well in animals and it works quite well an insects and it works quite well in humans i suppose animals insects and humans are all animals at the end of the day no surprise there but it all underscorsy sense to which kaffine is an absolutely fascinating molecua minutes of ability to offset the sleepiness system if you will this a denizine system and to control ar schedules in that way to essentially take a withdrawl against the bank that is a denisine and then pay that back later in the form of getting sleepy later as upposed to when we want to be alert it is ability to enhance focus alertness and mood and if taken after trying to learn something and remember it to enhance memory especially and it is ability to increase of vio two max increase strength we name in talk today about it abut aul just briefly mention that kaffine injested the sorts of dose s we talked about earlier because its effects on the normuscular system and the kalcium system associate with naro muscular exertion and fatigue can increase peique power output and muscle contractability hancing performance there as well and of course caffine does a number of other things just generally related tore overall in bazal level of mood and alertness not the least of which are these increases in dopami caffine is really an incredible molecule it is affecting all these various nortransminter systems but not hap hazardly it is increasing dopomine and a etocling in the forebrain to increase attention it is reducing fatigue it is improving mental and physical performance for some obvious and sume notso obvious reasons and what i think is among the more miraculous and powerful effects of caffine it is a potent potent potent reinforcir of things foods people and experiences and it is one that you can leverage in any direction that you once you understand the way that caffine exerts those reinforc in properties today have really tried to cover as much as i could about the mechanisms of caffine action in the brain and body as well as tools and sceduels and dosages in which you can leverage caffine in order to meet your physical performance mental

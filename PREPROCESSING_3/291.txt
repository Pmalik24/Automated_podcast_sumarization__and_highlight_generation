is this american life a miri glass ir show to day in three acts three very dramatic acs atually starting lets us get regt to it starting with this one from jack hit his ak t is got an epic novel with pot twists and unforeseen danger and bazaar coincidences and unlikely heroes and even more unlikely bad gueyes here is jack during new york sity's great crime wave of the nineteen eighties getting an apartment was simple all you had to do was commit a crime we we had heard from a friend of a friend that if we went down and gave key money that is to say one month's rent tegoing fee a two this superintendent that is to say bob ah that we would be able to get an apartment this is my friend cavin he and i got our apartments in the same building on ninety night street and the early eightes by bribing the same superintendent a got name bob these were old beat up flabs whe screaming radiators and war floors and exposed pipes a scity engineer once inspected the building and declared that it was six stories of dust held up by a hundred years of paint these were our first new york apartments we were there to start our lives new york was all romance and everything was outsize and outrages the buildings in thed town our ambition the night lighe and as we quickly discovered our super bob all sorts of things about him were truly spectacular for example the way he repaired our apartments here is chris another tenant in the building after we got burglarise bob put in safety gats for the fire escape which key well did that nobody could get in but you could not get out in a firy ite was noboy o them he told us the they wereininstalling sliding revolving doors which we got he never explained what those were but i do remember i thinking to myself how can he say theire sliding revolving doors but he said it was such a totally straet face bob's work habits were a thing of wonder i remember one time bob showed up with his assistant an generally talented guy name smitey mi sink was backed up and bob started pouring this heavy black liquid from a gallan jug into the standing water smithy started backing up and with experiences my guide i started backing up too one cup smida yelled just one cup shut up bob explained and he emptied the entire jag into the water there were nasty rumblings hot chemical reactions were happening somewhere in the walls i was very scared and suddenly the doors below the sankwuere kept my cleaning stuff they blew open with an explosion and this unspeakable oily sledge poured out across the kitchen floor bob was much more than just a bad handy man very early on i began to perceive bob's talents as e fabulis ah it was no veally painful to go down and pay the rent every hed to give it to him which meant you had to stand there and listened to ten fifteen twenty minutes of completely insane stories ah a big running theme was bob's importance in athe world in general and particularly in brazil i deaf remember his cattleran stories this is ann another tenant during those early days and now married to chris he had seven cattleradches four cattle ranches he owned in brazil and he seven vineyards he had not italy it might have been seven cattle ranches in brazil and four vineyards in italy if if you actually took him if after he left the room he thought about what he said hyou think why is he living here because he s ikin ow li basically a ckane ye oi e buillage people which does't welcome him he claimed that there was a a claus in the constitution of brazil that ah gave him immunity from any any prosecution whatsoeverah and that fact he could he could as he put it a go in kill thy president of the prercen estate and he would still be immue from osu of course bob bein bob had an explanation for how he went from being a south american cattle barron to a new york city super he had had two hard attacks ah and his doctor had had had this is an actionfol an actual stor is doctor had proscribed that he i gain a lot of weight and and and moved to america probably the first time medical history that that that enormous waking was prescribed for a hear condicion in his own way bob united the building all of us the elderly black business man the porter wecan grandmother the handsome bomba emmigrant me the southerner exile we all had our favoret bob stories we all did our own impersonations of bob it was impossible not to try to out bob whoever was talking with an even more outlandish bob story of your own we collected in traded bob stories comparing versions analyzing his technique he was remarkably unfase by any show of skepticism o hes story ah there was the story pou how a he had once hung a bag af acid from the roof of the building to chase away the various homest men who would and in those staye often common and now congregate by the by the edg but a corner of his building on the bob its posly hung a bag of acid from the tob that dripped down settling on i have no idea how you hang a bak o fast how you get the acid in the bag and but at up there ah that is a that no no small feat in itself but of course tthe best parties bob is telling us this story at the very same time that you could lean out of the office where hes talking and see the three or four homesguies sitting sitting on the corner anyrat aapparently comquictly unscarred or bothered by dripping acid the other sthory that i've ialways found really captured just loate all of bobs acence for me as when am ut every kitchen in this building has these funny circular florescent bulb's very a specialized light bulbs they are also in the hallways ain on the first floor and mine after ten years of noble service fonly burnt dout and i looked at it ny thou u where do you buy one of those side trotted on down to bob's office one morning and i said bob the light bulb in my kitchen as burned out and i'm juse wondering do do i buy that and replace it in if slowere you by them or ordeall just replace that for me and of course he went into this total bob tarr his i yes that is right you lime take something mister do not trid to steal one of the late bulbs in the hollwy i know what you are thinking but i've boogi traped them and if you glimb up there and you tri to take the lig bubit will blow up and shoot the glass in your eyes and you will be blind for all time yea where is thang i tae that demean that i have to by the bullyself the very opposite of bob was allan the landlord if bob was larger than life allan was smack in the metal the average percentile he had a family he lived in white plans ad met his wife doing business with a was completely routine experience if it was a tole it to be fixed hou'd make sure the crew got there on time and got down even in our biggest blow out he was always reasonable civilly than one time things get oldl testi when allan started neglecting the old porter recan folks in the building i become friendly with one grandmother who showed me her tub full of green stagnant bathwater allan and i had some tense words and i and some others e and held meetings to start a rent strike but in the end allan gracefully withdrew and we all went back to normal business back to bob the inscrutable endless mystry that was bo fast forward to nineteen eighty nine ihad been in my apartment eight years i had to steady job and i was walking to work one morning somewhere along the way i saw the daily news blaring the latest tabloid crime story headline terror landlord i lookd closer and realized it was allan my allan the landlord the nice gy whose kids i knew the story was incredible he had been arrested for murder firing hitmen to kill his brother in law arthur cats in nineteen eighty and as the story got out it quickly became clear that bob was the one who would ratet allan out allan was found guilty and sent unce to twenty five years to life in prison where he remains to day more time pass i got into apartment in the west village then i got married had children and later moved to another state where allan bob became memories proof that i had lived in new york back wen crack was king and the murderates topp two thousand a year in the late nineties almost to decade after had last seen bother allan i was working on an investigated piece about money lundering and a source at the treasure department a suggest that i called this really smart prosecutor in new york named john moscow i rang him up and started just yack in the way you do i asked him if he would handled financial crime alad and he was quick to say that he would worked homicide new york back in the eighties during the crime way hend crack was king and the murdertes topp two thousand a year yet i said i lived there too i told him i was acting invalbed to one of those tabloy stories mine involving a landlord and hired contract killers to murder's brothe in law and then gets ratted out by the super there was a peculiar paus on the found than moscow said allan stern lest ninety ninth street om the god who put him behind bars right away of course we started talking about bob i told him the lightbulb story moscow hawd a good laugh and then i went on and the way we residence of ninety nine street can do and finally got to the one about bob claiming that he had a special exemption from the brazilian constitution and could murder any one in brazil again there was that odd moscow paus and then he said yes the thing is that ons kind of true i asked him oh well you were in the military what were you were you assigne of the military police here is john moscow describing bob's testimony on the witness stand and what was your job my job was to locate antarrogate n ext icute politically uneliable persons get out of year o bob had been in the death squot in brazil and he was asked do you kill any people ythere yes more than one yes was more than bi i do not know wout he mean you do not know well if you shood somebody at long range in the go down you do not know the debter it comes the point when you realize that beneath all the fanciful stories that usually is he substantial mat of truth he said he camed north for his hell and perhaps to protect his heart bhe was thinking that high inpact led poisoning oapparently a number o and he was in his twenties when he was in the dethsquad and he realized at one point thay substantial number of people in his squad were dead a violent cuauses which would be consistent either with there being suicidle ind the risks they took or bom with somebody having a list of the names where they were located some one whose relatives had been this handle he decided that leaving was good for his health anall those crazy bob stories we swab for years who would have thought that the truth about bob would be just as crazy the cording to moscow not only had bob been in a desquad but he had been a kee figure in the murder of allan's brother in law bob was crucial and securing the talents of the two hitmen named sammy feet an crazy joe and according to the court documents bob was in the boiler room with some of his crew when news of the hit came down they celebrated with martinian rosy and things really got going when a portable radio just happened to felt out that queen song the one an n on bo te death an on on no on bat te detdat the hit was just one of numerous crimes brilliant crimes realy that bob and allen pulled off from that little office the turns out that when it comes to crime bob was incredibly conpident he and alen set up dumby construction companies they defrauded the state with counterfeit charges to force out one tenent they rewired the electrical outlets to high voltage lines to fry all the apartment appliances my favorite was their natural gascam they put fat cones out on the street and actually jack hammered through the ascalt to a working gasmarn they buy passed the meters and in time eliminated more than eight hundred thous and bowers of allen's gascws on top of all this bob help the prosecution snare allen bob tapped allen's phones bob wore a wire and in court transcripts allan commonly ways the relative merits of buying off some peoplew first as having them killed and this is what really comes across when you talk to moscow just how wrong all of us were at sizing up bob and allen when we had twenty two hundred homicides in new york as supposed to fewer than five hundred what were on for this year you had a lot of people talking about killing people there was a certain rationality and cold bloodedness about this murder that was just plain different i just bob testified under oath at trial i watched him when he was being cross examined and i omthing ill ever forget defense councel asked him ti dou torture men or women and he said my specialty was men and the way he said it my bloodfelt that ten degrees colder and there was just absolute on the the court room everyone was persuaded that he meant how did bob former brazilian desquat officer rat out allen bob ithink o old tips to report the murder tips right we the one eight undrednumber what the local crime reporting it seaven tips sotever yet he he calls that and then he goes and mak makes an appointment and meets wit the major case squad what bhut drove him to turn allan in allan and his family had disgussed selling the building and moving to florida and in the course of that allan ad disgussed having the president in the vice president of the tenant's association murdered and bob figured that allan was going to have these two guies wacked and bland bob what year s is this was nineteen eighty eight i only only bring ten ough because them there was a there was an aat one point there was ay a rent strike that was going to be put together in my building and i was the tenant leader of that i mean was that the ren problem that allan was a upset about was thoas another renstrig allan might have actually tried to get me wacked ultimately bob when into the police station and admitted his own role in a murder and thought he was going to prison because his perception at the time was that allan would cause these murders to take place and he protected himself by writting alan at first bob turning states evidence basically save my life or the life of thieutenant organizers that was bobstort mmo m i found bob i reaced him on the phone and we had a nice chat he remembers me as the tall blonguy on the first flor he wanted to talk to me for the story but his lawyer told him not to day orever and then bob suggested that i not bother to call back i wanted to ask him about the cattle ranches and being written into the constitution and give those stories a fresh lesson knowing what i know now and of course i wanted to know whether i was the one who was going to get wack i was not the only tenant organizer in the building at the time but i'll never get that answer now all i have as another bob story full of details i cannot confirm but delicious that i cannot wait to go back to my ole bawels and tell it to them this is the one of the lawyers talking to bob during the trial when you began your testimony on direct yesterday you told us about your military sperience in brazil iloc tor christen man liv in queens now i read to them the court transcripts that john moscow had told me about i was it more than ten more thanton o it it is gon did you torture both men and women my specialty was men wholly iii o ucaleno i this is the destimony youno this is un i me it is under oath i you have taken it to a whole new level sro oh i knowat does make you go to go back and methink the whole patern o exchanges you had with him i never comin ike i never said to myself thi some reality to who disguyse says he is i mean i used to get furious to him but to think oh i was talking tol i a murdering torturer examily ting with us yet now it is its different level of toy no you binstead of just being some mask it is he is a professional i i feel i'm sitting your maze now that we wernt stort sirwe are always a logically tortred b i mein we this this cood ove been very horrible story or co supers looking much it does not surprise me in away again here is cabin i man it sike e don talk i to byut the binality of evil he strikes me as on these no one these ikecan am tipe characters who who would a in certain contects to completely awful disgusting things and then if remove from them in puttin the some more peaceful you no banal surrounding would a settled back in tospee a windy ya a windy superintending the of a building he am it we was cin of interesting thot after this was all over after he d testified in alan was put away am of course alans a daughters i believe then on the buildings of course bob lost his his free apartment in his a his superish position and et was almost he kind of defleeted eu nobody had to talk to him any more he would walk around it wasalmost pathetic he would walk up down the block and say high and people would you knon't jus coming go by not to him go by a and and then after a short time after this he just was not around any more he was gone an at si and iam no idia re went to where is he anyway that you find out an o at he is an elevator inspector in the your city a agod god ere all in trouble now n found allan also at his web side alan sternd dout tat he is been appealing his conviction for over fifteen years he makes the case that he is innosent his argument is at the entire story of sammy feet and crazy joe and the explanation of the brothe in law's murder and all the rest of it is her say a grandios fiction in other words alan is saying he can top us all that he is the victim af the most outlandish bob story ever tol jack he ad en nawlivs in new haven in a house where he is his own super he is ous of the co hose to the pebody a word when hin podcast uncivil if youhave not heard it seriously give it to try his crantly debelding a new podcast it is been many years since we first reported this story an twenty fourteen allan stern which reachd from prison bob as far as we can tell is no longer an elevator inspector for the city of new york john moscow as now practicing criminal law in man haten coming out a supergets a crash that is in a minute from chicago buba gradio when our programme continues tis american life mir gl ass he took an a pregomichos a theme bring you a variety if different kinds of stories on that theme todaysho the super we have arrived at tat too of our shell at too superduper we now move from a story about an east cust super to a stray boeut westcut super from alic spumber josh lives in a spanish courtyard building in loss angelis a city in which even apartment buildings act ther antivy the sliby melrofs place lot of kind of communal activity and sort of presiding above it is the super is not really a super you would have in may be a larger building or a larger city it is he is a a larger said of these alike i i guess lie well ie can lat a dense ervan that he is whatever to say am but is tho he does not have a tool beld and show up in fixed things but hell sort of call the guy who does that and he takes the rant and and a he is kind of a solitary guy for the most part he sees sort of flines to spendl on time reading hinself he just come hangs out up there in the building joshion the rest of the tenants in the bilding liked their super who will call dave ung out with him atat the time of this story dave was going through kematherapy for lookemia an occasionally he would called different residents to ask for help what things when christmas he contacted josh he calls an he says a this really weared thing happened and am i i came over to his apartment he had am this orcid that was sitting on the table next to him and he said well i had this i had this visitor and am it was a very strange visit and he started to tell me that a couple months ago an between in between kematherpy treatments he would had two kamotheraby treatments and he was out somewhere and he was in his bland cruiser i thing he has and he was at this gas station and he sees this woman a pulls up in a big black escalade and a she is on the opposite side of the pumps is him she was an older woman but he said very elegant and a attractive in the elegant older womanway and she had fancy clothes and furs and i think she he mentioned that she had espedrils on and a am and she was and she was in this blacke escolite she wuld seem to be classy or something a or well off and there standing thre at the pumps and they start chatting she iniciates a conversation with him and their getting on very well and thend told me that she said something about him being bald which was from the cimotherapy and she said are you baled from the cemo therapy a or are you just bawled because you think it sexy something that and am hehe was not offended by that he thought it was it was kind of this a romantic reparte or something and am and thn she gives him a card and the card was sort of an old style card de visite that just had her name it was not a business card that had a company or information on it it was just sort of a calling card that you used to leave at the door of count vronsky's estate he wstot by or something and a he remembered thinking that that was kind of a a a classy touch and and diros a very mysterious and then he gave her a his information and they party ways until christmas two months after their first meeting at the as station when the mysterious lady called out of the blue she' dasked how dave was and he told her about his recent health problems an infection from the kematherapy had turned serious and he would spent a couple of weeks in a hospital and yeur coma that is terrible the lady said is there anything can do can i come by an visit dave said yes and she woulderived that morning dressed in the same elegant manner as at the gas station bearing the ork et which dave now had in this table and they sat in chat it somehow the topic of fate came up and that was the point whan she said i know this is kind of weird time but i actually have something i wanted to share with you and he says what is that and she says that she was abroad with a this group of investors who had developed this really interesting investment opportunity and she says i know that this is a weird time but i i this is very exciting i feel i should just let you in on this investment opportunity right now shef was you knows will surprise than but he said out all right what weu know what is the investment opportunity and te and she said well i've gon involves with this very canny group of investors and it seems that they have located this snow man that can bench press four hundred pounds wh yes i said i then i'm asking o ka with the well what do you mean it what cin hav a nowit is ardly exactly biggere out what the proper poll op qruestion iis cause it s thi said woll ca what it is it is the abominable snowman is now o now she said its of tolly normal snow man wat it carret nows and that coll for the high sand ta an a top hat everything it is just that thi snow man can bench press four hundred pounds and then but i i'm saying wil w in but what what is the what is the nvessn opertune is the running ahead on for what i'm in ununderstan and they said no see what happened is the investors they have got all worked out they they a they are going to put togother variety show with the snow man has the lead hact and then they are ging to take the snow man show on tour and the investmen opportunity is the geographice territorial rights to the show a sow it when the show goes to different states you you get to reap to rewards if you have bought in to the to the rights to the show the woman said that she had already she got in on the ground floor wath this thing he and she got california and nevat i the west he said that the united states was all snapped out but now indonesia is wide open and for wer the variety show snaring the waiht left things snowman the way lifting snow man ye the price for indonesias territorial rights to the to the show at to the snow man show we are not sheap it was thirty thousand dollars or something lokat but i do not understand that was thike if you actually discovered a snow man that had somehow become animated it seems the last sort of thing that you do is then just i tor variety shwi know what right i was what was asking i said will listen way hold on a second is not there going to be there is abe lot more important things happening than publicity for your variety show it ras the whole world is going to change science will have to readjust everything it is sever own all the various theologians of the roligan have to deal with the newst animated snow man worlds right iy'd have to really sort o lost things out just even the basic questions wllho did the snow man roll himself up in three balls and find to carrit knows and how do the investors find the snowman that is the other thing that i was riys velli whet they driving round the woods and they just saw this snowman lifting logs and they the high find each other in said all right weve conter variety show they are in a in a caravan o blacks of vurbans with their cigars we we d d it the weird thing was yeven though dave found the story of a weight lifting sno man just as preprosterous as joshdit he seems somehow persuaded by this mysterious woman he said was hard to explain but he felt he would knowner his entire life and he looked at differently now anyway he said something about how after when you get canser or something that a serious illness you just start to reevalueate things you a what might have seemed risky beforehand a is not now and heou said i kinded just felt ah maybe there was a reason to take a risk maybe there is a reason i met the women of the shell station and maybe this is a kind of a risk to take and then that spasically when he said i wrote er check for thirty thousand dollars on mik it what did you think i was alarmed and i was worried that it was a com and obviously rit am but i kind actually was a little bit convinced by his whole theory thinking maybe mayye is not bad right thinking in a danter i sort of his money and right if that is how he is going to you kno sort of embrace the life after canser then i to saye ra i kind of felt i i had to accept that over the next year joch told the weight lifting snoman story to everybody he could he loved it and his laudiences seemed to love it too at one point he decided with dave's consent to write it up for magazine humor section the final step in publishing it was to have it fact checked and the magazine called dave he called me and said the the magazines fact checkers called and a i told them what i ha what i best about to tell you which is that i actually made that whole story up and twas no lady with the card gard to visit or espidrils orefers of the snow mand did you ask him why he just thought that it would be a story that would amuse me and he was absolutely cra i guess he had no idea how successfully tha story was going to appeal to me and i man i kind ofbot it i may i the i did you live to be me know in your middle ages and youve con and never took any risks and tand things get tolly the prorspective refocuses ah in such a way that weight lifting snow man it makes as much sense as anything else i con't it you cannot it that that that he created a world in which it made sense to spend thirty thousan dollars i waiting on yating sone ye y in in ine werd since you were the con ye that was that me know was it was a double reverse reveal at the end of some movy were i would have been writing some check for a million dollars at the end right bcaus somehow i got sucked into the whole thing been i it to you wanted o bad i think part of what i love about it an maybe you dou too as is just throuh the image that there of the snow man this stick armed carretnis snow man actually just lying on a not a on a on a weight bench in the middle of the sibearan wud well also bench pressing and particular is you requires a bench i still t understand if they that say they found the snowman in the woods then did he have his own bench was it made out of snow i is you he was not doing squats ousplimber pocking

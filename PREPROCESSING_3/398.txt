welcome to the huberman lascience scienceato i mandrew huberman and i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor lecs freedman doctor lecks freedman is an expert in electrical in computer engineering artificial intellogence and robodics he as also the host of the lecs freedman podcast which initially started as a podcast focus on technology and science of various kinds including computer science and physics but rapidly evolved to include guess and other topics as a matter of focus including sport for instance doctor lects freedman is a blackbelt in brazilian jugitzu and he said numerous guestson who come from the fields of brazilian jugitzu from the coaching side and from the competitor side he also has shown an active interest in topics such as chess and essentially anything that involves intense activation and engagement of the mind and or body in fact elects fredman podcast has evolved to take on very difficult topics such as mental health he is had verys psychiatrists and other guess on that relate to mental health and mental illness as well as guests focust on geopolitics and some of the more controfersial issues that face our times he is had commedians he is had scientists he is had friends he is had enemies on his podcast lecks has a phenomenal i would say a one in an eight billion ability to find these people make them comfortable and in that comfort both try to understand them and to confront them and to push them that we all learn all of which is to say that lects freedmen is no longer just an accomplish scientist he certainly is that but he as also become one of the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet and if there is anything that really captures the essence of lec's freedman it is his love of learning his desire to share with us the human experiences and to broad in that experience that we all may benefit in many ways oure discussion during to day's episode captures the many fascits of lecs freedmen although no conversation of course could capture them all we sit down to the conversation just days after lects return from ucrane where he deliberately placed himself into the tension of that environment in order to understand the geopolitics of the region and to understand exactly what was happening at the level of the ground and the people there you may notice that he carries quite a lot of both emotion and knowledge and understanding and yet in a very classic lec's freedman way you will notice that he is able to zume out of his own experience around any number of different topics and view them through a variety of lenses that first of all everyone feel included but most of olve that everyone learns something new that is to gain new perspective our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media and how that landscape is changing the way that science in technology are communica ited we also get into the topics of motivation drive and purpose both finding it and executing on that drive and purpose i should mentiond that this is episode one hundred of the huberman lab podcast and i would be remiss if i did not tell you that there would be no hubereman lab podcast were it not for lects freedman i was a fan of the leces freedmen podcast long before i was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest and after our first recording lecs was the one that suggested that i start a podcast he only gave me two pieces of advice the first piece of advice was start a podcast and the second piece of advice was that i not just make it me blabbing in to the microphone and staring at the camera i can safely say that i at least followed half of his advice and that i am ever grateful for lecs both as a friend a colleague an science and now fellow podcaster for making the suggestion that we start this podcast i already mentioned a few of the topics covered on to day's podcast but i can assure you that there is far more to the person that many of us know as elect's freedman if you are somebody interested in artificial intelligence engineering or robodics to day's discussion is most certainly for you and if you are not but you are somebody who is interested in world politics and more importantly the human experience both the individual and the collective human experience lect shares what can only be described as incredible insihtes into what he views as the human experience nd what is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet before you begin i'd to emphasize tat this podcast is separate fror my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolite concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back telectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams thats one graham of sodium two hunder milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that element doc com slash huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el ement dot com slash hubermen and now for my discussion would doctor lects freedmen welcome back it is got to be bag in a bedroom this feels ahorrent set i apologize to open that way i'l never been apporns as i should admit this our studio has been renovated here we are for the monumental recording of episode one hundred episode one hundred of the uvrman ladpodcast which was inspired by the lexs freedmen podcast some people ray know this story but i'll repeat it again for those that do not there would not be a huban ladpodcast were not for lex freedmen because after recording as a guest on his podcast a few years ago he made the suggestion that i start apodcast and he explained to me how it works and he said you start updcast but just make sure that it is not you labing the whole time andrew and i only sore to follow the advice ye will you surprised surprised me surprised the world that you are able to talk for hours and sight some of the best science going on and be able to give people advice without many interruptions or edits ar any of that i mean that thakes an incredible mot of skill you probably borne with an some of it is developed i mean that the whole science communities as proud o you man standford is proud of you yes is a beautiful thing os really surprising cas it is unclear howa scientists can do a great podcas that is not just shooting the shade about rand himself but really is giving very structure good advice this boiling down the stat the art science into something that is actually useful for people that thels impressive 's a choly ship ye she pulled thesoff and doing it every week on a different topic that i mean you do not i'm usually positive especially for people alove and support but dam i thought there is no ways can be able to pull this aw week after week ins been only getting better and better and better ahad a whole rant on recent podcas i fo get with who of how awsom you are with a rona al kalubishes a emotion recognition person a i person and then she did not know a who were and ousik tll do me your inage when this whole rant to howa sim yars is clarious l i'm very gratified to hear this a ma it is ia little uncomfortable for me to here but listen i'm i'm just really happy if people are getting information that they an can make actionable and it was inspired by you and look right back at you i am ive followed a number of you are structural formats i a tire i do not wear a tie i'm constly reminded about this byn my father he says what it saw my poc astings ic quhy do not you dress properly your friend lex he literally said that am and a to debate the gos back an forth but none the less i how is a feel up landered how does it feel i can imagine your youar here you hear after many episodes done much i mean the number of hours which is just insaying the amount of passion te mon o work you put into this whats i feel am it feels great am and it feels very much the the horizon is still at the same distance in front of me every episode i dustryand get information there and the process if we talked about your podcasts we will not go into it of am collecting information distilling it down to simp simple notes walking around listening to music trying to am figur out wat the motiefs are and then as just you i do not use a telepromptor or anything that there is very menil notes feels great and i love it and again i'm just grateful to you a for inspiring it and i just want to keep going and do more of it and i should say i am also relieved that we are sitting here because you recently went oversees to i very am intense war's own literally to you crane and am the entire time that you were there a i was genuinely concerned am the worlds a unpredictable place in general and a we do not always get the only vote and what happens to us first of all wellcome back safely one piece one alive piece and am what was that i mean as at a broad level at a specific level a what drew you there what surprise o you and am how do you think it change you an in coming back here think there is a lot to say but first it is really good to be back one of the things that when you go to a difficult part of the world or part of the world has going tho something difficult you really appreciate how great it is to be an american everything the easy access to food tespite what people think the a stable reliable rule of law tha lack of corruption in that you can trust that if you started business or if you take on various pursuits in life that there is not going to be at scale manipulation of your efforts such that you cannot succeed that this can of ayou do not capitalism is in it is a the ideal of capitalism is really still brining brightn es contry and it really makes to appreciate those aspects and all sugjust the a a believe to have a home for generations aacross generations you can have a your grandfather live in ana kentucky in a certain city and a his children live there and you live there and you just continues on and on that is of the kind of thing you can have when you do not have war because war destroys entire communities it destroys the histories generations life stoys that stretch across the generations yin't anymen think about that until you said just now but photographs a heard drives get destroyed or just abandon right libraries an me nowdays things exist in the cloud but therare still lot of material goods that ayou know are irreplaceable teven in rural parts of the united states that on exist in the cloud i a lot of people still well even in towns they still love the physical photoalblum of your family a lot of people still store their photographs of families in the sti tho a via just haves in all that konstov iad but i think there many things have learned and really felt the lessons one of which is nobody gives the damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of stof your house is gone the thing time and time again i saw for people that lost everything is how happy they are for the peoplell they love the the friends the family that are still alive that the only thing they talk about that in fact they do not mention actually with much dramatic a sort of vigor about the tromo of losing your home there just nonstops saying how lucky they are that person ex person wy is still here and that makes you realize that when you lose everything its t it makes you realize what really matters which is the people in your life i are not a lot of people kind of realize that later in life when your face in mortality when youe facing your death or you get a cancer dognosis that cannostop i think people here in america in california was witwith fires you are you can still lose your home you realized it does not really matter to payinly ask but what matters as tho ththe the family the people and one i i think the most intense thing i talk to several hundred people some of which is recorded ave really been struggling to put that out caus iv to aditit myself and it is your talking about thirty forty hours of footage and it is notemotionally struggling as extrotion a struggles extremely difficult i talk t a lot of politicians the number two in the country number three i'll be back there to talk to the president to do a three hour conversation those are easy to at it there the realy heart felt and thoughtful folks fom from different perspectives on the goopolitics of the war but the ones that really hart to add it is grandmas that are in the middle of nowhere they lost everything they still have hope instead of love and some of them have some of them many of them unfortunately have now hate in their heart in february hen a russia invaded you crane this is the thing i realized about war one of the most painful one lessons is that work creates generational hate it you knon't we sometimes think about waris a thing that kills people kill civilians kill soldiers takes away live s angerous people but we do not directly think about the a the secondary intertiary effects of that which last decates which is anyone who is lost the father or mother or a daughter or a son they now hate the not just the individual soldiers of the leaders that invaded their country but the entirety of the people it is not that they hate a ladimer puden or hate the russian military they hate russian people that tears the fabric of a thing that for me you do not my might have my families from you crane half my families from russia but there is e i remember the pain the triumph a world wor two still resinates through my entire family tury and you remember when the rushians in oucranins fought together against this not se invasion youyou remember a lot of that and not to see the fabric of this peoples torn apark completely with hate is very really really difficult for me just a realize that things will just never be the same on this particular cultural historical aspect but also there is many painful ways in which things will never be the same which is we have seen that is possible to have a major hot war in the twenty first century i think a lot of people are watching this chinas watching this indias watching this united states is watching this and thinking we can actually have a large scale war and i think the lessons learned from that mig be the kind that lead to a major world wor three in the twenty first century one of the things i realized watching the whole scene is that we do not know sheet about was gin a happen in the twenty first century and it migh we can have thes intuition surely there is not to be another way will just coast yet the yependamic yat a normal back orman that is but yoeft to remember at the ender world wore one in alis i wuld your wilson called it te the war tent all wrs nobody in ironically in a dark way it was also the the woaring twenties when people believe this there will never be another world war and twenty years after that th the rise in notsy germany a the a carismatica leader the captivated the minds of millions and built up o military that can take on the the whole world and it makes you realize that this is still possible this is thil possible and in the the tension you u see the this the media machine the propagana machine that iave gone to see every aspect of it is still fewing that division between america and china between russia an india and then africa has a complicated thing that is trying to figure out whore they wit whoare the against and just this tension is building and building and i mes you realize we my the think that my shak human civilization may not be far off that that is a realization get really feel ta ime there is m all kinds of allthe lessons and one of which is propaganda is thi got to a i get a lot of letters demales and o some of them are full of really intense language full of hate from every side toward me a what well the hate is towards me as representing side ex and ex stands as a varyable for every side either on a zolensky show or i'm a pudent shw or i'm a nato show or i'm an a america a america sho in american empire show or i may a democrat or republican cause it is already been in this country politicized i think there is a sense of you crane is this place that is full of corruption why we are sending money there i think that is kind of the messaging n the o the republican side on the democratic side a nivin keeping a track of the actuonal messaging in the conspiracy theories and and the narratives but they are the tension is there and i get the feel it directly and would you get to really experiences there is a large number of narratives that all are extremely confided themselves that they know the truth people are convinced first of all that den not being lie to people in russia think there is no propaganda they think that yes yes thereis state spots ar propaganda be were all smart enough to ignore the tha a the sort of lane propaganda that is everywhere they know we can think on our own wewe know the truth and everybody kind of speaks in this way every in the united states says well yes there is mastry media they are full of messaging ind propaganda but we were smart we can think on our own of course we see through that ever everybody says this and in the conclusion of their thought is often hatred towards some group whatever that group is and the more you have lost the more intense the the feeling of hatred it is a really difficult a feield to walk through calmly and with an open mind and and try to understand what is really going on t it superintendse that is the only words they come to mind em as i hear this you mention something that it seems that hate generalizes it is against an entire group or n entire country a why do you think it is that hate generalizes and that love may or may not generalives i've had one of as you can imagine the kind of question i asked as d you have love or hate in your heart as a question i asked almost everybody and then i would dig into this exact question th you asking i think some of the most beautiful things i've heard which is people that are full of hate are able to self introspect about it they they know they should not feel it but they cannot help it it is not they know that ultimately the thing that helps them and helps everyone is to feel love for fellow man but there they have they cannot help it they know it is a drug is saylike hate a ascalates it is a cavicious spiral if just cannot help it and the question i also asked as do you think you will ever be able to forgive russia and after much thought almost it is a it is split but most people will say now i will never be able to forgive and because of the generaliszation you talk about earlyor that could even include all right all that payments they mean all russians because a because if you do nothing that is as bad or worse than a than then being part of the army that invades the the people theyre just sitting thare the good germans the people there just quietly going on with their lives you are just as bad ifs not worse is there perspective earlier you said that a going over to the eucraness now a allowed you to realize just many of the positives of being here in the united states i have a good friend we both know im i will not name it by name but we communicated the three of us from teere one special operations he spent years doing deployments really amazing individual and i remember when the pandemic hit he said on a tex thread americans are not use to the government interfering with their plans yet around the world many people are familiar with governments dramatically interfering with their plans sometimes what even in a seemingly random way here we were not braced for that there i mgother ter we get speeding tokets and theirs lines to vote in things that but a i think the pandemic was one of the first times at least in my life that canmember where it really seem the government was impeding what people naturally wanted to do and that was a shock for people here and a i have a an what might seem a somewhot won dane question but it is something that i saw and sociamedia lot of people were asking me to ask you and a and i was curious about t too a what was a typical daylike over there were you sleeping in a bed were you sleeping on the ground everyone seems to want to know what were you eating were you reading once a day were you reading your stake or were you were you in fairly deprived conditions over there i saw a couple fotos that you posted it out of doors in front of rubble pit helmet on in one case it a what what was that typical daylike over there there is there is two modes one of them i spend a lot of time in ke of which is much safer than ou may be obvious to stay but for people who do not know it is in the middle of the country in its much safer than the actual front that the word the battle is happening themuch much safe for the ke of even is levive which is the western part of the country the times i spendi key of or fundamentally different in the time i spent at the front and i went to the hursan region which is where a lot of really heatod battle was happening there is several areas ohi harkuve it is in north east of the country and en there is donbass region which the east of the country and then there is hursan region which a buthe i'm not good a geography a is the south east of the country n that is where at least when i was there was a lot of really heated fighting happening when i was in the hursan region there is its what you would imagine the place i i stay to a hotel where all the lihes have to s stay off to the entire town all the lights are of if the kind of navigate through the darkness and te leas your falln to shine and on this is terrible for the circadian system yet that is exact always this how can i do this where is my element and a fledi greens hukcan i function no i there is a i think it was balanced by the deep appreciation of being alive right itoming this is the reason tha i ask this the reason i ask is we we get used to all these creature comforts and we do not need them but we often come to depend on them in a way that makes us feel we need them yet but very quickly theres something about the intensity of life theyou seen people's eyes ecause they living through ward that makes you forget all those creature comforts and it is it was ectually i beu nom somebody who hates travelling an on i love the creature habits a i love i love a the comfort of the ritual i but all that was forgotten very quickly just the the intensity of feeling the intensity of love the people half fo each other that was thells obvious it turms of food there is a curf you a depends on what part of the country but usually you baseic could have to scammer home ilik nine p m the hard curf you in a lot of placesis eleven p m at night but by then you li you have to be home in some placess tan s at nine pianou start i going home which for me was was kind of wonderful also because i get to spend a i get to be forced to spend time alone as think for many hours an now wherever i'm staying which which is velly nice an every dis a calmness in the quietness to the whole thing in terms of food wants a day just the food is n'tcredibly cheap and incredibly delicious people are still one of the things they can still take pride in is a making the best possible food they can meat but they do admire american meats o the meat is not as great as it could be in that country but i borsh every day all that konnistov mostly meat spend the entire day wake up in the morning with coffee spend the entire day talking of people which for me is very difficult because of the intensity of the stories one after the other after the other wuld jus talk to regular people talk to soldiers talk to politicians a all kinds of soldiers i talk to people there cord do not rescumissions americans i hung out with a tim kennedy i ye igreat tim kennedy the crates imanneda who a also withim and many others reveale to me one of the many reasons i'm proud to be in american is ho am trained and skilled and effective american soldiers are and i h guess the pap for listeners this spodcast may weshould familiarize them with the timcennedy is canc i realize that that number of them will now i day do that a how do you try to summarise a man the rit in in a a but's we can be accurate but not exhaustive as wer as any good at a good data or accurate when on exhausted a very skilled and accomplish him an may fighter very skilled in accomplish specia former special operations abrya american patriot and a potcastor too r does he havs on porcast maybe ki maybe we know any stump as his own padcat yes yets amaze yas yet is great yet a clearing hot potcast with iny stomes but also im cennedies a the embodiment of america into the to the most beautiful in the most ridiculous degree he is a would you imagine what is the tyou america that a i just imagine him shirtless on a tank rolling into anima territory jus screaming at the top of as longas is jus his personality but not postering that is at h yet het does the work as they sa that as to thing he really embodies that now some of that is just is personalityin humor i'd to sort of comment on the humor of things not just with him it is very one other interesting thing of learn but i also when he is actally helping people thes extremely good at what he does which is building teams that rescue that go into the most dangerous areas of yeucrane dangerous areas anywhere else and they get the job done and but one of the thingsthat heard time and time again which which really interesting to me that eucranian soldiers said that you do not compare in eucranian russian and american soldiers american soldiers are the bravest which was very interesting for me to hear given how high the moralis for the eucrania soldiers but that just reveals that traning enables you to be brave it is not just about how well trane they are in on it is how intense and ferocious they are in the fighting and they makes you realize this is american army not just to the technology especially the special special fors guies they still is one of the most effective and terrifying armies in the world and i'm listen just for context i'm somebody who is for the most part aunte war a passivist but you get the see ait as some of the realities of work cind a wake you up to what needs to get done to protect a sovereignty to protect some the values to protect e civilians and homes in all lie onistov sometimes te war has to happen and i show also mention o the russianside because well i have not got to experience the russian side yet i do fully planned to travel to russia as i've told everybody else very oupfront with everybody about this i i would to hear the story of russians but i do know from the eurnianside the grandmas i love grandmas they told me stories that the russians really the ones that entered their villages they really really believe there save me eucrane from natses from not the occupation they feel that there is the a eucrane is under control of not the organizations and their they believe their saving the country that is their brothers and sisters i think i think propaganda and i think a truth is a very difficult thing to rive is in in that warzon i think in the twenty first century when i thinks you realize that much of war even more than in the past is an information war and a people they just used twitter for their source of information light be surprised to know how much misinformation there is ontwitter real a nerratives being sold and is its really hard to know who to believe and through all that yet to try to keep in open mind and all aultimately igno ore the powerful and listen to actual citizens actual people that is the other may be obvious lesson is that ta wors waged by powerful rich people and thit is the poor people that suffer and that is just visible time in time again you mention the fact that people still enjoy food or the pleasure of cooking or there is occasional humor or maybe frequent humor no joco willing as talked about this and in warfare and the that the all the elements of the human spirit and conditions still emerge at various times findless amazing and yuand i have had conversations about this before but the the aperture of the mind im that classic story that comes to mind is a ot the one of victor frankoll or nelson mandella you knw you put somebody into a small box of confinement and some people break under those conditions and other people find entire stories within us sentimeter of concrete that can occupy them and it real stories and richness or humor or love or fascination and surprise and i find this stor interesting that the mind is adaptable we tok aby creature comforts and the lack of creature comforts and the way that o we can adapt and and yet humans are always striving it seems or one would hope for these better conditions to better their conditions as you have come back and you have been here now beckon the in the states for hew long after your tri i depends on this pocastalis but its a felt ave nevertheless oa practically speaking a coponse yend we will not be shy we recording this midseptember a but it we actually recorded this several years ago aner inticipating features in surhi is osimulatinyui'm sichint forgoure out what that actually meens i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag one is a vitamen mineral probiotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs i've been taking athltic greens since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there isn i story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health or god is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the imman system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probatics inathletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athltic greens contains a number of adaptegens vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes gright if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic grens while you 're on the road in the car a plain et cetera and the will give you a year supply of vite him in d three k too again that that letter green stot calm slat hubormen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o vite him inde three k to i know i speak for many people when i say that we are very happy that you'r back we know that is not can be the first and last trip that there will be others and that you will be going to russia as well and and presume the other places as well in order to explore and i have to say is a podcaster and as your friend i was really inspired that yet your sense of adventure and your sense of not jus adventure but thoughtful respectful adventure you understood what you ware doing you ware not just going there to get some wore time footedge your something this was not a kick where a thrill this is really serious and remain serious m thank you for doing it and please a next time you go bring tom kennedy o and again i i elict im kenny gets you into what will take because he really lows going the most dangerous places and helping people i think you git me into more trouble in is wore than i shouldt mention that i me there is many reasons i went but i s deafening ot something i take lightly or want to do acan i'm som doing things that i do not want to do i just feel i have to compelled i do not think there is now i'll deting talk about it as we all should tere's different areas of the world that are seeing a lot of suffering yem and therthere is many atrocities going on the world to day but this one is just a personal to me i want to i feel con qualified just because of the language most of the talking by the way av been was doing it was in russian and because the language because of the my history i fellik i have to do this particular thing i think it is in many ways stupid and dangerous and that was mad clear to me but i do many things of this nature because the heart says pos a postso was that but also there is a there is a freedom to not i'm afraid of death but i think there is a freedom to a it is almost o k if i die i want to take full advantage of not having a family currently i feel when you have a family ye there'is responsibility for others you immediately become more conservative and careful i feel in i want to take full advantage of this particular moment in my life when you can be a little bit more accepting of risk we should definitly reproduce at some point am may be the before next time you should is free some sperm i a really a thing is that we do with th ice bath as at of that works it is interesting heres there is always an opportuni to s a science proticals that there are products on the intrnett and ther i shaly a few decent manuscripts looking how cold exposure can increase testosteron levels but i t does not happen by the cold directly a good scientists as the authors of those papers werein are realize that it is the vase of constriction and then the am these a dilation as that as people warn up again there is increase blood float of the testicls and in women it seems ta probably increase blood flow to the reproductive organs as well after people worn back up that seems to cause some sort of a hyper nourishment of the o the verious cells the sir tolyan lightic cells of the testies that lead to increase output of tostosteronan and women a testosteron is well a the cold exposure in any case am is obviously a do you do the ice bath ou an n have not as a russian i consider at a hot a y exactly a yet it is it is a nice thing to a have fun with every once in while a to warm up no ihave not done at been kind waiting to maybe doi together with the yuitsome point great i ges have not died ihav one yere i int' weed straight forward for you i always say thaa drendlin comes in waves and save you to thing about it walls you are goingthrough a number of walls of a drenline as possy going for time becomes rather trivial with the ergigets you backron one a you immediately recognize the physiological sensation even though it it is cold specifically it is the adrandline that makes you want to hop out of the thing and i you seen joes a sir jo set up ararly nice a man cave or it is as name in cave cas it is big it is a a network of man caves but it has a ice bath and asana next each other we have one of those here i sbathan sna sowill have to get you in it when a one of these days meoncs anatrable maybe to morrow no though there is a a a i do not know the underlying physiological basis but there does seem to be a a trend toward truth telling in the sna i'm some people referr to them as truth barrels minds a barrel sana ship a barrel who knows why maybe under intense heat derest people just a feel compelled to share they wl i have a complicated relationship asanas because of all the way cutting a sen which some of the deepest sufferings are t interrupt i've done was in the sana thit is veris i may have gone to some dark places in asona they mayi restle my whole live duto rightoss and those way cuts a can really test the mind you youre in truth telling yes a certain kind of truths oincause you are sitting there in the clock moves slower than it has ever moved in your life yes o i usually for the most part i would try to you knowt have a much osweats garbige bags nal tha cannastuff and run at's easier cause you can distract the mine in the sana you cannot distract the mind is just you an all the excuses in all the tha all the weaknesses in your minds is coming to the surface and you are just sitting there it is sweating or nots wetting that is the worse and talk about vis yual apture you are in a small box it also inspires some closter fobia even if you are not closter fobic am that is a bsolutely true and the desire to just get out of the thing is were the addret you get a pretty serious o drental in surge from from in the sanas well it u now the san actually well it will not deplete testoss from but it kills sperm for people that spermon a sixty day sperm cycle if you are trined o do not are not sperm er uccess will got us on to this or fertilize an egg were eggs in whatever format dishor in vivo as we say in science that which means a well you can look it up folks at the sixty day spermcyclesif you go into a really hot sana u or a hot bath or a hot tub your in sixty days those sperm are going to be am a significantly greater portion that will be dead will be non viable m there is a simple solutions be put ice pack down there or a jar not this jar but a jar of cold fluid know between their likes in ji sit there and or they go back and forth between the ice path and the sana but yet you probably ifyouren to go back over there am you should free sperm we are ging to do a couple episodes on fertility when it is ret realt of he inexpensive and your young yeshup i do it now cause there is a a association with autism is mails get older it is not a strong one it is significant but it' still a small contribution to datism foas your age do not spirm get wiser or i's no as de bat tha now but men can conceive healthy children and considerable age but in any case a but now they do not get wiser if tha what happens is in misin age thate what it is a little it it the maturation of the brain in the sense that some of the sperm get much better hat swimming an then many of them yet yet less good motilityis of is a strong correlet of the diana and the sperm this is probably good time to announce that i'm selling my spirm as a anifties i te o much that o i geess ating the a well your childern your future children and my future children as was to do jugitzu tog ether since i've only done the one you getszu class i'm strongly vested in a you having children es but only in the friendly kind of way well yes frindly competition kind of way yet brominent of the clan yet for sure au moving on to science but still with our minds in the ucrane did you encounter any scientists or see any universities or as we know in this country and in europe an in elsewhere you science takes in for structure you need buildings you neew laboratories you need robots you need a lot of equipment and you need minis aighty freezers and you need incubators and you need money and you need technicians and tipically it is been the wealthier countries that have ben able to do more research for sake of research and development of a improctization certainly the ou crane had some marvellous universities and a marvellous scientists what is going on with science and scien scientists over there and a and gosh can we even calculate the loss of discovery that is a curring as the consequence of this conflict science goes on the before the war you craine had a very vibrant tac sector that which means engineering in all tha kanistov a key of has a lot of excellent universities and they still go on the the biggest hit i would say i's not the infor structure of the scins but the fact because of the high moral everybody is joining the military everybody's going to the front to fight including you and your hubormen would be fighting and not because you have to but because you want to and everybody know would be really proud that your fighting even though everyone tries to convince andrew hubormen you have much better ways to contribute a there is deep honor in fighting for your country yes but there' better ways to contribute to your country than just picking up a gon that you are not that trained with and going to te front still they do it a scientists engineers see os professors student men and aviters men and women a obviously primarily men but men and women a much more than you would seen an' other militaries women are everybody everybody wants to fight everybody's proud of fighting there is no discussion of of kind of passivism should we be fighting shis this right is this it is everybody's really proud of fighting that that is a there is this kind of black hole that pulls everything all the resource into the war effort that is not just financial but also a psychological it is a if youare scientist it feels wull it feels a a almost you'r dishonoring humanity by containing to do things you were doing before thate's a lot of people that converted being soldiers they literally watch at you do vidio of how to shut a particular gun how to armor dron with a grenade if youare attack person how to work were drons you going to use that use whatever skills you got figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them o to help the effort on the front and that is a big hit but that said that you ave talk to a lot of folks in key of a faculty primarily in the tececonomics space i did not get a chance toe interack with folks who are on the biology chemistry youre a science side of things but that that that is still goes on one of the really impress of things about you craine is that they are able to maintain in for structure road food supply all that konstov education while the wars going on especiallin key of the worse started we ere nobody knew whether key of is can be taken by the russian forces he was surrounded and om a lot of experts from outside were convinced that russa would take key of and and they did not in one of one of the really impress of things as a leader one of things i really experiences that a lot of people criticized zolonsky before the war he only had about thirty percent approval rate a lot of people did not selensky buts one of the great things he did as a leader which i'm not sure many leaders would be able to do is when key of was clearly being invaded he chose to stay hes stay in the capital everybody all th a the american military the intelligence agencies nato his own staff advisers all told him to flee and he stayed and that is i think that was a beacon a symble for the rest for the universityes for science for for the infor structure that we are staying to and a that kept the whole thing going there is an interesting social experiment that happened i think for folks for interesting sort of gun control in this country in particular is a one of the decisions they made early on is to give guns to everybody a semyautomatics early on in the worand early on in the work i to everybody got a gun ah they also released tha much of prisoners from from prison because there as no staff to o to cto a on to keep the prisons running and there is a very interesting psychological experiment of how is this god a go everybody has a gun ar dingins thot robbing places tat they going to start taking advantage of a chaotic situation and what happened is that crime went to zero turned out that this as an experiment worked wonderfully that is a case were love generalized yes for at least hate did not we do not hov it is lover it sort of lack of initiative herself you do not common culture directed e yea i do not i right it is wy i i think that is a very correct to say that it was not hate that was unifying people it was love of country love of community it is the probably same thing tat wll happentng humans when aliens invade i's wall it is it is a the common effort everybody puts everything else a to the side bless just i the sheeramount of guns it is much texas you realize well ythere is going to be a self correcting mechanism very quickly because the rule of law was also put aside right gom basically the police force lost a lot of power because everdy else's guns and the kind of taking the law into their own hands and that system at least in this particular case in this particular moment in human history worked said inc eresting lesson iu no i did it is i had an interestin contrast that will share with you i as you mention texas not long ago ii was in austen often visit you or others an austin as and am many doors that i walked past including a school said a no firearms pass this point you as a sticker on the door you see this on hospitals sometimes i saw this at bailer college medicine et cetera a for relatively common to see in texas m not common in california a and then i flew to the semmersescobaria was walking by an elementary school in my old neighbourhood and saw similar sticker and looked at it it said a now peanuts or other olrgy containing foods pass this point on the door of this elementary school quite a different contrastly n guns in peanuts am now penadologies obviously are very serious for some people althog there is great research out stamfor showing that early exposurer to peanuts am can prevent theology that is a but do not start rubbing yourself in pena butterfolks if you have a penatology thats not the best way dea with it in any case the contrast of what is dangerous the contrast of am the familiarity with guns verses no familiarity non is real an elsewhere you see machine guns an the irport in germany frankfort you see machine guns on the a but not common in the united states again there is i feel lie there is this aperture a vision there is this aperture of pleasures and creat verses creature comforts and lack of a creature comforts and then there is this aperture of of danger right am people who were familiar with gumsyo ware familiarwit people coming in setting their firem on the table and eating eating dinner but in you are not accustome to that it is jawring ri i shi shall mention the people know this thron human history but the humanability to a get a assimilated na i get use to violence is incredible ik ga you cound be living in a peaceful time were here now and there'ld be one explosions a nine eleventype of situation that be a huge shock it terrifying everody freaks out the sec one as a huge drop off in how y freaked out you get and would in the matter of day sometimes ours it becomes the not of the normal hi've talked to many people in a harkave which is one of the times at seen a lot of heated battle you ask om is it safe there efact when i went to the closer and close to the wars on yask people is it safe and their answers usually e spretty safe it is all signal the noise yet it nobody is told me except western reporters sitting in the west side of you crane it is really dangerous here everells ik ye ityou don is good a my unclejis died yesterday yu is shot but's pretty its pretty good the the farm still running that the they a how do i put it they folkes on the positive that is one but it is there is a deeper truth at which just get used to difficult situations in the stuff they make you happy an tous they make you upset i's relative to that new normal the u establish w i grew up in california there area lot of earthquakes i remember the endi in quake i remember theyou market ore are frwe we call pancaking on top of people in cards i remember a i move to selthern california thos north richquake wherever i move there seem to be earthquakes i never worry about earthquakes ever i jus do not in fact i do not the destruction they cause but ever once while an earthquake will roll through an i's kind of exciting it is somdling a train comin touts lik wile the earth is moving again i do not want any one to get harmed but i i enjoy a good rumble coming through none the less am thiis signal the noise but if i saw tornato freek out in people from he midwest are probably comfortable with youon't dan gable the great restlat from the west of t and i've never met but i have great respect for he is probably unus it ese tornados o ya e maybe no i think signal the noises is real am before i neglect although i will not forget am speaking of signal the noise and environment you are returning to or have gone back to one of your original am natural habitats which is the massachusettes inc its do of tecnology which is youi hapits is it asually difficult to pronounce in full m i tea right you have been unspending some time their teaching am and doing other things tell us what you are up to with them i tea recently wut it is i'm i'm really glad that you being on on the less coast know the differenceseeng a boss in new york i felice a lot it aa east coast i it is ar o differen it is o grasually to tonincin york rs a oi ons ye i i love it i get a gavea a lectures there in front of a in person crowd well we talking abt for the ay i different aspects of they i and you do not robotics machine learnin machine learning for people who know the artificial intelligence field that youyou do not use the term may i te people from outside you say iyes the biggest break thergs in the machine learning field wit some discussion of robodics and on yetis in person is is wonderful at i'm a succor for that i really avoid to teaching or any kind of interaction at youren covid because a people put a lot of emphasis on but also go comfortable with remote teaching and i think nobody enjoyed it except sort of there is a notion that it is much easier to do because you don' to you kdow you have to travel you dont the you can do what i in your prejaimas kind of thing but when you actually get to do it you do not get the same kind of joy that you do when you'r teaching as a student you do not get the same kind of joy of learning it is not as effective and all that cims thoug to bein person together with people to see their eyes to get their excitement to get the questions in all the interactions that was alsome and is i'm still a a succor and a believer in the the idea of i my tee of the university i thinks at incredible place there is something in the air i still but you really hit e the pandemicate universiies thought hard because and i can say this is not u saying is is me saying it a that administrations as in all cases where people criticised institutions the pandemic has given more power to the administration and taken away power from the faculty in the studens and that is te from everybody involved including the administration that is a concern because the university is about the teachers in the students that is to be primary and wheneve you have a pendemic there is an opportunity increase him on rules one of the things that really bothered me and i'll scream from the top of the a i mi ty dome about this is dave instituted in you a timticet system which is if youre visitor to the campuss that i my tee you have to register yevt to first o ill show that youre vaccinated but more importantly there is a process to visiting your unein to get permission to visit one of the reasons that loved at my tea i some other sututions a my tea just leaves the door open to any one classoms you can roll in the ridiculous characteris the students that are kind o usually doing business stull for economics can roll into physics class an just you connona aloud but it is a gray arias youthayou let that happen and that creates a flourishing of e community thus beautiful and i think adding extra rules i puts a squeeze on in limits some of th of the flourishing and i hope some of that dissipates over time as we cut a let go of a the risk aversion that was created by the pandemic as we cannot enter than you the normal returnd back some of that flourishing can happen but when youre actual in there with the students a was is magic i love it i love it whatl sol me your earliest of idios on your outwo chantl were were of you in the class room wright is tell thi's all started yet ye's all you to putting stuff on a on uto was as terrifying i lik well s wor shi at the time when you did it again you are a pioneer in that sense and you did that yourt in peterson did that putting up lectures am is iyei would i teach still every every winter i teach i direct or course and all i'll be doing eveng more teaching going forward but am the idea of those pidios being on the web is is a ye that spikes my corters althou but yess terrifying as you get te and everbody has ha different experience that for me being a junior ive resur sine to s the the kind of natural concerns i who my awhen i was given this lectures i do not deserve anys lo your humility coming through and think te humility ion the part of an instructure is good because that those that think that they are entitled and who else who else could this lecture then i worry more t i think it is i once heard i do not know if it is still true that the a at caltack rint the great californi instituted acknowledgy not far from here that many the faculty youre actualy afraid of the students i not physically afraid but they are intellectually afraid because the students are smart and teaching there can be downright frightening i've heard but that is great keeps everybody on their toes and i think aand yo i i've been corrected in lecture before at stanford and elsewhere what when my live was a you see sandiego where sone will say it wa last lecture you said this and i you said that it were on the podcast and and i think it is that moment where you sometimes feel that that urged to defendy o you are you are right and i think depends on how one was train my gratu advisor was wonderful at saying i do not know all the time and she went to a harvard radcliff a you see a salfin caltec in brilliant woman and had no promisingti a i do not have that promis sia to guise that somebody speaks o grabum draga mot of never seehm again everybody is really suppmortor i oner you understand that that the amount of love an support i get especially when the last few students are there and everybody seems to e nodding as ye nwi think that am i'd love to siten on one o your lectures i know very little about a i machine learning or robotics am but gav talk that i might yo have you ever tlike a given lecture o ya in when i went on the job market from as a faculty member my final to choices were between a my t p cower i hadded an on paper offer wonderful place wonderful place to do nor sciense and you see sandiego which is a wonderful norrl science pargram in the end it made sense from me be on the west coast for personal reasons but this am amazing narral science going on there goodness and athat is always been true and is going to continue it isbeen a long time since i've been invited back there oddly enough when i star doing more podcasting and i still run a lab but i i srunk my lab considerably when i was doing as a donemore podcasting receive fewer academic lecture invites which makes sense but now their sort of coming back and when people invite now i ways say to yo do you want me to a talk about the ventural falemiss and its rollin a anxiety and aggression or to you i want me talk by the podcast and my big fear is omen to go bac to give a lecture about the rat n ar something i'll start off with an athletic greens read or something legist reflectively i just getting that would not happen but in't i think it is great to continue to put keep afoot in both place that i was happy to hear that your teaching it i mig tea because podcasting is one thing teaching is another and there is overlappe there in the vendiagram but am listen he students they get to sit in on wone youre lectures and you may see me sitting the in the audience soon when i creep into your class a some glasses yout's right wearing a red shirt a you will not recognize me ah will are certainly a receiving a great gift ie i've watched your lectures on you to even thearly once and a listen a i i know you to be a phenomenal teacher yet there is something about some also doing mik they sit ap pretty late last night a working for a ded lan on a paper one of the things that i hope to do for popely the rest of my life is is to continue publishing and i think its realthe important to do that even if a you continue the pokcas because you want to be just on your own intellectual and scientific journey as you do potgassing as a at least for me and especialy on the engineering sic as i want to build stuff and i think that i keeps your eagoing check keeps you humble because i think if you talk too much on h mikufon you star getting a you might loose track of a o the groundin that comes from engineering from science in the scientific process in the criticisms that you get all that costo and how slow and iterative is we have two papers right now thetare in the revision stage tat's been a very long road and i was as thiss recently because i met with my chairman he said you want to continu run a laboryou just ginto gotful time on the podcas and stanford has been very supportive i must say as i know an myty has been of yu of you ah and i said ow i absolutely want to continue to be involved in research into research and we star time at these papers wand were looking over my this was my yearly review an looking back lik goodness these papers have been in play for a very long time it is a long road but you you learn more and more and the more time you spend my optically looking in at the bunch of data that the more you learn in the more you think i i tolly agree you ae talking into these devices for potgassis wonderful cas a it is fond it relieves a certain itch that we both have and i'm hoply it land some important in formation out there for people but doing research is is the and i enied you guess if there is that the the the unpeeling of the onion knowing that there could be something there there just nothing it ant you do especially with the pandamicu and but but for me both twitter and the potgas have made me much more impatient about the slowness of the review process because a witder'll do that the twittl tha but even with potcas you you have a cool you will find something cool and youou have ideas and all and yu'll just say them and i'll be out pretty quickly there wre o w host right now about something tat we both found interest and its out in the world ye and you can write up something a there is a culturing cofpeter science of posting stuffon arcive and a preprince that do not get in your review and somethings that do not oucen go to the w process ever because i people just tart using them with its code and sike what with wit was the point ed this it works the self evident that it works because people are using it and that that i think applies more change engineering feels posence an actual tool at works it os a matter of you moght to scientifically prove that it works it works is using for lot of people what serge nterrup it a just it it for point of reference the famous paper describing the double heelics which are and wason in cric the nobout prize and am should have earned roslim franklin noble price too of course but they got it am for the structure of deona of course that paper was never reviewed at nature they published it because it is importance was self evident or whatever a o senctor the editors it was that purely editorial decision i believe i meand that is what i was told by some one whose currently an ederate nature am if that turns ouht to not be correct some one will tell us in the comments for sure ori think i've a pretty interesting i hav vis perhaps the most significant discovery and biology and by engineering it would leading to by engineering is was well of course of the last century was not pure reviewed yet but the ar quise tine but many others of have talked about this which is m evely people understand how poor the pure of o processes si just the amount of cause you think pure review means all the best peers get together and they review yourself but thit is unpaid work as usul a small number of people ands a very theyave a very select perspective they may not be the best personspeci of i supernovel work and is who has time to do it a man a bunch of editorial words still why i do not know but i enjoy he pure review process and andin papers out oftentimes the best scientists are very busy and do not have time to review and oftentimes a the more promer journals will select from a cand of a unique kit of very good scientists who are very close to the work sometimes to be lear very far from the work they really dm foth have negatives right if youre very close to the work there is jealousy in all those basic human things very far from the work you may not appreciate the the new ants contribution all that cins tel and their psychologis are ato interrupt again but a good friend of mine whos extremely successful nor a scientis howard he is investigator et cetera always told me that a they i will not even't say whethr or not a who they are they select ther reviewers on the basis of who has been a publishing very well recently cause they assume that person is t to be more benevolent because their they have been doing well that the a the love expanss a point to that actually a but the the ideas that editors might actually be the best reviewers that that was the traditional that is that is the thing ilang to mention thet air why sin talks about that back a several decates o go editors had much more power and there is something to be made for that zey editors are the ones who are responsible for crafting the journal they really are invested in this and it and theyare also often experts right t make sense for an edet to have a bit of power in this case sike usually if a ideas truly novel you could see it and ha it is it makes sense for an editor to have more power in that regard of course for me i i think pure view should be done the way tweats ar done which is a crowd source or amazon of you let the crowd o i the crowd decide and let let the crowd ad depts and breaths in in context before the contribution am you kdo not if the paper overstates the degree of contribution the crowd will check you on that a if there is not enough support or the conclusions a're not supported by the evidence the crowd will check you on that i the sur there could be of course a political bickering that enters the picture as pichon very controversial topics but i think i trust the intelligence of human beings to figue that out and i think most of essit ar trying to figure this whole process out i just wish was happening much faster because on the important topics the review psycho could be could be faster and we learn that the covit that twitter was actul pretty effective it doing sinse communication is really interesting isome some of the best scientists took to twitter to communicate their own work and other people's work and always putting into the caviot tat's not on the per o viewed and on but it is it is all out there and the dat has just moves fast and if you want stuff to move fasts twitter is the best meninmg of communication for that is cool to say i'm now on titt or more regularly aninitially was just in segram and i remember we you and i use to have these a over over dinner drink conversations were i'd say i do not understand twitter and you would say i do not understand in strga of coure we understand how it worked and how to work each respective platform but i think we were both trying to figure out au what is driving the psychology of these different vanusecause they are quite distinct psychologies am for whatever reason i think i'm finally trying to understand twitter and enjoy it a little bit ainitially i was not a prepared for the level of kind of a reflective scrutiny an that i sounds little i bit oxyg more onic but that peole can lic pick up on one small thing and then you' drive it down that that trojectory did not seem to be happening quite as much on instergram but i love your tweats i i do have a question about your your your twitter a account and how you do you have servoe internal filters of what you will put up and will not put up im becaue sometimes you will put up things that about life and reflections other timeas you will put up am things what you arexcited about in ah i or of course you kno on point to very spod casts including your own but but others as well now what do how do you approach social media not how to you regulate your behaviour on there in terms of how much time at cetera i know yofve talked about that before but what is your mind set around social media when you go on there to i either a post or forage or respondent information i think i try to add some not to sound crichet but some love i there into the world into as odiou simpson calls it toid a world a i think there is this viral negativity that can take hold and i try to find the right language to add no good vibes out there and its ectu really really tricky because it there is something about positivity that sounds fake and'not i cannot quite put my finger on it but whenever i talk about love and an positive and almost child in my curiosity and positivity people are itstart to think surely he as skeletons in the closet there is dead bodies in his basement this must be a agiatic it is the atic the atic i keep mine in the basementats a details aboready youre atc ion't nave a atic wor abasement o nor a dead bodies it is do not be very clear yet i do have a anatic and a i shul have not been up maybe there is bodies up there but yes i oull i prefer the basements colded down there i it a no but there is an sumption that this is not genuine or not a its is disingenuous in some kind of way and i ta try to find the right language for that con astof u to i ogt to be positive some of it i was really inspired by a youon's approach for twitter not all of it but the a when he just is silly i found that a silliness i think it is a herman has i said a is something to to pariphrase that lon my favorite writers sics es i think in steponof as said ta learn o what is to be taken seriously and a laugh at the rest i think i try to be silly laugh at myself laugh at the absurdity of life and an impart when i'm serious tried to just be positive i just se a positive perspective but and also a as you said people pick out certain words and on in the attack each other attack me over certain usage of words in a particular twe i think the think i try to do is think positvely towards them lik do not asklate whenever somebody is criticising me and on i i just smile its tere's a lesson to be learned o i learn it and ten i just send good vibes their way do not respond and just hopefully sort of a through carma and to kind of the ripple effect of a positivity have a pneno an impact on on them in the rest of twitter and you find is that builds your actions create the community how i behave gives me surronded by certain people but lately especially you cranes one topic this i also thought about talking to somebody resto to mes andrew tate who is extremely controversial all if from the prospect of a lot of peoples a misogenist and i have heard his name and i know that thereis a lot of controversy around and maybe you could familiarize me i've been prey knose down in poncast breap and i tryd to do this vacation thing for about three four weeks i thought about the ye and am it is sort of work i did get some time in the colorad o wilderness but i myself which was great am i did get m some downtime but in any event it i meant mainly consist of reading and a was nature it a reading an nature n a i spath working out am good food a elextrasleep these kinds of things i really felt i need it but i am pretty naive when it comes to the kind of current controversies but i've heard his name and am i think he is been dee platformed on a couple of platforms to i have that right has beend i should also admit that while i might know more than you it is not by much it is it is a five year old talking to four year old right now is he an athlede a podcaster a basic summary he he used to be a fighder kick box i believe i was pretty successful and an a si during that and after tht i think hi was in a reality show and he had all these programs at a basiclly pick up artist advice he is thi i community of people where he gives advice and how to pick up women ho a how to be successfom relationships how to make a lot of money and there is a it costs money to enter the those programms a lot of the criticism that he gets is can a it i's ak appearamend ceem where you convinced people to joinso that they can make more money and they can vince others to join that kanistov but that is not why i'm interested in talking to him i'm i'm interested because one of the guest maybei should mention who but ik one of the female guess i had really a big scientist said that her a two kids that r thirteen and twelve really look up to andrew a is a a mal children may o chant man and i hear this time on time again thake he is somebody that a lot of teens young teens look up to i have not done serious research i iusu try to avoid doing research until i agree to talk and then i go deep but there is an aspect to the way he talks about women that while i understand i understand certain dynamics and relationships work for people and he is want of such person but i think him being really disrespectful towards women is not what i a it is not how i see what he means to be a good man the conversational one to have with him is about masculinity what is masculinity mean in the twenty first century and when i think about that kind of stofv and caus yoe were talking about twitter it is going into wor'sown i'm a happy go lucky person but you are not send me a thecrane but i do not have this conversation on twitter because it is i is really really really tricky one because also as when you sit when you do a pakgast everybody wants you to on to win there is not a it is everythng you do is positive maybeou'll say the wrong thing is a inaccurate thing you can correct yourself with a anderta with donaltrom with folks this you will have to i mean it is a professional boxing a the you have to push the person yeft to be really eloquent ye to be all sympathetic as you cannot just do what journalist do which is talked on of the person the entire time that is easy the hard things to empathize with the person to understand them to steel man their case but also to make your own case in that case about what he means to be a man to me a strong man is somebody who is respectful to women not out of weakness not of social justice warriors signaling in all that kind o stoff but out of that is what a strong man does that the theydo not need to be disrespectful to prove their position in life he is often not a lot people say it is a character it is it is he is being masagenistic his being a masogenist is a kind of for entertainment purposes an avatar ye but to me that avatar is has a lot of influence on young folks or the character as has a yas in pact ouh i do not think you can separate the avatar in the person a in terms of the impact as you said in fact a there are number of accounts on twitter end in sougamin elsewhere which people iave only revealed their first names ar they give thimself another name or their using air cartoon image and part of that i believe ind at least from some of these individuals wo action o who they are i understand as ay an attempt to maintain their privacy which is important to many people a and in some cases a'm that they can be more inflamatory and then just pop up elsewhere as something else without any one knowing that it is the the same person some of the this is the darkstog i've been reading a lot about you crane and a nocy germanies of hauthirities indthe forties ind on and you get to see how much the a absurdity turns to evil quickly whon no things i worry one things i really do not to see untwitter in the internete is how many statements and with elwel it is a you think just because something is kind of funny or is funny or is legitimately funny it also does not have a deep effect on society that is such a difficult greay area because some of the best comedy is dark and mean but it reveals some important truth that we need to consider but sometimes comedy is just covering up for a destructive idealigy and yet to know the line between those two i hitler was seen as a jokein tha late twenties in in thirties the nosy germany untill the joke became very serious yet to be careful to know the difference between the the joke in the reality and do all that i mean in a conversation i'm just such a big believer in conversation to be able to reveal something through conversation but i do not know one of the big you knont you and i challenge ourselves all the time i do not know if i i have what it takes to have a a good ampathetic but adverserial conversation i need to a learn more about this a tate person or not lear or ot m at yet somne that something may be at something to scip i do not know i cause the and om not familiar with the content but ocan ask you am whether not youe i seek dout or whether not you would ever consider ever don ol trump as a guest on your poncount yet i ie talk to joe lot about this and a i i really believe i can have a good conversation with omtrump i but i have not seen many good conversations with him a pardon me thinks pardonmy believes it is possible but he often effectively runs over the interviewer i you sit him down give him an element in letting herry es i know i mean ats ice cool er condition a black curtain studio you have got an a a different side might come out context is powerful well a jos really good at this which is relaxing person you kdo not here i have a drink i i smoke a joint whatever it is but some this energy ofe just lest relax and there is laughter and on i do not think a as people know i'm just not good at that ken ofstoff i think the way i could have a good conversation with him i's te really understand his world view be able to steal man as welld you and those that support him which is 'm sorry to say for people who seem to hate nontrump is a very large percentage of the country and you have to really empathize but those people we have sympathized with onal trump the human being and from that perspective ask him hard questions who do you think it is ha counter point if you are going to you no seek balance in your guass if you c have trump on then you have to have who on well as interesting as ers any fouchy ah seems to be a you not strongly associated with am tor counter values at least in in the eye of the public things retiring soon but i yes heis retiring thats frorthe interesting anthony fauchy a he had definilly but i do not think he is a conterbalance he is a he is a complicated a fascinating figure who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust a but iin love from someping in love and not from some people i mean i know people am not even nessarily scientist who have you do not profouch hes shirts i've seen people with anty founcs you sir shirts guves me but certainly but a who adore him their people o adore him on the same withther people tat a door trump its it is interesting that ou know one species of animal it et such divergen neral circuitory it is almost feels is by design and every single topic would find tension and division it is as fastining to watch a me i got to really witness it from zero to a hundred in you crane where there is not huge significant a division there was in certain parts of you crane but a cross europe across the world there wis not that much division between russian you crane and if he was just borne overnight this intense hatred an you see the same kind of stuff with with fauchy over the pandemic at first we are all kind of holi huddled and uncertainty kind of there is it to gatherness with a pandamic of course there is more difficult as your isolated but then you start to figure out the the probably the politicians in the media trys to got how can i take a side here and how can i now start reporting on this side or that side and say how the other side is wrong and i think i think fauchy in is is a part of just being used as escape go for certain things as part of that kind of narrative of of division but i think trump is a singular figure that to me represent something importan an american history iam not sure what that is but i i think you have to think you put on your historian hat go forward in time and think back a cowwill he remember be remember twenty thirty forty fifty years from now who is the opposite of that ah you have to i i i would really have to think about that because because trumpas singular i think ale sees an interesting one but she young and son clear to know how what if she represents a legitimate le a lart scaled movement or not burny sanders is an interesting option but i wish he would be thirty forty years younger the young burney would be a good there are scientists working on that ye i think a not hems pecifically but well ye i it may be him we we never now there is a big conspiracy thery that pudness a that is that is a te body double it is no longer thes u u har tim erturn conspiracy there is non a that a the pudnuci an camera to day is a body double one thing that you knowin in sciencin in particular in anatomy there is a classification scheme for different types of anatamus which they either say you are a lumper or a splitter have some people to call a whole structure something not in the silly just for simplicity but for lot of reasons and then other people to micr divide the neucleas intomultible names and of course people used to be able to name different brainstructures after themselves sother be the the neucleus of laxan that and the the the huberman fasiculus or whatever less of that nowadays but and by the wy those structures do not actually exist just a yet a we have not one to find those yet that was making those names up but what is interesting is it seems in the last five years there is been a lot of tret there is been a trenscuse me toward a requirement for lumping you cannot say it seems that it is not aloud if you will to say hey ya and here i'm not stating my i'm net i will never reveal my preferences about pandemic related things for hopefully obvious reasons it it some people say vaxines yes but masks know or vaxines and masks yes but let people work and other people say no everyone stay home and then other people say now you kno vaxings do masks let everybody work known was sayng no vaxings no maskes and and stay home i do not think there is this sort of lumping right the the boundaryis around a ideology really did struct to defy science i mean it was not scientific it was one part science ish at times and sometimes really hard courte science other times it was politics economic ham ming we really saw the confluence of all these different domains of society that use it very different criteria to evaluate the world i mean i as a scientists a remember when the vaxines first came out and i i ask somebody one of the the early concerns i had that was actually t satisfied for me was how does this thing turn off a yeu starc ou generating in mar nay how is actuall get turn off i asked to fr and you knw they know a lot about are an abiology and tha you has tit turn off they explained it to me on the oke make sense ask some other questions u but most people are' going to think about it at that level of detail necessarily but it did seem that there was a just kind of amorphos bl obs of ideologe he that they grabbed on to things and then there was this need for a chasm between them there it was almost felt it became e legal in some ways to want two of the things from that men you wen one of the things from that men you i really felt i was being constrained by a kind of ben to box model where i did not get to define what was in the bento box i can hear at bat toa box ey or bento box to ze but nothing in betwaing it and i think i an that topic and i think a lot a topics most people are in the middle with humility on certainty in ther juscona trying to figure it out and i think there is just the extreme defining a the nature of this division i think it is the role of a lot of us in our individualie and also if your if you have a platform of any kind i i think you have to try to walk in the middle with ampathy in humility and that is actu what science is abouts is the is a humility still thinking about who is the opposite of trump i a it maybe it is not i me maybe a fou he is or thoginal to to trump i mean i not everything has an opposite i miang is a maybe he is an en of one maybe he is in the minority of one because he was an outsider in ut from washington who then mde i there but also i wonder e i you have to pict youre battles because every bow you fight you should take very seriously and just the mon of hate i get i got and i still get for having sat down with the fiesor seo thot's a very valuable lesson for me will that one was got yue lot a heat tes still does cause s you had some some pretty controversial guess on i'm ttat one that on on is he still tifiser see i believe sol seeos turn over crazy this a thing i did not rise here and in sine o somebody moves institutions a big deal most people do not have more than two moves in that in their career may be but the often you hont moved to next building is a big deal but it in bile attack it is i have a former collegment from santer when he is been a seeo here theys a see o there is that yeu went back to a company was e seoat before if he is prie back an t universe he worked out for it for all i know it is amazing how much moving around theres is very itinerant profession ye i think there is in certain companies i guess in batak would be the case the the seois more of a the manager types you can some was jumping around benefits your experience ye get but become better and better being a manager there ise some leader revolutionary see els that sthickeron for longer because ther're critical to a piviting a company the mitrosaliceo currently a sound of prachies somebody that a obvy see almusk it is somebody that that is part of piviting a company into new domains constantly buty ind by ateck there is a machine and for in in the eyes af lot of people a big farm a is big tobacco it is a it is the pity me of everything that is wrong with capitalism it is a it is evil i and i showed up in the conversation where i thought with a pretty open mind and really asked what i thought what difficult questions of him i do not think he is ever sat down to a grilling of that kind in fact i'm pretty sure they cut the interview short because of that and i thought literally was hot in the room and wert weating and i i was asking tofg questions for for somebody that half the country were large persent of the country believes he is alleviate a lot of he helped if through the financial resources that that fiser has helped to leave that a lot of suffering in the world and i thought for somebody that i was asking pretty hard questions boy did i get to here from the side usually one of the sides is more intense in o their anger there is certain political topics with a would entertain for example i would i would hear from a very youll probablyby the left far left that would write very angrily and that is a group you here from the fies ar se o i did not get almost any messages from people saying why did you go hard on on him a he is a he is incredible human incredible leader and see all the company that helped helped us with the vacscene and nobody thought would be possible to develop quickly you did not get letters that is not i mean t here and there but the the sea of people that said everything for me being weak that i was not able to call out this person how do sado what he platform this evil person that how you make him look human all that con ostuff and that you have to deal with that yet the of course itis great it i's great because i have to do some soul searching which is did i i you have to ask some hard questions i love criticism that you you get t i hav some low points there is deffeling some despair and you stead to wonder was i too weak should i talk to him what is true you sit there alone and just marinat in that and whopefully overtime thot makes you better buyt still do not know wath the right answer without one is whi feel that money plays a arol here on when people think big farmer they think billions of dollars maybe you trillions of dollars really and certainly people who make a lot of money get scrutiny that others do not part of is tit they are often not always visible but i think that there is a natural and reflects ive an oa're not justifying it a i certainly do not feel this cause i do i know some people who are very wealthy some people are very poor a i cannot say it scales with happiness aat all people are always shocked to to hear that but a it but that is what i've observed in very wealthy people a but that people have a lot of money are often held to a different standard because a people resent that some people resent that and may be a therare other reasons as well i mean among peopl who are very wealthy often times the wish is for a status riht not money you get a bunch of billionaires in a room and unless one of them is elon who is also has immense status for his accomplishments a typically if you put a noble prize wonnn room with a munch of billionaires they are all talking to that person right and they are many very interesting billionaires a but status is a is something that is often but not always associated with money but is a much rarer form of a of uniqueness out there a positive uniqueness if one consider stats positive exthere is a downside too but a i wonder whethere not the fiser see o caught extra heat because people assume and i probably assume also that a his salaryes quite immense ye i because i have a lot of data on thi secund is that is a very good hypothesis wast tust the scientif i he is about tell me it is a great hybothesis but it is wrong i know a smer i know this smer i honest th thing it is wrong there is that effect is there for a lot of people but i think the distrust is not towards the se o the distrust is towards the company one of the really difficult sole searching i have to do which is just having a tract with viser folks at every level from junior to to see o they are all really nice people they have a mission they talk about trying to really help people cas that is the best way to make money is come up with a medicine that helps a lot of people the the mission is clear they are all good people a lot of really brilling people pagdis you can have a system where all the people are good including the seeo and by good i mean people that really are trying to do everything they dedicate their whole life to do good and yet you have to think that that system can a deviate from a path that does good because you start to deceive yourself of what is good euturn into a game where money does come into play from a company perspective where you convince yourself the more money you make the more good you will be able to do and then you start to focus more and more and more an making more money and then you can really deviate and loose track of what is actually good i'm tot saying nesily fiser oes that but i think companies could do that you can apply that criticism the socier me to companies to big farmer companies that one of the big lessons for me that i do not know what the answer is but that all the people inside a company could be good people you would wanto hang out with teople youo on to work with but as the company is doing evil and that is a possibility the the distrust i do not think it is towards the billionaire individual which i do see a lot of in this case i think it is the it is wall street distrust that the machinery of this particular organization has as has gone off track it is the generalization of hate again yet and then you good luck figring out what is true this is the this is the tofstop but i should say the individuals a individual scientists at the ann i h a in in a fiser i just incredible peopl the're ther really the really brilliant peovil thet i never trust the administration or the business people in the offence business people but the scientis are always an that that they they have the right motivator in life but again with they can not blinders on two focus on the science not the germany has history of people just two focus on the science and in the politicians use the scientist to achieve whatever and they want but if you just look narrowly at the the geuraney of a scientists is the beautiful monk aus they altimately in it for the curiosity the moment the discovery versas money wer any prestige probably does comin to play later later in life but especially young scientists thereafter the theit is the pulling at the thread of curiosity to try to discover something big they get excited by that kanistov and his beautiful to se tat is beautiful t see i've a former grages you now a posttockit caltack and in't even nowf she had a self pone shu wud coming to lhaw put herself pone into the a daskan shas tremendously productive but that that was not am why brought it up iw she was productive as a side af fact of just being absolutely committed and obsess to discover the answers to the questions she was asking as best she could and it was you could feel it you ju feel the intensity and ter a just incredibly low activation energy if therese an experiment to do she t go do it your teaching it at my tea you are obviously traveling the world your raing the potcasts a lot of coverage youf chess recently which is interesting i i do not play chassbut i i have some scientific questions do about tha oh ki sure and then let us get to those for sure and then you are not gonnot it oh no o ke and then and then also some some very a doove tospell massachusetts again umworsh h the also you still seem to have a proclivity for finding guest er controversional right you think but tat were tin ut trum for time at the fiser see e o tong a foun che these are ese are in a intends people and say what we are getting folks is a am we are not doing narrow imaging here and the traditional sense of putting someone into a scander what we are doing here is we are using as a the great carl dicer ot who as on your podcast am thank you for i think you for conect as he is an incredible personhe is an incredible psychiatriss by engineere in human being an and all an writer and your conversation with him was phenomenal i i listen to it twice i should have taken notes am we talk about it in this household we really do a his a his description of love is a not to be misse i'll jusleep it it that becaue a i try and say it i will not capture it well but yet we are getting a a a language based am map of a at least a portion of lex freedmens brain here am what else is going on these days in that brain as it relates to robotics a i lor last conversation was a lot about robots in the potential for robot human interaction what it even what is a robot et cetera am are you still working on robots or focaset on robots and where were science showing up in your life besides the things wefore e talked about i think the last time we talked was before you craine yes or you were just about to leave yes that i mean that is what i went on ell yon us might be the last he said you ont come out here before afterals i m no let us see you before you go but i are in the flesh i think us o a lot of tha it is the lot of my mind has been opoccupied obviously with that part of the world but the the most of the difficult struggles that i'm stil going through is that i have not launched a company that i want to launch and the company has to do with a iy i means it may be longa conversation but the ultimate dreamis to put robots in every home but short term i see there possibility of launching socia media company and the it is e nontrivial explanation why that least to robots in the home but it is basely the algrythms that fuel affective social robotics robotsy conform a deep connection with a i'e been really you ave been building prototypes but stroggling that i do not have may be if i were to be critical the gots to to lauge in company or that tim well it is come on i think you have got the gots i man it is clear if you will do an interview with the fizer s oin you'r considering putting this tape fellow on your podcast ang you are gone to the rn ah that you you have the gots i it is also a am it means not i doing i quite a lot of other that is wa i mean but it it dos takes the thing is as many people know when you fill your dayind you are busy that business becomes an excuse that you use against doing the things that scare you a lot people youse family in this way ah my wife my kids i cannot when in reality some of the most successful people have a wife and have kids and have families and they still do it and a lot ime to can fill the day with busy work with a i thlike y of course i have pockes all this kind of sto and they make me happy and there all that are wonderful and a there is resource as teaching is on but all that cane os service an excuse from a thing that my heart says is the right thing to do and a that is why i do not have the gust the gust to say no tobasically everything and tin to focis aal because the part of it is i 'm unlikely to fail at anything in my life corrently caus i've ready foll in a comfortable place with a with a start up its most going to be most likely going to be a failure if not embarrassing failure am well the machine learning data that i'm aware of do not know a lot about machine learning but the within the realm of nurse sine say that a failure rates of about fifteen per cent is optimon for youon neuroplasticity endgrowth whether r not that translates to alll kinds of practices is not clear but getting trials rite eighty five percent of the time seems to be optimal for language learning seems to be optimon for mathematics and seems to be optimo for a physical pursuits iton average rite i'm shomming that it that you have more a machine learning im geeks ont to list en your podcast than liss in this podcas but does not mean he ought to fail on fifteen per cent of your weights tat folks homing it coan be or sixteen per cent now i'm just kidding but the a it is am it is not exact but it but it is a pretty good rule of them i think a lot of start up founders would literally murder for eighty five per cent chance of success i t i think a given all the opportunities i have the the skill set the the funding all that constoff my chances are relidtabe high for success but what relatively high means in the start up world is tho far far below eighty five it is we are talking about single did your percentages most tart ups fail i think it means the decision to folkst on the company not o the things means to decision to close the hatch on dopa mean retrievale from all these other things that are very predictable sources of dopamin im not that everything is dope mean but you nowt do not bemean as i think that the primary chemical driver of motivation and yu know if that you can get some degree of satisfaction from scrolling socia mediar from that particular cup of coffee tht's wha you can do i that is what youare going to consume unless am you somehow invert the agrithem in you im and you say it is iciate my denial of myself drinking that coffee that is gun to be the do not pemean ramtiouthing then an not's the beauty of having a forebrain is that you can make those t cision see know this is the essence i i do believe of what we see of david gogans there is much more there there is a person than none of us know i'm an only he knows of course but the idea that the pain is the source of dope i mean the frt tha lymbic friction as i sometimes to call it is the source of dopeming that runs counter to have most nervous systems work but it was i it is decision base right it is not because his musculature is a certain way or his he had crisper or something it is because he decides that u and i i think that is amazing t it but what it means in terms o starting a company an changing priorities is a closing the hatch on oll where many of the current sources of dopa mean that you can derive you do not la mean from the failures within this narrow contacts and this a very reduction ist view an and no nrow centric view of what we are talking about but i think about this alot i mean the decision to choose one relationship vurstus another is a decision to close down nother opportunities ri i think that the the decision he order one thing off the many uverses others is is decision to close down those other hatches i think that you absolutely can do it it is just a question of can you flip the algarism you hve rymap the source of dope men to something else is and maybe it maybe go out there not to succeed but make tha the journey is the destination tigpht thing but when your financially vested in your time and as far as i know we only get one life at least on this planet and dum you want a spend that wisely i and a lot of that the people that surround you they be people ar really important and i do not have people arow me that say you shoul to a start up it is very difficult to find such people it is ost in big start up cultureit is that is but it does not make sense for me to start up this is what the people that love me my whole life have been telling me does not make sense what you what you do in ri now just do the thing you are doing previously why do i get the sense that because they are saying this yere ap to go on i shaps never that unfortunately unfortunately i need a i've talk to people i love that my parents family an on friends i'm wont of those people that needs unconditional support for difficult things the kin know myself coaching wise i it is good to i shears how i get coach best let say wrestling i a coach that says o you want a win the olypics they will not for k if i say i want to when the gold men at the olympics and feastal wrestling i i want a coach that does not blink once and hears me and believes that can do it and then is viciously intense and cruel to me on the on on that pursuit i if you want to do this lets do this i but that is support that ik that positivity i do not i'm never a ou know i'm not energized nor do i see that as love a person saying rasey criticizing that ik saying yuyou are a you are too old to win the inleegold metel ray youuld all the things you can come up with that is not helpful to me and i cannot find a dulpomen or i have not yet a dulpman source from the the haters basicy people there criticizing you just trying to prove them wrong i it does not a it never got me off i never a wher some people seem to that i mean david gogins it seems to come al way seems driven by many sources that he has access i do i do not know as i've never asked him but i i if i were to venture agas i'd say that he probably has a lot of options inside his head is to how to push through challenge not just overcome pain not but but he will post sometimes about the fact that you do not people will say this or people will do this and it and and talk about the push back approach he will also talk about am the pushback approach that is purely internal that does not all of any one else great versatility there yeother's at there is literally a voice yyells at that represents some kind of a thike devil that wants him to fail and he is te o he calls him bitch and all kinds of things thaing ye'll fuck you i'm not i'm not he is there is always an enemy and he is going against that enemy and i wish may be that something i means really interesting maybe you can remap it this way that you can construct that is of kind of obvious mechanism construct a amorphos blob that is a hater that wants you to fail i thi's kind of the dav oi gogans thing you are in tat that that blobs as you are too weak you are too dom you are you are too old you are too fat you to whatever and getting you to want to quit and on and then you star getting angry at that blob it may be that is a good mot of eitr i have not personally really tried that elli've had external ch you knon want am challenge when i was a posstock a very prominent laboratory several prominent laboratories in fact we are working on the same thing that i was and i was a slowly posttalk working on at project pretty independent from the lab i was in and am there was competition but there was plenty of room for everybody to win but in my head and frankly i will not disclose he this is and and because there was some legitimate competition there and a little bit of friction not not too much healthy scientific friction am i might have pushed a fow extrahours or more i little bit i have to say it felt metabolizing it felt catibal right it did not a i could not be sustained by it and i contrast that with the pod cast or the work that my laboratories doing na ow folks on stressing human performance et cetera and it is pure love i just i want it is pure curiosity in love i am in their hard days but i never there is no adversary in the picture im the're the practical you non't workings of life that without those o thing that jo really inspired me on and people do create adversary relationships in podcasting cause you get you jubers do this they get they hate seeing somebody else be successful there is a feeling of am a jealousy and some people even see that is healthy o this that g mister beast of somebodys someboty's popular you too bersou how do they get hontrmillion views and i only get twenty views mister beas devoted his entipe according to him his entire life he is been fokas on becoming this mass of you to n with that you do not he is inspiring in many ways but thike ther some people they get become famous for doing much less a insane pursuit o fa of greatness an mister beasts this people become famous an on social media and on and it is easy to be jealous of them ma just one of the early things i've learned from joice is being a fan of his pockets is ho much he celebrated everybody and i again i i maybe i room my whold dopen you thing but i do not get energized by people that are they become popular the potcasting space an you to it doesnt it is alsome it is all of it is is alsome and m i'm inspired by that but the promise that is not good motivators inspiration is o cool humans can do this this is beautiful but it is not i'm looking i'm looking for a for forcing function that is what i gave way the salary for y mitee iws hoping my bancon cot at zero that will be a forcing function to lik o shit and i and youe not allowed to have the normal jobs i wanted to lanch and then the podcast becomes a sorce of income and sik contament ye well and here i i have to confess my bias as et you are a you are good at what you do in the realm of podcast and your excellent a other things as well i just have less e o experience in those things i know here i'm i'm taking the liberty of speaking for many many people and jus saying i i i sures hell ho you do not shut down the podcast bot as your friend and tat somebody who cares very deeply about your happiness and your your deeper satisfaction a if it is in your heart's heart to you accompany well then am it do the company and a lot of it i wouldn' even chare characterized as happiness i knon'it you have things that in your in your life but i'm probably the happiest i i i coald possly be right now that is wonderful but the thing is that there is a longing for the startle that has not do with happiness it is a something else they camp that itch that is o on it pretty sure i'll be less happy because it is a really tough process it is it' i mean to whatever degree you can extract happiness from struggle yes maybe but i will not see i i think i'll have some very very low points its a lot of people o who found fine companies found companies know about you are and i also wont to be in relationship i one to get married and sure s how star up is not at it increase the if a the likelihood of that we could start up a family and start a company withot that is i'm ahuge believer in that which is getting a relationship at a low point in your life which is i'm not disputing your stance a nor am i agreeing with it it is jult a every once a while there is a there is a likes freedman ism that am that hit is a particular circuiton mat ni i hasagis laugh out la i just think that it is easy to have a relationship wheneverything is good the relationships that become strong and ar tusted quickly are the ones when when shit is gone down well then there is hope for me easi a before we sat down am i was having conversation with a podcass producer who is a a i would not say avid rather he is a rabid consumer of podcass and finds these amazing podcass as he is am small podcass and ind and unique apisots any way we were talking about am some stuff that he as had seen and read in the business sector and he was talking about am the difference between you job career and a calling right an ni and i think he was extracting this from conversations of a a see yos and founders et cetera am forget this specific founders at a that brought this to light for him but that this idea that if you fokcuss on a job you knw ou can make an income and hope for you enjoy your job or not hateit too much a careeris is represents a sort of in my mind a cound of series of evolutions that one can go through rejunior professor ten yar et cetera but a calling has a whole other am level of a a energetic pull to it because it includes career and job and includes this concept of sort of a life it is it is very heard to to draw the line between a calling in career and a calling in the other parts of your life the question therefore is do you feel a calling to start this company or is it i borne of a compulsion that am irritates you is it something you wish would go away there as it someoe that you that you hope wi will not go away now i hope it will not go wha it is a calling it is a calling it is aito hopful it is e ti when i see a roba when i first interacted with robos and it became even stronger the most sophisticated the robots i interacted with i see a magic there and you are you look around does any one else see this magic i it is it is connolice may be when you fall in love that that feeling the the sany one else notice this person i just walk in the room i feel that way about robats and i ican elaborate wit that means but i'm not even sure i can convert into words i just feel the social integration of robots in society will creat a really interesting world and our billy to ant the promorphies when we look at a robat and or billy to feel things when we look at a robat is something that most of us do not yet experience but i think everybody will experience in the next few decades and i i just want to be a part of that exexploring that because it has not been really thoroughly exexplored the best robotisis in the world are not cornly working on that prom at all they they try to avoid human beings completely and nobody's really work in that promin turms when youook at the numbers all the big teck companies thatr investing money the closest thing too that is elex a and a basically being a serbent to help to tell you the weather play music and on it is not trying to form a deep connection and i i is vas you just notice the thing not not only do i notice the magic there is a got feeling which i try not to speak to because there is no track record but i feel i can be good at bringing that magic out of the robat and there is no data that says i would be good at that but there is a feeling is just a feeling i when i ecause hive done many things i love doing bu plan guitar all that constov a geget i've never felt that feeling when i doing to gesa i do not feel th the magic of the genius require to be extremely good i guitar i do not feelany of that but i've noticed it in others great musicians they will they they notice the magic about the thing they do and they and they ran with it and i just always thought i think you had a different form when i before i you robots existed before a existed the form was o more about the magic between humans the i i think of it as love but the smile the two friends have towards each other when i was velly young and people would be excited when they first noted each other an see notice each other and thereis that moment that they share that feeling together i elose well that is really interesting it it is really interesting that these two separate intelligent organisms are able to connect allson on this deep emotional level it is it is it is a is just beautiful to see and i notice the magic of that and then when i started a programming programming period but then programming aa systems you realize oh that could be that is not just between humans and humans that could be humans and other entites dogs a cats in robats and that i for some reason it hit me the most intensely when i robuts ye it is is lik calling but it is a calling thats i acting just in joy the a the vision of it the vision of a future world of an exciting future world is full of cool stuff or i can be part of building that and part being part of building that means doing the hard work of capitalism which is raising funs from people a which for me i know is the easy part and then hiring a lot of people i know commuch behiring but hire and hi excellent people excellent people that will define the trajectory of not only your company but your whole existence as ha human being and in building it up not failing them because now they all depend on you and not failing the world with an opportunity to bring something something that brings joy to people and all that pressure just non stop fires the if tho put out the drama the having to work with people workit lawyers and the human resources and supply chain and and a because his is very coma compute heavy the infor short the computin for structure managing security sibre security is because you are dealing with people's data thot yef to understand not only the ahthe sibast security of data and the privacy how to maintain privacy correctly with data but also the psychology of people trusting you with their data and what is how how if you look at magxakeburg and jock dorsyin those folks they seem to be hated by a large number of people the jackson i did not i most leii think i always think of jack is a as a loved individual but o wel that yet you have a very positive i mat my jack alot and i i his mind and i am some one close to him i described him to me recently as he is an excellent listener that is what they said about jack and that that is my experience of him too a very private persons wel lieve it at that by em i lis te ig i think jack dorcy is am one of the one of the greats of our a of the last two hundred years and it is just much quieter it om about his stands on things and a lot of people but much of what we see in the world that is wonderful i think am we owe him in debtor gratitude i'm just it voicing my stance here but n the person is really important ye a wonderful person aa brilliant pr erson a good person bu you still have to pay the price of making any kind of mistakes as the head of a company you do not get any extra boness points for being a good person but his willingness to go on roguan and o you'ld directly and say i do not know an answer to that in some cases but to deal directly with some really challenging questions to me earnt him tremendous respect yes is an individual he was still part of hem is you you have said your kand i love jack to and i interact withm a has been on your potgast yes but he is also part of a system as we talked about and i would argue the jack should not have brought any one else with him on that potges if you os are ye at a cadrof of oh he had o i guess o tho the legal of the head legal a with him and also it requires a tremendous amot of skill to to go on a pocgas ik jorogan and be able to win over the trust of people by being able to be transparent to communicate how the company orea he works because the more you reveal about household hor me t o company works the more you open up for security the the vector of attax increases also there is a lot of difficult decisions and terms of censorship an not that are made that if you make them transparent you going to get an order of magnitude mor hate save to make all those kinds of decisions and i think that is one of the things i have to realizes you have to take the a that avalanche of potentially hate if you make mistakes will you you hav a very clear picture of this architecture of what is required in order to create a company of course there is division of labor too i mean you do not have to do all of those things in detail but finding people that are excellent to do om the you do not to run the critical segments or a it is obviously key i'll just say what i said earlier which is if it is in your heart's heart to start a company n if that indeed is yourecalling in it sounds it is then i cannot wait does the heart have a heart well at expressing mot probably not on romante's my latom point early days we worked on cuddlefish and they have multable hearts and they but they pump green blood believe in not very fastening animal a speaking me of a hearts and om green blood earlier to day before we sat down i solicited o for questions on insteram in a brief post you ant a if you will look at some of them yes lets think he is in t e real time i podcastim is always teasing me that i never have any charge from my phone mon these people likes to run in the a run in the yellow or wherever it is and i thougt on yed have manyhouse always the i fond people are out abattery wywe are ot a new one we in this one has plenty of battery i just got a new one i've i've different numbers for different im things personal work et cetera u i'm trying that now im all right get in to the iv i've a chest think tur to mention to oh yes please it will i in sault you if i if i look up these questions as you ha no no but i will in soll you by asking isi thing is hilarious there is up bin a controversy about cheating an can hans neman who is a twenty seven honr player oh ya i ces a liting lip on your eclips chantlan by the way a love your clips cannel and i listen her fols chanel the big accusation i is that he cheated by having i mean it is is have joke but it is startantt getting me to wonder whether m that you can cheat by having vibrating anal beads you can send messages to i let't rephrase that statement not you can but one can one can the on cannot you now's a personal attack yes but is made me realize i ma i much sia just my tera i use it all the time for pacasting send myself messages i do remind me myself of notes a but it is interesting i mean it it ti i'm not going to call you again yes that is exactwere i keep my phone the thither it it did get me down this whole rabbit whole of well how would you be able to send communication u in order to cheat indifferent sports in me that does not even have to do with thum chess in particular but it is interesting chest and poker that thereis u there is mechanisms sat of modern day where your streaming live the competition people can watch an on tv if they can only send you a signal back i they it is it is just a fund little thing to think about and if it is possible to pull off i i want to get your scientific a i valuation is that to cheat using some sort of intereceptive device li ya vibrating a sunkand yan well i no no that is one way to senc the els is li morsco adbasically yes there is a famous i believe there is a famous real world story of physic students i monty get some of this wrong i'm saying this in kind of a course form that somebody will correct this but im i believe it was physics graduate students from you see santecrus or somewhere else may be is caltac bunchy universitys that no one associates with any one universy that went to vagus and use some sort of tactile device for kind of i'm coward counting i think this was ashy demonstrate also not this particular incident i do not think in the movi casino where there wit they were they spotted a i remember roberto ero whoy you have a i'm not vague resemblance to by the way intaxy driver not i wish i had it ggot your impression ry now travas bickle look it out folks trav as bickle as if likes evereshade to said ntom i would they yet a a tapping device on his ankle that was signaling someone else was counting cards and then signaling to that person yet that could be done in the tactile way it could be done obviousy ear pieces if it is deep eur piece i think that their ways that they look for that certainly any kind of vibrationall device in whatever orifice provided someone co pay attention to that wil on playing the game yet i think it is it is entirely possible now could it be done purely nurlly could there be something that was a and listen it would not have to even be below the skull this is where whenever people here about nurrw lank or brain machine inner face they alway think how you have to drill down below the skull and put a chip ble o into te skull think there are people walking around nowadays with am glucosmandering devices levels which i've used and was very in formative for me actually as a kind of an experiment give me lot of interesting insights bout my bloodshriger regulation how it reactid from foods et cetera well you can in plants a tactile device below the skin with a simple incision extul one of the narrow surgeons at nurrl link i i know well because he came up at some point through my laboratory and was at stamford and he actually has put in a radio receiver an his hand and his wife has it too and he can open locks and at of his house and things that yeu uneto e skin under the skin ye you can go to that work how to you u here sir you go to a a a body perscer type person and they can just slided under there and and it is got a battery life of something and some fairly long duration how do you experience the tact a a e haptics oh know that there is allows him to open certain locks with just his hand but you can easily put some sort of tactile device in there but this hav to connected the nerves ors is just just ifi brio just vibration and you can probably sensit even if it is end the c and it can be by who can be blue tooth linked i i've seen there is a a engineering laboratory at the universiy of ellinois champagne a rbana that is got an amazing device which is about the size of a bandate it goes on the clavicals and it uses am sound waves pinged into the body to measure cavitation ithink about that this for a moment this is being used in the military where let us a youre leading an operation or something people are getting shot shot at and on a laptop you can see weare the bull at entry points are our people dead ore they bleeding out a entryex it points you can get if take it out of the battle field sinarra you can get breathing body position twenty four hours a day there is much that you can do looking at cavitation these same sorts of devices on twelve hour blue tooth could be used to a send all sorts of and mak may be every time am your s puss to hold your hand i'mi'm not a good gambler i only play re that when i go to vagis because i you just long boring and you kdo not games we get to u get some good milege out of each out of each rounusually but the am maybe every time you spusst a hold the person get sort of a stomach sinching because this is the inostimuling the vaguest a little bet in they getable of it of make it does not have to be am morse code it can be yes no maybe writing an e begou be i green red yellow type signaling it does not have to be very sophisticated give somebody a significant advantage en i have not thought about this in detail on before this conversation but oy others in an immense lin tis ar enough a pokcoplar named pillivy no id i do not follow the gambling what the us h is considered to be one of the greatest pokers players of all time legenemally it ol he just incredibly good but he gots a there is as big case where he was accused of cheating and prove an it is not really cheating which is withs really fascinating is it turns out a ye place poker at tecas hold i mostly but n all kinds of poker it turns out that the the grid on the back of the cards is often printed e litibate imperfectly and you can a use the asymmetery of the perfections the try to figure out certain cards if you play and you remember that a certain card is tik i think the at in that deck that he was accused of and ait and nine wuld slightly different a symmetry wise he can now a ask the deal actil to rotated to check the symmetery youd ask the dealer to rotate the card to see that there is to detect the a symmetry of the back of the card and now he knows which cards ar aits and nines and or likelier to be aits and nines and he wa using that information to play to play poker and whin a lot of money but it is just a slight advantage and a his cases and in fact the judge foldness that he is not actually cheating but it is not right you cannot use this kind of exorinformation that it is fascining you can discover these little holes and games if you pay close enough attention yot it is it is fascinating and i think that on youi i did watch that clip about the potential of a cheating event in chessan and and the fact that a number of chestplayers admit to cheating at some point in their hareer very very interesting on lines on line cheatingis easier ight when you are playing un line cheating in a game where the machine is much better than he human it is very difficult to prove that youare human and that applies by the way another really big things and social media the bots to if youre running a social meticom ny have to dea with the bots and they become one of the really exciting things and mushin learning an artificial intelligence to me is they sthe very fast improvement of language models you ale not works the generay tect the interpretex the generate from text images and all thie can astuff but that is you are now cing to create credible bots that look awfully a lot humans wetl least then i can be those cripto bots that seeme to populate my comment section when i post anything on in sryam i thually to leap those even though they add to the common ah roster and if i ithey bother me much is i spending at least ten fifteen minutes on each pose just to leading those i do not know what they need to do but i'm not interested in em those and whatever it is their offering am speaking of none bots im man assume t all the questions ar are not from bots there a lot of questions hereo i more than ten thousand questions goodness o i'll just take a few are working from top to bottom am what ideas have you been wrestling with lately and i sthink about the the company as one but as i scroll to the next what ar ur what are some others alsome of the things we talked about which is om a the ideas of holite you understand what is true what is true about a human being how to reveal that how to reveal that the conversation how tochallenge that properly that at least to understanding not divirsion that that applies to everybody from dol trump to latimer puden also another idea is there is a deep distrust the science and trying to understand the growing distrust the science trying to understand what is the role of those of us that have a a foot in scientific community how to be how to regain some of that trust also there is a i thinks we talked about the how to find in how to they howt how to find how to maintain a good relationship me that is really been i've ve never felt quite as lonely as i have this year wen you crain it is just many times i would just lay there in just feeling deeply alone because i felt that is my home not my home literally cause i'm an american i love i am a proud american at i'll die in american but my home in the sense of my degenerationally my families home is now going is not has been changed for ever there is no more being proud of being from the former rushiar you crane is not just it is now a political message to say if if you orh to to show you pride and has been extremely lonely within that world if yuwith all the things on pursuing how do you find as successful lacho has been that is been taught probviously and there is a husion of technical ideas with a start up how the healdy make this thing work well tit the relationship topicis when we talk lubit about and last time we be touched on ntetn bit more detail am we are nt come back to that a ams i amit a note here ah what or who inspired lack you to wear a suit every time you pat gess that is a good question i do not know the answer that the too too ance is that question one is a suit and too is a black suit and black tie as i used to do i ease to have more variety which is there i's those those of black suit but i would sometimes to a red tie ind a blue tie now that was most in me trying to fit into society cas varieties youre supposed to have some variety what inspired me is a at first was a general culture that that does not take itself serious in terms of how you present yourself to the world in academi in the tack world just at gugo everybody was wearing pajamas and a very relaxed in in thattack i do not know how it is in the scigns in the chemistry by all genstl on but in a computre science everybody was very i mean very relax in terms of the suff they wear i wanted to try to really take myself seriously and take every single moment serious an everything i do seriously and the suit made me feel that way i do not know how it looks but made me feel that way and i think in terms of people i look up to tha war suit that made me think of that is i's probably rish our fineman i see i wonderful you man b is i seem as the epity me of class and humour and brilliance and you knon't obviously ii can ever come close to that kind of vam a you will be able to simply explain really complicated ideas and to have humour and whit but deafnly aspired to that and then there is just th madman that whole air of the fifties a classiness of that there' something about a suit that both a removes the importance of fashion from the character you see the person i think a a not to i forgot who said this might be cocoshan alis on me this is that you dryou a wear a shabby dress and every one sees the dress you wear a a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman in that sense i os i hope ile quoting that correctly but a that is good i i think there is a sense in which a simple classy suit a lowst people to focuss on your character andnd do with a fool responsibility of that this is why am and ell of that and i i love what you said just prior to that my father who again has always asked me why i do not dress formerly you do ah always said to me growing up if you overdress slightly at least people know that you took them seriously it is u i a sign of respect for your audience to it in my eyes am some one asked is there an a i equivalent of a psychodelics and i i'm assuming thy mean i is there something that machines can do for themselves in order to alter their narl circuitory through unconventional accavation patterns yes obviously well i do not know exactly howspsycadelic's work but you you can see that with th all the diffusion models now with dolly and the stable diffusion degenerates from text art and there isa is basically in a small injection of noise ainto a system that has a deep representation off visual information is able to convert dtext to art in in introducing uncertainty to that a noisinto that that kindit may be i could see that as a parallel toe psycadelics and is able to create some icredible things from a from a conceptiale understanding of a thing it can create incredible art that no human i think could have at least easily created through a bit of introduction of randomness randomas does a lot of work in the machine learning world just enough thereare a lot of am request of you for relationship a lot of requests about statistics about you data about you specifically am flipping past those am what was the hardest belt to achieveint ugitszo i would have assume the blackbelt but is that actually true no i ma everybody has a different journey through jugius o as people know for me the black bell was the ceremonial belt which is not usually the case because i fought the wors i trained twice a day for i do not know how many years seven eight years i competed not stop i competed against people much better than me i compet against many and beaten many blackbelts and brownbelts i think for me personally the hardest bell was the the brown belt because for people who know jugest to the the size of terma divisions for bluebelts and probablts is just humonges worlds when i competed a world it was a hundred and forty people in division which means you have to win i fon get how many times but sevent eight nine times in a row to to to metl and i just had to put in a lot of work during that time and especially for competitors instructures usually really make you earn about the to to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult e uingly difficult and hem to ern the brown belt means i had to compete nonstop against other purple belts which are young you talk about lik the people you should compete are twenty three twenty four twenty five year olds theyre shredded incredible cardio they can for some reason are in their life wort they can nok kits nothing they can dedicate everything to this pursuits of their training two three four times a day died is on point you are going and for me because a ye there usually bigger and toler han me and just more grassiv actual good athles ye i had to go to the lot of wors to earn that brown belt but hey had a tr tis yu jos you thin yi should but'no i try you i did to one class but i i really want to the junten brasa as many pursuits legugets or a different iyou doing your twenties and thirties and later it is i gits a different you cannot you are not you can have a bit of a nego in your twinties you can have that fire under you but you should be set of more zen and wise and patient a later in life well one would hope a that is the wisdom i think rogan is still a meet head you still goes hard and crazy and he still supercompetitive on that some people can and jocces someboding that but whatever they are doing theyre doing something right me as ther're still in it and athat is superimpressive there were afar too many questions to ask all them but a several if not many ask o highly appropriate question for where we are in the ark of this discussion and this is one a admittedly that you ask an your pod cask a all the time but i get the great pleasure of being in the the question asker seat to day a and what is it your advice the young people su just gave a lectun ar my tea and i the amount of love i got there is incredible and of course whit you are who your talking to is usually undergrads may be young graduars tons and there one person did ask for advice a as a question at the end of the much of cunet my answer was a that the world will tell you to find a work balance to a to sort of explore to try to a try difference yeals to see what you really connect wis a variety general education all that connistov and i said in your twenties i think you should find one thing your passionate about and work harder at that than you work that anything else in your life and if it destroys you destroys you that is advice for in your twenties i do not know how universally true that advices but i think at least give that a chance sacrifice real sacrifice towards a thing you really care about and work your assov thats said i've meant many people and i'm starrying to think that advice is is best applide or best tried in the engineer disciplines especially programming i think thereis a bunch of disciplines in which you can achieve success with much fewer hours an it is much more important to actually have a clarity of thinking in great ideas and have an energetic mind thike the grind in certain disciplines does not produce great work i just know that in computer science ofd programming it often does some of the best people ever tha have built system have programme systems i usually the john carmac kind of people that drink sota piza and programme you now eighteen hours a day i do not know actually you you have i think really go discipline specific my advice applies to my own life which has been mostly spent behind tat computer and for that a you really really have to put in the hours and what that means as essential yo feels a grind i do recommend that you should at least try it in your own that ta if you interview some of the most accomplished people ever i think if they are honest with you they are ging to talk about their twenties as as a as a journey of a lot of pain and a lot of really hard work i think what really happens a unfortunately is a lot of those successful people later in life will will talk about work balls they will say what i learned from that process is that it is really important ah to get a son in the morning to have health to have good relation shire or not a tea exactly i think you have forgot those people have forgot ton the value of the journey the took to that lesson i think work life balance is best learn the hard way i my my my own perspective there ise certain things you can only learn the hard way and you should learn that the hardway the as that that is definy advice and i should say that i admire people that work hard if you want itwill get on my good side i think here are the people they give everything they got towards somethin it does not tual matter what it is but towards achieving a excellence in a thing i that is that is the highest a thing that we can reach force human being i think is excellente that a thing i lov it well speaking of excellence at a thing wheather not its teaching it at my tea or the pod cast or the the company that resides and the mere future that you create un i i once again im i speaking for an enormous number of people that excellence and hard work certainly are woven through everything that you do every time i sit down with you i begin and finish with a such an immense feeling of joy and appreciation and gratitude and it would not be elec freedman podcast or and case of lexrymen being a guest on a podcast if the word love were not mentioned at least ten times a the feelings of gratitude for all the work you do for taking the time here to day to to share with us what you are doing your thoughts you are insides here on what your perplexed about and and what drives you and and your callings every topom yes please it would has try to cut me off but witho wit geting a in long a this is a ust think it about this reason is one o my favourite rober frostpoems and i a caus i wrote several essays on it as you do cause i think it is a popular one that is read and essays being trying to interpret poetry and it is one that is thicks with me i man both is calm beauty but in a seriousness of what it means because i ultimately think it is the a ta i stopping by woods and a snowy evening i think it is ultimately a human being a man asking the the old sisif as the old comminal question of why live i think this poem even though does not seem it is a question of a man contending with suicide and choosing to live whose whose woods these are i think i knowg his house is in the village though he will not see me stopping here to watch is woods fill up with snow my little horse must think it queer the stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the yair he gives this harness bells a shake to ask if there is some misstake the only other soms the sweep of easy wind and downy flake the woods are lovely dark and deep but i have promises to keep ad miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep the woods representing the darkness the comfort of the woods representing death and e's a man choosing to live i think about that often especially my dark darker moments is ah youave promises to keep thank you for having me andrew your beautiful human being i love you brother i love you brother thank you for

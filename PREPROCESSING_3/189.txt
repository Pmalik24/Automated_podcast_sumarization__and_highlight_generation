into the open ocean nans of somemer different from what she would planned on that is in a minute nchicaco buve a gratio when he progam continues tis merican life my re glass to day's programme of course stories of people and as sho here not just people who get thrown off the very cuer course tat their lives were on and then have to invent what there going to do next we have arrived at at two of our programme a too sink hernie swimmers son the ocia when you get off course there are all kinds of dangers at dface it just are not there when you are a dry land fe be judge as a story when you see some of that she is tost of this is love potcast wer reversion of the story first rown when lincok was a tea nature she was a competitive long distance ocean swimmer six days a week she would wake up early to swim it a beach nearher house in southern california sibically she would been back and forth in the deep water betwen a really long pier and a stone jetty she was training for a twenty one mile swim it was march and i was seventeen years old and i was ciming for a morning swin it was before the sun had risen and the water was pitchblack i started swimming between the sibysh pier and the jetty a sof my plan was just to go in and and stretch out and swim for an hour and be done and then go hang out with my high school friends but and i started swimming and as i got close to the pier i felt the water holling out around me meaning i could feel something underneath pulling meford felt some hing really big was swimming below and in my mind up thinking all my gosh is it a seal lik know it is to big for seala sicho kas it a dolphin no it is not a dolphin and then i that onl my got could it be a sharp what is this below me in this is most people's biggest nightmare on earth that they would be swimming in the later and that they would feel something large underneath them i think that is normal to be scared a me when you cannot see anything below but you can feel something iand you can also not just feel the motion but the presence of something but when you do these long swims you have to keep your mind under consrol because you freek out than you are out of a swim i kept talking to myself and sang o ka you are not sure what it is just move closer to shore i i swam closer a sure but this thing kept swimming round near me the water kept getting hollowed out and i realize that whatever was there was still there and it had not gone away and i was just ready to turn and race out of the water but there was an old man name steeve who worked in the bat shop on the pere and he sort of watched over me and watch what was going on with the water and i could see him sstanding under a light on the peer waving toward me to come to swim out to him and he yelled at me and said len come here there is a baby whale swimming with you yo see you stick your head out of the waterand he is waving and he and he says there is a baby whale yes he said a baby wale and i really i've never seen a baby wale in the while before he told me that the baby whale had lost ho mother and needed to stay with the baby whale why did you need to stay with a baby whale why could not you get out he was afraid that if i turned to go to sure that the baby whale of fall me and possibly could run aground but he also thought that know mabe the baby whale will just swim off and be totally lost his i dea was that you just need to stay with tha bab whale it can be dangerous for baby whales to be supperated from their mothers therre prediters around sharks and also young whales are totally dependent on their mother's milk to survacht a while back there is a story about a baby whale getting lost he tried to suckle on a yacht that sense of being lost wit something i related to with ha baby whale is it is it easy as a swimmer to get off course yes hend i think the thing that most people do not know about when you are in the ocean if you get lost and you tri to continue going you start swimming ana huge circle and that makes it more difficult for any one to find you and the mother may not find the baby ever at this point lindstill could not see the baby wale beneath her in the water she only saw bits in pieces of it swimming you could only see part of them me you could not see his whole head or face ye to saw the the on his back and the baby gray wale than surfact and he swam over toward me ye wis scary it was cry caus he was big and i was not sre how to deal with him i mean how do i inther act with a whale seeve though was calm and and a sure that it was just find to be in the water with a baby that i thought well he knows he is this old guy thats spen out here for ever and he knows everything about the ocean i will do what he told me to do as and i'll just stay out here with his wale until we find his mother stev got on the radio to all the fishing boat captains and life guards along the coast and told them to keep their eyes out for a large gray whale traveling north he told lynne to swim back towards the jetty once she got to the jutty she turned around and swam back to the peer again the baby stayed wither we were sort of side by side or he was right underneath me or im very very close and at one point he just rolled over and looked right at me and it was just the most a masingthing in the world because i felt he sees me and i see him and were together ol bag is a baby gray wales eye it was sort of im the siyes i'd say o a plum or a orange it' it is large and it was dark dark dark brown almost black did you try to talk to him were you talking to him yes yes yes aet i as as if he would understand but end i told the baby o kay and that things things will work out and well find his mother and i'm thinking i my gash he cannot understand my wors but maybe understand the feeling or thy intention they swam for an hour then another hour lynne started to wonder if it was even possible for the mother to find the baby howd he find something in the ocean she got scared that the mother might never be coming she got scared that the mother could be dead maybe the mother was dead some people had gathered on the pier with steeve to watch what was going on and the fishermen out in boats were all talking to each other on the radio one of them reporded seeing the large gray whale swimming near an oile rig about a mile and a half off shore and then as though the baby wale was listening to the radio it abruptly turned and started swimming in the direction of the oile rig normally lynde would not swim out into the open ocean without a boat or somebody near her but she decided to follow he made a point of swimming rait in front of me n in a little bit below i could swim in slip stream and i thought wow i that he learn that from his mother i bed when they were migrating nors he was in her slip stream and enable an enabled him to swim much easier thand then against the strong currents and it was i si col me becaus i was hardly moving at all my harms and i was just flying through the water and i just thought wow an i ke know i at times i tried to think about how does he see me and he must have thouht horrible swimmer she is yey jus ses just beautiful elegant graceful in the water and just move effitlessly and i just on di kik of is if is then his tail tin is fluk and he would just move and here i was struggling with my arms it was just he probaay thought i needed help by this time lyn had been in the water with the whale for almost four hours a strun a swimmer as lynde was she did not how much longer she could be in that cold water they swam towards the oile rig for a while but did not see the other whale and lynde realized she would have to make a decision soon ou know i was used to swimming a very long distances but i at their points along the way where i was getting tired and cold because he know i was not swimming at my normal speed i was tretting water i was wondering where hwale was going cause he was suddenly diving down deep into the water and i think it was about a for and half hours or five hours into this time out there in the water i was getting rether cold and i realized that i was putting myself in danger now that i could go into hypithermia and if i got hypithermea that i could become really disoranted and i could also fast out in the water it was five hours a swiming around and not rally going anywhere i'm i decided that i really needed to start getting back toward the peer she turned around and swam back toward the peer the whale stayed wither then lyng saw a long beach life gard boat coming towards her at full speed and when it reached her the lifeguard told her she was out too far then hy told her something else a commercial fishing boat had spotted a solow whale only a half mile from the peer we are len usually swaim that the whale was now swimming in their direction kept thinking ow my gi please let and somehow hear her i hopefully she is making some kind of noise that he can understand that she is approaching her maybe he is doing something that she is hearing ou know the cry of the baby i'm to come and find him even though this is what she would been hoping for len did not quite know what to do full si's gray wales can be fifty feet long and we ninety thousand pounds oh i would have gotten i would have been hi wouldhave con to b you gf you get never vis about this mother coming i was really heris cause i gain it was do i stay an the water do i get out of the water do i stay with the baby wou do i do and i thought well my intention all long has been good and and the baby recognizes that and hopefully there communicating and she will understand that ou know this has been a good thing and what happened when she actually swam over to us she came over very very slowly and did not come really close to me initially but a few minutes later she came right next to me i'm and ou know when in when a mother wale comes next you it is a bluss puling up beside you and i'm i back away 'm because i was afraid i mean the animals forty feet lon forty five feet long i'm and to be in the water was something huge it is frightening i mean cause just won push er efin her anything i'm i could be heard i tried to tell myself just be calm just just flowed on the water and and if she does not want you around you will know that very quickly i saw them together and i'm it was one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen in my life to see the mother and baby reunited an mean for five hours we would been out there swimming together and i'm she came over she approached me and she was close that i thought a'm going to touch her i'm just going to do it because because i feel a part of this whole thing and 'm i touched her and i could feel that she felt my hand on her and i'm hi was amazing know cause she was ig and ou know and thand i'm a few minutes later if swam off well ling swam back to the shore the lieguard mether the the cargo ships around lol sangeless harbour knew where the mother and baby were swimming leater bots reported seeing the two join group of whales on their way north when she got back to the beach len as to life guard if she could use the phone to call her pearence tho let them know that her work out had gone longer than she expected and she was on her way home and it was weird though to go from that is always sowere to be in this amazing environment the ocean to then leave it and then go back to okay now an i wen doing threst the day ins ju strange but i did not tell my fearence what had happened because i knew i would have been in much trouble because i was ou're responsible for me to swam off shore without support without people watching the water but i told myself it was really o kay because e no steeve out was out their watching in the life guard throughout their watching and they knew what was going on but om it was still stretch i think now that what i did was pretty om dum but if i was to do it again i'd still te it because i felt it was something i could do a few weeks later lyne found herself off course in the ocean she as trying to set a record become the fastest person to som the cattalinga channel that twenty one mile stretch off the coast of california lynd set out at midnight with a support boat the doory and a coach on a paddleboard beside her on that attempt from cattlin island the fog came in at midnight i get separated from my support boat the doory nd i just had a coach on a padleboard we were lost in the middle of the channel at midnight and there were ship surrounding us and were feeling the bou waves breaking to be lost in the fog where you cannot see more than ten meeters in front of you in the pitch blackness and to feel and to hear ships moting round you is absolutely terrifying and my coach who had had no experience in the open water had told me ju jast keep swimming because eventually the crew would find us but then lyne thought of the baby whal the way the whale even though it lived in the water had lost its way an ended up further and further from its mother lyndon want this to hap in to her she stopped swimming and gave up her attempt at the record she says she ind her coach just ta put bobbing up and down in the water antill eventually her cruw picked them up feby judge a version of this story was won her potcast this is love from criminal and fox media when cox a she interviewed twice one's e record for the fastest crossing of he english channel he is also the very first perston to from across the bearing straight from the nited states to the sevi union just for the reckond by the way it can be illegal to touch a way also iu know doll try thi n the theo i o an s theo a a three the year of manical thinking we we not turn to another father and daughter who get abrupt wy thrown off the path i thought they were on shoved off course and in this case we see the strange places that takes hem to she she was son is a commedian she tells the story it begans when she is twenty four years old tan a momdizes suddenly it happened on a family trip or rehobith beach delaware my parents got there a day before my brother and me and had a nice merried couple's evening bot a tom clancy novel for my dad took a walk on the beach holding hands fell asleep watching sects in the city the next morning my dag got up earlier than my mom and soa i want to to breakfast and gathered up all the papers for her and thand i came back to the rone and low an behold tat just the shock of a lifetime yes i realize the she ah was not doing fery well at all i ma mean that is that is to say the le she was had turn black and blue in the two hours i had gone i and laug in she she ad clearly died in that peried of time from a heard attack my dad paul can be a little detached when he talks about this and it is not just that it is a tough thing for anyone to talk about he has a really hard time talking about his feelings but he is expressive in many other ways to be clear he is a great tat when i was eight he built the stage fror me in the back yard to put on plays and during the finali set off fireworks in the garden he was my girl scout leader till i was seventeen he is got a big personality he is hot peocle lucky generous makes political ads for a living he has friends all over the country people call him the unofficial mayor of our neighborhood and my mam caty was an equally big personality she fought for the equill right's amendment was the youngest chair woman of the national women's political calcas she was an incredibly passion of person the type who could go from angerst laughter in the same sentence extremely funny and really just fun the things she would say before anything we did was let us have a big old time and for her to just be gone suddenly she was only fifty four heven my dad who has a hard time expressing feelings the word he uses is brutal it was absolutely instantly perilize in instantly frightmen and disorein in is state of shock my dad did something really strange something i've never heard of anyone doing well i i remember that i back in the day we had deat filne and i i notice that i had a few image ist left on the roll this was two thousand five and i was sad i was alone with your mamand that ah and i decided to capture the moment am with that with a few stills a what i did not realize is how gruesome i really did look that when life is gone it is gone i dad why was your instinct in that moment to take photoes of mam well i i just felt ut we might want this i turned out we did not want it bat a wen on ad and and tha and have it i thoun these fotoes by accident i was home about a year after she died and flipping through rolls and rolls of photoes my dad tok and intermingled between pictures of thi sophball team were about a dozen photoes of my mam dead and one was a sulphy i threw the on the ground and just remember screaming and crying and my dad saying oops forgot those were on that role i thought who would do this take a selfy with a dead body and then how do you forget you have these photoes and just leave the mout for your kids to find i mean i was equally unmored by my mamstaff i moved a mattress into my closet i set up a shrine to my mam around me and spend hours crying in the darkness of that strange cave but my dad dealt with it very differently he made choices off never understood and we have never spoken about it talking for thes story is the first conversation we have ever had about that time what is art with the funeral my dad became obsass with the idea that we were not only gen a wanit filmed but filmed right he hired a crue to do it as a three camera shoot a t v sit com to make into a d v d that he would give out as stocking stuffers just what everyone once for christmas did give you a sense of how hard cor my dad was about all this when i give my ulogy the sound cut out during the last five minutes he insistent on bringing me into the sown booth at his office to do eigty ar which intevian film as when you re record any dialogue i got mysed up i work as an actress and i've done this many times but to be directed by my father saying too by to my mom was sereal and i had you la re record and i pushed to you a little bit and you wern' into it and alwas very low energy and i said come on casy you have

cry ah i i had you do it with a little more umph and ta we finally got a good dake but why did it feel important t you at tim that is that is a good question just felt that was an act of completion and we needed it a we needed it done the final broducted drop by christmas it was a three and a half hour too parter that i'm guessing not one person watched next my dad decided to quot take the funeral on the road meaning he set up six a ditional funerals in different cities across the country for his friends if the funeral in our home town was the broadway my dat embarked on the national toer he book hotel conference rooms brought along a lifesized photo of my mom and redelivered his own ulogy at some of these there were sixty or seventy people at the time i could not understand why he would put himself through this again and again the way i saw it back then based on his daily updates hes felt less funerals and more huge parties for him i mean a lot of these people mever even met my mom which left me wondering what was the point i wanted her meaning your mam i wanted heard a feel we had really love ter and really cherishter ye did you think it the time you felt more alike i'm doing this a sort of something to keep busy or drive towards or dew instead of mabe feeling ah to me this was feeling and this was how i heeld weeks after my die got back from the funeral tour just three months after my mam died i got a phome call from him i never would have imagined i'd get soon i was driving in alley whre i live and he told me he was going to start dating again then he amended that and said he had actually already started dating again i found it unthinkable how could he possibly be ready to date it felt dishonoring of my mom i've never understood it and never asked why he started dating soon till we had this conversation the way he tells it it is it happened to him this was not what i expected an ant the bar and had my back to the windows and almost sudden ly here pounding on the window and i turn arand and it is somebody i do not know and there motioning for me to go outside i go outside and they instantly stare kissing me do not ask me whas yan may be they had a little too much to drait wait a minute es to croutmen out of the out of the blue and a a yan i go wer telling me a woman kissd you from seeing you in a window yet through the window yes this woman wh s a complete stranger and to my eye a preditor but to my dad this felt a meet cutan when harry met sally not long after that the flood gates opend he started dating every one i mom's good friends mom's first cousin a see span anchor every hon he litterally he asked a woman out he met in a cross walk when i think of my dad at this time it is he was o blurry image he just never stopp to moving some people say that the first year after a love one dies as the worse but for him as he entered year too things ramped up even more he was acting manic he call every day with these new grandeos ideas and big plans that no one could talk him out of at one point he attempt ted to wall paper our living room with wrapping paper because as he told me why pay all that money for wall paper when wrapping paper at the paper source is just as nice he bought a woman in our church new teeth and then there was his hair si walked in do lad the woman had been cutting my hair and a and she was a senior you ko expert and i walk in i said i wont a do something different am i pulld out a twenty dollar bill nd i held it up toer and i said i wont a look this and it is andrew jaction and he has long waves of hair that go back across a i hs eear in an to the back of his haid and i go that is how i want a look this senior expert gave him a large barrel purm he texted me a picture of himself in curlers it is a shock i have never gotten over and one i hope no one else has to go hor then he had a run in with the law one night at a restaurant he picked to fight with a mator de on behalf of an older woman who was not being seated and the cops were called and as they were dragging him out i dad who had not eaten yet managed to rally the whole bar in to throwing nuts and to his mouth shouting nut me as he passed he called me later that night laughing just thinking i would get such a kick out of this story and his great cametic exit line and he was shocked by how concerned i was and just to say my dad was seeing ar grief therepis at the time and unbonounced to me she helped explain what was happening to him the sun loss of his wife had triggeres ta manic behavior it was a reaction to grief she would seen before there is actually a term for this bereavement mania manic behavior caused by the stress of losing a loved one and this kind of mania can happen in people with no other history of med disorders and it can happen just once and not recur but at the time i did not know any of that and i was just horrified by the things he was doing in the places he was showing up our neighbors across the street told him paw come by any time whatever you need the way people do when some one dies and he surded he showed up unannounced in their hottim more than once he told him dad no one once you in their hots op every night these or hard words you are making me sa to you but you are giving me no choice or there is the time someone sold's car and he tried to set up a sting to get it back i was worried about him i tried to get him to come stay with me i could keep an eye on him and when he tactics failed i through fits i cried d he would actually yell stop trying to control me i'm fine he kept trying to explain he was o kat and that in fact he was having fun sometimes i'd felt id lost my mam and my dad and then it all came to aheadat a wedding can we talk about a man dos wetding yewbut ti ii do not think if really relevint her view you do not think a man tis wetting his relevant to the story of your manic phase after romdide we o me you you started off i understand myis hesitant it is the only thing he did during that period that still embarrasses him my dad love is weddings there his superpole it was for my best friend demanda and my dad was the unofficial father of the bride he was also as always filming the wedding those three cammers were back baby we were all on the dance floor outside and he was in his element the life of the party and then suddenly i could not find him to my horror i looked up and found he would made his way into the house where no one was alowed and was standing in this room that overlooked the dance floor he was framed by huge floor to ceiling windows a fish boll and my dad had turned this living room into his own personal stage he was histing up what looked a dead body but it turned out to be a bride's mad he would rolled up in an area rug that just her head was popping out thankfully she was in on the bet he proceeded to bob her back and forth between his arms the way you see guies on the boardrock tried o juggle a stick between two other sticks and then nfortunately he stuck an emptyd beur bottle through the zipper of his pants and pretended to pa everyone was laughing but it was not funny it felt scare to se him that my brother and my friend's uncle and i raced into the house thand we dragged him out across the giant lawn he started putting on this baby voice saying we no want to stop hapving fun just begging us to go back to the party we finally got him to agree to go home and as he was getting on the buss he turned to us and asked if we would hold his cammera equipment for a second he could tie his shail the moment our hands were fully ti a fake out and he took off running back across the lawn jumping over hedges to get to the party yelling i'm fre i' fra turned out the hedges were felled with placenivy which lanted him in the hospital the next tay i did not know until we talked that this moment change something for my dad he realized what am i deaing eir mabe i'm a little out of control a no an tet y and i started to say id better bring it down a couple of notches that nigh really was kind of this turning point for you a that i saidn't i think that was certainly i one that slowed me down and yet which i needed at that point yet i really do think that was also a big moment for me because it was just the moment that i really gave up i was just i cannot control this man any more it does not feel good to do that to you and i also simply cannot i do not think any one can u one other reasonat i wanted to talk to you it because i think when momdied we just grieved her very differently i really was hell bent that you were grieving wrong and i was grieving ride an i'm kind of lang in bed an feeling an your not feeling to my eye how i was well i i think ga it it was just ta different process for me and i i felt ta i felt the grief i but i also felt this compulsion almost to be the funny man ta to live a little bit and ga i at at the same time that therisis tremendous sadness there is this the beginning of aa little iun o freedom it just felt different kind of pleasant tto be free of shackles i guess i sort of the reason i thought it felt wrong to me was even when you say you wanted to f el free of shackles it sort of implies that mom was your shackles as opposed to grieving mom in away and i i do not mean it to be your mom but it was just you mastus the notion a that there were constraints on how all of us live our life and the constraints were off erwhat he means is that when the stable suburban life hed built for himself suddenly shattered he thought if i half to sart ofer then i'm just goin to do m he got this idea i was surprised to learn from someone at my mam's wak the woman who had lost her husband not that long ago tout fourteen fifteen months earlier she came up to hug me and i remember asking her when dis it git easier an she she just said it desnt and that said itle he decided why not injoy life and all those times i thought i was being helpful and protecting him i was actually making things worse i think ga what made me a little a angry at times was how you omean to control me and control my emotions and they were not controllable yah did you would you say i treded you kind of a tile o no maybe just a little bit but you were you were trying to kind of keep me on the rails keep me in a you kno straighten narrow and i felt you were trying to say no no this is how you have to feel this is you have to be very sad ye and what did you feel about about me and how i kind of handled at an ended it da you you were pretty consist that not likelyd anythink were you worried about me very much ye went you won mon sleeping in their closat i i think that is cose for conser from your perspective from where you were ot did you feel i was grieving wrong ye i guess i did i mean i did not feel it was a the the most noble thing to be sleeping in your closet for over year you were very disturbed by that y i thiris for i thout a was disturbing i dow it is not it funny at the time mi thought there is nothing weard about this hat all as not werd at all that i found a twins ive mattress and ar the gorage of my build ing and i have it sticking half in the closeat half hou and before i would go to bed i would just take te swag of this nicale every night and then i would go through her dap buk she just as e your hand writing in to see kind of all the upcoming events is almost a mister you want to put together and i think iyou know it is a plutcheur's graduation and doctor's appointments in your just kind of ae whol to that not that this is such an original thoht but to have no notion our knowledge just soming sat about some one planting out a fu ture that is just never to be why you can put a wabele on my dads wed of mania u can also put a label on mine depression in away there two sides of the same coine fom y died to hav fun go out on dates i do not know may be it was healthier why did why did it ave set you that that you thought somebody was replacing your mom why why did bother you s that how was horrible horrible horrible to think o ununfathomable a ye i really haded in my head that to move on was aan insalt to mow as suppose to you moving forward because you had to yit was excruciate well i can approcete what your shame no yo but i do feel i was too hard on ew now that i married and i really im up the mind now god however anybody hased to get through this is the right way yel a trade and jus there is no way if there is no way it wasnit until eight years after my mom's dath that our grief lifted a little not all of it it will always be there but i remember the moment that it lifted enough to finally feel it was not crushing us it happened on atrip my brother fletcher my dad night took to the beach it was just the three of us our family now missing a limb on the plain my dad told us that he had met some one a woman name margery speech riter and professor and we could tell in his voice that this woman was different he was in love and for the first time i was flooded with happiness for my dad that he was moving on by this point i was also dating my now husband david and my brother share tht when he got home from this trip he was going to pro pose that his now wife catholeen and i remember on this trip there was a feeling in the air that this would be the last trip just the three of us we did not talk about it what we knew we allscu badive and i remember the dive we went on ere we were when hundred feep below the surfacs was very calm but i turned and looked to my right and was shock to see a literal abyss just a cliff and darkness below it was eari but we drifted away from it and kept swimming alternating who was ahead and who was

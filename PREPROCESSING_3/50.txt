thes show sponser by expressit vepianus time to stand up against pigtack protectors ata expressvepiansa coms last men yesterday hunter bidon announced that he would be avoiding a sepina by the house over sight committee the republicans on that committee wanted to ask hunter about his business relationships with dad joe hunter s currently under indicntment for nine charges related to taxivation all baston unreported income in spending from his lucrative years as his dad's alleged bagmen republicans voted last night to formelly open an impeachment inquiry which presumably gives them some sort of grater sepina power yesterday hunter showed up in washington d c to gran stan he began by announcing that hunter bidon was the real victim a victim of republican mago cruelty hunter bidon accorting to his father the media and wait for it hunter bidon he is the victim in fact hunter biding is the greatest victim we are it not for hunter bidon's last name he would not be prosecute for gun charges and taxivation over a million dollars we are not for his last name he would not be dragged before congress to talk about his business here he was yesterday for six years mago re publicans cluding members of the house committees whoare in a closed dor sestionsection right now have impuned my caracter invaded my privacy a tack my wife my children my family an my frends thev ridiculed my struggle with the diction they belittled my recovery an they have tried to be humanized me all to embarass an damage my father asto devoted his entire public life to service om we impuned his character he did not impune his own character if besbennino eat huntred thousand dollars on sex workers we impuned his character we impuned his children you mean other than the child that he refuses to support with child support and refuses to give his last name we made fun of his addiction because he put pictures of himself on his computer and then wrote in his memoir about how he storted parmishon cheese off a carpet which is inherently oarias we de humanized his recovery because of course he finger paints for a cover and then sells those paintings for half a million dollars to his da's business doners and we have dehumanized him man that is that is the worst thing of all of course were't not for hunter bidon's last name he would also likely be a homeless drug atics without a pending to his name on pay child sport and no life prospects at all as hunter once admitted his last name was gold to foreign in vesters his word gold hunter one said his fathers chal quote open doors that would not be opened up to other people hunter by the way is not the only member of the bidin family who feels that way jim bidon joe's brother told potential business partners quote we have got people all round the world who want to invest in jobidon frank joe's other brother called the biding name a quote tremendous asset for business val his sister says wuote i had better seato t table because my brother is at the head of the table hunter bidon is not a victim he is anything but a victim but according to hunter a ma n who again tried to disown his own daughter father well he was a drugattle derolect in whor urged his father to do the same to his grand daughter all well he spent nearly a million dollars on prostitutes and drugs the whole debocl surrounding hunter and his dad according to hunter biton is a winchunds here we go there is no fairness or decency in what these republicans are doing they have live over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life much that ther lives have become the false facts believe by too many people no matter how many time to this debunt they continued to insist that my father's support of you crane against russia is the result of a non existent bribe they displayed naked photofs of me toring an oversight hearing and they have taken the light of my dad's love the light of my dad's loved for me and presented it as darkness of few things on that one first he suggests that republicans are saying that jobitans supporting you crane against rusha because of berisemant or something no that sucsho not even the accusation then he suggests that republicans showed a photo of him in newd he betunge there about martretal agreen in a house hearing where she was talking about the fact that hunter and his daddy lied about the provinans of the laptop on which hunter bito had placed such photoes but here is the igger point when he says that republicans have turned his dad's love for him into darkness sometimes weve canturn into darkness say when your powerful father uses his power in order clear millions of dollars for his family using you as the family bagman even knowing tho giving you access to the family credicart allows you to fund your saxon drugadictions puting aside the semi personal situation of the biding family lover whel we really have heres a pretty cut in dribe corruption case yesterday hunter claimed that his father was not financially involved in his business note the words financially involved in his business let me stayed as clearly as i can my father was not financially involved in my business not as a practicing lawyer not as a bord member of berismon not in my partnership with the chinese private business men not in my investments at home nor abroad and certainly not as an artist well that is some preaity careful wording right there financially involved not totally involve not involvedo my business at alf financially involved as in did not sign chacks on behalf of the business was not an executive did not funded himself was not doing the ten forties but how about whether joe was involved at all in hunter's business well obviously joe was he always has been in reality hunter biton has never in his life hel tay job on connected to his father or to his dad's corruption as a delaware senter joe was very close withvice president of embionnett t woich just happens to be the biggest bank in delaware an b ana hired hunter t to a management training post after hunter left am b ana hundr got a jop of the clinton department of commers then he went to work his a lobbyist for a former bidon campaign staffer named william oldecar during that time am b a neight paight hunter a hundred thousand dollars a year an be a na for what it is worth made bank while they pushed hunters carear according to theamerican spectator by nineteen ninety eight that bank had become quote the second largest t issuer of vsa and mastercards in the huntry some annalis believed it would eventually overtake city corp to come the nation's biggest credicar bank how convenient hunters lobbying work earned him huge bux as for the new yorker quote and in formal arrangement was astablished bhy did not would not ask chunter about his lobby in clint and hunter would not tell his father about them it was not we all sat down and agreed on it it came naturally hunter said hunter has been clearing family money for years onthe back of jobidon's position as he texted his own daughter in january twenty nineteen quote i hope you can all do what i did and pay for everything for this entire family for

october twenty twenty just be fore the election when hunters la aptop hunter while hides kite had left his laptop in repairshop in delaware and then never shown up again that laptop came into public view it contained not just pictures and vidio of drug use an prostitution but the contents of those demails in whattat messages the whole biding criminal corruption story was emerging just before the election bidon lide and did members the deep state and did the media on october twenty second twenty twenty bidon lide right out in open a bate joe said quote i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life my son has not made money in terms of the thing about what are you talking about china the only guie who made money in china is trump the american public never got the full story before the election that was because the f b i vaguely worned america's largest social medea services that the laptop might just be russian dis information the social media services actiavely shut down to semination of the neurik posts blackbuster story then hundreds of former sudo experts on intelligions signed another letter false a testing that the laptop had the halmarks of russian dis information then joe's campaign suggested it was russianis in formation too all this time joe and hunter and everybody else knew the laptop was reel including the f bii all this time hunter was also under a act of criminal investigation by the f bei he had been since twenty nineteen that investigation covered two separat matters hunters years long taxigation and hunter's false attestation on the gun form that he was not a drug atict in twenty twenty three huus to turning david weites of delaware a man who worked with bobde and long connections with all the power players in the state of delaware announced o deal with hunter as the sweethart de hunter would get no jail time for the tax charges he would receive a diversion on the gun charge the deal also included a cleverly created proviso to imunize hunter from all further investigation hon his forgn dealings including possible and obvious violation of the foreign agent's registration act that provisor was included in the diversion charge not the tax charge all this blew up in public view because two iras whistle blowers came ford saying that the do j had a tempted to cram through the sweetharddeo in order to avoid implicating jo not only that they claimed that jobidon's do j under meric garland had actually stopped the investigation by refusing weites special council status and that the do j had pushed through the deo the whistle blowers as it turns out were right according to the nor timesquote mister weites appeared willing to forego any prosecution of mister bidin at all his office came close to agreeing to end the investigation without requiring a guilty plaon any charges but the correspondence reveals that his position relaid through his staff changed in the spring around the time a pair of iress officials on the case accused the doja of ham stringing the investigation now thiser wise suddenly demanded that bidin plea guilty to committing taxoffences the deal finally blew up when the judge and hunter's case refused the plea dea she noted ho was totally un precedented then to cover up that tobocell meric arland announced the wise would be a special council tyou know just in time to avoid weits having to testify before congress about the sweethar del when taweises has finally charged hunter on nine tax charges hunter will likely go to jail but just remember he is not going jo becaus victim and there is no waight in hell that jobidon was ignorant of all of this that is why the impeachment inquiry has now been voted on and is gaining steem hunters says toll out politics of course and as theny political ack politics are of course part of the game but hunter also says the impeachment inquiry itself is scirriless here is hunter and in the adepts of my diction i was extremely responsible with my finences but to suggest that is grounds for an impeachwen inquiry is beyond the absurd it is shameless there is no evidence to support the alligations that my father was financially involved at my business because it did not happen well no actually te only shameless person here is the gan who sells five hundred thows nowler finger paintings to his dadstoners then refuses to pay child support and insists that any settlement involve denying his daughter the right to use the only actual asset the bidin family has jobidin's family name hunter should be hit with contempt and he will be it with contempt the only question is how much more information as in a drip out that ye bunks every last t argument jobidon has ever made about the innocence of his son and his own ignorance about his sons a business arrangements again the notion that joe and hunter ere totally dis connected is a lay it is obviously untrue there is evidence to that of fect and despite what the media will tell you about there is no there there that is not true whatsoever it turns out that joe has nothing to say about anythis here is joe bidin on all this eetea and joe is out he will catch you later in just one second we will get to a weird aspect of hunter biting to big announcement that he wasni't going to walk ten feet into the building and testify yesterday first are you still

this news broke and hunter had done his you are out of order everyone is out of where this whole cort is out of order alpushin o retin from an justise fral cureen jahn pierre was asked about the fact thats dom jobidon had apparently known that hunter was goingto do this thatlooks in olfolotic obstruction if you our cipinan you now have a duty to appear before congressif somebodly helps you not appear before congress that is kind of obstruction he here is correen jahn pierre trying to speak to that did he is been anytin n wen his ta a thn tan couple o just a couple o things on that and i going to be really clearlo as hunter bin is tha private citizen and i certainly would refer to his representative im you im the president was certainly familiar with what his thon was going to say and i think what you staw was from the heart from a hison and you heard youve heard me saytit he ternd the president fay this when it comes fo the president o pirs lady they proud of him a continuing to rebeald his life they are proud of their son a gain the attempt to turn what he is a corruption scandal into they are just proud of their son he is really weak not only that she just said out loud that jobident knew full well that hunter was going to avoid thi seppina why did not he just tell him not to avoid the sopina kind of obstruction he is it not apparently it was not just joe involved in the sort of obstruction he behavior coing to politico hunter bidon pulled off his surprise appearance of the capitalon wednesday with the help of a fellow californ e resident eric swal well yes the farding congressmen the man know i was stipping a chinese by the demogratic wawmaker confirmed to politico that he reserved the senate swamp he spoht mere feut from the capital that often host press conferences for hunter bidin's dramatic remarks tivi cam respotted swalbol before the presidents beside the president on as hunter sought to go on offence against the house gope but apparently it is not just that he helped set this whole thing up apparently he also helped cordinate with the white house on this one person who knew about the suden appearance the president himself two people familiar with wednesday's morning events told polito go that hunter bidan notified joe of his plans ahagain kind of obstruction he i'm noticing we are reardly obstruction he othe republicans of course are a fighting matt about a representative chiproy of texas went after hunter bin yesterday he said an important worder he said hes tad did not t haviny in ballmet te mancially that is that igh he did not say was a blank at in o that he was in ball that' truly inportan the harder bog this pace ticaly in on going od domin o ball o stupin the sision an stupin tatement at were seeing that right here going o the capitlan sang is thatwas in a ten te mancial teol hehel see if that is true but that is a big towel to me we all know that his dad was in balld in an riching a hunter we all know tha foran enemies were setting billings of dollars to that we know from wisso lower testimony that they were slo walking the ior aus for eing ableto go after the investigation o twenty fourteen an twenty fifteen we know these things to be true worken haven te inquiry to day we will seek the true weve been having to do all of the work the thepartment of justac refuses to do and th nluck we get also our hold him a contampt if voust for we need to do in the house or representatives and then see where this process gos meanwhile house over sie comittee chargan's comer whos een leading this entire

of ohio whos on both judiciary and the over sicomittes he says listen if ye's ung an a shop will hold him in contempt what we want is the fact wan the facts and every single that every single that is getset in poff in is you brink in e ta foreign inter you behind close gos wen you can get those facts an en as tochairmanset we not om to ho on hav we say this t tomind council an te whine house o bot argue that to wbecin you couldi con for a deposition wats because there was not a formal bot for in peach mi for that is on a happenin a few houss we think it is gut tacts we think the house of representativeswel go on rackor with the pown that solely resines in the house to say we are in n oficial an pecting pargy tas of ourle per sac and let that hawi see wetter excuse his dat tesion to ben year to day but let us we take that bot we expect him to come in for a a or his intervieu for his deposition and frankly i lasso i tank look at am proceedings as we befor just for the facts t the reality is that cantemp tof congress done meaa ho havela you have criminal contempt where you acually hae to fild charge of th deo jay the deoja has todeside whether to go forward with those charges y of civil contempt in which you can ask the judicial branch to inforce a congressional sepina but that takes a while and you have an heran contempt which as wery actually send he houseer senate sergeants at arms to detane and imprison somebody which has really never been used such a sert an empty threat but again thi's the game let us be real about this there you aspects oney is the actual corruption of j obidon and hunter bidon in the fact that a lot of the stuff was taking place these relationships for being form promises were being made well hunter bidon's dad was bice presidents of the united states under barakobama and a lot of the manipulate ofe cover up was happening well his dad was actully president and it was the do j doing that manipulative cover up with those sweetheartials but there is another aspect o this two and that is the democrats open this can they open this can and now the can is open democrats im peached ona trump not once but twice and they did not on the basis of no criminality they did not even a ledge criminality and theire impeachmen proceedings they open inquiries over a phone call that he had with vlodamers lensky with regard actually specifically and weirdly too an investigation by the cranians into the corruption of beresma turns out that corruption fairly obviously is real that is number one and the number to was over january sex were no criminal charges were actually aleged by the members of the house impeachment committee and once that can was open the notion the republicans were not going to use that against jobidon is insane when you impeach somebody not once but twice and when you threaten to impeachmon day one which is what democrats did the minute thet donal trumpentered office it was only a matter of time antill republicans open in impeachment inquiry into into jobiden and one of two things will happen either mutually assured destruction will be restored in which case both parties golas in we cannot keep im peaching each other presidents we really cant or it will be this all the way un till th un of tine and if it is this i suppose it is this thons hing th on of the world me frankly investigations sepinas president's being hld under the gun all right i mean if this is if this the world the democrats chose for all of us to livin i gess i can live with tat do not threaten me with a good tine meanwhile democrats are really upset about all this ilexander o coso cortes i she has her lines to read and she reads them with passion and lots of canmotions she says the bidn impeachmen increes in exercise in futility i'm i'm certainly glad that toman informed her what that wit that phrasemans her own a rit we ther one republican witness sad that ther are from what he hasting there are not grounds for an impeachment inquiry or rather frankly ipeachment in general a of presiden bidim but that has not deturred the republicanside from continuinto tri to a force throu a completely groundless and unsubstantiated i will not even colitan investigation i'll just call it e exercise infutility well she is she is very upset and she is very serious legal scholar wll i'm impressed i'm imprestute it w'd only be better if she were wearing her smart people glasses that she sometimes puts on in committee hearings to look not an idiot meawhile represent of dan goban he is doing the same retine they jus do not have the facts they do not have the fact at or no ah why they decided to do a join appearance dan gol men and tard moscuoets on amasan me see am but this looks an outtake from a from waiting for godo a really bat rduction an wert gasting here we go this is a bogust sham in peachment with no evidents whatsoever and the notion that ten and telenaldin hin forward for some sort of precedural reason is completely bonk the bydmidministration has been way more cooperative than they need to be and certainly far more cooperative than donal tromp was when he provided zero documents to the congressional in peachment crein to does in nineteen the administration has provided witnessis a hundred fousing and more documents the problem here is not that they do not have the materials the problem here is that they do not have any facts to support their allegations of any wrong doing by president by t remember dan gollman was one of the lead lawyers in the impeachment inquiry into donald trum turn about is farepli democrat's naturally a now suggesting that any attempt to impeach bidon is he insurrectioni it is an insurrection to what was it when heu did it twice with with donald trump and claimed that he was a tool of the russians here was representative jima govern of massachusetts doing this retine this inquiry has nothing to do with joby it is about the republican party at how radicalise an extreme it become they are alurgic to truth and transparency republican say this is not about a three or dayed outcome it is they are going to try to apeach president bi despite the fact that there is no evidence against him at all trumps and a violet mag a mob here to the capital to reverse the election results an certif that he want even though he lost what they could not do on january sixth they want to do with this extreme political stum they have contempt for our democracy they want to finish the jo if contempt for the democracy because they wanted impeachmen inquiry into eming that is part of the actual system its part of the actural system again democrats used it twice meanwhile representive jasman crocket of texas democrat she is going in furnishd his republicans are domestic enemies if you wanching in peachment inqueing to presentin your domestic enemy i wont whant that want is that mean when democrats do it to trump twice it mi no e no i we ao o e e mi em me m do a ar o i mes no a e e i no we a no me no oe be a man e wil te be ot a it outwas domestic enemies anybody who opposed them as a traitor their traitors worgan a fight journey by calling all of our ponents traitors and domestic enemies ask in ago amazingly well again it is very hard to make the case also that your god jobin is being unfairly targened by the house republicans when i kind of noticed the jacksmith is unfairly targeting donald trump in extraordinar y ways has an excellent articale by jason willick over at the washington posed talking about jack smith's prosecution of trump and more about the time line of jack smith prosecution of trump an ourloige is accelerating the timeline what whyse that tihline hase to be accelerated why the answer is

talking about democrats are claming that it is totally unfair wrong horrifing fore publicans to open an impeachmen inquery into jobidon meanwhile jack smith is doing whatever he can to get tonal trump arrested and put in jail before the election ajason willock has really god peace over the washington posed about thas he says there are real legal problems with special councel jacksmith's election interference case againstonnal trump the former presidents effort to overturn the twenty twenty election was despicable but political lying isn'n generally a crime smith's case tosmo rely on some of the vaguest laws in the federal penal coto plying them in untessed ways but let say yeu dis agree ou thing trums post election behavior as clearly criminal and presidetet bitans d o j had no choice as a matter of law but to invict him for it two recent developments in the case should none the less undermine the fiction that smith is in a political prosecutor smith staught a pretril gag order againstrum that wouldhave limited much of the candidates political speech that it had to be successivuely narrowed by two quarts now in a filing at the spring qart smith has all but announce that his prosecutorial time line is control by the twenty twenty four general election where trumpe is likely to be a candidate start with the gag order litigation in september smith asked for startling restrictions on trumps right to object to his own prosecution he demanded that trumpy barred from disparaging and inflammitory statements about smith order the judicial system most astonishing the special council suggested trump shuld be barred from blaming bidon for the prosecution a sentially muzzling a major line of criticism against the administration trump wans to unseat judge tonya trut centopointed by obama clearly leans toward the prosecution in this case for the gagwarder wil significantly narrow then the one smith soght then last friday a three judge pelopadel composed entirely of obama and bidnon pointies have the even narrow that gag order then iis what smith wone was a dramatic violation of free speech principles against tonnal trump but that brings us to point umber too which is the fast track smith fial temotion on monday to buy pass the normal oppellit process and fast track the trump trial baste of what can only be described is a political time tables says willick trump claims gets immunity from prosecution because he was per forming official presidential duties when he tried to overturn the twenty twenty election and because the senate acquitted him in his twenty twenty one in peach fon trial the claims are likely wrong but they do raise novel legal issues but the problem for smith is that the trial cannot be completed until youactually solve the issues trud can denied trumscommunity clain is trump is now appealed to the dc circuit but smith is going directly to the supreme quart why exactly is he doing that what is the compelling reason that this thing has to be done right this very instant here is what smith says quote vindicating the public interest in thescates requires immediate resolution of the immunity question to permit the trial to occur on an appropriate time table if the pellet re view of the decision below woatd ave proceed through the ordinary process in the qourt of apeals the pase of review may not result in a final decision for many months even if the decision arrived sooner the timing of such a decision might prevent this cuourt from hearing in deciding the case this term as wellick points out the argument is totally circular and no point tho smith explain why this thing has to be decided right now who cares who cares let say goes to the apelicort andwill take takes months then e'll say goes to the suprim quort and takes months and now its twenty twenty five what is smith's big rush smith does not say what he means if the justces do not take the case now the chance of completing a trial before the twenty twenty four election will go down if trump is not tried and convicted by the election the chance o bidin winning will take a hit that is the whole point and every one can see it when trump complains that his case has been politicized there is a lot more evidence to that of fact then to the clain that there is a political motivation behind investigating the bidin corruption scandal o came meanwhile the latest on cloudy an gathy president the apparently invulnerable president of harvard university the harvard crimson has now come out and suggested that she did in facts biolate academic integrity good for the arvard crimson at's a shocker and wonce harvar law the crimson is a very left win newspaper according to mediately in an article detailing the allegations agains cav the crimson noted it in av independently reviewed the published allegations and concluded that gae work appured to quote violate harvard's curn policies around platrism and academic integrity the newspaper has been generally defensive of cloudine gay but the crimson details the allegations and says that she pretty obviously violates standards the students would be bound by meanwhile the springs about again wht we talked tat yesterday on the sho the final argument against geting rid of clouding gay whiches she is black lady and any criticism of her is races the person best position tare ticulate this criticism is another mediokher but highly placed person who has been elevated because of her race and because of her intersectional stat us n colhanna jones somehow towded is some sort of valuable historian despite the fact that her histories are entirely wrong biast and quite discusting actually morally here she was yesterday explaining this is a racest campaign against cloudin gay of course of course everything is race ofs campaign she is being singled out as some one who is only surviving because of her race what did you make of that well it is rathi i mean we havent no one has produce the thread of evident that to that the tho qualificase and a that a a president gay hat wa that e is a black woman that in thalting on in the fi ltic and the fact that a tho presidend tho all came under intent scrutiny that only one has been called ouled o the tho caled the verth inthe are formiti fact in hiher te thinks tho what black woman in the country have gone through historically and contined to go through every day im het clearly qualified she is clearly qualified and cohan jones one least qualified historians ever and yet she was offered a tenured position university on rough carolina then she turned it down and she went to historically black college and university she is been made sort of the face of the neur times by the fact she is not done to work for them for coupleof years it is pretty astonishing by the way is worth noting that if cloudin gay had been fired she would not be the first harvard presiden to be fired borenc's summers youwill recall was austed from his position as president of harvard university this happened whle i was actually at harvard she was ousted from that position for the great crime of suggesting that perhaps under representation of women in the hard sciences was due to both under performance on testing and also lack of interest wo no that was discriminatory tha he had to be fired for it meanwhile clauding gayes jenticide against jes depends on the contect and everybody's well she is a black lady i gus we have to keep her it it really is truly amazing stof and continues to be truly amazing stuff but again cloudinggay cannot go for the same reason that d i cannot go it is the entire reason for a higher education now the perversity of higher education has never been at higher pitch and fraglam conpleased that there keping clouding gay because id prefer that they do not again have the figleef of firing the president an gover it you pen doners cannow feel a suage that may be their con cerns have been heard ae cannot feel that way at harvard hopefully people continue to pull their money from harvard university in other major universityes that mirror that seeme d e the versity equidy

we have been discussing for at least a couple of weeks at this point the mine administration wants this giant chack sign to ou crane and israel and ti jan and a leatalit for the bord but no actual changes in policy at the border well they have been trying this line for a while here that if re publicans do not just sign off on a clean you crane bots becaue they love pouden and it is not working they continue to push the line but again that dog is not hunting here is a keem jeffreys the house my norday leader if an agreement is reached o you believe the speak will put it on the flort it that remains to be seen because a the pro pooton calkis of the house re publican conference ah is extrene it is a loud and it is groing it is a led by march we tali gran and gem jordon on the inside and on the outside it is led by donal crom antuckor causton and it seems increasing ly clear that this pro pooton cakis with to see lanter mar pooton in and you crane which would be bade cor mericas an ask o security which is lide it is an open question as the wether house re publicans a serious at all about funding thecranian waer fr kagain that is that dogsing in a hunt because re publicans are aready shore will you swant oud actually secure the boarder will now sendin negotiators according to the walster journal have moved closer to striking a broad deal on changes to usporter policy after the white house offered significant concessions to win re publican support for separate legislation further finding you crane in the war against russia a deal would mark a break through on inistue that is royal washington for decades with the current talks driven by the record number of migrants crossing the southern boarder and giope lawmaker's decision to tine new aid to keyvte to changes an emigration policy a'l democrats are criticising that lincage meny are signalling in recent days they ould be willing to make such a trade off that white house offer includes creating a new expulsion power the boarder that ould allow the government to turn away asylum seekers without letting them clemisylum democrats have proposed allowing that new ex xpulsion authority to be used only of certain thresholds are hit blike daily illegal border crossings democrats have also offered a create or requirement that some asylum seekers be held in emigration attention for the diration of their hearings that was not know whether the new requirement woud reply to migran families or only single adults it wuld also raise the initial threshold tasylum seekers must meet in a screening interview and expand the government's rapid deportation authority to be used at nation wide rather than just at the border senter james langford of voklohoma said work enough to hostile but it still possible therestill days in the calender represent of don bacon of dobraska he said were close to an agreement not sure their were the're totally beclothes now again these are mage or concessions from toabiton over the border and frankly we should continue to fund ou crane that they do not actually collapse under the weight of a a new russian invasion for example and we should find israel in is battle against commount and wesh funti wan sas they are armed a porcupine against china all thats of his good stuff tgetting a bunch of border concessions from the by administration is a big republican win and that that again can only be had if a deal get's cut here yow again coudos to the re publicans for standing strong on this particular provision and democrats yo the're they'r seeing the light at least a little but meanwhile on the economy the federalres orve is sending some kon of strange mix signals theyre leaving infrostrates study they are not changing the introstrates weld be expected that because the inflation rate has been coming down and the economy has been slowing but theyare also signalling that they may start to lower the introstrats as early as next yearin they might to it as much as three times that is om obvious the causing the stock markets to jump because people are now suming that that means when the new money flows in the stock price er gin to go up becuse we'td gin to do with new money flowing into the system and you are not to do it the shoving the stockmark et get in now and get in early would be sort of the idea ow warn buffet is thinking the opposite warn buffet ed thinking they are no new business starts tossing money at the american economy has not in fact generated massive growth it is not a question of the fluidity of cash in theamerican economy rat now it is a question of cros willing to invast in a long trum growth projects in the united states when the political situation is rife with chaos when it feels as though the entire working community is shot through with bad employs but git is harder to start of business now than it has een t any time in the recent pass aw without people starting new businesses an coming op t new products in new services that is the tuff the generatesioconomic growth not government spending itso the stock market may continue to rise because again wearying pat your money if there is more money in the system but that does not necessarily spell economic health the de the dowjones in dustral hiddin all time high becase they were cheering progress on inflation and their seeing the possibility that again monitary policies can get looser next year whether that' soft landing is going to now materialize in a way that wouldis not mean economic stagnation is anybody's guess the definition of softh landings can buse in question a softh landing presumably according to the by dministration would mean just avoiding a formal recession but if they mean their gon to avoid stagnation i have serious doubts according to founder of sam consulting and former fet economists the soft landings in the bag inflation has come down for several months recession calls are coming off the table barring any other catastrophe the economy has done the impossible joseph leborna chief economist at s m b c neko security said recent history suggests a march twenty twenty four rate cut is happening the futureis market agrees investers are betting on seventy five per cent percent chance the federal slash rates inthe first three months of next year presumably that would also be political and attempt to inject new laquidity into the economy in advance of the election as to increase of feeling of economic health going into election twenty twenty four and then bydrem get to brag about it economic record or something again i remain highly suspicious at the idea the you can have stagnating wages for full on two years thou can inject to this much boney the economy and then have overall inflation that in terms of for example mortgages up ninety per cent since two thousand and twenty and the can somehow come out the other end with a healthy economy i jus think that is a very very difficult

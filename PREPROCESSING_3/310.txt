welcome to the huberman lapoe a science science as to fri may druhubermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing oral health now when most people her oral health they immediately think tooth health and appearance and presumably fresh breath or lack of bad breath as well and well of course tooth and breath freshness whiteness and health is a critical component of oral health to day you will learn that oral health including the ral microbiom the alth of your pallet your tonsils indeed the entire oral cavity is an extremely important component of general bodily health much that to day we are going to add a seventh pillar to the called six pillars of mental health physical health and performance this is not a trivial step to add a seventh pillar to the six pillars if some of you have been listeners of this podcasts for a while you may recall that the six pillars of mental health physical health and performance that is the six things that every one needs to invest specific protocals into each day are in no particular order by the way sleep sunlight and light exposure generally which by extension also includes dark exposure neutrition exercise which we could also call movement both party of ascular exercise and resistance training stress management and relationships and social engagement including relationship to sealth and to day we are going to add oral health and microbiom health and i suppose we could generally call this oral and got health because as you now if you think about it your moulth your oral cavity and your got are contiguous with one another we are going to add oral and got health as the seventh pillar of mental health physical health and performance because as you will learn to day there are many aspects of oral health and daily protocals for oral health that extend to cardiovascular health to metabolic health and indeed to brain health and to staving off diseases in all of those bodily compartmence i cannot over emphasize an ealth how much oral health influences your general bodily health to day you will learn abealth oral biology and health we will not go too deep into e biology but we will go deep enough into the biology that you will learn some incredible things such as your teeth have the ability to literally fillbackian cavities that have formed provided those cavities have not gone too deep into the teeth layers yet you will learn that saliva while most people think of it as just spit is an incredible substance fluid that contains all sorts of interesting and important things that allow you to re build the strength of your teeth and indeed to support the health of your oral cavity and got macrobaum and body generally saliva is superinteresting and important and to day you are going to learn many many protocals including zero cost protocals protocals that will actually save you money as well as some lo cost protocals to both restore improve and maintain oral health and in doing maintain and improve your overall bodily health before we begin i t emphasized at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desir and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that thime i the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes looseleef and ready to drink yerbamate i often discuss yerbamate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar its high and the occident content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible nero protective effects i also drink yerbamate because i love the taste while thereare a lot of different choices of yerbamate drinks out there i love matina because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose leef and their can varieties are of the absolute best quality much that i decided to become a partial owner in the company although i must say even if they had not allowed me to do that i would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and bess yerbamate you can find i love the taste of brud looselef matina yerbamate and i particularly love the taste of matina's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which i personally help them develop if you would to try matina go to drink matina daccom slash huberman right now matina is offering a free one pound bag of looseleef yerbamate ta and free shipping with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerbamate again thats drink matina daccom slash huberman to get the free bag of yerbamate loose leef te and free shipping to day's episode is also brought to us by roca roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of te absolute highest quality i've spent he lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly under different conditions roa understands this and designed all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with the biology the visual system in mind now roca eyeglasses and suglasses were initially develope for use in sport and as a consequence you can wear them without them s lipping aff your fase while running or cycling and their extremely light weight roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are also designed with a new technology called float fit which i really because it makes their eyeglasses and sunglasses fit perfectly and they do not move around even when i'm active if i'm running and i'm wearing my glasses they stay on my face most thetimin owing remember them on my face becaue they are light weight you can also use them while cycling or for other activities if you would to try roca glasses go to roca that is ar okee a dock calm and enter the cod huberman to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is our o k a dock calm and enter the code huberman at check out to day's epizode is also brought to us by helick sleep hlic sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality i've spoken many times before on this an other pod cass about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the keythings to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress matches your sleep requirements the helics website has a brieth two minute quiz that if you go to it will ask yoau question such as do you sleep on your back your side are your stomach you tend to run hot or coal during the middll the night as well as some other questions that allow you to determine the optimal mattress for you when i took the quiz i personally match to their dusk mattress to you s k which has allowed me to significantly improve my sleep if youare interested and significantly improving your sleep go to helic sleep dock calm slash huberman take their brief two minute quiz and they will match you to accustomize mattress and you will get up to three hundred fifty dollars off any mattress order and two free pillows again if you are interested in trying helicks go to helic sleep dock calm slash huberman for up to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows ok let us talk about oral health this absolutely critical aspect of nochust having fresh bright teeth and no cavities and fresh breath or at least lack of bad breath one would hope but also total body health as i mention a lobit earlier oral health is inextricably linked to all aspects of brain and bodily health both in the short term and in the long term and it is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of mental health and physical health to day i'd to start off with a quizs i'm going to ask you which of the following three categories you believe you best fall into ok the first category is those of you out there who brush and floss every day probably twice to day and who make some effort to try and keep your teeth clean who the feeling of your teeth being clean and who pay a fair amount of attention to whether not your teeth are getting wider or not getting wider if you whether not your breath is fresh or not fresh maybe ok these are not requirements for being in this cattegory but maybe you'r somebody who also uses a mouth wash or uses mince or gums in order to try in keep your mouth smelling and looking fresh an your mouth clean o this first category a does not require tht you do all of those things but lets just make a basic requirement of participation in this category that you routinely brush at least twice to day and that you floss at least once o day ok if you fall into that category you are in category one and by the way if you are in category one and you do those things and you do a bunch of other things tooth whitening and mayb you go to the dentist especially often more than the recommended twice per year that still puts you in category one ok second category o t hose of you out there who are let us say a bit more blasa about your oral and tooth care those of you that perhaps just brush your teeth in the morning that your breath is freshing clean out that kond of sticky feeling inyour mouth that is accumulate it overnight that sometimes brush and may be floss at night but in all lot of times you fall asleep without doing thater you do not feel doing it or perhaps that do not really floss at all oque that perhaps go to the dentist once every six months maybe loless may be once year onces everycouple years while there is a bunch of different things that could put you into category to let us make a basic requirement for belonging to category to that you brush your teeth once a day but not twice a day on a regular basis or that you brush twice o day but that you rarely floss o kay that would put you into what i'm calling category too and then of course there is the third catgory that may be some of you out there fall into and this is the category of people who are extremely diligent not just about tooth care but also about oral health generally about maintaining the michrobiom of your mouth about making sure that your gums are very healthy about making sure that your soft palete ind hard palete is very healthy about making sure that yes your teeth are clean that they are devoid of as much bacturial build up and other stuffin there that can cause cavities but also that you'r paying careful attention to your oral microbiom and the overall mileu of your health in the mouth end the fact that your mouth is linked to all these diferent aspects of brain and cardiac and metabolic health oq if you fall into that third category great but let us be honest most people i would argue ninety five maybe ven ninety eight per cent of people or more fall in to either category one or category too as your hearing this your pobably think yo o ke while fi'm in category one i'm good right i go to the dentis twice year i brush and floss you mouth wash ie ven brighten my teeth i i make sure that if i had a sugary meal i'll rints out my mouth i try not to drink acitic foods things that will discuss to day as to whether not they actually have relevants for cavity formation or not but guess what if you are in category one as i described it or category too chances are you are doing things to really deplete and dissrupt your oral health that is right even if your paying a lot of attention to tooth health chances are if you are most people out there simply because you do not have the latest information on what oral health really is and how to best support it chances are you are doing things that yes might be keeping your teeth white and clean and you are not getting cavities or you are not being told you have cavities that need to be filled when you go to the dentist twice a year or more but that you are disrupting your oral health in ways that are depleading other aspects of your brain and bodily health and i'm not here to scare you i'm just here to tell you that if you are incategory one oke you are clearly doing some things that are beneficial for you but that there ise some additional things that you can do in a few things to avoid doing that very likely will improve your over all bodily health very quickly and the good news as lostings are also zero or low coster and some cases can save you substantial colst now if you are in category too chances are you are tepleading both your oral health and your over all bodily health but here is what is interesting some of the folks in category too that are not doing as much for the let us say hygine and freshening and whitening of their teeth actually have a healthyour overall oral microbyum that is not always the case but often it can be the case wat you are going to discover today is whether you are in category one or category too there is some wonderful and easily accessible practices that are well backed by science and by the way in preparation for this episode i also consulted with no fewer than five dentis including a petiatrictentis i tought to appariodontis i talk to people who fall into the functional dentis category i talked people with a bunch of different orientations who are all heavily qualified to talk about and to make recommendations about oral health and tooth health et cetera and what i'm going to deliver today is essentially the overlap in the vandiagram of what they all agreed on all highlight a few differences that they each had and that several of them had they do fall into different camps but i was positively surprised how much overlap or consensis there was in terms of best protocals for tooth and oral health and by the way for in that third category of the person that is doing a lot for their tooth health and appearance and breath et cetera but also oral health and microbyum i'm sure that to day you will also learn some new health practices an some things that willlow you to expand on your already terrific practices for oral health let us get into the material about oral health folcussing first on tooth anatemy and health and some libit about moulth anatomy i promise to not go into this in too much depth but we really need to have a firm basis a foundation of understanding of what the mouth cavity really consists of and i'm not just going to throw bunch and names out there for sake of knoming clatur out on' you to cloud your hypicampus with that sort of information unless it is functional information but it is critical functional information for the rest of our discussion where we will talk about waighs that you can really build up the strength of your teeth even if cavities of already stared to form and how to really get your saliva to be the best healthiest saliva for your overall mouth and for your gut and for your brain your heart et cetera ocasalit is talk just briefly i promise briefly about the anatemy and a lobit of the physiology of the this stuff oke the teeth were all familiar with what teeth are and tongue tha tonsuls in the back the mouth we ave ar soft pallat hard palet gums let us talk lobit about how all that fits together centering around the thing that most people think about when they think about oral health that is the teeth it is just a good jumping off point for us your teeth are layered structures pretty much every structure in your body is a layered structure s just the way those structures form cells are born at one location they migrate out and form stacks or layers those different layers have different cell types and youre teeth are no exception while they'r different kinds of teeth in your mouth teeth have an outer layer which is the enamel the enamel believe it are not is not white it is translucent ligke can make it through but its not transparents not a clear window is translucent can make it through but its a bit opaque beneath the enamel is a structure called denton denton is important for to day's discussion because as it turns out cavities form not surprisingly from the outside of teeth inward and cavities as the names suggest are holes that bacteria burrow down through the enamel and if your unlucky make it down to the denton our goal meaning your goal is to engage in daily protocals that is right daily protocals that are simple and fast and zero or very low cost that allow you to avoid the formation of those cavities yes but also that can allow you to fill in those cavities this is one of the most important things to understand about oral health that frankly i did not know until i start researching this episode and talking all these experts in the field which is that you can repair cavities that have started to form that is right your mouth environment based on its chemistry end some things that are mechanical but mostly based on its chemistry in particular how acitic it is or how basic it is is always in a state of what is called either d mineralization or remineralization now those words are hard to say in their specialy hard to say fast demineralization remineralizations o a bit of a tongue twister today i'm going use a short hand that is a convention in the dentistry field which is demin or remen to refer to demineralization or remineraliation remineralization is good it is the process by which within the enamel and to some extent in the deeper dentin layer of the tooth but especialy within the enamel there can be the eddition of new minerals that form very robost essentially chains of crystals okay if you have ever looked at a crystal of any kind under a microscope or you have seen a picture of it they are incredibly well organized they form a lattice of very strong often although theiare weaker crystals to very strong bonds and structure its the structure of a really well formed building oke remineralization is the process of putting minerals back into that crystal structure and it is actually possible to fill back in those cavities that bacteria have started to form especially when those cavities have burrow down into the enamel but have not yet made it into the dentin layer of the tooth or teeth o this is very important understand it is especially important understand the context of the fact that typically not always but typically if you have a cavity formed at one tooth and let say it is just half way or three corters of the way through the enamel layer that if you have cavities elsewhere in your mouth chances are that they are at the same depth or level not always but chances are and that is great news if those cavities have not yet made it into the dentin layer wise at great news while i do not know about you but i do not having my teeth drilled i do not having cavities drilled and filled i had a very tramatic childhood with respect too dentistry and aural health i'll talk about it lobit later in the episode it is not that i had tons and tons of cavities i actually ave this other issue where my dult teth came in behind my baby teeth had of all my baby teeth pulled i thad to get a bunch of injections of novican in my mouth an in getting injections into my mouth i opted have any cavities i had drilled without knovicane it is not cause i was a tough little kid although that only tough in me up it was because i hateet having stringes in my mouth i might have even biton a dentist or too or three i do not bite the dentist any more i thank the dentist by the way i think dentis are wonderful regular cleanings are wonderful will talk about frequency of cleanings but here is the point if you are somebody who enjoys getting your teeth drilled well then i do not know what to say but if you are most people out there with proper wiring of your neurology wel then you do not getting your teeth drilled and you can avoid it in many cases bi remineralizing that enamel layer of your teeth now if there is demineralization down to the deeper dentin layers of the tooth then most often you are going to need it to be drilled drilled and filled as they say or is some people say which has a bit more cynical drill fill and bill caus you get charged for that or your insurance gets charged or that o k back to some tooth anatomy and mouth anatomy talks about the enamel layer of the tooh on the outside i told you that either can demineralized demon or remineralized remen this is a key point your teeth are always in a stath of either demon or remen that is right either demon or remen it is not both at the same time it is one or the other and it is largely dependent on the p h that is the acidity of your mouth which is largely dependent on how much saliva you are producing and the mineral content of that saliva keep that in mine i thin it is a very important point now another key point is that next to your teeth you have your gums the gingiva as it is called now the gingiva provides a really important roll in keeping the teeth stable we do not often think of it that but youven though hat stuff seems gummy and soft it is soft tissue it is very important for fixing the teeth to the bone it is not just about the roots that extend down into he jawbone below the gums are very important for keeping the teeth where they are hit i sheal aligament too between gums and the teeth thatreside to lobit deeper but the gums form a critical barrier between the oral cavity and the deeper layers of what eventially is bone and into the general blood flow or blood stream of the body now this is important to understand that the gums are a seal around the tooth this is why when you go to the dentis ther're paying attentionwent that loll pick there aying attention to how high or hopefully low the tenting is the the the lrecesses or pockets of gums along the the i hear gont yakave my my tre hanging within in my mouth yes i'll try not to do that during to day's episode point to my teeth much that i'm then you cannot understand what i'm saying that the gums are providing a seal between the oral cavity and essentially the bone and the general blood stream now this is critical becauses lets just take a step back and think about the oral cavity and what a remarkable place it is think about it this is a gaping hole in our body can we have some other gaping holes in our body but those ten to be spincter base holes yes i realize the prise some chuggles as soonas you say sfincter yes the anal sfinter ocat were anatomous were biologust we can talk about that stay shut stuff is generally not going up there and if it is not very often okey your nasal passages yohat those are holes but you ow there is a lot of stuff thre there is mucus to catch stuff there is a cribreform plate there is a bone thre's a bunch of things that actes barriers between the nasal cavities and the brain which sits right behind it the ol factory bulb and yes we have eyes and then e ave the outside of the eyes and there is af a susceptibility there but we have our blink ree flaks there is a also an ocular microbome there is a bunch of things there but think about the just this gaping hole in the front of our face that we use to eak and speak and breathe oqet it is a huge hole and as a consequence it is filled with bacteria from our outside environment all day long all day long sometimes at night although we are going to talk later about the critical critical need to be a nasal breather at night and not a mouth breathere not just for sake of staving off sleep apane a but also because turns out the dryness of the mouth is one of the ways that you really can throw off your oral health in major ways bact it is one of the leading causes of tooth decay ind people methamphetemine attics or if you see be witl at your mouth breathers there oral health and ther teeth generally but certainly their oral health is severely to pleat it to gethers big hole in your fron ior face and your talking and eating and moving about during the day even if your nasal breather when you are not talking your eading and all the bacteriais getting in and it is a really moist environment and it is really warm the commination of bacteria moist and mor means that this thing is a peetry dish for growing stuff that could potentially be really bad for us but it has thits incredible feet ture which is that if the p h is right then the bad stuff is killed off does not mak it ind our system does not destrupt our orl health or our bodily health it also as a critical feature which is that the bacteria that are good for us proliferate and supports the sealing process of the gums against the teeth and tooth health and tongue health and pallet health et cetera cas the rl cavity is amazing by virtue of how vulnerable it is but also how robust it is and the way it stays robust is by keeping the saliva healthy now there are other ways too but that is one of the main ones and it is a huge portal into the rest of the body and if the orl cavity is into mazing toyou already base on what you have heard thus far think about this if you get a cut on your arm or your hand ore your shin unless youre one of these remarkable people that always heals up without a scar as long as you are about twenty five years ore older typically you will form a loe scar there will be something noticeable there the worl cavity also can take cuts and burns and things that unfortunately those things occur but with rare exception heals up with nearly zero scarring sometimes there is a scar but nearly zero scarring which is remarkable why well it is basely an open wound with a bunch of bacteria and and its warm and it is moist clearly there is something special going on in this thing that we call the oral cavity indeed there is and it is anchored in the fact that if we treat it right you can encourage remineralization how do ou do that by keeping the saliva healthy how do you do that by supporting the proper bacteria within the mouth and making sure that you are eliminating the bacteria that you do not want or at least limiting those bacterian to day we are ging o talk about how to do that and by virtue of doing all the things that support tooth health you are also going toe support gum health cae those gums are critical because they form that barrier that if it gets too big if those pockets those recesses get too big and you are not taking care of the bacteriin your mouth in you are not gettng rid of the bad bacteria those bacteria worm their way down into the deeper recesses near the roots of the tooth sometimes into the tooth will talk about that and can get down into the bone and then can cause serious serious issues his is call paridontal disease and peridontal disease is a sociat with all sorts of really bad stuff including alsheimers o cathus is not just some wellness culture woo science leap to alsheimers there is literally evidence that the specific bacterias that cause recession of the gums can cross the blood brain barrier if they make it into the general circulation and potentially cause placks and tangle some of the halmark features of nerl degeneration in alsheimers ok probably not the only cause of alsheimers but potentially one of the major causes is a new theory but it is one that a lot of people r shine to pay attention to and it is also very clear the bacteria make it down into thse deeper recesses near the roots and into the bone that you can end up with issues relate to cardiac health and certainly metabolic health ocase o again the gol to day is not to scare you it is not to spend too much time on all the terrible things that can happen but rather to emphasize the positive which is if you do the right things at the right times especiall if you do them on a regular basis that you can really improve the health of your total oral cavity and your teeth and your breath and all the other stuff that people care about for aesthetics and intor personal interactions will flourish as well i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptigons i started taking a g one away back in two thousand and twelveh the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all of my quotas for vitemens and minerals and it insures that i get enough prebiotic and probiotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mune system and for the production of nauro transmitters and nauromodulators things dopamin and ceratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutricional intake every single day but there are number of things in a g one including specific micronutriens that are hard to get from whol foods ore at least in sufficient quantities g one allows me to get the vitemens and minerals that i need probiotics prebotics the adaptagens and critical micronutriancs any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a g one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash hubermen and you will get a year supply of vitemen d three k two and five free travel packs of a g one again thats to drink a g one dot calm slash hubermen o k let us talk about how cavities form because i think this is the major question that people ask when asking about or thinking about woral health as i mention before cavities are literlly hols ther fenistrations as the nerves call them nurts me call them fenistrations will holes down into the enamel that if they make it down to the densin layer of the tooth most likely do need to be drilled and filled and presumably builled o k but your goal i think all of our goal is to try and keep our teeth in a state of remineralization by keeping the p h that is the relative acid alkaline balance of the mouth such that the saliva supports remineralization now let us think about how a cavity actually forms turns out that no specific food not even sugar causes cavities cavities are not caused by sugar cavities are caused by bacturia that feed on sugar and tow that is not just a little bit of a twist in the mechanism that is a critical point there is no specific food not even pure sugar not even a hard candy a delicious jolly rancheries those when i was a kid that get stuck in your tooth that causes cavities no it is the bacteria that feed on sugar that then produce acid that burrows down through that degrades that d mineralizes the tooth in this very focal area that we call a cavity ok now if that is not surprising enough get this the bacteria that causes cavities by eating sugar and releasing this acid while there are several of them the major one is called streptocacus mutans or what i'll call strep mutans for short strep mutans is not something you are born with it is actually a communicable bacteria that is right you give it to one another through how sharing of glasses sharing of bottles kissing on the mouth et cetera now i am not here to tell you not to do any of those things i'm certainly not here to tell you that however and by the way in researching this episode i did learn that there is a specific category of person out there typically they are a dentist or married to a dentist that have opted believe it or not to never kiss their children near or on the mouth as to help their children not get streptococas mutans because almost all adults carry it not all but it is communicable a ast i or a flue or a cold it is communicated between individuals we are not born with it now that is a whole area of a let jus call it biososhoal ethics decision making that i think most people are not going to be to concerned with or at least act on becaus let us face it most people are not going to change their over all behavior of kissing or usage of bottles or glasses in order to avoid getting strep mutans most people in the world halv strep mutans or will get strep mutans and it lives in the mouth eit just resides there strep mutans is there and it is hungry what is it hungry for sugar when theire sugar present it eats it it produces acid the acid produces cavities taking teeth from a state of remineralization to demineralization or and by the way this is really important if your mouth is already in a state that is mor d mineralization mode to speak well then it will capitalize on that and it will cause cavities much faster o k keep in mind that acidity is bad for the mouth does that mean that you should never consume a lemon or and by the way yes i'm guilty of everyone smile chu a lemon slice or drinking water with lemon an it or carbonated drinks or it oes or tea or anything that has acidic flavor no likewise should you completely avoid in jesting any kind of sugar because strep mutans love sugar no turns out strep mutans sugars in the form of complex carbohydrate sugars too if you e posto arise serote meal bread every once in while as i do on manominivor metn fish and eggs and also starches and vegetables and fruits am an ominibore as most people are well then srp mutans has an opportunity to eat the sugars that come from those other carbohydrates does that mean that if you were to have a zero carbohydrate diet no sugars no strarges et cetera you would reduce the opportunity for strep mutans to consume sugar and release acid may be may be however most people will not do that and strep mutans is a very clever maybe even diabolical bacteria and if you are on a zero carbohydrate zero sugar die there some evidence that strep mutans will figure out ways to feed on other components of food in order to create this acid to then create cavities in your teeth the key thing to understand hereis that cavities form not from foods not from sugars per se but from strep mutands and other bacteria that eat tho sugars and create acid hence the critical need to keep your mouth as alkaline as possible which does not mean that you can ever drink some lemon water r coffeeor tea heres the key point that every one needs remembran because this dove tills beautifully into how often you should brush and floss and when you should brush and flos specifically the key point is the degree to which your mouth is in a demon state or a remon state and the degree to which cavities have the opportunity to form is dependent on the amount of time the amount of time in which your mouth is net acidic or net alkaline the amount of time that you are in a demineralizeation mode or remineralization mode ocaso its the amount of time no one no one can avoid having their mouth be acitic every once in while or injesting a sugar or a food that strep mutans can feed on and produce acid the key is to trying reduce the amount of strep mutans and reduce the amount of acid in the mouth that is the best way to reduce cavities and even reverse cavities that have started to form now in a moment i 'm going to tell you about floride because i know their lot of questions about floride but in order for you to understand what i say about floride an to make the best decision about floride both in drinking water and tooth pace et cetera for you you have to understand the remineralization process just a little bit just a little bit little bit of temistery here loba structural biology and this will be fun i promise even if you now no biology no structural bilgyou no chemistry you cano this part and its very simple those minerals that form the crystals within the enamel and some of the deeper layers of your tooth or teeth rather those crystals form through a specific type of bond and those bonds are very strong think of them lego chains but these are not ou know just conventional legochains these are lego chains that when they stick when two pieces come together things are tougt to pull apart they are not indestructible but theire tufto pull apart and there also spectual because unlike a string of legos ike a single string of legos these bonds that form during remineralization of the teeth are interdigitated with one another or rather are at angles with one another that make those bonds especially strong any architect or somebody that understand structural byalds you understand that bonds con be weak or strong depending on whether or not there linear wether not their crossed whetheror not there latises there is the whole bunch of interesting yo angled forces stuff that the architects will understand an the the construction workers will understand at a very intuitive an and inconcrete level no pone intended and on and on but just think about it a bond is only as strong as the number of different points at which it can resist sheering and pressure the way that these remineralization bonds form is through the addition of specific minerals at specific angls and the nactually occurring mineral that is responsible for the majority f these bonds in the enamel and teeth is called hydroxy appetite what a great name if you tok about woral health rwe use the mouth for a lot of things you can think of the small list ore long list of those things than many of them younderpending wo you are and what you to do with your mouth but the point being that we do indeed eat with our mouth appetite is part of eating you just remember hydroxy appetite bonds and that are very strong but therre not indestructible acican actually break those bonds ay that is the demoneralization process now floride is a substance that is not a vitemen it is not a mineral it is not an essential neutrient but that in the last century it was discovered can actually replace some of the hydroxy appetite bonds in teeth and actually make those bonds hyper strong superphysiologically strong now wi'll talk about the safety considerations with floride and lol bit because there are some safety considerations but it was decided an mass in the united states in europe that the addition of floride to the drinking water and to many toothpactes or toothpowders would be useful because it creates these superphysiologically strong bonds within the minerals of the teeth and indeed it does it does floride gets between those legopieces and makes them extra axtra strong and this is why floride is added to the drinking water but and this is very important emphasize but nowadays there is a really polorize debate about floride because some people out there believe that floride can destrup thyroid health mighty be disreptive for brainhealth certainly of floride levels are too high in drinking water or any substance it can be very dangerous it can be a poison but of course the dose makes the poison iht floride itself may not be poisonous at very low levels but there really two camps now that have form and i'll just illustrate those wo camps by virtue of what is happening right now right now in the state of california there is a major law suit against the government because people want floride removed from the drinking water because of the long lists of bad things that excessive on highlay excessive floride can do flor bodily an brain health ospeciall in kids but also in adults at the very same time meaning right now there is also a major law suit this one in buffalo new york from mostly parents who are suing the city of buffalo saying that there was not enough maybe even zero floride in the drinking water for some period of time and as the consequence thei're children's teeth or oral health or both is depleated and they are suing for damages a case thee this is a really polorize camp now i did a full episode o te hubran lawpodcask all about water and i talked about floride levels which levels are thought by the see dy see to be safe which levels are not thought to be safe i talked about some of the theories as to how floride might disrupt function of the thieroide in some considerations there please check out the time stamp in that episode i link to that time stamp in the caption tthis episode but the important point here is that if you are at all concerned about floride in the drinking water the simple answer is to just filter the water that comes out of the tap if you are concern about floride than i suppose you would probably want of void toothpastes that have floride indeed there are some i will provide links to some of those in the shownot captions for this episode or a variety of these a zero floride toothpastat of start to accumulate but keep in mind that when floride is introduce into the bonds of the minerals of the teeth they do make the teeth really really strong but and all the dentis i spoke to emphasize this point the bonds that form are not the natural bonds now the fact that they are not the natural bonds does not necessarily mean that they are not good for us or that they are bad for us but the bonds that form when viewed under what is called electro my cross could be look different they look wavy they are not smooth bonds and they do increase the resistance to different forces including cavitis or acid that would create cavities to be specific they make the teeth stronger structurally resistance to chipping et cetera but there is a growing concern about excessive floride which by the way if you drink a lot of tap water you are going to be exposed to more floride than if you drink less tap water that jus kint of stands to reason but yeal do not really talk about this i ou wing tolk about examount of floride by concentration and a given leader of water or gallon of water els yo have to ask ol how much tap waterare you drinking every day er you have to ask that question rihe it is not simply the concentration it is how much you are injesting over all and that something that is much harder conto control for again in the water episode i talk about was to e liminate or reduce floride in the drinking water if that is a concern of yours but if you want to know why there is floride in drinking water it is because governments figured out eh well if we want a reduce tooth decay what is the simplest low cost method to do that well it is to put floride in the drinking water and you now also now know why there is floride in a lot of toothpace but given the concerns about fhierard health petentual concerns about brainhealth ow you also know why many pee ull including some dentists that i spoke to ar not big fans of floride both for children and for adults you just have to make a decision for you i'm not here to tell you what to do you just have to decide are you pro neutral or against floride in your drinking water and if are your going to filter are you going to completely avoid drinking any water may be cooking with any water from the tap and on and on but now whi floride is in drinking water and floride is in toothpace if you are somebody wuse conserned about floride in either are both of those sources well then what you really want to think about in what most of us probably should be think about anyway is trying to increase the remineralization state of ir teeth and mouth in ways that do not create the opportunity for any other health hazard and i will say this as well which is that there is some data not a lot but some data that floride might not be great for our oral microbioman as will soon learn the oral microbiom is critical for our oral and overal health i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker as a personalized neutrition platform that analizes data from your blood en dan e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your healthicals i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood tast im majyour problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy cause they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et cetera but it give you specific directives that you can follow that relate to neutritian behavioral modification supplements et cetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracker dot calm slash huberman to get twenty per cent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen in a moment we are going to get in to what to do the two dos the behavioral to dos and some of the other to dos for trying to keep your mouth in the best possible remineralization state the best p h for tooth health for gum health for avoiding periadontal disease may be even for reversing some aspects of tooth and peradontal sickness because indeed you can do that if you shift your mouth to the correct p h if youre putting it into that remineralization mode eh however before we get into the two dus i think it is very important to discuss the do nots that every dentist and perydntis i spoke to agreed on the quicklist as i'll call it of bad for your teeth bad for your mouth and therefor bad for your brain and body or not surprisingly perhaps alcohol which by the way i did not entire episode about iull call its one of our more popular episodes i'm not here to tell you to never drink if youre an adult is nt nol colic but the cut off seems to be to alcohol base drinks per weak beyond which you run into trouble and yes zero is better than any but here when we say alcohol is not good for oral health and for tooth health what we are talking about is the desruption that alcol creates to the microbiom and the way that alters the p h of your saliva and places the mouth and the th into a d mineralization state that is very clear it also kills certain cells of the moulth some people i remember this in college would say th all you kow ifyou have got a you have got a exscracth in the back your throat you are getting sic an e should drink anlencs o they said you should drink it is con o kill that thing oft welt guess what it does the exact oppositic kills off a bunch of things that you want the cells in and around the mucosa layer of the mouth that are actually in a provide a mun support and eliminate those bacteria virosnes ah that are making you sick et cetera alcals bad or not saying you should not drink at all if you are nonalcolicadulth you have to decide for you but just understand that if you are drinking alcohol thet you want to pay extra attention to your oral health and your tooth care practices especially on the days or round that alcohol consumption and if you'e somebody does not want to drink alcll now you have yet another reason do not drink alcohol the second thing on the no fly list or the not good for us list for sake of oral health are stimulants now f course things mathemphedemin which are you a severely diliterias a dictive drugus for all sorts of reasons they kill dopleman urgic and other brain norons they are highly addictive om and on and on but also stimulants aderal vivans et cetera those stimulants basely any drug that increases epineferan and norepan eferon call a drenalane in orgentlan or the other names for those are going to have a negative effect on oral health does that mean you should stop those medications if you been prescribe them no it means that you should do some other things to try an offset the negative consequence of stimulants why would stimulants cause such desruption in oral health whle therereally two reasons there is a chemical reason and thre's a mechanical reason the chemical reason is that stimulants change the p h of your saliva making the mouth more acitic which make strep mutans an other bacteria more capable of creating cavities down into the teeth they take your mouth and your teeth from that remineralization state or as i've been referring to mode to that d mineralization dmon mode demon mode that is a way i remember its bad demon mode demon mode not good may be an o vdiogam demonmod is good demon mode not good for the mouth d mon mode dmoneralization mode there is a chemical reason why stimulants desrupt the oral health milu and cause desruption an tooth health and degradation dmon of the enamel of the teeth and deeper layers of the teeth and this is profoundly evident in methatics but the other reason and this was a reason that was shared with me by a physicion and em ty from universiy california san francisco who interacts by virtue of his profession with a lot of methamphedemian attics who have terrible teeth is that stimulants in courage mouth breathing watch a methatic or watch somebody whois on a high dose of stimulants and they tend to mouth breathe because of the shifts and autonomic nervous system function the tendto be mouth brethers it is the drying of the mouth that also shifts the mouth from that remineralization mode to demineralization mode if you do take stimulants by prescription i would hope not methamphedeming or lisa drugs but if you take prescription stimulants and by the way things well butrin modapinil they do qualify is stimulants even though mo daphnofs little bit of a a special case any drug that increases nor up an eferanepanefron any stimulant and yes indeed coffee will talk about coffee as well and tea will make the saliva more acitic and make your oral health potentially less good mouth breathing bad for oral hoth bad for teeth bad badbet there is just no question about it to day's discussion 'm calling oral health but that includes oral air way health and i've talked before on this podcasts about the fact that if you can be in naselbry there bea nasalbreather please as longs you are not speaking songs you are not eating tryim breathe through your nose if you are exercising exercising really hard that you are running really hard fine mouth breathe i do not thik there is any evidence that staying in nasal breathing mod all the time while exercising is best for performance in fact to the contrary there are times when youin to mouth breathe and their sports where yean to exail through the mouth specifically certain marshal arts for instance not saying do not ever breathe through your mouth but as much as possible trying keep the oral cavity moist and closed if this is critical stimulants dry out the mouth they increase the acity the saliva that is bad smoking cigarettes and yes also canabas and yes vaping does this to it funnyn any time i tolk about smoking being bapula well what about canabas well i did not episode about canabas canabas does have certain medical uses that are very interesting and am there is good evidence for those but for many people canabas is not a god idea you can check out that episode to decide for you then beill ask what about vaping vapingsnos bat smoking right that is hat they say here there sort of asking saying hoping wishing fantasizing and the truth is that vaping is terrible for yourral health as well is it asbad is smoking probably not but it is bad for bunch of other reasons that off set any gain or gains you would get from vaping instead of smoking just kno that if you are smoker or a vapor were if you vape rather that you are going to on to pay extra attention to some of the otherprotocalls discussed and that we will discuss going forward in order to try and support your oral and therefore your whole body health a case we have got i'll call stimulant smoking slash vaping and by extension dipping tobacco frankly not good for oral health or tooth health in fact they can be procancerous to the gum tissue it is well established and they can also cause degradation the gum tissue and even someof the underlying bone if you tend to do it on the same side all the time or often at allth that is not good we already discuss that sugar is not good for oral health does that mean you can never in jest sugar no of course not enjoy the sweets you enjoy every once in a while enjoy an ice pastry do as you will am if you are smebody never eats those things great but then understand that any carbohydrate any starch provides a sugar that strep mutans can eat in create acid n and demineralize your teeth create cavities that is avoid sugar in access and if you eat sugar try nd rints your mouth after and ideally you would brush maybe even floss after i do know those people that after every meal o run and even the min all the day they runde the mathroom and brush their teeth and floss and tat's great but most people do not do that swishing water rinsing your mouth out again plan water may be with a little bit of salt in it it is going t be beneficialwill alk about mouth washes later just if you low window into were were headed with that most mouth washes terrible terrible for your oral health especially alcohol base or anticeptic basemouth washes except under certain conditions prescribed or otherwise ocet if you eat any sugar and frankly after you eat anything it is a good idea to trying clear as much of that food product from your mouth you may not think you still have food in your mouth and teeth but tryn it you swish some water may be spittet out may be swalloed that is up to you are you a spit or swallow not my business do not want a kno do not tell me do not put in the comments just decide for you but sugar and other food products residing in the mouth for long perieds of time not good and similarly acidity foods that are acidic certain things citros fruits which i love i love oranges ihave an orange tree my back yard now and i absoutely love it i love oranges great fruit ojust i love the peal i even eat the peal sometimes delicious and no one' telling you not to eat acidic foods or to avoid acidtic drinks lemon water or carbonate lemin water some people are really extreme in they decide to just use a straw when they drink those things in fact thet dentists i spoke you said yes could you ask people please if they are gong to drink acidic drinks to try and use a straw but then i said wyll youn o hon o straws they destrupt the environment most people are not carrying around metal straws or and what about the turtles this kind thing and they said well o ca hears the real truth the real truth is it is the amount of time that the mouth is exposed to that acid ifthe're gong to drink it drink it over the course of five ten fifteen may be twenty thirty minutes and then be done with it rints out the mouth with a itl bit of water and trying clear out that acidity it is not about completely avoiding acid foods or sugary foods or acidic drinks it is about again limiting the amount of time that the overall milleu of the mouth is acidic because of this whole demon remon things trap mutans and the acid created by strep mutans that can derod the teeth in the fact that of your mouth is kept acidic for long perieds of time you are going to provide the opportunity for faster and deeper development of those cavities and keep this in mine again any time we talk about demineralization the formation of cavities rememberid a cea saw it is either demon or remon but not both any time you'r demineralizing your teeth you are also not remineralizing your teeth case really avoid alkohol stimulants smoking vaping sugar mouth breathing acitic foods acitic drinks but many of us most of us cannot avoid any sugar's any acitic foods the other things can be avoided but some of us are perscribe these drugs and need these drugs some people a drink with alkallit in every one somwhile and it is perfectly fine for them or they have deemed it perfectly fine for them in that case try and rints the mouth try and keep the millu of the mouth as moist and as basic or alkaline rather lessacitic as possible to translate this a bit more to the real world if you are somebody me who loves tea i drink colbrews ero sugar your bamate that is my favorite source of cafin i also a nice black doublespreso or coffee every once in a while it is fine to drink that but you dn't want to sip on those sorts of things all day and you do not wan to sip on them for hours and hours and if you are going to combine those things with some acitic foods or with any kind of food youon't try and get your meals done wrap em up and rints your mouth and move to the next part of your day and that actually segways into a really important point that came about when researching this episode that if i had to hihlight bold face underline and light up one particular protocal that i think most everybody is not thinking about is that there are certain times in the twenty four hours circadian period in which your mouth makes the maximum amount of saliva oqe and that the saliva has an opportunity to be the optimal p h that is chemistry for encouraging remineralization of your teeth and that is during the daytime and especially through the middle of the day now therer couple things that can disrupt that for instance eating anything i do not care f your carnivor vigan whatever omnivor when you eat you change the p ch of your saliva and your introducing those sugars that the bacteria can feed on one thing that became very clear to me when researching this episo talking to experts reading manuscripts and also reading some really interesting books about remineralization opportunities for the teeth is that having a stretch of time of maybe two for six hours or more where you are not eating anything or ingesting anything that is acitic in terms of liquids can be very beneficial now this is a vote in support of called intermittent fasting this is something that i practice typically by eating my first meal somewhere round eleven a m every morning sometimes earlier sometimes have ab breakfast at nine if i particularly hungry but typically i eat my first meal round eleven a m or noon and then i eat my last bite of food by about eight p m not everyone likes to do intermit ant fasting and i realize forsake a weight loss it is probably interchangeable with coloric restriction generally and there is a lot of debate as to whether not interment fasting is going to extend life span whether now it is better from metibolic health and sibil cloric restriction i dont ant to get into that debate frankly ts a barbed wire debate that is been carried out on this podcastin elsewhere before and i think is i on going i think it is the of the best way to couch that debate but in researching this episode it became very clear that we have an amazing opportunity during the day especially in the morning and throughout the day to create a lot of saliva that is the right p h to support remineralization of the teeth provided that there is not a lot of food or a citic liquids in the mouth of that time at least to my mind this is an interesting opportunity to place intermit an fasting which again or even just gaps between meals not constantly snacking or sipping on a citic beverages throughout the day as an opportunity to create that healthy mileu during which the teeth can remineralize and the overall oral health can improve now does that me you should never eat or drink anything during the mill the day no i'm not saying that i'm saying that if you are going to do those things trank clear them from your mouth as i describe before now many of you will probably say hey during the middle of the night i'm not eating your drinking anything for some of you that might be the only time they yu're not eating your drinking anything because you are asleep one would hope you are sleep but here is the interesting thing every cell tissue and organ in our body is on a twenty for our circadian clock i think many of you have heard me say that in the contects of yiewing morning sunlight and other protocals that i it suggest on the huverminad podcast but here is the interesting and important point in the middle of the night indeed you are not in jesting any food or fluids presumably but you are salivar production is tramatically reduced again dramatically reduced and a's a consequence if there is food or rather food opportunity for strep me utens another bactory to feed on and create acid to a road your teeth the saliva necessary to offset that to combat that is simply not present or at least not present at the same levels that it is during the day this is a sort of two prong protocol on the one hand i'm saying you might consider trying to introduce maybe an hour or two hour or longer stretches during the day in which you are not in gjesting any food and if you are drinking anything it is not a citic or if you are to tryind rints away that acid as much as possible plain water would be great avoiding carbonated lemon water be great but if you those things and indeed i love those things i love carbonate lemon water i love as yerbomate indeed the erbomate i as cobru zero sugar but has some lemon an ginger in it e that is fairly acitic but then drinking it down either pretty quickly or if you are go sip on it than rincing away with some water and not doing that throughout the entire dand indeed i tend to drink my cafine early in the day and not much throughout the da may be a low bit of a mate in the afternoon sometimes ay that is one aspect of maintaining or encouraging the corr c ph of saliva to re mineralize your teeth right create these windows of opportunity where there is a lot of saliva for long stretches of time during the day as long as possible while still maki at compatible with your nutrition needs in your hydration needs of course the other prong or the other aspect of this protocal is that at night when you go to sleep you need to know you are not producing very much saliva and that is the critical time to make sure that there is as little opportunity as possible for strep mutans and other bacteria to feed on sugars or other food products and thereby to creat acid that creates cavities and this is a very important proto call the every single dental and oral healf care professional i spoke too supported and indeed champions which is if there is a most critical time of day or night to brush your teeth and floss and clean your teeth it is at night time it is at night time why my saying this with such whispered importance well i think there are many people out there in particular people that fall into that second category that i mention at the beginning of to day's episode that wake up in the morning and brush their teeth maybe ven use mouth wash maybe floss and you ill bunch of things to try ind get their mouth clean and fresh especially if they are going to interact with other people during the day and to and get rid of all the constickiness and yon your mouth your morning breath that kind of thing but that at night their finishing dinner maybe having some desert doing some mwork and passing out without brushing their teeth ar flossing or simply getting too lazy to brush or flos and by the way i'm an a raise my hand at just say for many years i was in that category i know i gross but i was in that categora had high motivation to brush and floss or at least to brush in the morning very little motivation to do it in the evening every professional sad if you are going to brush and floss just once per twenty four hours and that is not what they recommend by the way but if you were going to do it just onces the critical time the most essential time to brush and floss and clean the mouth and get the milleu of the mouth correct for tooth care and mouth over all oral health is at night before you go to sleep because you al ready know the mechanistic backbone for this argument because at night you are producing far less saliva and if there is any food product there that the bacteria can feed on the saliva is not there to combat that because it is a constan battle betwen acidity and alcalinity your saliva's coming in trying to save everything and the strep mutens is trined destroy your teeth and the acid is the weapon re they use and what fuels that weapon ry what provides the more amo to destroy your teeth are sugars and ascidity if you were going to rush or floss and ideal you do both only once por twenty four hours it would be at night before going to sleep indeed much that i would say that night time brushing and flossing is perhaps one of the most important things that we can do for over all or health care well talk about what to do what to use for brushing and flossing an a few minutes but that is absolutely essential i d do not want that to be translated in to you only need to brush or brush and floss once per twenty four hours every professional i spoke to and all of the data point to the fact that doing it twice per twenty four hours is best or perhaps even three times per twenty four hours but let us be onest most people are not going to brush and floss three times every twenty four hours some well but most will not and now of course i've been saying brushing and flossing but i have not talked about the incredibly extensive landscape of how to brush and floss now let us take ourselves back to being little kids right whend we were taught to brush our teeth in a particular way and is fus suspend a certain number of minute set a time er a's to floss in a certain way every time we go to the dentist they tell us to floss in a cert may do this not this what do the data really say what are the modern health professionals in dental and or health really suggestion we do when it comes to brushing and flossing and fortunately here there is a near uniform consenses there is always that outlier that person that says to do things a little bit differently or no is in fact one person very prominent in the dental health space that is not a fan of flossing but they are really the out lier the vast majority of dentists out there all say the same thing you need to brush you need to floss you need to do it twice to day were more and you need to do it correctly now let us talk about what correct brushing and flossing really is o case i'm not going to demonstrate how to brush your teeth but one very actionable proto call that was told to me by all the dental professionals i spoke to was use a soft tooth brush now this one hurts i suppose hurts less anyway it hurts my hart a little bit because i enjoy very much using a medium or hard tooth brushand really scrubbing back there especially i teeth in the back is feels good i feelik cam doing something good again the backs ofy teeth the frunts of the teeth an i actually enjoy brushing my teet especially lately ask me why butt i do but every single one of them said that that very vigorous brushing with medium or hard as they are called bristles really distrupts the interface between the teeth in the gums in ways that is not healthy for the gums nashally makes tenting of the gums and those pockets those recesses as they 're called far more likely to form and every single one of them said if you are regular with your brushing and espessially if you are brushing and flossing regularly that a soft tooth brush that is one that is moved in a circular motion on the fronts and backs of your teeth for all your teeth and that is gentle you are not providing a lot of prussure is going to be the best way to break up that bile film layer each in every time and promote the best tooth and over all oral health suppose sam manufacturers who are making medium and hard tooth brushes may be give us some rasional for that em because the dental professionals that i spoke to and a can i spoke to a fair number of them all said the same thing soft tooth brush notchas better soft tooth brush best likewise if you use an electric tooth brush which i now do somehives us whitch back and forth but use an electric tooth brush it was recommended that you not provide too much prushure that you really trying keep the tips of the bristles on the the teeth an gums and yes it was also suggested that people brush their gums this is interesting for people out there who have tooth sensitivity one of the major suggestions from people in the dental and peridontil field at least the ones i spoke to was to actually brush your gums lightly to increase circulation of blood and other neutrients to the deeper portions of the tooth that actuall extend into the bone now there is a tremendous amount of blood flow to the gums any one whos it is are nick their a gum with a a while while flossing or with a toothpick untill you bleeds very readily and that is not a good thing rond you do not want to create bleeding of the gums s lok about bleeding the gums during flossing in a moment by the way do not jump the gun just yet is at jump the gun not jump the gum by the way if you are brushing your gums make sure useing a soft tooth brush if you are using electure tooth rus make sure you are going very lightly on the gums and because there is much blood flow to the gums it does encourage a lot of circulation to some of the deeper cavities of the tooth as it turns out i doft want to revert to tooth anatomy any kind of detailed way now but of course with in the tooth youe again enamelly of the dentin you have got what is called the the pulp or the center there is a lot of nerves enervating the center of the tooth is munch of other tissues and and the bone around it and layers et cetera and when you masage or lightly brush the gums around thereyou are encouraging a lot of blood flow to those deeper components of the tooth which are really the live and active components of the tooth that require blood flow in neutrians this is a good thing in facht it is probably such a good thing that most people perhaps all of us should do it but most people probably will not take the time to also brush their gums but if you have a la bit of time it can be beneficial especially if you have sensitive teeth the idea that is emerging dow the dentle field is that it can help promote razilients or t less sensitivity of the teeth to things hot and cold and may be even to prushure before we talk about flossing i just want a re emphasize that the reason to brush your teeth than the reason to brush your teeth lightly or without too much prussure that is is that if you are regular with your tooth brushing and flossing the maingoal of brushing is to break up the bile film layer that provides a substrate for strep mutans and other bacteria to layer on thicker layers of bacteria call plac that will eventually turn to tarder cy if we really wanto gruss ourselves out and really mote of a brushing and flossing maybe we should describe that what happens with strep mutans is it forms the strand bacturia they's little seelias other attache to the tooth is the bie film layer sof the little strands of strings but if enough it ife accumulates than it gets thicker and kind o mossy as colic you'n thicker it looks t on a sponge of form and that is the plack and then if enough of it forms and there is enough acidity in the mouth then it forms tartar which is the hard caked on stuff that require scraping off by the dentist you and some people get a lot of tartar some people less tartar build up depenning on how diligent they are at removing the bile film with brushing now you can remove bile film and plack with brushing but once it starts to form tartar that is once it is layered on some as has a yellowish tint to it then you really strart to run into trouble because brushing and flossing we will not remove that tartar and that is why the dentis neens to get in there and scrape it away it is ideal to be diligent about removing the backteria while it is still in that strand or platform i dealing within thi when it still in that strand form removing that bile film if you have ever bento the dentist you may recall they will do this tooth polishing they will do that thing with a kind of a griddy stuff on your teeth and you wonder is this to make my teeth wider and indeed it can create a bit more shineg or sheen too your teeth but the main reason for doing that it turns out is to make the surface is of your teeth smooth after all they do it on your backs tover your teeth too an if their good dentis they do on the backs of your teeth as well why would they do it there it cannot be for cosmetic purposes well they do that because the smooth surface makes it hartar for those strands that bile film to stick and form and certainly for the more dense plack and tartar layers to build up on top of it theye make your teeth smooth that the the bacteria cannot adhere to it as readily but it is the daily protocalls of tooth and oral health that are really critical we will talk about dental visits and frequency of dental visits and what a dental visit is really about is always about cleaning or filling et cetera but in the meantime brushing and brushing often enough such that you do not get any build up a bile film for very long periods of time eliminating or reducing the amount of plack and tartar that builds up is going to be your best strategy for improving tooth health now what about flossing there is ittle bit of debate about flossing in the dentistry field some people say if your gums bleed when you floss you need to floss more in fact most dentis i spoke you said that but they also emphasize that you need to floss correctly you cantcjus pull the floss down on to the gum in between the tooth you need to glie down the side of the tooth get we will bit underneath the gum and ouse a circular motion and then lift up from between the too teeth which frankly is a lot easier if your teeth are not very very close together right some of us have teeth that are very close together and wenyou try n to bring it up through the eeth it is more of an effort uquet but they really all emphasize trying to knot drop this rather sharp floss and heare we could also be talking bout the toothbick basefloss wir there is a little arc with a with a we will bit of floss across from it the one you can buy some beblach use toothpicks r old fashion method a frankly most entis i spoke to do not want people jabbing their mouthand gums with toothpicks how you can decide for yourself but almost all of them except for one felt that flossing is a great idea for tooth health and that if your gums bleed when you floss correctly as i just described what correct flossing is that you ere best trategy is to floss at least twice a day between all of your teeth and if you are not in floss twice a day for whatever reason in protest or for lack of time at least once a day and when woith that once a dabe it would be at night before going to sleep for the reasons we talk about earlier and several dentas i spoke you said that using a water pick is going to be better than using more typical floss or for or using those toothpick baste floss approaches because it is gentler on the teeth i personally have not used a water pick but i'm rove entreage by the the concept because it sounds i gits a much harder to damage the gums and teeth by doing it and that it is at least as a fishing as standard flossing for those of you that have the disposable income and the interest in using a water pick sounds ike it could be really god idea for the vast majority of us me just getting some traditional a floss and using gentle floss a at least once a day at night and i deally also in the morning after brushing that seems the most direct and low cost strategy i should just mention that the pediatric dentis that i spoke to mentiond that flossing is really about removing food product from between the teeth and therefore children younger than six who typically have big spaces between their baby teeth and their adult teeth have not yet come in infact thats wit those spaces are about by the way unless youar me and when you were a kid your teeth were too close together and all your adult teeth came in behind those teeth was really miserable experience for me most kids their baby teeth are spaced out a bit an in order to allow the adult teeth to come in to erupt as it is call such a dramatic word lovereenthess literature when the moulders eropt its wo now it is is come up through the gums those spaces are really there for the adult teeth to come up through the gums and it was suggested that children who have those spaces between their teeth and the spaces are big do not need to floss between those teeth because it could cost some damage to the gums rather they should just focus on their brushing now let us talk about some protocals that involve changing the chemistry of your mouth not just immediately after meals are during brushing or flossing but really around the clock and one of the key protocals that i'd to discuss is the use of an artificial sugar called zylotall zlotall is a very low calory sweetener i can place it among the other localory sweeteners aspertam sucrelo stevia et cetera but what is unique about zylotall is that very much standard sugar or any kind of carbohydrate sugar the bacterios strpticocus mutans loves to eat zylotol but when strepticocus mutans eats zyolotol it does not meaning it cannot produse the acid that normally would demineralize the teeth and create cavities in addition to that when strepticocus mutans eats zylotol it kills streptococus mutans what this means is that if zolotoll is present in the orl cavity after a meal say in the minutes an hours after a meal then any strep mutans that happens to be there is going to preferentially feed on the zyolotol not other sugars and it will not be able to release acid and because zylotol can actually inhibit the growth and that is the proliferation of more strep mutans we have got a tufer weve got a situation where strep mutans cannot releuase acid to demineralize the teeth and potentially cause cavities and the total amount of strep mutans that can grow that can proliferate in what are called colonies literally the bacteria colonizes on the teeth in that forming that biophil or then that cannot happen zalotol is a very potent tool for improving oral health in this way in addition zyolotol reduces inflammation of the gum tissue and other soft tissues of the mouth and zlatoll is providing in a ray of positive benefits especially when its presinto the mouth immediately after a meals and for that reason their number of different dentits that created ziolotol products in the form of gums or in the form of mnce specifically to be used after meals by chewing a few of these zilotol mince where by chewing a ziolotol based gum immediately after a meal your taking substantial steps towards improving the chemical milu of your mouth and inhibiting the proliferation of cavity forming streptococus mutans now you can also find some literature on other proposed benefits of zyoleotol such as improving over all microbiom ah such as reducing inflammation in other tissues besides the gums and within the mouth there is some evidence that it can support the gotmicrobyom because of course the oral microbiom an the gutmicrobiom or contiguous they have different compartmentsimy might even be surprise to learn that within your mouth there differen niches as their called for instance there is different microbiota that live on the gums verses the hard palet verses the zophpalot back in the throat and then as you descend into the gut et cetera and it does appear that ziolatol has certain positive benefits for all of those different gop microbiom miches but the literature on that is less well substantiated than for instance the literature showing that if ziolotol is put in as a surigat sugar substrate for strep mutans that it disables strep mutans and co prevent the formation of cavities now as far as i know when consumed in mint form or gum form i'm not aware of any specific cide effects or bad effects of zolotol provided that its not consumed in excess but as with everything dosage matters if you are somebody who wants to explore the use of zylatol gum ere zalotol mince after ameal i would not suggest going from consuming ero zalatoll mince to consuming fifty a day or something that reven tenaday you might start off slowly and just consume one or two after a meal ay beu just your morning meal may be just your evening meal something of that sort rather than choewing alatol gum all day long et cetera et cetera i'll just mention one other positive benefit of zalatoll gum which is if you u zlatol gum after say your noon meal or your early day meal it further increases the production of saliva which as we talked about before is a great thing because one of the best ways to support oral health and tooth health is to have a long stretch of time in the middle of the day where you are producing a lot of healthy saliva in large amounts because again salivas this incredible stff that supporting remineralization of the teeth lots and lots of reasons to think about may be consider using zalatol gum rzalatoll mince their number of different ones available out there i have zero again zero financial relationship to any of those mint or gum companies i'll provide a lincon the shownote captions to one source the company and the products were developed by a dentists doctor elly philips who is quite prominent in the public health education space around dental health some of her views or little bat controversial her views on flossing other of her views i find frankly quite a head of their time in that she is been talking about a number of these things promoting the health of the ora microbiom and the potential value of zalatoll gums and mince et cetera for some period of time i think most of the information that she puts out there is supported by other dentists and she still suggests regular dental visits o am nothing renegade out there or heretical ah again there are other sources of zalatol gums and mince that you could consider i'm simply putting a link to the one that i use because i happen t use them and them i to use the discussion about zilatall as a segway into a discussion about toothpacte because there is a lot of controverscy out there about which toothpace are better for us may be ven bad for us and best for us i think it is fair to say baston what we all now know about zalatol that if you can find a toothpace that contains zalatoll as a sweetener that can only be a good thing and indeed there are a number of the malt there will talk about specific sources and li bit but let us just put zalatol on the om short to not short list of things that would be great to have in a toothpae for all the reasons that you now understand the real big quession with toothpace is always should i use a toothpace that has floride or avoid toothpace that have floride and in order to answer that we hae to go back to our earlier discussion about floride it really depends on whether'r not your somebody that thinks that florate is great because it creates the superphysiologically strong bonds within our teeth the crystal structures are that much stronger then when forned by hydroxy appetite or whetheror not your somebody who is wary of floride that you are concerned about potential brainhealth issues or thiroid issues and here i think people really do fall into either camp or the camp frankly of i do not known should i be worried i do not know if i should be worried i personally grew up using floride toothpace i we have the con a standard namebrand floride toothpace am in our bathroom i brushmyn tooth those for years whether not that negatively impacted my health or not i do not know iget my blood work don my thidwoard harmons are normal a my brain o works at least reasonably well but i do realize that some people are very concerned about floride and they just do not want it anywhere near their kids they do not want it anywhere near themselves if your somebody whois goingto air on the side of caution with floride and you are seeking a non floride containing toothpace there are such toothpaces out there and most of those if not all of them contain you guessed it hidrocy appetite they contain the minerals that naturally form the bonds that create that additional enamel that can potentially filling cavities and by reminalization of the enamel and some of the deeper layers of the tooth if one is seeking toothpace and you want to avoid floride you would want to find something that ideally had hydroxy appetide and something that had zilethall and they often also contain some sort of mild abracive ocaynota not a really scratchy abrace of substance a but a mild abracive that can really allow for breaking up the biol film that we talked about earlier nowhave provided links to a couple of sources for such toothpace and also for of these toothpace tablets am that i've been using lately as well sometimes switch back and forth between the too these are tabletsthat you chew up and then you a brusher toeoth immediately after with your wet toohbrush both of them work quite well again i want to be clear that the companies that i've provided link to in the show no captions are companies for which i have absolutely zero financial relationship i do know some of the peopl that started these companies i i shal discovere these companies because these people are dentis or periodantis or other people in the oral health field a but i also want to be very clear that there was no exchange of promotion of their products for information or otherwise i simply trie and the products and i just happen to have learned somethings about oral health care from these people separate an away from anything about toothpace or ziletolls et cetera o kso want to be very clear that i do believe these are quality sources these are the toothpace and tooth tablets that i happen to use gums amints that i happen to use large part as a consequence of researching this episode but i payful price for them i'm certainly not suggesting that anyone else has to use them they just represent one option if you are looking for nonfloride containing tooth pace and some other things to promote oral health and i'm sure there are other sources out there and if you to refer the various viewers and listeners of this podcast tof those sources cause you feel very strongly about those other sources just put those in the common section on you too o kay let us talk about mouthwash wer mouthwash is plorel at the beginning of to day's episode i said let us determine what category of oral health you are in are you somebody who pays lot of attention to or health you brush and floss at least twice to day you are using mouthwashes tooth whiteners perha ps as well or are you in category two or three well here is the deal most all most all not all but most all mouthwashes especially those containing alkohol or terrible for or health simply put they deplete certain components of the mucosal lining of the mouth and they disrupt the healthy components of the oral microbio for those of you that rely on such mouthwashes i would really encourage you to learn more abalt them you are about to do that now you are lready doing that now and th really con sider whether not they are helping or harming your oral health now iam not suggesting that you create a scanareo wer your breath is causing other people to dissolve into a puddle of tears or back away from you quickly that is not what you want that is not what i want that is not what anyone wants but i think it is important to realize that these alckohol base mouthwashes are not good for us in addition there are anticeptic mouthwashes some of which contain aukhol some of which do not which sometimes are proscribed for very serious bacterial overgrowth and infections of the oral cavity if you are dentists or physician or pariodantis proscribes those i certainly a not going to try and get in the way of that prescription that is between you and your haulth care professional but you would be wise to ask them whether or not these cloraxidine tyhe mouthwashes et cetera or potentially bad for other components of oral health or microbioda in the gut generally because in some cases they have been shown to be not good for us at the same time we do not want over proliferation of really bad bacteria in the mouth we doft want infections to run wild either most people however are using mouthwashes to freshon their breath and to kill off additional bacteria in the mouth that they might believe they could not get with brushing or flosing if you are somebody who really wants to use a mouthwash for that reason i encourage you to try and find a mouthwash that is not alkohol based and that is not a strong anticeptic or that if it is an anticeptic that it is not aukohol based huquen such muthwashes exist out there theyre little bit hard to fine i'll provide a link to at least a couple of them in the show note captions here i have to say i have not tried those mouthwashes yet they do come from sources in which they were developed by license dental heath care professionals but as is always the case when somebody selling something it is worth while to do diligence now as we talk about tooth pase and mince and gums and mouthwashes i think it is worth taking a step back and also asking the question are there any zero or very very low cost or even costsaving alternatives to any of this and the great answer is yes there are actually a number of things that you can do with basic over the counter stuff from the grocery store that all the dentists i spoke to said yet that is a pretty good option it is not the best option available perhaps but it is a pretty good option and in many cases it is better than the typical commercially available toothpaste or mouthwash for instants i would imagine based on everything i now know about the structure of teeth that using something baking soda to brush the teeth would indeed scrape off the bile film perhaps even whiten the teeth a little bit although it is we talked about early are not really whitening the teeth yroughashu just changing the a reflectiveness a and some of the composition of that enamel which is translucent that you can see the underlying components better well i talk to several dentis and they told me that baking soda actually as fairly low on the a braciveness rating scale they have a specific rating scale for this we do not have to go into but it is actually considered quite safe for the enamel of the teeth especially if you are brushing with a soft toothbrush and you are not really grinding the stuff against your teeth at maximum intensity or even near maximum intensity turns out that baking soda and water is actually a pretty good toothpaste if you are not going to go by a toothpacte that is good news now you may have heard that you can make a sort of mouth wash or mouth rints with baking soda water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide i ont emphasize a little bit but i'm also going to emphasize i do not thing this is a good idea at all why is not not a god idea at all well first of hle when we were kids we used to take baking soda and hydrogen proxide and put them together to simulate volcanos on that tells you right there the kind of chemical reaction that you are going to get but in addition to that it is pretty clear that hydrogen peroxide unless there is a specific medical recommendation to do is not something you want to introduce to the oral cavity now this is something that i'm very familiar with because when i was a poststocxso this is in the two thousand five to two thousand ten stretch i started to get some pretty bad canker sores i do not know about you but canker sores feel awful to me i hate them when you eat they hurt yeu swallow they hurt when you do anything they pretty much hurt and some one gave me the recommendation to use a little bit of baking soda dissolved in some water and a little bit of hydrogen proxide to use that as a oral rents and of course then to spit it out and i did that and actually what happen to me as i got almost quarter size olsors on the roof of my mouth and on the sides of my mouth it took those little canker sores which were annoying and count of painful and turn them into full blown alsers i know this because when i stopped using it those healed up almost immediately and then when i spoke to some dentis and perydauntis is it oyaa hydrogen proxide is just far too a bracive for the mouth cavity and the reason i raise this is because i do not think i'm alone in that if you hant ave venture into some of the am let us call it alternative recommendation space for oral health a you may hear that things hydrogen proxide can be useful for gargling with or swishing with if you are strying to get a la bit of a throat tickle may be an infection and turns out it is a really bad idea now if there are physicians or oral health experts out there that strongly believe in the use of hydrogen peroxide rinces were gargling with it to promote oral health for ny reason let me know in the showno captions i do not want to go against any of those recommendations but this now considered kind of old school recommendation of creating one's own mouthwash with a la bit of baking soda some hydrogen proxide and water does not seem a good idea not just based on my experience but every one of the dentl professionals that i spoke to that said it does seem that creating a high salt solution o case of taking some salt putting into water dissolving it and then finding the point at which it will not quite dissolve because you the concentration of sodium is just high enough and using that as of course not something to swallow but rather as a dental rint putting your mouth and swishing it around and then spitting it out and at scan a taste vory salty and then taking a swig of water just plain water and then swishing it around and then spitting it out that actually provides a really nice milu for the production of healthy mouth bacteria it is near zero cost ispose you neel but a salt low water in a glass to put it in but it is basically zero cost and if you think about it that high saline or high solinity solution is a lot the sort of brines and the liquid that comes from these low sugar probiotic foods that earlier i was suggesting in an other episodes i've suggesting to be really healthy for swallowing for the gut microbioto but again i want to be very clear do not do not swallow high salt concentration fluid were tungng about a swish and then a spitting it out as a way to improve thet overall milu of the mouth to get the pth rit to promote the proliferation of healthy microbiota components o casea we have talked about some commercially available gums and mince containing zile ats all we talked about some commercially available tooth pace indeed some toothpase that you almost fall into the very boutique category because they have all these things that are known by dentists and a perydontis to be great for oral health but those kin run some cost nigt and i do thing it is important that we also talked about the use of just baking soda with a soft toothbrush and some water and gently brushing the teeth as a great way to desrupt the bilefilm and clean your teeth and a high salt solution as a swish and spit followed by a swishiand spit with clear water clean water no solth in it as a essentially very low cost or zero cost mouthwash far and away different from the heavily scented alcohol based anticeptic mouth washes that are commercially available and that we know are basically not good for our oral microbiom in addition a lie to point out that those alcohol based mouthwashes that many people in the world use are also known to reduce the amount of nitre oxide that is produced in the oral cavity and that is very important for the production of nitrocoxide elsewhere in the body whyse that important will nitrocoxide promotes vaso dilation not just within the blood vessels that line and feed the oral cavity but also the throat also in the knos also in the brain also in the heart what we are talking about here is a substance that is indeed increased when we for instance nazelbreath we know that dramatically increase as nitrokoxide we are talking about a substance that when the oral microbiom is preserved in its healthy state tends to increase in production and we are talking about a substance that is really good for small capulary vain and arterial health because it allows for the passage of blood both for the delivery of oxygen and other neutriencs to tissues but also the removal of waste products from tissues we do not want to do anything that reduces nitrokoxide unless there some specific medical condission that leads us to want to do that for most people increasing nitrocoxide or keeping nitrocoxide levels stable is the state that we want to seek and thes alcall base mouthwashes are known to deplete the production of nitrokcoxide there is yet another reason to avoid the use of these alkohol based more typical over the counter mouthwashes by the way this is not a scare tactic against malkhuashes i'm sure that if you use mouthwashes you are still producing some nitrocoxide but i thing nowadays many hopefully all of you are interested in doing whatever you can to improve your mentalhal physicahealth and performance and if there things that you are doing that are inhibiting those in any way that you protentially want to at least think about those may be removed them from your protocals especialy there is a cost of them that you can remove in other words you can save on costs again lots of reasons to move away from the alkohol base standard anteceptic mouthwashes a side from the improvement in your breath that by the way can be better achieved by supporting the oral microbiom other ways that we have discuss there is really no clear advantage as to why one would use one and there apparently are a number of disadvantages now earliere we talked briefly about canker source theire really uncomfortable there a lot of theories as to wy canker source form and therea lot of products and theories as to how to get rid of canker source well indeed there are some ways that we can prevent the formation of canker sours and accelerate their healing and that actually has to do with promoting the health of the gut microbiom the is a clear link between got microbiom and orl microbyom in a way that can either promote or reduce the formation of canker sours and can actually healp heel canker source and to my knowledge the best way to support a quotunquote healthy got microbiom is to consume at least one tofor servings of low sugar formented foods per day i mentioned what some of those are lobe earlier i also did not entire episode about got microbaiom we have posted expert guests on the microbyom including just in sonumberg from stampherd school of medicine and for sake of time i can just briefly list off the things that are known to promote a healthy got microbiom and that would indirectly support the healing and prevention of canker source and those are consuming one af for serving of lo sugar fermented foods per day for instance consuming enough prebiotic fibr consuming a fibr in the diet through fruits and vegetables or perhaps supplementing prebotic or probiotic fibr and in some cases if somebody is really dispiotic or if you ben taking antibiotics actually taking a pill form or capsil form probiotic but it is not something that i recommend people take consistently and i certainly do not i think by injesting those low sugar fermented foods on a regular basis by trying to make sure thatyou aregetting en ough sleep each night this is key probably should ave mention this earlier in the episode a but you one of the folks who i've great respect for in the public health discussion around dental health is doctor mark berheen he goes by ask the dentist on instegram he is a actually a retired dentist a but he is been deeply involved in the kind of a valuation of the consumer product space as it relates to dental and oral health care for a number of years am and markberhen in addition to discussing all the various topics that we have talked about to day such as zilatall and floride yes or florid know et ceter et cetera is also been a big proponent of people paying attention to that first pillar of mental health physical health and performance which is sleep impointing out that when people get fewer than there necessary a lotment of sleep each night typically most people needs sixt eight hours some people nee more some people neel less but getting at least sixto eight hours of quality sleep per night which supports the health of the gotmicrobium and oral microbium and thereby indirectly supports the health of te entire brain and bodi am doctor berhen and others have talked about this but i really appreciate that hes champion the importance of sleep among other things but certainly sleep as a waiy to support the oral microbium we talkd quite a bit about teeth and gums a little bit about mucosal lining and throat one thing that we have not talked very much about the hongue the tongue your tongue is obviously a very important component of your mouth and as i mention earlier different niches different locations within the mouth have different microbioda living on them both good and qotenquote bad meaning ones that we would to promote the proliferation of because they reduce bad breath ad promote oral health thand all that good stuff and coticote bad bacteria because they make our breath smell bad and because they deturate the various tissues of the mouth i looked pretty extensively into this issue of tongue scraping and it is an interesting one and every licensdental health care professional i spoke to in preparing for this episode agreed that yes it can be a good idea to scrape the tongue and each one of them cided the fact that a number of unhealthy bacteria can build up on the tongue cross the course of the day and throughout the night much in the same way that bil film can build up on teeth although through a different process different bacteria and that scraping the tongue er brushing the tongue can be advantageous for removing that bacteria what was interesting is that several of them pointed out that lightly brushing the tongue may in fact be better than scraping the tongue because they argue that espescially when people use those steel tongue scrapers that few people know how to use them with sufficient force to remove the bacteria but not much force that they do not damage the tongue tissue and the tongue is a very fragile soft tissue the recommendation that they relay to me was to suggest once or twice to day brushing of the tongue but here is an important point they all suggested that you use a separate tooth brush to brush your tongue than you would to brush your teeth f things were not complicate enough already i might using a separate toothbrush why well they gave two reasons one is they want to prevent cross over of the bacteria betoeen those too different tissues especially if one is brushing the tongue to vigorously you doft want to introduce bacteria from your tooth brushing unt your tongue of course you can rince it in between but the ideal situation is to use a separate toothbrush for the purpose of brushing the tongue now that opened up a whole exploration and discussion about tooth brush care edo all epizode all about tooth brush caire but we will not suffice to say that when you brush bacteria off your teeth or tongue and presumebly the tooth brush gets moist if by no other means certainly by means of your saliva being on it then you rince it off and then even if you were to dry it off with a clean a some sort of clian towel or something that an you set it out al lot of bacteria are going to purlifrate on that tooth brush this opend up a whole discushion about should you cover your tooth brush or let it dry out in the air should you use uve irradiation a to sterilize your tooth brush and frankly it took us me down the rabbit hole of tooth brush care far that one point i just i ar just scream uncle enough i i think one has to decide how much bacteria they are willing to tolerate living on their tooth brush and between tooth brushings a anywere from zero were youse a new tooth brush or tooth brush head every single time you brush that seems un reasonable or least economically unreasonable for most people verses replacing it once a week verses once every two weeks really there is no specific recommendation i can make all i can say is be aware that bacteriare growing on the ooth brush head trying of void contact between the tooth brush head and any a unsanitary surfaces try in rinte and dry off the tooth brush head all these things are recommendations that were relay to me and that just make good common sense now prior to this episode i put the call out on socia media for questions about oral health and one of the qushions that came back from many hundreds of people was what about fillings what about mettle fillings what about sealents are they safe well most dentists will tell you that sealents are safe they are now made from compounds that are generally not thought to cause any major ir sues to be ons i did not do a deep dive into the chemical composition of different sealents because it turns out the different dental practices use different sealents i'm sure that if i looked hard enough i could find i'm some really bad stuff in sealents i'm sure i could also find some reassurance that at the concentrations and conditions that there introduce to teeth that they are better alternative to having dee cavities into the teeth and that actually gives me an opportunity raise something that i perhaps said earlier but i want to re emphasize which is i've been talking bout how you can remineralize the teeth and how that is cridical if you want to maintain and build up your tooth in oral health but it is very clear that if the cavities get down into the dentine layers of the tooth that in most cases there is no remaining opportuniteeth to reminerralize the teeth using the sorts of practices we are talking about to day and that indeed it is very likely that those cavities need to be drilled and filled ayd now that is not always the case and this is one reason why i highly recommend that if you have listened to this episode and if you are here this poin i the episode then you have listen to the episode that you talk your dentist ask them if they say you have a cavity how deep ar these cavities do you think there is an opportunity for me to remineralize the teeth if i do the following things and if they tell you look you have a cavity or cavities and there are simply too deep into the tooth that you cannot remineralize you'r teeth and fill those in well then ou kno you should trust them there the dental professional if you do not you should find a dfferent dentis however they may be surprized and who knows pleasantly surprize for you to i say hey i heard that you can acsure remineralized teeth and if i've got a cavity but it' still not through the enamel layer oh if i'm really diligent and o yousumsileatall may be some i'm hydroxyappetite and avoid certain things and due certain things discussed in this episode that i could rea a remineralize and fill in those cavities that said there of course will be situations where you need to get those cavities drilled and filled especiall if they make it into the deep deep layers of the tooth and you do not want those cavities to persist and for bac tury itsto preliferate in those deeper layers of the teeth and down into the bone that is oh bad for reasons we talked about early or nucius for your moulth in your teeth but for you'r general health and brain health included for that reason and also because the history of dentistry with such that nolin that early part of the last century if you had a toothache in a cavity what did they do they pull the teeth they extracted the teeth than at some point this business of filling teeth became industry standard people would get metal fillings now the types of metal fillings that people had and have depend on when they got those fillings there were believe it or not lead fillings as is not good you do not want lead in your body for all sorts of reasons it is terrible for brain health it is why it is now e legal to contain and paints and many household goods you do not want lead fillings but some people had lead fillings or silver fillings or commonation of lead sil lver and other things and many metal fillings that were given and sometimes are still given depending on where you live in the world and country and the kind of healf care and costs that you have available to you contain mercury now i ask several dentis about this and said well if somebody has a metl filling that likely has mercury in it do they need to have that metal filling removed and all of the dentis i spoke to said it depends but generally the practiceis to leave those fillings in and try not to diserrupt them now they also provided a important recommendation which is if you have metal fillings that contain mercury or that you think might contain mercury to avoid jisterrupting those fillings to the use of things mastic gum we have not talk to much about mastic gum a iv e used mastic gum before not for long periods of time it is a very thick gum ah the original use of mastic gum and the the kind of origins of mastic gum or a tree sap th kind of fo substance that you chew on as ta strengthin your jaw et cetera am i do not use it any longer i use it for a short while does not taste much of anything some people believe there are certain anti inflammatory and other health benefits of mastic gum i have not really explored mastic gum and enough depth or detail to comment on any of that but a number of dentis said well if you have metal fillings chewing on things mastic gum or hard candies where you really chewing on on that hard candy which by the way your spuss tu stuck the hard candy the jolly ranshur nos ur to chew on them but that some people will do that they are just naturally chew on those can actually diserrupt and liberate some of that mercury and that would be bad and keep in mind also that when mercury is contained in a metal filling it is not really bioactive in that mode but if it is liberated then it can get into the blood stream and petentially cause other issues this is a somewhat controversial topic much that in certain countries and i believe in the e use somebody check me on this by believe that in the not too distrant future metal fillings will no longer be used in the european union perhaps elsewhere in the world there sometimes still used in the united states is a lot that is changing in this landscape around floride around metal fillings et cetera sothe very dynamic landscape right now i think suffice to say that if you have metal fillings currently try not to disrupt them in a way that could liberate that mercury however if you have them in your really concern about them talk your dentis ask what the various options are see whether not thay could be replaced with something safer and if the process for replacing them is really worth the trouble and again to just go back to the larger point of wether not you should get cavities filled whether not you need that route canal that was a very common question a lot of people said do we really need route canals do we really need to drill cavities yet my observation based on now having talk to a number of different practitioners in the space really pay a lot of attention to the pure reviewed research the old school practice is the new practicism where everything is headed is that youl there are indeed instances where people need rout canals there are many cavities that are just too deep into the teeth that remineralization of the teeth through the sorts of proto calls that were talking bout oday is not going to cut it that they really need to be drilled and filled nd of course we hope those dentis are doing that as little as is required to maintain dental health i also would hope the dentists are talking to their patients about ways that they can improve their oral health and indeed thei're a lot of cases reported on line or people will go in get ax rays and in exam they will talk about all these cavities that they have than they go home and they do a bunch of practices and they are able to remineralize their eeth and too essentially reverse those cavities and i certainly do not doubt those stories but it is simply not always the case that we can remineralize our teeth an fill back in our cavities if those cavity recesses are too deep into the teeth they need to be drilled and filled now that raises a final set of questions and points which is do we really need to go to the dentist twice a year every six months that is the general recommendation and this is the tricky one asked dentists because of course dentis are highly incentivize to see their pations and i'm not somebody that believes that everything is at as an attempt to make money but look when moneyis involve angs can get complicated now what was really great is that the feet back i got from dentists was very balanced i mean o i must say that the community of dentists seems a really wonderful community i' know how they treat each other but they were very kind very generous with information with me and at the end of this episode just before wrapping i'll refer you to a couple a on line oral health and dentis educators that i think are providing some really useful content on a consistent basis and i'll provide links to those in the shownot captions but here is what the concensis was this business of going to the dentists twice a year makes sense it make sense from the perspective of coting routine cleanings but every one acknowledge that those routine cleanings while they can remove tartar that is built up that would be very very difficult for people to reverse or eliminate at home and while they can i dentify cavitiese and tell you how far cavity has developed into the tooth et cetera every one of those dentists agreed that those routine cleanings are not actually going to help remineralize your teeth extept to the extent that they remove existing bacteria plac and tarter and all of them said that they wish for and that they really strive in their own practices to promote more oral health daily protocols of the sort that we have talked about to day which i thing is just great i think obvviously at believe in medical professionals providing routine care i also believe in each and all of us doing things for our health not just oral health but sleep health mental health physical halth et cetera to tryine not just maintain but really bolstare our brain and body against disease and also to bolster our vitality to feel really great energetic focus sleeping better et cetera it was refreshing to hear that they feel that way as well and in addition to that all the dentis i spoke to said that setting aside situations of li reconstructive a surgery for the mouth or puridontal surgery which often is needed if that those recesses into the gums and gingividis and and worse have started to really develop in proliferate all of them emphasized that the twice a year dental visit is not just about getting the cleaning it is really the check up to a valuate how those daily practices are emerging it is worte going to the doctor for a check up on your be ami on your blood pressure but also things blood tests things that typically we do not do at home unless we are accessing those through on particular sources but all of them emphasize that going to the dentis twice a year is not just about those cleanings it is allso about establishing what the baseline level of health is in one's mouth and teeth and having that on record and in a very detailed way that one can check back routinely twice a year and discover whether or not in fact they could get away with perhaps one cleaning a year because you are diligent about your brushing flossings ile t hall a not being a mouth breather and on and on or perhaps if you are not being very good about those protocols or and this is important if you have some of the genetic variance that create an over proliferation of certain bacteria that predispose you to gingevitis or that predispose you to excessive build up of tartar this is the reality that some people have genetic variations that create a susceptibility to certain things both bacteria and other conditions in the mouth thet make it such that those people perhaps need to go to the dentist not just twice a year but perhaps four times a year or six times a year indeed their some individuals for whom either because of lack of diligence to protocol and or genetic issues actually need to go to the dentis every single month for major cleanings but fortunately if we are diligent about these daily protocols night time protocols and we really are paying attention to the components that can create healthy salava and remineralize the teeth and that can fill in any cavities that begin to form and were daving off the production of stmutans and were scraping way that bil film on a regular basis that we are going to prevent the need for many routine cleanings and even if we are still getting those two a year routin cleanings for those out there that are fortune enough to have that covered by insurance or can afford it well then all the better because as i mention the beginng of to day's episode oral health is not just about having clean straight white teeth and fresh breath it is not just about that all of those things are great to have but oral health is about all of that and it is also about reducing carty of ascular disease it is about reducing irritable balilsindrom yes i know that we have not done an episode about this yet but i get oh many request to do episodes about irritable balilindrum and other colitos type a boweling got issues that people have nd it is clear that oral health and promoting oral health has been linked to promoting positive got health as well maybe even reducing and possibly eliminating som of the symptoms of irritable bal disease because again the mouth and the gut are contiguous with one annother they are related and a lot of the bacteria that can cause things got issues are making their way into the body not directly through the gut but through the oral cavity because of the richness of blood flow to that region again to day we have talked about a lot of different protocols ranging from cst saving to zero cost to low cost to let just be frank higher cost products and protocol such as water picks et cetera the point of today's discussion was essentially threefold first of all to really tamp down in our minds the importance of oral health not just trooth health but oral health on the whole because of its relationship to brain and body health on the whole much that i'm placing it right up there next to the other six pillars of sleep nutricient movements tresmodulation relationships and light as the seventh pillar of critical to attend to on a daily basis in order to promote our mental halth physical health and performance the second point is that there are many things that we are probably doing currently that we could do differently either by doing them more or perhaps less or eliminating them alltogether things considering whether or not these anticeptic alcall base mouth washes are good for you or not they are not te're bad for you in my opinion but you can decide for you how often you brush when you brush whether or not you decide to ouzile its all et cetera as ways to improve your oral health and of course in doing the strength of your teeth the brightness of your teeth the freshness of your breath et cetera but through some means that i think for most people they were not aware of i certainly was not aware that we could remineralize our teeth at any moment by changing the ascidity the chemical mill you of our mouth and that their very straight forward cost savings your ocosts in lowcost ways to do that and then the third point is that today's discussion by no means was exhaustive right you may be exhausted but it was by no means exhaustive meaning we simply do not have time to go down the rabbit hole of all these other promoted health practices such as for instance oil pulling a lot of people out there believe that if you take oliv oil an swishn around your mouth and spittet outh that is good for your mouth and indeed some dental health care professionals i should say license dental health care professional said yet i think there'e some benefit to that there is the whole story about vite him indee and whetheror not we are getting enough vi thim indee can indeed impacktd our twoth health maxture your vitimen deelevels are sufficient i sou're getting some sunlight again this tisinto some of the other six pillars am i suggesting that everyone do oil pulling no i do not think the pure reviewed evidence on oil pulling is sufficient to suggest that people do that but as a practice considering that it is essentially near zero costs ouon taking lamit of olive oil swishing round your mouth and spitting it out couple sense may be am youknough that' something that you feel benefits you great if you are aware of some terrific purereviewed research on that and you want a p da link to that in the comments on ou tobe grat please send them my way at love to review them but my point is that there are lot of different practices that have been promoted including oyal pulling and a bunch of other things that start to get prete far into the esoteric which does not necessarily mean that they do not have merit but to day i've really tried to focuis on the major ones the ones that relate to what most everybody could and should be doing brushing and flossing rincing getting the oral microbiom healthy reducing the amount of strep mutans than the opportunity of strep mutans to create that acid that is going to depleat the enamel of your teeth and lead to tooth decay trying to limit the amount of recessing of the gums and peridontal disease and for all the reasons that we talked about befor keeping a healthy mouth including healthy teeth healthy tom healthy gums healthy pallet and all the rest is oso important notjus for your mouth notjus for speaking and smiling and licken the way you want to look but also for your heart also for your gut also for your beleeve er not your skin en nave time to go in to this but directly relates to skin health and for your brain health i strongly suggests that all of us take a look at what we are currently

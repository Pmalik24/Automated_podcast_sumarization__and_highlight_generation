curing fods and and during the training they said that before you help the voter be sure the voter is voting for the democrats wout will you told that in your training im now do not recall hearing

would you be able to do it mean to say it is surely there is no pretence that this is about democracy incounting every ballad as you do not di their poace to set bout winning i mean if somebody said i

it and then not do it ihave you had to do that i y had one persent yelet me tramp twenty twenty an tan ha p i did not haveject to do et ar but a day an our program after an election weekfull of uncertainty and even after news organizations looked at the official results and called the election for jobyan there is still more uncertainty present an trup of course is not conceted s calt the vot counts fradulent sat it ay we asstrays of people all over the country living through this weird o kno what to colt gravityless wimbow of uncertainty that we have all been floating through since tuesday speaking for myself of chicking the news compulsively the watching impost of the day after the election this wednesday a hump day for the ages all of is winding how is this command o fellow citizens going through that stay with us cakuin virginia my gigglyas a reporters been fowing molitia groups for the last year and interviewing the man in them en couldn'g lot toguies yhofve been bracing for civil war ever thelast few weeks rom president trump repeatedly encouraged his supporters to go to polling stations and quote watch very carefully on election day my wondered if any these groups and the sguise he knew would heed the call here is my when i called joe clam the leader of a militia in virginia called the ridge runners he told me that is exactly with their gaing rad to do i joined them for a pre election training session in the opolation mountains one chilly saturday morning three weks ago yet you jo would not tell me the location over the fon i met him and about a dozen other guize in came at donalds and followed them to a large farm they start the day standing out of tention behindan a bandoned building with their ay or fifteens al rat reat borgent lat to see you all here thank you all for coming out jus ro quak am weregan a go fer couple things to day u that is all goues a muscular twenty nine year old who looks exactly the former marine sergean he tells me he is e this one of cani bring us all the forefront of all f your minds with the election on the way we will not i need to stay vigilant an now we are all i've been collaborating with all the other group commanders in the area each group is going to have us set number of polling slides that were an be responsible for each polling sight is going to have to hopefully three a grayman operating at that sight grayman wth that means men in plain clothes trying to blend in to the crowds at the polling stations occasion jo tells me what their looking florest groups black lage matter in anteeta they believe could destruct the election in commnae voders or commit fraud they get this from the presidem trump and writ wing media have been raising these fears without evidence for months every one in jos mlishon is white the question of whethe militihas are sonaromis with white nationalists always comes up with groups this and they almost always reject that label all the places that jo imagers might be hotspots an election day a near by citys the pots of people of color but he and his members insist or n t races before january when joe start of the group most of these guides did not know each other jowas one f the most intense people i hade ment n on lichons and when he talks people tin to snap to attention he tells we stories about fighting as the black ot soldier losing friends and killing enemies i chuck with the marines and they tell me they have no record of the survice joe claims that is because its classified when i aske people what drew them to the group they talk about jo is carisma here is a member called savage i went to a luster and withfiel for a group and that group dispasely wont a staner an talk and and ther's nothing wrong with that at do not call yourself a malicia if you just wanted standarnd talk politics jofs group when he come up and deliverd his stayin they talk about trainin and that tat having he do not lake it out shoot rans stown range for fun no we does not wont a train and be a part of som the loun of the day seems the guides are just here to bond and have fun joe les the man through six hours of drills starting with pt and them moving to shootieng posistions and room clearing it the thets ra con tat o can tat fro to undre meter tha ta ta tan tank an movi lo the running a drill here where the ideas that they learn had to cocker each other i lo when i spent time with these groups a' always wondering how seriously you take the idea that they might really engage in violence on the one hand to give each other nicknames slapp each other on the back in sang bang but at the same time they really do believe the countries in danger that they might need ta turn their guns on their fellow citizins one day and they buy into all the un supported claims trump makes about liberals bent on election fraud an violence in the need to stop them and they think they 're th once to do it nearly all the malition men i've spoken to this year believe that democrats commit mass of botorfraud an twenty sixteen and theyv bee doing it again i this year with mailan ballats and early voting joays worry the twenty twenty election could be stolen did did it did it marry you the trump said that om well ye of course it did because if considering all the a access in formation that he has that we do not if he is drop thes little tidbits there is something that people me need to pay attention to you think that he is basemen on unreal information i hyouthing as possible that he is playing politics om ion i do not thinks he seems more of a straightforr cannagy i think that he is not the tive of person to plike politics ysome times they wish the people in these me lasther groups could hear how much they sound people coveret in countries tha ad come on done it is pen a lit of time in ech hion ew crane and fearly coing thirteen wit the progression actof this who ou ventually pountry resion into a war they wele going sociamedian to an into russion cop aganda and convince themselves at their countrymen were out to destroy them they tell me that bans of notes were coming from kee op to kill them i was struck by the way people had to convince themselvesthat the other side was absolutely out to get them wat's bent on their destruction in order to take that step into real violence et's not that i think that would happen ew crane will happen in america the talk of violence can become eself fulfilling prophecy the stakes for you are they are the stakes jest an election the trump loos is oke may we can win again and four years the no i really believe that anybody who gets in after a trump if there liberal imis goming the downfall of america for sure no this election is going to be some sort of tor aa turnn poit for good or

absolutely noug no chan s yet nottan wo everything that o no we thoi expered weading up to the election there is kno whey that trump would lose a far election it is nowhere your own experience

impeded im that a really have anything to do with what goes on with those bowd o e kno after the people o cat n joe tells me he sure that if bid win some kind of violence is inevitable he says to lan of finding some one va thas matter ante for he is not sure ah what it would have i some poin trump were t can seednt say he exapsifiin i mister prat is present now u could he change heur mind you absolly not mih can keglyo he read about his experience is comening civil wors havr sees in his book chatter the nations at to new york in germany four years ago the daafter don a trump one that election re porter stephony foo met two army officers at t o diner to talk to them about the new boss thes cisere in the same unit closs friends but they did not agree on politics at all why doy each other i do not now on do we likeny fellow we disagree on almost severython eu know why because i know that he'l have my back in to and i'll have this regardless of what he believes all those ill found an most of it et is also i give my life one i said my ol line if if if te not a does wore e we ba the time they went back and forth about what they thought the next four years waregoing to be the president trump is commander in chief whether it ment they were more likely to be t a poy to a configz own how it would affect moral and the possibility donal trump made start a newcleor war tho wbe find ye not he an tropin new some people nono i think he is incredibly uneducated about ut he is a thing about the cos if heople no realize people it is not he as a piece of paper in his pockanis al heris ne g cos is not work that way wat the guid president trump said the officer with the newquarfootball woeld prevent donald trump from random we newking somebody the helry quettan supporter was not shore anry stepny checked im with t two of them again or wear this week one ofis in the states one of them stationed in germany the biggest thing that happened to these gays in the last four years actually had nothing to do with crump they both had babies isactually better i can ye ges for you sim late ah some be decided to take off their typer and shoe on it we were dealing with that and now i were terrible parents thes crying hsterically because how tere we not let him eat his own feacies ga you reminds euse muc ar e thou or you doters not throug far behind at a tom these not their il names but chet and tom voted exactly how i expected them to in the election tom voted for bidon chet again voted for trump but in twenty sixteen chet had been really hard cor trum supporter he really wanted an outsider but now that the outsider is an insider he feels more ignostic and maybe a little part of his indifference is because of trum smor as their boss but the time trump made the comment saying why are we having all these people from shithole countris coming here chat was not crazy about that neither was tom the bind supporter who has defloyed in africa went that went down i's comments about shit whole countries tetainly impacted my jon we us a noliter as training exercises across the world with partners i haven a be in a possition at tha time weres running i group ateams aid were in avcan countries anin as you sitt in there planin for these trainin avents these comments come out in just ou know your portners accountalike as this whith you ges think about us is sait sat whate did you have to tell them i basea we talk thregly that does not represent you as nmilitaries position on our partner ships and onestly sometimes it comes down to sta both shitting an having friendly relations with pose ow that is similar experiences to i'm a trumps of porta righte macg at twenty twenty but yes it it does make your jop more difficult i'm ack ing ta defend the fact that when he sayis something it is o ket it is time to brace they were not totally unhappy with his performance both chet and tom agreed that trump strong man personality did come in handy some times they that he engage with north carea and supported the assassination of veroni an general costums only money but the thing thats affected them the most during the last four years is the same thing we have all dout with the thing that is not get a magically go away no matter who ins i feel the thing that is very clear to me is that it really feels there a two americas right now you does it feel that way in the military yes i a that is chet i have collegues on both sides and it is awkward lie yer you used to talk about it more and now people do not want to talk about politics it all ye ene ight when i went to i rack and two thousand aid it was people be i'm voting for a bom or people ccominable for mac kane but there was there was not any charged raceism attached to it you were not a races if you voted for mac kane you could talk about i and nobody would get offended and now wit is dislike apparently i'm a supremises because i vote for trump according to some people and i mean i'm just very much whatever man i'm voting for cormon wil for you can do the same i do not want to talk about it one of the moments that bugs chet the most is from his last to playmen one of his friends was a black woman who absolutely hated trump and she hated all of the wite trump supporting soldiers around her to she did hang out a chat he things thit is because he is age in american and it just pult me n an awkward position all th time an i woutd always could aske by both sides why you hanging out with them and i be really mam are almost aintin the carse tom agreevs he says that in the military the mind sat should be that tere is an enemy and it is out there printing an encavin af gan astand somewhere not in the next style at the stopan chop wen i was waching a stop on the days with that the black matter protest an national guard troreting caltin i kept thing i that is the worst fikan jap i would never ever want to do that right the these are people from youre community and you are getting calld in to do something no one in the military once to do this know un less again when it comes to e merchants situation that than everybody's olf for boin ering to do that in the case it say hurricane but nobody wants to go wen it trying to be a policemen that is not our jhap now o know i follow some military inster grams in one of them is i killed people enoug ganistay an now kill these people to day and i then hes before bullis shet idiot's tos those people probably fail their psychic sam a lot of international relationships hade been tested by the trun presidentin but not ten toms you is er sell friends yet i meat but we totally s that is because we have talk to friendship where we just one of each other all tan this is just one wore tanonly we we worliamdo ye we hated each other long before trum even teside a run fo presc sloing we ju seeno built on top of that hethrd non we have the he mountain over the friendship bridge sit is really beautiful thin sh o aon tom says that the military creates and environment were people have to trust and communicate with each other even if he do not each other which does not an attitude america seems to have these days about our democracy i talk to them wednesday the day after the election tom said he be pretty horrified if trump one catestrabed if bydon winds he said basically whatever both said they respect either ot come an tstaphany tho sheuse to be a producer on our programm s now writing a memoir about healing from complex p t st coming out somebod who thought as life as on a change alot to pending on who becomes president thoug now is not clear hat's in a minute mchicago bu bagradio wen our programm continues it is is americ com li from our glass to day's programm squeaker i donenouf i should admit here how many minutes to day we spent arguing over weather to call the episode electile disfunction squeaker was our classy choice anyway i show this week his storys from all over about this strange week wevolve tust live through waiting for election results of course for some people the out come of the presidential election might have a very direct effect in the o ti forinstance to people living in the ten camp that just over the border from texas in motomoris mexico he camp feld with people seeking asylum in theunited states we'v been sent there under the presidents remain in mexico policy on election it the hout of vigil all night long until five in the morning a parently the passers o put this together tried to keep at eight political stick with prayers and songs but by the end of the vigil in the early morning hours the las pastor who took the stage said the thing that apparently lots of them en been thinging all night he said i hope joe bidon wens and somebody was heres that it was everybody final we had a chance to let out their feelings they cheered they danced the have heard jobidan promise to reform emigration n his first hundred days and office which brings us to act three at three louisiana man calhoun has this story if somebody elseas not from this country is ween following the election as closely as he can jonathan who was in an ice detention center in louisiana told me that this years presidential race actually solved the problem in the detention centers he is been in he is been moved roum to a few jonathan told me the recurring problem was with the t ves take the ice detention center i called him in it was this small triangular room he said te to morrow oat to morrw i am o o a thot the o ta we won wa e be gee tha o wa ye t the problem with the detention senter t of is te n eterted the same with any tvang america people cant agree loo to watch twe watch english t v two u spanish t v ho do b a what you e be be that wo wou e o bet be tha o wo e bev be that o o o on o ot o it o wat ta o e tat woit jonathan told me during the eighteen months he is been an iced attention one of the few times this wasn'n an issue at all was the presidential debates this fo every one jonathan said one to see those i called jonathan the week before the election because i wanted to talk to someone in our emigration system whose case could potentially be effected by it i wondered how the election looked from where they were jonathan said he talk to other detainings about the election he been talking to gards to most of them m he told me were bidin supporters but yet lots of people were wondering how the election might change their cases including him jonathan's thirty it is from cameroon and he came to the u san twenty nineteen seeking asylum he is been stuck in to tention ever sents at o a ta wat o the ot e atin botment o be o be o a o wao e at a mo oi o you e hi bi do w we i what o wulbe e a be i under presiden trump asylum seekers jonathan are getting toported even ones with strong evidence that their political refugees will be tortured or killed if the return to their home countries jonathan i should tell you that is not his real name a'm calling him that because he has family back in cameroon and he has good reason to worry about their safety jonathan is part of an english speaking minority that is been persecuted by cameron's french speaking majority and it is long time autocratish president paul be at that whole situations gottin more and more violent jonathan was not part of that he was a business man a grocery whole sailor bought stof from farmers to sell in town he started the business to sport his mob if thers dad at basically jonathan got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time he was in this barber shop when i got rated by soldiers he and fourteen others got thrown in jail and they were beaten and tortured for nearly a monthat one point a few men were taken out and they nevere came back nd t soldier told the rest of them they were all con ad killed then one day a warning was his pretty graphic one day an officer took jonathan and one other man at gunpoint and he led them outside to a trunk he told them to clean it up jonathan looke d inside it you o t o o i o o wetat yo be you mot be tat you mt be a a ajonathan says it was blood all over the inside particles of flesh he started to clean and then at some point he noticed that the soldier was distract and talk into some one at a wi o u yu wat toity i tat a wl a a you wat at a mao wa a he on e you jonathan says he slipped around the corner of the building and then he ran through a corn field he just kept running eventually he got to a cousin's house and then eventually escape to equidor i just wone to say jonathan's account of all these details it is all well supported but documents and photos and legal affidavids among the documents there is a warrant for jonathan's arrest for quote terrorism secession and insurrection jonathan told me if the government gets hits hands on him chanceis will be killed our hundred per cent that is what he said a hundred per ent jonathan's atturney told me under a different presidential administration than president trumps to thinks his asylum case would have a much better shot after escaping jonathan went through nine countries at some point some one gave jonathan a piece of advice that would end ip being really important its had rip your passport out it will make it harder for any one to send you back to cameroon jonathan did that in the end he made it to u s he made into ice costody i asked jonathan why he did not seek asylum in any of the other nine countries and he told me it was simple he did not know enough about any of those other countries to know if they would protect him or if they would send him back o i now o wa op o at e ti i know not i o a a tat yout you moa at wa bi not opor ta you or oa ot ot ymorrig what a a o i a e i w o ime o i i o oi i wu oa ui o o taa how i i wu o iion e judge ordered jonathan to be deported the only reason he and his lawyer thought he had not been is because jonathan had taken that advice and destroyed his passport back in panimal for months ice officers had been asking jonathan to sign this document that would apparently let tham send him back to ammer room jonathan has been refusing telling them that he will be tortured and killed ice in response told jonathan they would hold him in indefinite detention until he signed and ice for their part thac started leaning on jonathan harder and harder you half to signed this recently he told me that situation came to a head when an ice agent he knew let him into a room he tat i u eee depine pople me yeu jelp wen we ind e o poin eo a me en we boma oyo jonathan got on his knees and ba said he would be killed the officer was in hearing it t he said he needed a picture of jonath insid to e repeated dold me jo e or e definde e i wol be take o wuew i o a o a oo i i a a o a o me o wu ii a i a a o i e o me hehe grabbed your hand not a a o o to a a puo all of this only stopped jonathan says when a female officer opened the door and asked what was going on she called the other officers over to her and they talked where jonathan could not rearly hear them then he was alowed to go call his lawyer after jonathan and i talk we agreed that he would call me the day after the election at five p m i wanted to hear his reaction to whatever results ir non results would have by them but that never happened because the morning after the election when every one was waking oup to a map with eight state still suspended in gray i got a voice male from jonathan's lawyer o will not i you tin n o im fom where i do not know were im a morewhere am i o a o e i or or r

about politics they were how it is a topic she se e vaner seevin ali we actually invited they say which can be tricky becaus markao voted for bited and in nochca for trump the part of that venis well in voting block in florida the press has been freaking out about wondering why o why would let the knows as if we were one thae vote for trump the family moved to my amme twenty years ago they all

trump because byden did not come out hard against maluda an venis well as socialist government ne nochca also says bit hin florided her words with cuba too much and that was all a deal breaker for her too close to communism she cannot even saven is well less former precedent's name who go chabis she called him i said he known but outim which is and i'm not even exaggerating he who must not be named waldemore ne nochcar really wants you to know though that she did not vote for trump she voted for the republic in party she does not him at least not a lot she thinks he is really read about immigrants which she thinks this hypocritical given that his wife is an immigrant she thinks he is arrogant she also told me she hated the way he treats for porters though i'm aware she said this too a reporter i asked marko how it made him feel that his mam voted for trump he squarmed he moved his hands a lot ivoided contact o be go o ho wu yoa angry w e e man an it' some mess he says it is a mental an emotional mess i feels strange i do not want to say be trade we to war she gossi wa he oe be e e ein e he is dam i know other friends another parents who also can here because of politics also from venisella and they went for biden and it makes me think what did these other parents find out that made them make a different decision one that is more mine she said his mam's vote made him

it she tells me how was he gon taget i if he has 'nd lived at either she points at markot but those of us who have lived id always feel it here she says and she points at her heart and here and she points at her had i asked her she thought the people who ware scared about trump who think he may be the start of her regime itself fashason if she thought they were wrong she said no she said she could see it but that still seemed far away and unrea compared to the socialists she did with her one was the possibility the other was already a reality and then just as we were wrapping up the interview she said we got her just wait calmly for results and honestly for the good of the country maybe bidin should win trump makes people angry this surprised me she had been clear about not wanting bit but when she unpacked es a little more i understay she does not want onrast that she knows very wow she knows how that stor ands notty raymon it is when be tatstakes massachusetts s whatever produces shohn call some talking head tipes on see an anvysently discussing the stakes of this years presidentiallection and ow both democrats and republican see it as existential that is where they used existential a the very existence of ar democracy r even our planet hangs in the bolance which in a the concime kind of abstract and he is pass two weeks as we approach dilection day shohn in somebody very custrum have been dealing the very immediate and a real world existential questions he shot about two weeks before the election my stepfather ed was admitted to cape cot hospital he was rushed there in an ambulance with extreme shortness of breath he was suffocating turned out to be lung cancer a tumor almost the size of a golf ball that caused all this fluid to build up in his left along plus a precarious blood clot on the same long i raced up there from new york before heven knowing the diagnosis it is ninety and had already been battling stage four prostate cancer for a couple of years there is been this ambiant sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop when i got to the hospital two nurses were settling him into the room where he would spend the next four days one of them asked him a whole battery of standard in take questions history of smoking yes syou drink kafin yes and then she said do you feel threatened by any one at home or just in your life ad paused look down and said the president i thought that was really funny and also telling even in this dire moment for him trump in the election still kept bobbing back up to the surfas ad's a demograt follows the newspretty closely bact when he was merely contending with stage for prostate cancer he told me several times that he just wanted to live long enough to see what happens with the election a that zero existential dread beyond that and at some point during his hospital stay i realized this was almost certainly going to be exs last presidential election and i wondered if he might be experiencing at differently than the rest of us for a couple of my daily hospital visits i brought my recorder along el i gatherl be glad ter uld be the last election i yo kety why such tat sensical things wan people ake astls excuse usprersion i mad beta republic in his turnden to sobgut a religion bouad bein a dema crat to and once again i havs the best pesision in the house i trump weds i do not care lie ta and i bid wens ika trupsgon o you think yofll make it till the election welll be mighty pis at these doctors wom i do not at that point again this was more than a week before election day the doctor still had not given him a prognesis about how long he might live they did tell him that the blood clod could detachet any time and go to his brain or his heart and kill him he was equally sanguine and philosophical about that as he spent about the cancer told me the clod will either kill him or at wont and if it does not why should he worry and if it does he will not be able to worry he placid about his mortality that it does not leave a lot of room for me morosely ringing my hands about it when i'm with him but now there is this kind of gradient from what he is probably still going to be alive for to what he might be to what he probably will not be and he does not get to choose of course but i thought i'd askd him anyway how long do you want to be around for what of the things that you want to see still well it is see bide will take over trump sti will be a tha presiden that to the electiur but still be pres of it three monts three months you want o keep gon iways i mi two bore about gat a commi sosid and yofll i mi coun to say a to be rot three muts that is for mut go by people say why you still alive tat does'make avy sense a to me is logabout it a ou pay i do not min a little it can bes to say alie there might be a could show at once at awhil the migh be a good book to read ibe i'm nather wha that wats to live just for the sake i living i think it is excellent time and the next two or three years to die wy youre o for e all sorts a huge problems we have gobal warmin gomin that big time the country is sogon to be divided evenin a bitin wins e's got a hell of hell of it i put it back together but i think he mighe but still europe is going totelitarian this country is going mor totelitarian which is carry is tot much to look forward to things i would to see our answers to big questions is there in tellege in life in this universe i's not oters and tat i would he went on to talk about this thing he read about possible evidence of life on venus i's usual he got excited talking about this stuff a kattle i think it is is curiosity that is kept him around thi long the same curiosity not partisan ship or spite or goolish vengeful ness but curiosity that is had him wanting to see how the election place out which i think it such a pure perspective to watch this whole yucky circus from especially as he would be totally forgivend for just changing the channel to i cant i ad how are you doing a a mi len fared a meddling e in this call was early friday morning a three days after election day ad was back home from the hospital in a three new prescriptions including a heavy duty blood thinner for the clokwhich is actually ben working and while almost everyone else i knew was biding their nails waiting for the electoral scoreboard to change hed was not in fact on election night itself he did change the channel then evon watchd the returns commen yi a mak mly which is er sgrit if you can al way tell the out co be a ye

country tate that bin wen i told that there is this thing ive been trying to square how he can be at peace with his own mortality and yet concerned for the fate of the country and really the world he is leaving behind thius seemd opposetes i said he said he did not see the conflict of course he is concern yes he is not going to be around a lot longer but we will then he still cares about that john

what are essentially common gardening tools raks hos foxes this pat can be up to thirty feet wide the cold is to give the fire no place to go sometimes they widerily fiht fire with fire tworching trees and brash before the wild fire can get there theyve one of those jobs thats both monotonous and superdangerous all the while they have to be on the look out for falling trees called snags herre

car recks on dart roads little tea was once at a fire where a plain accidentally dumped thousands of gallans of flameer tared an on a fire fihte from another crew killing in and then earlier of the season a squad bos pet died while fighting the elderato fire in sothern california the flames burned over him afterward another member of the crew who 'd been upset about is theath went nessing soo aside and petios t e have risen among wild and fire fiders it tells done luck that pet has not seen a dat on his own crail he is in charge of a bunch of guyes in their twenties a lot of them are pretty neaw to this job he can stop worrying even when the're off the fire and get to go home he says they have gonen injured and even duied in car occidents tired and in a rush to get home after a fire i've heard a lot of fire fires talk about this is a problem he says his wife jen sometimes busts him for not being able to leave the guys backet work some to say i i i get this blank ster and they were sittig in the couch i i wach to be be gentles watchin to yo and she look at me yand rite away her question always sis are yousen about work i teing about the guyes i what do you think ing

pretensiony cosses our lives with the family you walk away and you come back at the later or whatever be with os he you cannot i'm away that it might be unfair i'm a hundred precent awore that mong fires seasons are now consistent that there is a whole army of private contractors that chases these fires across california too it is amoten million dollar industry there drobs are to make life a little easier for the people out on the fire line at the creet fire most of these contractors are set up in the main parking lot of the keeper's work which is the acquivalent of downtown here there is hot showers the sleep trailers they are highlys ot after and an in dustrial kitchen that packs up these brown paper bag plunches calle the five thousand calory meal the mobl londrmat is in a white

oneof the ones that was just shown to be effective david was the scientist in his erly career they worked at firmy lab and from the coverage he could not understand what exactly they had done in any detail any one to know that and who these people were and especially how does it field who have help make a thing that could save many lives fix a goble economy get life back to normal again for everybody here is david i gong to tell you the story of some of the people who made this one tiny thing it is a key thing that is an at least five of the vaxines that are being tested if you get the vaxine shot in the coming months this thing will probably be injected into your body and it could save your life and the story of all this you could start it all sorts of places i gon to begin here in china i'm from ther i small manage a rons the east coast it is chalom comens ibosman haris a famas this is yanchan wan his way into science was playing outside noticing bugs and locusts scorpions just got him curious about stuff yet why we co thing why i a rennety eat fod yes iti amcorias ba asols it is finding for me it was when i was in tenth grate i thing i learned about newton's aquasion for gravity and i learn that that explained to both the orbits of the planets and also what ever haven you dropped a ball and i was i ma that is amazing there is anoquasion that describes both of those perfectly it was the rules behind the thing as the same thing ye what i ready beautiful ta ye hen i first emale antuan he was superexcited to talk said no one had really interviewed about al that he had done yntron got himself a scholarship to one of the top universities and the thng he found himself gravitedin for it is this field called structural biology huch i think favors of particular kind of person you are basically trying to figure out what molecules look weare all the atams are you can tell how something works or if it is a virus how to fight it and the thing is people work for years trying to figure out the structure of one tiny molecule the traditional way of doing it is that he get a munch of those molecules and try to get them to lay out in a neat repeating pattern then he hid him with these powerful ex rays which give you just this pattern of dots then yoe have to apply these mathematical algritms and sometimes it is just not solvable it really is pushing a bolder to the top of thae hill thet rolls down over and over yancuan was gooded it though first thesis he worked out the structure of part of a corona virus not this crona virus this was years ago it was a coronavirus that was making the news back them the murs corona virus the cause it caused middleast respiratory sidrom after that he needed a job i reached out to agot who was also looking into mers jason mc clellan at dartmouth how would your friends describe you ah i no idea fon could they hang out with s likes having a ber to is con to save the world i'll think that was not any one's rater ancuan came over to the states to work with jason in his teem this was two thousand fourteen six years before the pendemic they wanted to make a vaxine for murs and one of the things they were trying to figure out back them they would not have been key for the vaxcene we have to day was how to manufacture copies of the tiny spikes they were all over the surface of the murs coron virus the spikes are why they are alled crona viruss the viruses have a corona awreeth of these little spikes sticking out all over it the spike is the part that sticks to your cells when it gets on your body whet's the virus break into your cells and start replicating it is this carry part of the thing in away if they could make just the spikes without a deadly virus attached to them maybe they could train your imune system to recognize the virus and fight it but tit turned out to be damn hard to make the spikes in the lab besicall you stick the genetic code for the spike into some cells one of the cells a les two either cho cells chinese hampster overy cells or a c c cwunine three cells which are what a hu human embryon at kitysells i do not know why i wanted to know all this except that this is the kind of knowledge that is can t save our asses the problem was when they got the genetic code for the spikes into thos cells they did starts pitting out spikes but the cells were not making a lot of them and the spikes on their own were unstable they kept changing into the wrong shape ancoang spent a long time trying to stableize them ad something tweak the genetic code try again again there is a tedium to it each try takes a while ar i ta tre wix twotherees you woud start it march first by the third week in march you would be done with that tast and most the time it fails yes and then you start again and then you do not know for another three weeks if that new thing works yes yes but the be had to lak e that is tha same time as youv a mol tree o you do twenty of them at the same time oh yes wit did dala atry and every time you tried this in your mind are you oh this time it is gon to work yes iry opi as a tans it it is goin to work if we wal work i wa copliest coject te ah you'ry i got tis apoe a it is funny that yourself to mistic because most the time it fails right it just keep failing and failing yes tha that is cala thalive as a begee this kind of labwork it is cind of cooking but for the fussiest restaurant ever lots a little precise steps yeu makes the stuff up in a flask set it on this little platform which gently squirrels the stuff in it keep the whole thing at thirty seven degrees selsies leave it over night se your constantly having to be at the lab at a certain time to do the next step his wife told them heu ways say t'll be five minutes but it is hours they tried many different things scouring the scientific literature for different ideas modifying them the thing that finally work was changing the genetic cod for the spike would swap in two prolinomino ascids they helpd told the spike in it spike for kept it from changing shame also the sells were spitting out waywore spikes fifty times wore ow the day ot work is real excited cause we a the ontrak we would been doing all this work it is it is a lot of trial at air you racically just failing and tell at works and filly you got wat lik while that tahallix fantastic we knew we had something thet when the have accinated mice gave them a shot containing these murs corona vire spikes the mice is little amune systems developed dantibodies lots of them it looked really promising you might be able to make a really good vaxine against the murrors corona virus this was basically the road map for the vaxine we were all gin to need when the pandemict started but the major scientific journals we are not interested in publishing it the tra toto tra sixty fothe galas and the was rejecta fatans wow that is kind of amazing looking back now ye if we look ba yes yes ow ow i i was gett i ta o te rejecte forie fari jection yes he told me he fell into a real depression no one seemd to see the value of their work he saw a tharapist who pointed out all he had accomplished and suggested that he might feel proud instead of sad it did not really help this was two thousand seventeen the pandamic was three years away the fact that the had trouble getting it published to me it does not mean the scientific journal editors are idiots bact then most people thought the next pandemic was can be some new form of influence of not a crona virus hich of course is the argument for funding lots of basic research sometimes yeu do not know what thing is going to be important when the current pandemic began jason mc lellan had moved his lab from dartmouth to the university of taxas at ostin te antrong had gone with him jason told me one day in january january sixth he was in you toss snoboarding and he got a call from the deputy director of the vaxine research center at the national institutes of health barney graham graham had been working with him on all the murs corna virus stuff he was calling about som neumonia illness in wuhon china the local health authority was reporting forty one cases elebe now you was talking of the you ae d s and thet they wanted to quickly make a vaxin canadats nd look it was a bat o cer on a irus and if he wanted to know ar ar are we game are webing a cwewe help out try to rapidly determine the structure of the spike and get the vaxe made and a you said you said im busy em snowboarding they hav vis i at yaws ax us getting some boots heat moulded si had ten minutes to talk to him a while theyre heap moulding to my fee but i immediately what is apped myke rad student daniel rap and told hem a ou wereging to rase to got to move quickly on this tats get prepared it is worth pointing out they were running full steam at this in january this is before won went to lock down for that giant hospital got bill the whole thing was varely in the news and life here was totally normal they are all going to the office to work frantically on this thing wall around them people are going to restaurants and church kids are in school the thing they were going to try to help make is called an m arana vaxine instead of giving people shots filled with coronavirus pikes you nject people with the genetic code from making the spikes te code is wrapped in this little package and once it gets in jected in your body it goes into yourselves and then yourselves start making te spikes loads of them which on their own ar harmless but your mun system sees these farign things and learns to fightin which should hopefully protect you if the real viris cons this is the genius of vaxines we are not that good it making drugs against fruses bwe know it is really good fighting them arm yuinsistem if you just show it the right piece of the virus it often figures out how to fight it off it is the answer we all have it inside us th ta t te tay ta then they an and the big thing tey had to work out for the vaxine was what part with the genetic sequence for the cronavirus were they gon to stick in the vaxi to make the spikes and how ware they gong to alter that coat that when the spike was created it would be stable and not twis st around five days after jason got that phone call chinese re searchers posted the genetic code for the new corona virus on line teams around the world could look at it jason and the others started going through it right away how long did it takes you get the sequence and how long until youre this is the thing we want in the vaxine oh an our maybe really there is probably with thitetmen she mey says you to the sequents limat you just put tem in k that is because the spike on this crona virus that would cause the pandemic it was very very similar to the one on the murs caron of virus the one they had been studying it is often noted that these vaxines came together rearly quickly but it seems the reason they came to gether really quicklies because all this work that went on for years beyat that is right and ya it definily us just it is aligat just happened in thirty days thek get happy and ma no ni grapic gon lie in showing that if sars cuvet at two had t emerged even ten years ago we would be nowhere this far along to to having a vaxine they sent the genetic sequence off to a company that they woulde been communicating with for a while caled ma durna madurna a much of other scientists another companies have been working for years and how to even make in an arana vaxi which is a whole other story anyway a few weeks later they had one ready for testing ma it is lay the bar bacti but thit gentually be tected a or what wul the a barginin geti this is kis meekya corbit viral an menologist at the annaage whof ben working with jason and yanschuang and everyone else she was there when the package arrive from madurna it just anote about kismikya she told me that she was one of these kids who went all the science fairs could not leave a math problem on solv and also when the nobell prizes were announced she would write the speeches she would imagine they would deliver and read them out loud pretending to deliver them in a very dramatic way wit tears as if they were the oskars r something anyway she was the one who went to get the box of the first faxines when they arrived it came and i wake for the was the first time iny the peope ma garna were i had t show by ide and i wolmember bloading dot people could ne e brak the box up to me i had to lake meet that yuiber down teairs i do not een baby came on a plan itually think tha they hadnt y ridin from bosstin but tas ta when you got that box what did you think i i remember asking the guide the loding doke to take a pikture a hig a er can you thing about we get i re te me te me et tis fa en he la o ike a git ty that caus he was too busy i even as a m ja im just this narty find is the bout to back to ate some wedow two hundred two hundred fifty mites with the bak ten it ane hede an needont was really understood the grabby this was in february his meeky remembers at some point going to see her family sitting down on her mamm's bed and cun of breefing everyone i think things might really changed i thnk the vyrus is about to be a big problem i talght to all the researchers about what it was in this period making and testing of vaxine they hoped to work but not knowing meanwhile more and more of the world was shutting down more people getting sink and dying cis meekyat told me she is to look at the daily numbers for the world and then had to stop it was not healthy barnie graham as his meekia's boss hes that deputy director of the vaxine research center at the annaage an me guy called jason while he was snowboarding he would worked with them on all thi stuff the most seniormember of the groop they waited on him though he did now his recognize it he says he is not always in touch oth his feelings we talked in the evening he was at home where had been for months sitting in front of a bookcase little bust of bentamin franklin on it he seemed tired making the maxine took many steps many decisions most of the time you just you on drind through the dayin trader mak this isisgin and and she everybody oin ere's al a sequenc in o things hav to happen in certain order or you get ok ju ceping things lovi tak fors won wut sin she most eo now may be my wife can say and then his wife who was in the room where we were talking the name cynthia jumped in well i she is a pcychiatress and at a couple of points of been chiming in in a very sweet way the sort of explaind her husband's calm exterior she said youre forgetting the storyin which she started to tell he came out of his office in he was clearly distracted an upset and of course that you wan a was soin o wer you have to askhim and you have to not le la the he inso he sellsou and i can s tis cro in he he said what if i selected the ro se quence swe had slecte e sras and missra but e question was on was it the rit one usually we spin we spen months or even years experimenting to the side this is best one o yus he was worrd about the time that would be wested in the nome that se iself how many people wuld di how many children will be that without tairs yo how many old people wit at i yet raa raany e was just thinking a that tha o se pasan ences it yes at is rot yo race it is it is just i said i i ten to be a little obsessin and yo know you just i get certain ideas ar thougt hatterns aut of your head till you find e at resolution clenical trials began on march sixteenth which is pretty incredible this is right around the time when businesses were just deciding it would be safer to work from hom shouts were eventually givento tens of thousands of people and then the weight began to see if it worked meanwhile the koronof iris kept spreading in the es or as the president called it the cong flew and the china viris hereis ne unshwon i fon cila yet a i do houson som sotefaty that is yes the present a should the not see that to toll my home country how pretty ilary pasat i things it it makes lo sans it was offensive but it also just struck him as don there was many things the president needed to be doing to tame the pendemic wy was he wasting his time with this and then may be remembere this there was a story in the news vacen but how the f b i was looking into whether chinese spies working through the consolate anhuston he tried to steal vaxine research the f b was con bequestioning people at the university of texas one story included yanchuan's name an someone who worked there from china friends told them to get a lawyer he says he and his wife looked into whether they could leave the country if they needed to in the end no one came to question him but it was unnerving the moment when all these researchers learned that their vaxine wask can a work was a few weeks ago when feiser announced tat its vaxing was more than ninety percent effective fiser had started its face three clinical trials on the same day as them but feser got its results first fwier had used i its vaxin the thing this team had come up with the korn of iris pake stablized the way they had figured out fiser had licensed it from them if the feiser vaxine worked they figured theires would to viny graham got a call before the results went public i been right here in my office for ten nots i was in my office and it was in the evening a light evening men eretly there bade in safety monitering wor it mat earlier in the day and they were gon on fut at prese release the next day on one day and i got off the fon on i went over an sheepishly to my wife and my son whowas visiting an thet o yno it it looks its can a work and and that just kind of on release a lot of emotion i think that i've been holding tat frorwas ten monts s i retreated back into my office and us can wet all let out for a few minutesand they all a ma consoled me but tha that momen to at copy by surprise that there as much in there to come out the whole family was in tears it is just a relief to now that you gan to that point and because in vacen aboutment there is a thousand choices to make a thousand decisions and a thousand wice fail and most of these kind of tabout me projects to tol turn out and and to get through all the way to get an answer tit sat it work and even work better than your expec at was what cartermol ye i was not expecting to be emotional at all i was sure was not expecting sinpe c

just talk for my dad bi morning about mixing a dish washer in my rental property talk of thet all time but i atti out ye its feels oh got it is its naturally walking tow it is really going to wa lotof people i think i'm proud awa and e it is great that little thing you made my ye fixe the global economy it could save millions of lives it could help you now everythink it back to normal that little thing yes that is what i hope ye what ae your parent say a parens aturally s it do not know o hows toi they just now oh you develop a mox in as gat us ther think an they do not know how much

encourage alos y's a pass yet i were always remenby those things e it can be hard i think when you are in deep with something complicated to explain that thing to some one on the outside particularly with science there is this version that often makes it out into the world of a single person having a clear dramatic break through dunasock apoleovaxine the novel prize is always given to one or a few

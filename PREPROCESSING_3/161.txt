russian movies form comedy for russian audiences even prudence seen hin perform caught om a good actor years ago en russians did start the war wonn just on the battle fiel when they ar space over yucranian cities it was within families this is not thing i had no idea about the way a conflict this might take normal disagreements between people and bow them up when you think about it of course right it was the rgter massia guess in o explain this jimmey massia was born in moscow moving in rd states as a teanagor with their family then wi back to russia as an adult to work is journalist they written several books now colonlly a staff writer at the new yorker and what massha per together to day is a very unusual story by the try to capture what this is by looking at one family and the fights tay get into re lated to the war we you are bact to heare i's one family and ait fights here is massia in normal times we keep the peace in families by letting things go by the commedating by for getting things were pretending not to notice things but when t e war starts even the quietest most conflict avoiding people start fighting just before the work agan on february twenty first twenty

i do not want him to go to berlyn and we actually we did not succeed too rach and persuading him and she did not push too hard because that was not her way i do not know i just hate fighting i just hay when it gets ugly whatever i even sense that this might be the sitiation i jus you nont go on no bee direction it would never actually get too far as to have a fight as someone and i think i'm used to this is 's been for years this we jussideo genat go there for two weeks we as a niter looka an nisest gofrenc and only on two weeks he agreed and everybody too weks ofcourse w but then i

back a long time to years eve twenty ten when catana niza met my friend there she introduced me to niga saying this i caran and he on thave a child and this is nida as she wants it to please is in lit me when everything is done and ayou gan a esizor kid and thi'll be he is a her godmother that was it they were a ka let us talk and we several times we talked about it e and we decided yes wat stood they were thirty one and tweny eight they were both queer they were both budis they had that in common than that they did not discuss any of the biggishes of how to rate child what school he would cud to what languages he would speakin how they would explain the world to him nate knew she wanted to raise him an eucranent she would move there from moscow years before this caran wanted to stay in moscow but hed visit there wen't exactly friends the wen't straight to bein coparence they figured that workin at e few ers later it was time to choose a school for luca nasa had to make a commitment to the next ten years or of her son's schooling and the language and which he was going to study at the time keve had schools with instruction an eucranian russian english german french as it was struggling to make a choice but caran had a definite opinion of course i i was hoping that he will study russian and he will read and rit in russian i mean all his family including he is ucranian part of the family eh speaks on the russian and he is thinking in russian he never reads an in ucranian what is the poyent to trid artificially implement the language that he does not hus and will not use when he crows up caran's cannof a funny one to be champany russian culture he grew up and outsid his heritages armenian tu greek and yes i russian he has dark curly hair a trimmed beard a white chiselled face and a long prominent nans hi's beautiful he also does not look russian at all s not easy to grow up on russia when yeu do not look ethmically rusian i know i grew up on russia looking un russian and i get teased chaste and beaten up a lot caran's name marks him as an aurmenian he had to fight for the right to be russianneither on other hand with her blon hair and blue gray eyes growing up in moscow she certainly never had to defend her right to be there she moved a ke as a kind of experiment and foundan she lufted there became her home carano lot of nethers friends though kept assuming she was an eucrane temporarily on this particular night caran was a little drunk and that is when we started for this fight he was we started over schools and then it went to that eucranian culture is not culture and the language is not language and all that and he went on in on and at first i was shocked and he was his sudu many things and then i was wat what what do i sufpece to do because i cannot fight with mi do not because i have to keep good felationship because he is lucas father i was a cate please do not say these things because we eucranians he was now eucranians you russians you from moscow and he is russian anothe ca yet of course i was byistan i am still by us an but by as tile bys se toward russian heritage this is important part of my didnto he and i was convinced that that a this is an important part of his identity also in fact an had always hoped that neither would move back to moscow neither had zero intention of doing that is thing is i always hated the idea that he has to go to moscow even ol ver they a vacation i never liked the influencei was on him not that she said the stocaren why startifi because all the time luca was going to russia for one months a year his father was insistently feeding him that he wil russian you not eucranian e got nothing to do with youcrane there is no such thing as eucranian cultir the eucranian languageis no good and there is this cramandes russian cultu oushuld heding towards that and then luca would be coming back in saying young i do not to a tant some eucranian hollidays o where we chivan can owe why would yo do that of a chavanka is a traditional eucranian embroidered shirt kran told me hed in havingthing against eucranian tradition in particular we all know that a traditional costumes ar jus liderly that taste for everybody inno matter if this is vichavanka or traditional russian costume we look down to that in general becaus sily because it has something to do with the nationales we all hated always at least we thought we hated there is ha big difference between russian and eucrania national coscumes the vachavanka long before the war was a symbol of the renaiscence of eucranian culture and identity after the fall of the sovi union yeucrane was a former colony of russia karan most russians was oblivious to this this is another bot a russia recrages this is abot senseess style kind of to neithe it was about karan's attitudes toward all things youcranian he thought kive was a backwater i hate to mention it but i he was visiting museums or theatres or concerts only when i was a coming to kes and i took him to same to a three museums and not to mention theatres there are almost none in kes how much a theatr an than the museums did you get when you werecid unfortunately not a to much not to mani because i was born and rased in a siberia in usk and this is not the culture centre every parent wants to give their children what they did not have growing up neithe unlike karem grew up in the centere of moscow in the very heart of the empire in a privileged family karan could not believe she was willing to give up what he had longed for as a kid neither for her part one e to aboid conflict in the end luca did not go to e ucranian school or russian school he enrolled in a german school gv when the worst started all those things that luca had heard his father say that he and his mother really russian these ideas hid to luca hard his father's country was bamming his motherland luka was crying and saying its my fault im russia i called his father and a said look what have you done luca now wi things that is his fault because he is russian he felt that he is half this and half that and now there is huge in their conflict inside of him becaus to him to hes kid's mind there was one half of him hes attacking the other half of himself talking to luca did not help much maybe he could be convinced that the wor was not his fault but he was still stuck with this problem of being both eucramian and russian the war was tearing him apart it maybe did not help that he and his mams were still in the move they finally landed in lisbon i was thinking may be suggesting maybe you think you an be portuguesa sance we leaving portuga and he was ike none now i'm german i'm definitey german wine and then the psycalloges explain to me that it this age they just pik the savest invironmen luca had cone to german scolintu he was going to start a tending a german sco and lisbon choosing germany was away to avoid choosing ou crane were choosing russian a way to avoid choosing between his parents i think germany felt neutral fiht's number three in number for cremea and the globe if heas back i don' surprise nither for his part of summer vacation his suggested taking luca to cramea crmea had been under russian occupation for several years once upon a time it had been a vacation destination for both russians and eucramians but after the occupation cremea was off limits re cramians and a i was in a now we we do not go ty cremea and a they were ose now come on a because er the whole family or his father he ise to spend somewhere in crameas they wll continued doing that and they were calling us and thin can luca come they oubki the kids cannot spend time together was y i do not mind but we do not go to cramea we youcramias because hit is no our land and as the whole thing about it imagine you live in a house and one day someone comes in with a gun and just takes over the second floor and i was not a bench of empty rooms your cousin was living there now your cousin asn't allowed to talk to you and suddenly your frind goes hey tat's go visit the guy whos living on the second floor of your house i've always liked the view from there i never shared this point of view that ayou can not a visit and next territories well i guess for oucramians it is completely different for them if you go there it means atyou support of the idea cremes for russi or there was le gobe he really could not see what the vigdeal was thet go there support the local economy after all the people of cremea were not to blame for being occupied there is no way i can explain what i feel the only way i could say i kay does not matter wat i feel probably you right but at non the first of septantamber the ki would have to go toou cramian school and when when they ask him how he spend the somewhen if he says he goes i cremee heis geting bein big trable that worke the creme invacation was a verdict but then came the globe when russia occupied crimea it printed up new maps and made new globes that labelled crimea as part of russian and as nase recalls catan and his boyfron were coming for a visit and bringin a globe as a present for luca and on the plain they realized that this is a russian globe it showed crimea as a part of rssia this would be a problem when they gland and crane and have to go through customs and they got they got really scared that the somebody would decide to check it and they will be in a big trouble they would be stoppd to know allowed to en ter the crane because they brought the globe with the crania be marked as part of russia they would really scan it but it is but they could not throw it away because it was a big thing to get red of it is really or vis and the toil it its it is not mere even many places we coul leave it they kind of had thi poker face and they crossd the customs and nobody even checked they left theyr port i took atasito nizes house they gave the globe to luce and they told the story of how they had this realization on the plan and were stuck ot the globe and thet we was a biggest joke they would keep telling it everyone as oha how finey imagine hous topid and i was an wo this thing in my house the glov was lucas thos nati ha elt stuck with it i i do not want a fand father's feelings it is really nice that i's it in its you present and i know if i throw awy we be huge candle awas kind of sayng i'm really really sorry and i told toly understand but agan it might be some other people visiting a the crane an people visiting wy house and get a fan that i'm reali sory but i'm getting fet lo this ow it always been this i couldnt really say what a focking stupid idea why theyall brought this glob you kno to my house give it to o son was e i always have to bee the long way after other people my get the fanle o people remember eindancs the fe ie in carinversion of the story there wis no globe on the airplane no fretting about customs but there was a globe until there was not it is not there when i visited him next time in kave and i was and there is your globe and she was well there is a tiny mistaken that is globe mama i hided it from me and i realized what an af mistaken but i never i cannot recall that there was any fight about it did she tell you that we at fito abot the globe nnshe said that some she said that she fell compelled to tell you that she had to get at out of the house because you cranian friends would see it i know nobody sa it there was no problem and te did look i actually say tiny mistake yes there was it was sobe i tuch yo nowsos sweet of him eshe was shins well there was a tiny mistaken te te gloy i never told him what i what ha i did not makea drama an anydin as hat abot y wethin it was clear th thit is problem fite number five wouche when the first coll invasion began it began with then imaginable almost immediately russian tanks were right outside of kave russian troops occupied the western suburbs eucranians fighting to

always answer that am russian to anybody else into myself and also why had his spend much time in effort insisting that nate and luca wer russian since now it is aburden for him i'm oh no forget it just leave it theyoudon nee yn more and tat's pretend ther that you are noerussian at all if it maks youre life easier theteeany to be would you prefer not to a russian tit no sory i would not prefer that i cannot even imagine it because this is my country and this is a my culture this is my problem also this i my drama because i do not want to a hide why identityi do not want try to escape from the responsibility i to have as a russian persian and this wor let me some the suppe little that you were never accepted as russian by russians you live in exile the russian government has declared for an agent yes and you consider yourself frushien ah das it sound yer sort of scarce o frinim gadan is a journalist and olbitcikiactist two things the russian government hates most that is why he is been designated or for an ancient neithen coad an both felt better after that nees fight thet cleard there neis a felt heard adan felt it understood something for one thing he understood by neither said that she in louka were you cranhim and how iworten that was their relationship approves and also the new nisa had emerged one who told people but she really thought except when she did not nomber eight the fight that was not neither comes from a long line of diplomats her grandparents were diplomats and her mother realy hope neither would be diplomat too which brings me to night u step father the man who was present for most of neither childhood ni did dored him she calls him dad she never called alecs that long after he ad nies his mother divorce they stated in touch as neither became an adult they spoke less often but every time he called it was they would seein each other just yesterday and he was also a diplomat in fact hes still is a diplomat a russian diplomat whois still working in a high post and after the worst started and they fled to lisbon and she got alec out of you crane neither was starting to dread her dad's funco the call she would always looked forward to him her birth is at the end of ma and he always called this time she would have to assume that their conversation was monitered she told him what had been happening for her since the war began even ogfalt he did was listen that could get him in trouble but what if he did not just listn what if he said the sort of thing a man in his possession as expected to say defending the invasion justifying it she was scared he say something unforgivable she was scared she would say something that would get him in trouble she was also maybe scared should say nothing and regret it he is quite old he will be retired he he is got a few yeas left and he ashieved what he was always wanted since he was a child and i mean it is everything he is got his realy i know he is important for him and is he is job and he' con't do anything else he has theuption of retiring now i do not no i i freely i do not doubt that he is a fantastic fassinan down what ever happens to him i just hope he is can be right i just really do not whont i hurt him and i feel really sorry for him and i think he 's in a really complicated position and i think he he is really sorry and he is suffering in way he did not call ehi thought this would be a storry about how war makes everything black an wit te does i've seen it and everyone you heard from in the seppisote has seen it long suppressed disagreements become fights to the death fuzzy lines turned into firm boundaries nothing is left un said it is true most youcranians i have intrivuted in a year an a half of covering the war have heart breaking stories about their relationships with family in russia but whois a kittin when our family conflicts ever resolved decisively when our family stories ever black on way neither for instance could have a weeks long fight with her mom about giving less than a hundred dollars to the russian government she contemplated throwing her father out of the car for being unable to face the crimes on bucha she flew in to rage in response to the waycutan caption tof photo of luca but she was not going to say word to her step dab whois actually serving the russian state wh then at belog the russian eucranian war has been going on for more than five hundred days nota sophy and luca are still living in lismon caran is in berlin a few weeks ago the russian government added him to its listof extremests and terroros this means

ucrane after rusian troops troop push back from keve the fixed up the house and taking the blankets off the windows they are still very much in love the cats weathered their absence fine the rest of

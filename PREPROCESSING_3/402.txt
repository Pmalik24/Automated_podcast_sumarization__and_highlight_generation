welcome to the hubermen ao science scienceayto fo i'm endercubermen and om r professor of nurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor lane norton doctor norton is one of the foremost experts in protene metabolism fat loss and nutrition he did his degrees in bile chemistry and nutricional sciences and is considered one of the world experts and understanding how we extract energy from our food and how exercise and what we eat combine to impact things body composition and over all health to day we discuss an enormous number of topics under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness including for instance what is energy balance that is how do we actually extract energy from our food we also discuss the somewhat controversial topic of artificial sweeteners whether not they are safe or not and wether r not they are an effective tool for weight loss in particular for people suffering from obicity and different types of diabeties we also talk about got health that is the got mycrobiom and how it is impacted by food and how it can actually impact the metabolism of the foods that we eat we also discuss fasting or called interment in fasting or time restricted feeding what it does and what it does not do in terms of how effective it is for weight loss and perhaps even for health and longevity we lso talk about protine and to find very clearly how much protine each and all of us need depending on our daily activities and life demands we discuss the various types of diets that you probably heard about including ketogenic diets vigan diets vegetarian diets and pure carnivore dits as well as more typical omnivore diets and how to make sure that you get all of the essentially menoacids that are critical for healthy weight maintenance weight loss or directed muscule gang we also talk about supplements in particular the supplements for which there is an immense amount of science pointing to their safety and efficacy for fitness and for over all body composition what i'm sure will become clear to you as you hear laine talk about each in every one of these topics is that he has an incredible ability to both understand the mechanistic science but also the real world applications of the various discoveries that are made in particular papers and in particular in the randomized controlled trials that ie when a given scientific hypothesis as been raised he is extremely good at understanding why it was raised but also at a valuating whether or not it works in the real world which is what i believe most everybody out there is concerned with i think this is one of the things that really distinguishes him from the other voices in the nutritional landscape i assure you that by the end of to day's discussion you will have a much clear understanding about what the science says about nutritian about fitness end about how different diets and fitness programs combine to achieve the results that you want before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however r part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science in science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponser is element element is an electorolikte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar wsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurrants in fact in order for your nuronts to function properly all three electrolits need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performants element contains a science back to lectrolikte ratio of one thousand miligrams that one grahm of sodium two hundr miligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element dok com slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleement docom slash hubermen and now for my discussion would doctor lane norton lane doctor norton thank you much for being here this is a long time coming and have to say i'm really excited because i've seen you in the socia media sphere i've also listened to a number of your other podcasts and as a fellow ph d scientist i feel a great kinship with you i know you have tremendous experience in in fitness in nutrition and number of areas we also got a lot of questions from our audience and i'm really loocing for to talking with you to day excited to me this you hs been something en talking about for long time as glamery l make it happen ya indeed and am i think some of the audience has requested a debate or a battle and i can hah ha 's not gon to hap and actually one of the things that brought lane and i together i in conversation on line and then via text et cetera was the fact that i love to be corrected and that is what happened i i did oppost about artificial sweeteners which we will talk about a ltlebit later in the episode and lane pointed out some areas of the study that i had missed or maybeve misunderstood and i provise my opinions and i think it is wonderful and other studies hove come out since then hopefully our conversation will serve as a as a message of how a science and action will science can can be perceived and and and that it does not always have to be a battle but hey if we get into it we get into it i will not get physical because we know you would we ha a ha ha a ha in any case i'd to start with something that is rather basic and yet can be pretty complex and that is this issue of ene rgy balance and energy utilization i think must people have heard of a calory i massuming that most people do not action know what that is in terms of how it works what it represents and some made you could just explain for people what happens when we eat food of any kind and how is that actial converted into energy as a way of framing up the discussion around weight lost weight matenance weight gain and body composition se great question and you said this is one of those things where now people use the term calories an callories out they said well that is way too simplistic i'm if you look at what actually makes up calories an calories out it is actually very complicated right let us dea with the a what you mentioned first what is a calory becaus i think a lod people do not quite understand this calory just refers to a unit of energy of heat specifically and what does that have to do with food what is that have to do with what we digest and eat really what you are talking about is the potential chemical energ that is in the bonds of the machronutriats of food right and by digesting assimilating and metabolizing those neutrians we are able to create energy and the inproduct of that mostly is e t p a a denizn try phosphate which is your bodies energy currency to understand e t p to try to think about if you are trying to power these various reactions in your body ayou retalk about tens of thousands of enzimes that require a t p am it does not make sense that yo would have to create a munch of micro explosions right you want something that can transfer high energy phosphates to power these reactions to give up essentially it is energy to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable a lot of metabolism is simply creating e t p which the in of the line of that nike f a kind of work backwards is what is called oxate of respiration that happens the monichondre ere but is heard mnicondrea power house of the cell and that is done a through essentially creating a hydrogen ion gradian across the mitacondrea which powers the production of ah t p by converting free phosphate pluts aighty p to e t p now the way that hydrogen ion grating is created is through a creating hydrodoge hydrogen ions be donated through the crebcycle now the creb cycle is linked to licolisis fe toabout cara hydrate metabolism cromhydrates basically other than fructos get converted into glucos which can go n t glike callus his and you can produce some eigh t piecs through likolysis and then it bolls down to pyruvate then a seetal oay which goes to the crebcycle produces a lot more eigh t pies from that i'v you toab ou protine protines al but different because protine i gets converted to ametoacids buch can be used for muscle protine synthesis or protine cetesis another tissues a but it also can be converted through glicanegenesis to glucos and there also are some keetogenica menoacis as well a and you can have a few different ways to get to the creb cycle a either being through a aseetl coa or through glue cos going troug the c gliccolysis to pyruvate then you have fadiacids which a are able to create energy through what is called bate oxidation where essentiallyou are taking these fatyacids in your lopping them off to carbons at a time to produce the setal coay which again can go in toe creb cycle produce tose hydred dions the can ten power the production of eight t p that is kind of at the saluo level of how this stuff works but stepping back and taken it back out what does that have to do with weight loss fror meight gain ran well when you think about the balance of energy and verseis energy out sounds very simple but let us look at what axy makes up energy and verse energy out first of all youve got to realize that the energy inside the ecquation is more difficult to tract than people think right one a food labels which we to think is being from upon high a can have up to a twenty per cent air in them really oh yet a hundred callery something liss is a hundred callories preserving it could what is actin in there can be be here hundred and twenty right exactly that is one aspect of it the second aspect is there is what is called your energy but the thows also matabolizable energy rightso if you have a food stuff with sa lot of insouble fibre typically insolible fibere a's not really digestible and you could have quite a bit of carbal hydrate but if you cannot extract the energy from it and typically this is because insoable fibre from plant material the carbal hydrate or and even someof the protine is bound up in the a plant structure which makes it inaccessible to digestive insimes and this is what adds bolkter school sthool what not but again reduces the matabolizable energy in ther and there is some evidence that based on peoples individual gut macrobiom that some people may axy be better and extracting energy out of fiber compared to other people just starting off right there occa theres there is quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things now one of things people will say is well see that is why ition where about tracting calleries cause of the food labls can be twenty per cent off and what i'll say is loki that is a that is i understand we are coming from but typically if it is office could be consistently off and if you are consistent with how you track it eventually you will be able to know kind of what you are taking in and it is got that is kind of saying well do not worry about tracking if you are i olito use financial a examples you knowl we know that to save money or you ife to earn more money than you spend well you cannot exactly know how much money you are earning at a time cause there is inflation and then there is ah if you ave investments those can be different interest rates and what not 'say o cate but you are you noifyouhave a budget youhave a reasonable idea of what it is goin to be and you make you make certain the sumptions but you can relatively guess now that is a good example right now let us look at the energy outside of the equation which is act you way more complicated right and say you are energy out is a few different a buckets the first one in the biggest one is your resting metabolic rate you'r armar and that for most people is anywhere from fifty to seventy per cent of your total daily energy expenditure now people use the term menabolic rate and energy expenditure kind of enterchangeably but they are not the same thing you are total daily energy expenditure is the summation of all the energy you expend in a day racking upstairs exercise if you do it fidgeting yet plust eur resting menabolicry right resting metabalk wate is a big part of that but it is not the only thing that chooses about fifty to seventy per cent and sedentary people will be on the higher end of that ' be a bigger proportion whereas people who are more active it will be a libut lower not because theyr metbalk rate is lower but because they are expending a greater percenge of the calories from physical activity then you have something called the thermic effect of food which is a relatively small percentage of your told daily energy expenditure it is about five to ten per cent ah and very difficult to measure and usually what researchers do when they are kind of looking at the stuff as they just kind of make an assumption about it they use a constant ah but that is about five to ten per cent of your daily energy expenditure and that refers to the amount of energy it takes to extract the energy out of food think about your body kind of a car right you do not just have gas ind your tank and its spontaneously starts out right yoif to have a batteries you put in energies woe can get the energy out of the the petrol at you have in your car similar with with food you cannot just eat food and then it just appears in your selves and you start doing stuff it has to be systematically broken down and put into forms that can actually produce energy and you have to put some energy and to achieve that and a lot of times people will say something well not all calories are crated equal thot's not true because calories just an unit of measurement right that would be saying not all seconds on a c lock ar creative equal yes they are all sources of calories may have different shal effects on energy expenditure and appetite if we look at something am fat for example the t f of fat is not zurto three per cent meaning if you would a hundred calries from fat you are nt will be about ninety seven to a hundred said the process of breaking down that fat i such hesob tracts some of the the calories away because yu used it in creating energy cori breaking those chemical bonds to create e tepy correct okrect you have for example some inzimes tat require eight p to run these processes now fat is actually the easiest thing to convert into energy then you have crorble hydate which has a t f of five to ten per cent you eat hundred calors from corbehydrte and ovicy the fibra content makes a big difference on this but you eat hundred calories you will net ninety to ninety five protin is about a twenty to thirty per cent t f if you would hundred callors from proaching you are only netting seventy to eighty now you are still net people say while you cannot eat too much protine well people will ask wil con proaching bestortos fat the carbons from proaching it is unlikely tocan a wind up an autopost tissue but if you are eating a lot of proaching over alls part of a lot of calories it does it has to be oxidized and a cannot provide a calory cushion for other things to be stored in fat but proaching itself does provide a net positive for calories but less than carbhiter or fat and tensity more satiating again when people talk about are all calories create equal yes but all sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expeniturant appetite that is the t f bucket and the b im or bucket then we go to physical activity and physical activity is essentially two parts there is exercise which is kind of your purposeful movements you oge for a walk you do training session whatever any purposeful activity and then you have what is called neat which is non exercise activity throm magenesis which i think it is actually really cool it is fascinated iat is it is i was actually hanging out with somebody last night and i was noticing them they they were fidgeting their feet and their their fingers and i said now if you always been pretty lean nd ere yet i never really had a pro problem maintaining leanness and when you look at the obs resistent fena type people think they hafe high b am ar or they exercise lot and really whanted it it seems to be as net they ten to if they over eat they just spontaneously increased their physical activity now people get neat confused ihave heard people say whil man got for a walk to get my neat up that is not neat neat is not something you can consciously modify but you are doing there if it is purposeful its exercise for example if it what i'm talking if i'm waving around my hands if im tapping my feet if i'm whatever that is neat but trying to get yourself i'm just good a tap my f ut more well now if i'm consciously having to do this than my fok is ame yu how the brain works very hard to do you do not really do two things it wance sori you kind of switch quickly between tats i rightly can i quickly ask a was the person that you are referring to our friend a ben bruno now now youes he is fidgety amazing on line fitness channel a he is a freakishly strong individual i a ya and a am i cannot remember whether not ben youre a fidgetor or not but anyway off to go go chack and will measure your fidgeting am about a non exerciseing you sermagasis neat a my enderstanding of the old papers on this old be i guess back to the midninetes ya tat the callory burn from neat is actually pretty significant we are not talking about a hundred callories wich you oner callis perday we'e drying about in some cases hundreds of thousand iescue a hundreds to maybe even close to a thalsand callories perday could you laberate on the yes there as actiona really classic study i think from one sats from levin in nineteen ninety five is meabolk word study and hopele i do not butcher the study because i'm trying to pullit out of my brain i do not expect you to have must say you have it a i quite extensive a pubmed idee a grab bag in there try to bring the receipts a i try to bing the receipt we can but we will put a link to this study in the showno cashion a a people can pruise it if they i believe they had people over eat n i think it was by a thousand callories day and i think fper six weeks en i mean this is the medal lic word they are this is very tightly controlled it is as tight as you get and what was interesting is of course on average people gained waight and gained fatmass but some people gained more than expected and there was one person in particular who only gained just over half a kilo right they should have gained i think it was something three to four kilos it was was predicted and what they found is this inge of individual just spontaneously increased the'r physical activity that e did not purposely do it it just happened and i mean you no anecdotally i've seen people who are again very lean even eat a meal sit down and start sweating and be very fidgety there is a a natural bodyblr back in the day named jim cordova and this gy was just very lean all the time and he was exactly that finotype he would walk up a flight of stairs and all the sunny sweating sit down ean to meal he sweating huust he is a furnace just expending energy and what is very interesting about neat is that seems to be the most modifiable i mean exercise very modifiable cause you can be intentional with that but of you do not be amour t e f and neat neat seems to be far more modifiable even a bodyweight reduction of ten per cent they observed a decrease and neat of almost five hundred callories a day for for a ten per cent a reduction at bodiwait now you also do get a decline and beamar when you lose way one because you are just in a smaller body now and it takes less energy to a locamot a but also there is what is called metbal captation which is a further reduction in your bamar then expected from the loss of body mass and that is on average usually round fifteen per cent but it does seem to be there is new evidence coming out on the metabal captation from bamar and it seems to be a lilebit a kind of in the transition fases if you if you start to diet within the first few weeks you will have a reduction and bamar that then kind of just af thereafter any further reduction is mostly from the amount of body mass you lose and then if you for example finish o diet moved your callories to maintenance a within a few weeks beamar kind of starts to come back up there is still a small reduction a but i used to be somebody who thought the bamar the metabalcaaptation was a big reason why people stopped losing wait or plateaud and now i think it is much more to do with meat interesting and you have said that it cannot be conscious am because that will distract us from other activities i do not knif you have had chance to look at this study and i'll send it you may be id be fun to do a kind of an on line jeurnal club about this at some point sumebut there is a study it came out a univers aused an recently having people do now this is a long pert of time four hours a day a basely a soleliest push up which may see a heal rays cave a seeded calf rays with one who at not waited and then they looked it a bunch ofthings about lucos matabolism and glucos clearance and insolen levels and they did not conclude that people burned ta ton of callries but what they concluded was that a bloodshuger regulation improved greatly and i think tere is a lot of excitement about this am at some level but base on everything you are telling me this it fits perfectly with what is known about meat this sort fellow somewhere in between with a in betweenscus me a to af deliberate exercise and spontaneous movement i guss they have tryd to make that spontaneous movement a little bit more conscious what i'll tell people as if if you are worried about nee one thing you can do these watches for example li people all what told me i burn this many callories the they are not accurate for energy expenditure i meat it is there was a metanalysis in two thousand and eighteen i wone to say between a wenty eight and ninety three per cent over estimation of energy expenditure by these watch ot this istracts over thorse are you listening where 're not getto name the brand but a fitness trackers that is a rist warn fitness trat and this itness is across the board a depending on the brand it could be be know more or less but they all over estimated the mount of ex the callories you burn from exercise this is acty a great example werke people go well callories in callories out does not work for me cause i ainte ta callorydeffs on i didn' loose weight an no when i talk to them usually it is they went to an all mine calculator it is ane is to few things they went tohan all i'm calculator put in their information it is it ispat out some callories to eat and they ait that n den loose weight nit is will but he thinks more likely that you are defying the loss of consurvation of energy or that you'r you might have not got in the right number for you the r the measurementual was off no now the next thing is a lot of people weig verysparatically and i'll tell people if you are go to make an intentional weight loss of goal and again this can be different for diffrent people but typically i tell people waiy and first thingin the morning or after yo the bathrom do it every day and take the average of that for the week and then compare that to the next week's average can ask one qritsarydan trou but whene great question about them weu say go to the bathroom not to get at you detailed i her for unnecessarily better e talking about ourination and lamiting your bowels i hav nearly becaue you geatin big meal the night before yet yet got it wake up i use the bathroom in all all forms that tat you ready and then and then get on the scale take that measurement average that across the week and then maybe every monday you take that value y and the reason i i recommend doing that is if you are just conosparatically weighing in as somebody who weighs themselves pretty pretty regularly i mew my weight witl fluctuate yu know five six pounds and not seemingly changing much and that is just those short term changes are fluid i i've had it before where week to week my averge did not change but between the lowest way and from a previous week and the highest waiy in might have been eight pounds right if you are somebody who just randomly is weighing in and you are eating in a callory deficit and you just weig in one day where you have just whatever reason holding some more fluid then you oll see this is not working when a reality you are average might be dropping that is one of the reasons and actually believe t are not a weight fluctuations are actually identified is a majyour reason why people get discouraged from weight loss m that i kind of stops the buyin when they ave a fluctuation up that is one of the reasons are earlin one of reasons early on the low carbdiets tend to work really wells cause people lose a lot of water weight really quickly and they get that buyin right to all this is working ow we can return to that noll bit ihave theories as to how that when people eat less carbadrate they screet more water and they will see for the first time they will see some definition in thei'r absen o we ot tho stiits amanzing and the fluid loss does hold that promise i think flue loss can do some other things on myt people lit make people literally feel lighter a all the gan i have some negative effects i do ever one quick question and and u i do want well return to met in a moment but when yo say the coloric burn as a consequence of exercise want to ask about the coloric burn during that exercise soperence and somebodies on the tread mill and they will see ocat they burn in four hundred callories ash i think this is a month where a number of prominent pod casters burt criser tom cigara jo rogue and others and they callt sober october but in addition to avoiding a'll call they they are burning five hundred callories perday during the exerci ever ment they'r measuring it a lot of people do this they think they take track of whether excuse me take stock of how many callories they burned myi unerstanding is that if that particular form of exercise is a muscle building form of exercise that that' some point later there might be an increase in muscle if you did it everything right you everything right and then you will burn more energy is a consequence of adding that tissue that is a long processess as and we will discuss but i have heard about this post exercise induced increase in oxidate of metabolism ia probly ot using the right a languaging here you if i were to go out for instance ance sprint dosome sprinc run hard for a minute jog for a minute run hardfor men do that ten times over they let us assue my burn four hundred callories during that a exercise about but my understanding is that in the hours that follow my bazil metabolic rate will have increased is that true and is it significant enough to care about answer both those questions a yes there does seem to be a small increase a imetabolic rate and no it does not appear to be enough to action make it difference when they look at and again this is where a i tell people i think i've a good perspective on this because i my undergraduate degrees about commister degree sa is very into mechanisms you do not it mean it was all if we just do this and this will get this right and then i did nutrician is a graduate degree and then my adviser was greate because you could do something over here and he could tell you how ul effect videm an de metabolism over heris is gon lame ye do not amn he would always can say yhe have what is the outcome good to be right this is actually one of things i change my mind on was i used to be very much while i think high intensity interval training is probably better because you get this post exercise energy burn which they do see in some of these studies but in the kind of meta analysies and more tightly controlled studies where they a quaite work between high intens intervals and moder or low intentsty a cardio a quating work a they do not see differences in the loss of body fat and to me if i'm looking ie that is the example of a mechanism which is oca were seeing this small increase in basemen a bolic rate that should lead to increased loss of body fat but again remember you are capturing it a snap shot in time right but we do not see a difference in the loss of bodyfelt what may be happening and again i'm just speculating but a way to explain it could be you might have an incr ease andthen you might actually have a decrease the tends to just connal wash it out i ave imagine some forms of exercise this would be highly individual but im we will spike appetite more than others fer instance if i go out for a forty five minute jog or which i do o forty five to sixty minute higker jog once a week i just make it appoint to do that or ruck or something that thrown away vast and hike after that i find i a very thirsty i want to hydrate but i'm not that hungry that is true of most all carty of ascular exercise for me but after i wait train about sixty to ninety minutes later i want to eat the refrigerator and obviously callories in callories out dictates that that will play in important rollas to whether not i gainerlos weight et cetera is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise that people choose i needs to be take in in consideration callories in callories out to how much is burn during the exercise also how much that exercise tens to stimulate appetite i not nowither not people explore this and in the rigorous studies t and whether not that form of exercise actually increaseis lean muscle mass or not im it' id now we take an exercise and split it into a number of diffent dimentions but this is what i you are masterful at is really parcing how the ifferent components work individually and together if you would just am expand on that i love to know what you are thinking yet this is actually fascinating thing im first thing i want i wanted just go back to talking about for example burton tom and and joe er n to fafner callories to day on whatever iso those apparatuses do not measure those things effectively either right just these watches but wel the one thing i will say is if you are for example if i do to ours resistance training typically this will say d burned about a thousand calleries not's a lot of resistanctermy wary migh waight work outselects are warm up for ten minutes and then one hour of work done i just i love to tran okad it is an and you can recover from my recovery quotion is pretty low i've been training for thirty pluss years and i've found that if i do more than an hour of hard work in the gem meaning resistance train if seventy five minutes maybe out mocay but pass that i have to take two maybe en three days off before anytin in my nervous system just does not tolerate it well i i liminute to an hour i know but an ha that to remember is i've kin o built up to that over a long pet o time right ill could not just pose somebody in the star haven do to ours day as nocking to go well for them i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens ithletic greens now called g one is a vite im in mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundation ol nutritional needs i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve 'm delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there is my starry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take atletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to be i the probiatics that i need for got health ire got is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiatics anouth letic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition i letic greens contains a number of adaptigens vitements and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastesgrit if you to try oth letic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d thre k too again that is atletic green stoc cam slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vite emind thre k to but i we will say about the callory trackers is if i'm used to i usually burn about a thousand calories according to this it is not accurate but if i go in to morrow and i do thirteen hundred it may not be accurate i do not know what the exact number is but i can be relatively confident that it is more than the previous session right and in terms of comparison it might be o k you non't cone ut within subject a and in the other thing i kon a circle around i was if you we are not neat tracking your steps can be helpful because peopleill step counts can spontaneously decrease when none a fat lost i than ev realize it aand and that again not a complete measure of neat but what we have had some clients to wet are tee miling coaches is they will say o kay your at eight thousand steps right now we are not going to add any purposeful cardio but what ever you need to do to maintain that eight thousand steps do that and sometimes they have to add fifteen twenty thirty minutes of cardio because their spontaneous activity that dhey're not even where of goes down that is a really excellent point at i i've heard you no the ten thousand steps per day number was a we all heard that and then i learned that ten thousand s con o thrown out as in ar trery number erlise atgt hour intermit in fastingthing that is a story behind that ish a spoke to souch in and it turns out that the graduate student in is labe that did that initial study which was on my by the way a was limited to being in lab for a bout eight hours by their significant other the eight hour feeting window as actuall the consequence of this person's relationship a that is that is a really great point that people do not realize when they a lot of people will try to copy scientific studies and i'l i'll tell people that lessen scientific studies are confined you you need to be very careful with how broadly you apply what is in there right ther they are a very big hammers the kond the way a look at it o ka they are not a scowpl theyr big hammer and i think a lot of times an terms of coaching scientific studies will tell you what not to do rather than what to do right il be getting back to your question about exercise appetite first if i'm not really aware if there is aevident showing differential effacts of different forms of exercise on appetite it is possible am but again it also could be a plucibo effact right because we for sample you and i grew up in an air a with a muscle magazines it was well soon as you finish your work out you'o hve your biggest meal the day right and when i say plucibo effact i think people have the wrong idea what the plucibo effect is they think that is just a feeling plusibo effact can actually change your physiology people do not people do not realize this a there is research showing that a plucibo where the power of suggestion is basically as powerful as some former suitacles and one of the the great examples i to use is ictul t was a study we just covered in our research for view on creaton where they did am four groups not supplement with creatsan told they were not supplement of creaton not supplemented told they were supplemented supplemented told they were supplemented told they were thasically it just matters what they told them really go u this is incredible am i have to get this study wo it is we can link to a collegue of mine that stambershe is been on the pod casts i love introduce you to cause i think he is we a really rear first rout she was a former de on athle am and then is a it runs a labat tamperin psychology is is a leacrum and she is an grup am it in thes very athletic obviously and very very smart and her laboratory folkses on these belief slash plucibo effacts where if you tell people all the horrible things that strasts due to you interms your memory and cognant functioning they give them a memorytas they theyd perform well belo baseline you tell them that strass sharpens them in the short term and that it dranalin is this powerful molecule that can a really tune out by number of memory systems memory improves and it mints remarkable am and it is consistent and a and this end theyve done this for any number of different things in anagan easle wod olergies for instance it incredible results in any case i i'm i' glad you are bringing the sout m i take creating monohidrate a and have for years fivegrams a day i do not nat's great and am and it is great and i believe it is grates it ner compound offact of believing its great and it actually nigh not in this study but i think the thing to point out people will misinterpret that as creaton does not work and that is not what that says what it says is youre beliefs about what it does are probably just as powerful as what it does right they would actuly to a study do not have the citation but it was think within last ten years wher they told people they were puttng them on anibal exteroids and would not it they had better gains even though they were not actualy on anibal exteroids they had better gains than people that they did not tell ereand ofoxteroids and that is hard out come strength lean body masts o those sorts of things when people say well i would not falt for the plucibo effact its eh you do not have to fall for it if if you believe it to be true the power of belief is very very powerful and as a scientist i wish sometimes i was ignorant that i could subject myself to little see befect more often av some ram kind of gettng back to that is just a possible explanation of maybe why and i'm th same way i get don with a work out i c resist the traiting session amread to eat ight now if you look at the literature over all on exercise an appetite it is not always what you would expect consistently it seems to show that exercise extually has an appetites suppressent effect a people do not tend a compensate at least fully for the amount of movement they do and there is some evidence that you have probly heard people say what exercise a realy poor weight loss tool right it if you figure out how many calories you should be burning from it and you do that you an up getting less weight loss than you then you would predict have a family member who is perfectly happen to eat lest but does not loathe exerciseba dislike sexors yeand they and there of healthy weight but i'm always encouraging them to exercise morinecicisn on going battle in ur in our sibbling relationship well one thing i would say is that exercise independent of anything that happens with your bodyweight you will be halthier exercise is one of the only things will actually improve your bile markers of health without even losing weight there is it it prove your insellent senstivity inflammation all that stof ever bih out there looking for a hack to be healthier exercise is the hack riveshal point and our am a mutual friend doctor peter to a thin has gone on record several times now saying that of all the things that one could take and a men et cetera met formin of a egard us of wheather not one takes those or does not take those that the posive effects on on gevity by way of bar by markers from regular exercise is far out waiys all of those things combine not that those things do not necessarily work we are not going throug them in detail now but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do for healtspan in life spandion absolutely i hundrpercent agree and when you are talking about weight loss people miss the point of exercise i think yethere is some worth that came out from a hermin ponsers well that basely showed well if you do a hundred calories from exercise you have a twenty eight calory reduction in your basol metabolic rate in a response to that it is kind of this constrained energy expenditure model right but what i would sayse iok can wlte tare still a net of seventy too right its still it is still o ka and the other thing is i think the effects of exerise on weight loss ar actually more due to what it does to appetite a if you look at people who lose weight and keep it off for a number of years kind of outliers because most people do not keep it off for years over seventy percent of them engage in regular exercise of people who do not keep weight loss maintain weigt loss less than thirty per cent exercise regularly now that is just a correlation that does not es prove causation but there are some pretty compelling studies showing that exercise increases your sensitivity to society signals basely yould have the same sitiety signals but you are more sensitive to them when you exercise and there is actuya really classic study im from the nineteen fifties and been golly workers where they looked at basically four different quadrants of activity suhed sedentry lightly active moderately active heavily active basely base on o their job choice and they did not have an intervention they just one detract them an and see how much you nw how many calories to the actually eat it was a jay shaped curve the sedentary actually ate more food than the lightly active are moderately active but from lightly active to heavily active they almost perfectly compensated how many calories they should be eating to me that suggests when you become active you can actually reregulate your appetite appropriately or much more appropriately than if you'r edentary and do you think this has to do with changes in the brain brain centers that respond to socity signals from the prifry am and or do you think it has to do with a changes in rt blood sugar regulation what i was taught and i do not know if this is nl conser true is that now spikes in blood sugar will triggar or desire to eat more even though it is got of exactly the opposite what you need when you have a spiking bloog sugar and there is this kind of and will get into this oint ouk about artificial sweetners this his idea in mind i think i adopted perhaps falsely that now eat something that sweeter that tastes really good and and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more am and i can imagine how exercise am if it is increasing the society signals a could be working in a number of different ways ye i i think it is am i think the effect is probably mostly at the brain level am that the effects on blood sugar the research out there is not very compelling for blood sugar driving a appetite now if you become hypogly seemac yes you will you will get hungary but it is a different kind of hunger then your normal i feel con empty and my stomachs growling those are they can go together but usually the hypogly seem is i am hot i feel hmn to pass out you want it eats something not because your stomach crowling but because that you just neat some fuel s youre etting cold under oh ye asualliimere been there when ive a then longer fast something i do not do any more and drank a lot of black coffee thos probably an electrolight effect ther because coffee as you excreete sodo him another electrolites and then just feeling i needed something this whole thing i need something has have desperation and i never want to be back here again hyprogrise theng man is very on ut's not fun again when they any when then when they look at you now actual randomize control trials of implementing some exercise were there pretty controlled environment they typically see people if if anything they eat less as supposed to eating more now some people again that is u know studies report averages right and there is individual data points there are some people who at least anecdolly report that exercise makes them were hungry that is completely valid it is now it could be the're believe surrounded it could be of number different things but it is important understand that there is individual veriability and i think one o the things that i've learn to appreciate more is not trying to separate psychology and physiology we would we do this a lot itso whil wone tnoug the physiology do not care about the psychology of it and now i'm kind of appreciating more psychology is physiology that with most things now we have kind of the bio psycho social model and i'l give an example this lot of people get really caught up with appetite and if we could just suppress people's appetite that is part of it but people do not just ee cause the'r hungry thet for a lot of different reasons social reasons especially can you remember the lost social event y ever went to the did not have food right ie you look a dinner plates from the eighteen hundreds about this big now how begger dinner plates the whole offay ri rita im if you there is a situational cues right your stting down to watch t t o grabson popcorn grab some snack whatever i even see this with that how i one personal pick up the phron and then ever onet piks up their fon i think there is a similar effect with food yno and and same thing right how many times have we either done it ourselves or been a experience people saying owe should have some you should have t lie atout call specially right people a i was saying out of somebody last night and i had a beer and they just had a water and i'm i feel now need to try and convince them to do that with me what i mean but as humans we are were kind of hurt animals we do not want to be doing something out an isolation o our own now i this is a very tinuous i guess belief of mine but doing things alone in isolation during kind of ancestral times that is going to set off your alarm system caus if you do not have other people you cannot protect yourself right typically things were done together in groups and i think that is tha lot of the reason why we tend to be just trible in nature about a lot of things right the whole point to that is on the list of reasons why people eat me i've gotten the poi where i think that hunger is actually not even the main reason people eat i stress ah lackasleep ord bord ye absolutely unless we can do something that addressis all those things ah this that there is a line from a review paper this reviepever came out two thousand elevens by research or ame ac clean and it is the best review paper i've ever read i was called abiology's response to dieting the impetus for weight regain and basely went through all the mechanisms of these aditations that happened during fat lost diets and how biology's response is to try to drive you back to your youre previous and i'm in a butcher tho quote but at the end of the study he said basically the bodies systems are comprehensive redundant and well focussed on restoring to pleaded energy reserves and any attempt or an kind of strategy for weight loss thit does not attempt to address a broad spectrum of these things is going to fail and that is why when people say will just do low carb you will not be hungry mu youeve it people do not just eat because they are hungry i think really trying to get outside the box and and think about these things and especially when you read some of the litter tried i recently read a a systematic review of successful weight lost maintainers which i hought was really interesting ah they took people who had lost to significant aout oa bodyweightn't kept it off firs for i think it his three years and it masely asked him questions and tried to identify commonalities and there were some thingsthat i expected cognative restraint self moditering ah i exercise and then one of the things they sad that i found realy fascinating was pretty you biquitists between people they said i had to develop a new identity you are you sear with ethen simply no ethen is a actor he is been remember the titans and a american history ax i certainly saw american history ex yes he was he was very large he was five hundred fifty pounds and now he is too thirty and jacke but you ilifi he was how five hundred fifty pounds well ah and he hase whenever he puts up post on his instogram of him training it will say i killed my clone to day and i asked him is this whit youre talking about creating a new identity he said this is exactly what i'm talking about because i had to kill who i was because there was no way i was goig t be able to make long term changes if i just did not become a new person because there is i mean an attics talk about this right am people who were alcholics they had to get new friends they had to hang out at different places because theire entire life had been set up a round the slife style for alcohol and i would actually argue that eating disorders or disordiring patterns is much harder to break then other forms of ediction and he about food ediction well in some ways belemia and and arerecy are still addictions you cannot stop eating i you are alcoholic you can abstain from alcohol if you become addicted to psycocane you can abstain from that you can never abstain from food and now imagin tongue of gambling attict well you have got to play the slot in a couple times to day but no more that is that is really challenging yet i just all this stuff it is important to be comprehensive with how we treat these things i these are incredibly important points and to my knowledge i do not think any one has really described it in a cohesive way the way that you are doing here important for people understand this because ivas se is a nero scientists i think noow the nervous system is creating our thoughts our thoughts are and feelings are relate to psychology and therefore of course our physiology in our psychology are one in the same sby directional now there is nowdays here is a lot of interest in brain body in paticular got bring a access and we we can talk about that but i i really appreciate that your spelling out how there are these diferent variables each one can account for a number of diffent things exercise clearly has a remarkably potent to fact both during the exercise and trms of coloric wern over all health and bile markers and then this is wonderful to learn that it can increase the sensitivity to a to society signals i think that make at least my mind place is very high on the list of things that people should absolutely do but that there are other factors too and the identity piece is fascinating it reminds me also your story reminds me also a davigogins who is lyu you do not he talks about his former very overweighitself almost as if it was a different person and he uses language that i'm not any useeere youi've inmet david know david a bend he is he is every bit is intense and driven as and remarkable human being as he appears to be aon line he is that guy but it does seem he had to mor less kill off of a former version of himself and and continues to do that every day and i think it wht your point about that this other fellow who did u does it does it through a similar process i the word to day seems to really matter it is not you a defeat this former version of yourself and then that that that person is buried and gone you said i killed my clone to day and that is the way that david talks about it also this is a daily process and i think this is not just a small detail in ting together all these things i think that what you are describing is is fundamental because we can pull on each one of these variables and talk about each one of them but the other day weare cohesive whole as it is an individual in i'm a sorry you re us t gets that is gasaxiono em i my favorite topics which is ou know why do we have such a hard time with losing weight but more keeping it off because of o beast people six out of every seven o beast people will lose the significant about a bodyweight in their life why do we stelfen o beasty prom they do not keep it off why do not they keep it off when you look at the ree search basically what it suggests is because people think about i am going to do a diet and when lose this weight and they do not give any thought to what happens afterwards right it is think about if you have some canochronic disease r a dibak right you you cannot just take insolent once and that is it right you got it take it continuously other wise you are goingto have probledms i'm if you do a diet and you lose thirty pounds fantastic but if you then just go back to all your old habits you are going to go back to where you were if not more you cannot you cannot create a new version of yourself while dragging your old habits and behaviours behind you what i'll tell people is as people say what i'm doing a cart of wor diet or i'm doing this diet or that diet and i'll say that is fine do you see yourself doing that for the rest o your life and if the answers yes if you if you really believe that that is con to be staled for you and plenty people lo carb andr ment fasting what whatever they say up felt easy you now i could do this forever great what if you are going to lose weight you have to invoke some form of restriction whether it is a neutrient restriction low car lo fat a time restriction interement fasting any former time restricted eating or calon restriction tracking mack ros whatever you get you get to pick the form of restriction pick the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive to you as an individual and also do not assume that it will feel the same for verybody else because i made this mistake where is lie i i track things i i allow myself to eat everity foods i allow myself to eat some fun foods a but i track everything and i'm able to modify my body composition on being good health doing that now does not feel hard for me at part of it is i've just been doing it for long but the other people that is very strestful they do not want to they sa wi'd rather just not eat for we know sixteen hours if that fells easy for them do that because the one thing that there is a couple of metanalysis on a popular diets and basteley what they showed was theyare all equally terrible for for long turm weight loss but when they stratified them by adherents and none of them were better for adherent over all but when they stratified people just according from lowest adherents to best adherents it was a linear of fact on weight loss really what it says is what is the diet that is going to be easiest for you to adhere to in the long term and you should probably do that and people again this is where i step back and take the ten thousand foot viewu somebody'll say whamul do kito genic because i want increase my fat ocidation and i want to do this andthere talking always mechanisms an everything and that is great can you do it for thrust your life right is that is this going o be something sustainable for you and if the answer is no you probably need to rethink what youreproaches gon to be it is incredibly important message basically that by thet high lightn if there was a aversion of highlight or bold face and underline in a in the podcast face i i would highlight bollface and underline what you just said and for those hof yeuth heard it i listen to it twice and then go forward because it is absolutely key i think it also explains a lot of the called controversy that exists out there i think am it also crosses over with the placibo effect i almost want to say pick the the nutrician plan that you think you can a stick to for for a long peritife time i deally forever and picture placibo too because there is there is a lot up with sibo woven in t each and every one of these things interement fasting a kito probably even vican verses ominaboriversis carnivor well even talk about the diet honeymoon period it wer you go into a diet you are all fired up about it your veriat herit and in what happens with every single diet without exception in research studies is once you get past a few months atherents to starts waiting thitn' goin off here we are really talking about a form of relationship i'm not id not saing that to be tongue in cheek actuall we had a guest early on in the podcast doctor calle diceroth he is a psychitris and u'm by engineer at stampfored am tremendously successful lasker a word winter et cetera and he talked about love as a sort of a a an interesting aspect of our psychology where it is a story that you co create with somebody but that you live in to the future of that story when you tik parup with somebody that we as refering to romantic love that there is the sort of mutual agreement to create this this idea that you are going to live in to 's notch as about how you feeling the moment it is also that you project into the future quite a lot i'm seeing a lot of parallels with am a highly functional and effective diet and u and i love it i'm not as setting this parallel up artificially a i'm setting out because i think that ultimately it was that down to what you said earlier which is that the brain in our decisions about what we are going to stick to are tremendously powerful and i think one thing i will say as i keep in mind when you look at the research tate of the medanalysies on say time restricted eating verses non when calories are ecquated does not seem to be a difference and in waiht loss fat loss and most by a marker's health same thing for blo car verses loaf at few quat callories in protine there is there is a medanalysis on by ceven hall back in to tho seventeen where they looked at the and again actual loss of body fat and another important point was there was i tink there wis twenty two studies an this but all of them provided food to the participants right that' some portant because that make in sures at adherents we much higher in those studies where is various free living studies sometimes you can see funkey results people are sneaking food or or there just not really it is very diviing away that the study would i deally have them unless unless the person is getting continuous support studies were they have a dieticion talk to people every week ten dacts you have pretty god adherence but h mean that is expensive to have done the studyng again lie what limits studies money money and money right m but the low car for slofat proaching and cowers are quated basically no difference in foutlows now some people get up set about this but it is what to me that is this is great because you get to pick the tool you want the one tool it does not seem to be that much better than another pick the one that works for you i whatever lever you have got a pool you have got a bunch of different options umention a picking something you can stick to for a period of time is there ever a case for some one saying look i to eat low carb or even quito for six monts and then switch to a more standard omnive or cloric maintenance tipe diet and then switch back isthere any downside to doing that for sake of howl for or weigt loss over a time or weight maintenance overtomgess here realis not everyone is trying to lose weight i'm then i deaftly want to talk about it some wainht how to eat to maintain wait is i think there are a significant a fraction people out there who are trying to do that yes there anything is there any downside to being a dabbler quito for a few months and then i'm novor for a few months et cetera i think that is i h a great thing especially to mad be find what you feel is easiest for you right a but in terms of as astrategy i mean i guess some people a this mike get into dopamin but ochange ind get something new and you fell but more positive in on artiner model yee i exactily i do not think it is how i would usely set things up initially for somebody but if somebody tot hay i just to have some variety and an changed it up as long as there still there behaviours in the doing portion control or whatever it is and theyre able to sustain a calory deficed or to pitting one of their goal is i do not thnk there is really any downside to it i do think the one than to keep a mind is when you look at going between extremes a low fat to lo carb or or vic aversa a there can' be in that transicion period a little bit of weirdness for o better term for example if you been on a cuto genic diet and all the sudden you move to a higher carb diet you will be basically inselend resistant for just a short period of time now is that goin o cause any health problems probably not in the long term it is lt a's lot especially if youare till controllin caleries but just because your body has kind of upregulated these systems dealing most we mostly with fat and glucofs production rather than glucos matabolism now if you start taking glucos or carbhidered back in fre senly use somemi or glucofs tolerate's test after they ben on quito the do pretty terribly at it but that does not last that long about how long few weeks i think that is hat important for people to know because i have a feeling during those first few weeks are the period of time when a lot of people go running back to what they were doing previously which is not to say that they should not but i certinly done that i tr i've tried a very lo carbor hydrate diet and i would have assumed and now i know i'm completely wrong but i assumed that i was carbhydrate starved for long that my insolent sensitivity which is a good thing by the way folks it would have gone through the rof and i would be able to just spon shop every bit of glucost that i would have injested through carborahydrate i did indeed switch over and i felt a pretty terrible brain fog i even got some gitters and i thought what is this my blood suggar was low before now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory but they some what you just said i'd upregulated the enzimes and systems in the body for fatmatabolism on the quito diet and then switching over am there was a basicaly a ramping op of the of the the molcos ivolved in a presumbling n glack calls transition period and m thing about if you have not weight train before and you start weigt training you would feel pretty terrible right you cnd be sore and stiff and a con o stuff but will say you are not necessarily wrong in what you said about being more insolen sensitive because it depends on how you measure insolent sensitivity if you measure with something am fasting but glucos or fasting insolent or even homa i are those ten to be pretty good on low carb but that if you do in old glucofs tolerances test it sends be pretty bad and it depends on your specific measure right am i i think that the idea that quito makes you ito glucos and tolerand are inslent resistant i think again it just a transition period and i'm not too worried about it but there is something important to keep in mind and what the reasons lik coun some mas to transition out of quito typically if licke i'm working with them or oneof our coaches ore working with them wulcin of instruct them to do it slowly in kind of systematically over a four to eight week period that way hopefully you kow they are not having that period of two weeks for the o man why why i feel terrible very important point i want to go to the other end a literally in figuratively and talk about got health because until now and certainlty which you dad certainly in the last a few minutes we been talking a lot about ser top down processes that the brain the psychology placibo of facts but the very real aspects of those not that i can imagine two thousand colories as housand calories and somehow changed the law of third montinamats cannot do that but we been sort of top down in integrating a lot of different ideas into weight lost maintenance and and weight gain but got health least tha the more popular studies on got health hav blown a lot of things out of the water for instance this idea that you could take obs mice and let literally give them feagle transplants from lean mice and yes that sounds what it sounds im i fecle transplants steffling am inserted through the same end in which it comes out and i point thed out beas a lot of people ask me they you knw it was conniscari to me i thought yes this is not about injesting f sees this as they ay they literally do a a transplan of hes from lean mice in to obs mice and the obs mice get lean and yes this has been done in humans limited number of studies and observe i'm some pretty impressive effects on weight loss that i have to assume could be related to plicebo of fact they might have told these o bes people i look yofre ging to get lean through this feogle transplant from lean people but more likely it had some effect on their corphysiology i do not know which aspects although i can speculate which ones and they became leaner they lost weight and that is in some sense miraculous when especially given the important roll of psychology and exercise and sotiety signals because i'm going to assume that they controlled for a number of those other variables although no study is perfect what are your thoughts about got health as it relates to metabolism energyulization and balance as for the first i all say is i'm not a got got heal expert but i well i feel rell to the comfortable talking about it based on conversations i've had with people who are experts i one being im susand of coda lose oue moer well she is sort of a fenalm in this area from what i anserse as actually do her masters when i was do my p h t and laymon's lab she was swene my labmates for im and ithe other thing to say is even got health experts and susann will tell you this they you do not talk to me in twenty years we we just know little i think that is an overall thing the people do understand is the scientific insensis moves very very slow and probably for good reason because if we just flipped our scientific nsensas based on one study i mean you it would be a mess right it is gon to take time before wou really understand the implications af the got and what it means when it comes to weit loss there probably is a roll in there may we have seen that there is something going on now whether that is it im something were ey got bac macrobiol make up that is more obes resistant a perhaps it extracts less calories out of the food you eat wh i or perhaps it is elevating bm ar although i i think that that is probably some one unlikely do you think it it impact the way sotiety signals sir that is to me o back to the brain again that' we know that there is a link in the they got brain accis and my suspicion is that it probably is aworking thea appetite regulation that the mean if we look at a if we look at the most effective am o beasty treatments out there which is someglutide ai mean you consistently see a yo know fifteen percent weu know an average loss of bodywayt which is massive and people keep it off a that is a go p one memetic which is a guthorm on and it basically just as a very very powerful appetite suppress it i'd not well i guess i'm interrupting but hopfully with a purpose em but there is this really interesting study and it is in mice admittedly but a publishing a nuro scins journal recently and the basily to take away is that many things in nurol science it the geo pu one works in two parallel pathways in the brain it seems to impact neurons on the hypithelemis that control sotiety exactly what you are saying and in the got it seems to create a am the inactivation of the mechanic sensors in the god wso the perception is that thet god is full even were full ler i should say not full because i think people who take bsomicuti do not feel bloaded uness i do not know mat they might but that one feels as if there got is actually fuller because these mechanic sensors that send stratch our sending signals to the brain oh act ye have some food i'm not empty down there rit am ay rat i i'm tickled by this result mustly because every time i hear about a a drug or a romolecul having effect we think it has an effect at one location men it is kind of interesting that especially for something am appetite regulation that it would be impacking body and brain in parallel an we forgive me i not's a gateli i'm ii thing really excited about this and an here you are telling an urow scientist me that a lot perhaps circles back to these brain mechanisms of society i mean i think that an especially looking at the research onleapt in we used to think oke me tabolism is mostly liver base and then there is a there is ayou do not metabolism atipesite and skullda muscle but none of the stuff exists in isolation there is much cross talk between these pathways and that is when we get into mechanisms the one things i love mechanisms but one things i tell people is keep in mind that when you are dealing with an outcome right when i say outcome base were talk about physical outcomes wait loss fat loss changes in blood markers whatever though that is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms sure sometimes you can effect a mechanisic pathway and you g it con a straight down the line outcome but not always youknow whenever you make a treatment or kind of anything into the system it is throwing a pebble in a lake right creates ripples and we do not always know what those are going to be right a and that is why wht may we have seen certain drugs wat works on this pathway and then they list off all the side effects you go how would it create that many side affectes because nothing for the most part they do not just work in one place there is multitude of places it works a in in to your point about a me glutide and the effects on a mechanol censers it is probably while od people report actually kind no low grate nausea a wt when there using me lutide abecause of that because if your ou kno that feeling is usually not a real comfortable feeling bu mean that will get you to not eat i think there is absolutely likely a connection a but we have not fully elucidated how that works and we think abot how complicated the gut is i think i heard something there is more youknow thr's more cells in our microbio by far than there are in our body we are axy more and terms of a sell per cell level we are actully more bacteria than we are you carry out i there is a just in sonunberg whos wone of the world experts on microbom he is in the lab up stairs from mine at stamford and a he is this idea it is just an idea that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are sells the questionas whose the host and whos the passenger maybe we e are just maybe there exploiting us to take them around and interact because they interact and grow on one another ans of this idea this freaks people ot lex freedmen will of this that maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles for the micromithe other way or out anyway kind of aa a scary thought a do you do anything specifically to support your got microbiom are you a probiotic guy or a fermented foods guyre a fibr gui agan i'm cannot go straight down the line from whatever from susan another experts if you want to improve gut health one of the biggest levers the three biggest levers you can pull is not eating too many calories exercising there is that there is a connectuion between exercise and the gut and fibr we it is of the things we know ditery fibr seems to positively impack the gut because it is a what is called a prebionic you are gut microbioda can take especially soluble fibr although there is actually some evidence at least in mice that they it might be able to use some insoluble fibre as well i think susanne was doing a study looking an himmycelulos an actually seeing that some specific forms of microbioda flourish with himmy cellulos suggesting that they may actually be getting some kind of fuel out of it which is really interesting a begin in mi just huge caviot you are got microbium can produce these short chained fadiacids from a by fermenting a this thes the soluble fibre and there is quite a bit of evidence that these volatile fadiacids which can be then acually a reabsorbed in through the liver that they have some positive effects i'm for example buterate when they have done buerate supplementation the have actully seen positie ffects on insolent senstivity what we seem to understand is that more diversity seems to be better fibr seems to be positive prebodics seem to work much better than probionic supplemented prebiono yes if the problem of most the probionics is there typically not concentrated enough to actually colonize and even if you do colonize what happens is tit let' say you colonize am some microbiota that you did not really have much of if you are not fueling it with the appropriate fibre it is not going to stay anyway because it is essentially going to starve the research seems to really clearly suggest that eating in a fibr at which is again a prebiodic that that is a better way to get aa healthier got per say then probiotic what fibrer sources do you use and i think i momt i realize there is a huge array of choices out there but people will want have some ideas as to how they could perhaps memic what you are doing yet and i was to say diversity ri af some there is there is various evidence from veryus different fibre sources am forits in vegetables obviously am weu know grains some whole grains a some cereals a and then various other sources this is one of the things where we do not really have a good idea if this one source of fibres better than another source of fibere we just know that fiber over alls pretty good and one they i'll tell people is if you want a long gevity hack i mean fibr is kind of alonggevity hackive if you look at some of these cohort studies ore is a actuia recent really large metanalysis of over a million subjects am and basically what it showed was that for every ten gram increase in fibre there was a ten per cent reduction in the risk of mortality and that extended specifically also to cardiovasculases and cancer one things i'll tell people when they get really into you knowhether tedement fastaying or you knw all al is son thingsthey that is great that is great are you eating over fifty sixty grams of fibraday and i ti conceptialize fifty sixty gram fireaty a a a bult a what is to say i quarter plate of brochly a and the brocly isin stack to the ceiling hen rochly is jis reasonably a stacked on their a proxially how many grams of fibrers that if it is a a two cups abrochly is a a fyout two un igrams of brocly persay would probably five six grams of fibere and i need to get how much perday well i only tay i would typically what the recommended dose is is fifteen grams per thousand caleries and take because i your eating low callories it is it is difficult to get in a fibr in a but based on and again these are cohort studies but you cannot do twenty your long rantomize human control trials unfortunately thet does not really appear to be a top end at least for the benefits of fibre that it probably bawls down to how much you can tolerate without feeling uncomfortable rright because if youre eating a ton of fibr i mean it at some point it is not can be very comfortable exercise becomes uncomfortable and wore hazardous ye and as ye kind of touching on that becausei it is important a you a log people have kind of in the carniv ore commenyis said well you do not need fibre you poop just find without it and always say will pooping is the last reason to have fibre tat yes it does help it does seem to make a elimination easier i can you do not do it more frequently ats bulk to stool but that is thot why you should eat fibere why should eat fibre is because of the effects of mortality and some of the pushback will be whell this is healthy usurbius and what all say is meaning healthy people do this and therefore how peopleit more fibre on theire for and i mean yat there is theres something to that but if it was just healthy user by us typical you would see some disagreement between the studies and an great example that is red meat not every study shows red meat has an associates with cancswer in mortality ther's there is differenceis deping on the population youse depending on what they to find us hired meat lowred meat wither its process on process but i have not found a study on fibre and cart of askr diseese and cancer and mortality were it did not show improvements from hire fibere to me that suggest that that that effect is real a and again as much fiber as you can get in comfortably i would try to do it a because it seems have some really powerful effects and is good for the got microbium the other thing that may be a consideration for microbium is there is some evidence that saturated fat may not be great for he microbium that it a reduces the a the prevalence of some some of the more positive strange of bacteria and that appears to be a not much from the saturated faut itself but from the bile in products that combined with saturated fat seems to have a negative effect on some of these more am healthy reforms i've got microbiota but again this is really difficult because we do not even know necessarily yet which species of got microbiona or positive or negative and that is anding this gets in to some of these studies where they may call it dispiosis sound scary but disbios is just means that the got changed it does not necessary it does not tell you anything qualitative about whether the change was bad or good and these are just things i think we ned to keep o mind we talk about this stuff that this stuff is still very much in its infancy but in terms the big lever levers i mean it is pretty much fits with what we know about healthy life style exercise do not eat too much consume a good amount of fibr from diferdiver sources fantastic a fantastic because it fits with what i to think of its con te centere of mass of evidence right and i i'm strying to get some window into what your process is around selection of studies and no one study being holy but when you look at as you mention all the studes on fibr having it a a positive fact to some degree er another it is pretty hard to refute that there is not something really interesting there i will not they hont tell people's one study i mean sometimes i'll change my opinion base on a single studywhents really well done and very powerful but usually one studies just can move me just a little bit ten may be if another one comes on mo me lobit more right and they very slowly in when it gets i' men my my experience with e'll deal clustral this some mi change mo mind on a while back o when i was younger but circu two thousand five gettng into grad school cond of the prevailing thought was well it is not much the elld yell it is the racio of eldell to h dell that is what matters and probably about five years ago and i was i was pretty strong about that opinion and in five years ago looking at these mandilian randomization studies a kind of went i cannot hold this position any more what is cortin what is your avised position on elseel if you look at the research h dells important because it is a marker of menabolic health if you have high h del it suggests that you are menabolically quite healthy you very rarely will you have high h ell and high s r p which is inflammatory marker or disregulated bluglucose almost exclusively people who have high h dell will have good bile markers of a menabolic health but if you take drugs that raise h dell it does not reduceurisk cry basker disease in mend in mendillian randomization studies which mendilling ranomization baselly uses natural randomization some people are in the case of h dell naturally hiher secreters or naturally lower secretors of h dell and we talked about how you cannot really do at twenty eur human randomized control trial and when you are trying to examine something heart diseas i mean that is a life time exposure issue it is very unlikely that you are going to pick out differences between treatments ind two yearss or even five years i mean people do not develop typically do not develop heart disease until there in there ukno fifty sixties and seventies womendilling randimization allows is to say o k we have these people who naturally secrete more or less we can stratify those and look at what is their risk if you look at people who are lost cres f htel verses high secretors of ahteel with holding some of the other key variables consistent eldiel you do not see an effect on hart diseas really of eldiel of tel got it ok but when you look at eldiel and you look at the lifetime exposure to eldiel it is a linear effect on heart disease and we we know that it is actually not much eldiel but's mor i aple lip oprotine b but that tends to track with eldiel just in general and if you look at the mechanism when we know that eldiel can penetrate the intithelium a there is the mechanism is present if we look at the epidimiology its supports that it is a an independentrous factor and en again these mandilian ranivization studies where we can kind of look at people's exposure over a lifetime and then we see that line or kind of dose dependent a fact to me that was convincing enough to change my mind on that particular topic and then if you look at some of the frammingham data look at am hi if you stratify hihdel verses lo h del both groups looking at hi eldel and low eldel if you have high hdel lo eldil you will still be lowerous factor than somebody was hihtel and hieoldiel right to the raseo does matter stheracio does by same thing withi with inflammation if you look at people who ar lo inflammation lo eldiel they will have a lowerist then people who are low inflammation hioldiel again that was kind of sufficient for me to change my mind but it is took it was not just one study came out it was lok an then there is another study and then another study and another study and in a certain point i go ok well now i other have to change my mind or i'm basically just got a be cognatively discitat and say no i do not believe all that and and i think that is one of the things to keep in my people we will say al you are your saying this is a bad study very rarely wh i call something a bad study because data is just data but the issue becomes how it is presented and how broadly it is applied ind the mainstre media or by bou people on fittes influencers and what i'll do is try to step in and say ok let us consider expuian z is well and then it is not a bad study but let' jus be careful bout how broadly we imply the interpretation w and i i think you are in a very unique and important position to be able to place things into their proper contect because of this for lack oa better word holistic view of how the psychology plecebo offacts also carfot a quarphysiology relate to one another and on in fact i think that your training as about chomest and then training as a uam in nutrician with somebody who donlayman who was pushing you too focus on outcomes anthing thit is a beautiful am capsr r of the the continuum at which one can look at something because for those af you do not know out there it lot of laboratory studies on mice an humans for instance in the romobile chemistry or in beetro studie you will see a change in some molecule can be quite dramatic and then the assumption is oh yo just take you take the drug that will change that molecule on a particular direction and then you will get the effect you want it that at the whole ororganism level the person will lose weight the prson will gain muscle the animal will i'm not i have alshimers et cetera budy just dozen work that way because of the redone an see and this interplay well great example of that is my research was actually in rodans all my all my studies on proaching metabolism and an loosing in particulars what we are studying well we know if you give loosing increases muscle proting cynthesis but we also know if you supplement with loosing people do not get more muscular i was at as li as long al yot to do a supplement wen losy nigt an i write and how is that possible wher ou kno muscle building is not just protine cynthesis it is also the balance between cynthesis and degradation im an degradation just happens to be very very difficult to measure but a a great example and again hele the cool things won my peagede was ac ual changed the way i ate im which i thing is interesting before i had been a iht eight mill st dat every two hours tod yeels a day yhav when i can onder ati in that thirty grams are proaching you rame that a meno drip going in was the idea right i just have an ivy hooked up of menolascis not really folks not really yebut that that was cone toe concept but the first study i did we basically looked at o k a lot of people had measured the amplitude of protinge cythesis in response to amel we wanted to see how long does this last and where is at peak right and my thought was ok will it a pobby track with plasmaloosing you give for those that are not familiar loosing is the meanal ascid that is almost exclusively responsible for increasing muscle protine sythesis when you eat protine it is it is one of the branch chiminoascis we wanted to stee oce hallons this effect last we we fed these animals a way proting and again i thought oka will have or long plasbelosine stays up that woill be how long i protings of the sistayes up and we got the protings of the sestate aback and it was piqed at ninety minutes are sory piqued from forty five to ninety minutes and then was back dow to basside by hundred eighty minutes and when i went to do the plasbolosing analysis mi shock was at three hours plboloosing was still plateaued out is ok well when i look at the initiation factors that will show me something im for those not familiar am this is part of the imtore signaling pathway one of the two of the targets of imtour when its stimulate loosing stimulates im tour two of the targets of imtor are a approaching compound called fort e b p one and then another one is call ld a ribe is oll pproting as six ka i dont want to get into the specifics about it because it is cont be on the scope but basically when these things are phosphorelated by imtore a it increases a the rate of translition initiation which translation initiation is baselly the proces of the ribazome hooking on to the imar in a and then starting protine sythesis i i was looking at the phospher relation iffore a beupy on and our p as six as i go ka well i'll probably see these things come down it at three hours still plateaud and then it was what is what is goin on heres i kept actually kept rerunning the data and rerunning te data and rerunning the data and i'll never forget i went into layman's office and this is no six months after we have done the study cause hi analysis tix time an tha where are we with this sduration study i hi i just got to run the plasme data again because it is not right and he is well why is it not right and i well just does not make any sense and i kond of went through he is a wol described to me your tecnique how are you doing this i described it in what how is your standard ere i told him what the numbers werey said it sounds its good data he said it sounds you are trying to get the data to fit your conclusion and you need not change your conclusion to fit the data and that statement this is why we do pghts why yet you neon an adviser this is why i'm sceptical of everything because i have had many of my ideas crushed by my own data right we oxy in it up this this am this kind of e fact as this phenomenon is called a muscle protine synthetic refractory period basically once you trigger the system kind of runs for define period of time and then it takes time to es sentially reset for lack of a better term it is also been referred to is the muscle full effect a but i looked at that and said why am i eating every two hours then then there was even a study out of wolf's lab back in ninety nine i think were they infused to me essential munoacids for six hours proting synthesis went up peked at sixty minutes came back down a hund and twenty and never went back up again maybe i'm beng naive but i would have thought that if proting synthesis goes up and then comes back down thay eating more often would be exactly the thing you u'd want to do if your goal was to get increased protine synthesis because you be pinging the system periodically but that but the probem is the plasme nuaciters till elevated it is essentially eating the whole way through right from the perspective of lose on the sells up that was one of those things were i said what i'm mexigon to eat less often because if i'm eating and three hours later i've still got capped out plasma me no acids and we looed at all kinds of stuff we looked at interestsao lu scene just to make sure that thou know that was not falling off it was not we looked at all the plaspha essential meno ac ids because you weere thinking well maybe proting cynthesisis youow sucking somebodies of a munoaces out of the plazma and their dropping and that is causing it to kind a short circuit the system that was not the case it just essentially what the evidence suggest i think wheether only oncs to show this far i'm not raty to say that this is a real effect because i hold out the idea the date artiffacts do exist and you cannot be tolly sure but we saw a an increase in amp kinase kind of around this mark where aproting to the to started falling off we also saw a decrease in interest or eight p and proting cynthesis is an eih t p dependent process and what we think might be happening is you are consuming protine and you are uprt you are increasing muscle protieng cythesis and then it a certain point it is has enough effect on youre you kn energy matabolism in yourselves that a kind of short ar not short circuits it but it kind of cuts it off right againd we are the only once to show that that i'm aware of and that was again in rats i i i i was taught by data those date i'm willing to bet my my tow on my foot on my leg on in my life on i'd probably barely bet the end of my little tow on that one i'm not quite sure but it is interesting none the less for catsoing that is a great example of o k we are looking at this mechanism of imtor signalling and if we just looked at that we would say iwll proating cythesis can to stay elevated for no past three hours but that is not what we saw yet i think it is again that is why i really try o get people to say willets mechanisms are important it is in especially if youre seeing an outcome it is important to identify mechanisms that may explain that but let us thet back from the mechanisms from trying to chase mechanismsmd let us look it chasing outcomes in terms of what we recommend the people excellent point in terms of a chasing outcomes a number of people a knower interested in weight loss or weight maitenance and several times throughout to days conversation we have come back to this issue of a sotiety signals whether not their brain base body base or both yenot wanting to eat more is a great way to maintain or lose weight because you simply do not want to i heard you mention earlier that protine and maybe specific types of protine or sources of protine may provide better sotidy signals than other mackronuw triance could you briefly talk about how mackernu trans including protine but also curb ahidrates and fats in pacts sotiety and from the standpoint of somebody who for instance would to conicl lose a few pounds tright probably would be happy to gain a lebit of lean body mass provided it was you k o particular location on their body that seems to be a a thing now directed hypertrophy if you will and how much theyshould focus on protine as a quar component of creating this diet assuming everything else as being done correctly they ging o hit the right number of caleries relative to their am their output neat et cetera how shlething about proatin i sustiety signals and are animal sources ofproatine indeed wer byo available tricking a word a ind forstake a muscle building but also for sake of somebody who just would to lose body fat they do not wont lose muscle and they to bring their weight down a few pounds lot o things one or more yeet law things to unpack there of the macrnu trean's proaching is deftly the biggest lever that you can pull because even if you kow it does not take a ton approachine to get alout the muscle building benefits i mean to think the benefit is really start to plateau out around one point six grams for kilegram of body weight there is some evidence that may be even up to two point for or two point eigh grahams for kelo may give a little bit more benefit i thinke it probably looks something an asm tope in terms of a curve where ou as you put more into the system you always get a little bit more but it just gets to the point where it is infintessibly small benefit that it is for all intensive purpose is no benefit but you mention one point six grahams approatine porkilegram of body waight is it would you consider that at a threshold that most people should try an achieve daily i think i see very few downsides to hitting that i mean i know some people an thi sugingto get into a supper conversation by nospeople say while i do not want a stimulate emtore because as can make me die early and i think one of the things to keep in mind is if you look at this kind this thought process out there that if your stimulating him tory that proatingeis can make you di early and first off we have very little human outcome day to support that claim and the second thing is if you look at any macronutrian isolation i can make a mechanistic argument that it is can to kill you fat if you take in fat in decreases flomedia dilation flowming that dalation is important for heart health in the short term copydrates stimulate insolent insolent pro in flammatory and all these other things and i can make an argument for any single macronu tre and to be negative prolong gevity i what i really want people this is something that even scientists get wrong they look at an acute response of something and assume that that i's going to relate to long term outcomes in signaling let us yust take exercise for example if i if you didn' know anything abou exercise and i said to you and you i'men to do something that is going to make you your heart rak go up your blood pressure go up youre inflammatory mark res go up your reactive oxygen species increase you are going to say as co damage your muscles you are gong to say i'm not doing that that sounds horrible but it does all those things in the short term but what is the long term effective exercise you actually get hel thear all all those things improve now'm not saying that you kon't proating is a along jevity hack or anything that but what i'm saying is i think some of the arguments out there based on mechanistic this increases intory therefore we do not want to do it i think it is a much more complicated argument than than just that there is that proaching is the biggest lever i would shoot for one point six grams for kilegram if you can do more great there does not sem to be really downsides to it even up to very high levels opprotine a hose antonio to the study ther was a your long randimise control trial im and again it just one year but they were looking at all sorts of different bil markers and masically even up to foregrams for kilegram approtine they could not really find any negative health out comes from it other than people were just satiated they ended up eating less callories a proaching is a big lave lever because one it has a higher thermic effect of food getting lbut more callery burn preday even though it is not ton because t e f is a pretty small percentage of your over all energy expenditure but still benefit you are getting the effects on lean bodymass it is going t if you are in a diets can help preserve lin bodymass if you are at maintnance it is can to help build ar preserve lene bodymasson if you'r in a surplus can help bill apreserveing bodymass then you get the effects an appetite now on to be careful because appetite effects tend to be very specific to individual foods right you can take a high protine food and make it not very a not very sagiating take for example a really tasty proating bar which a when we were getting into this ther no such thing existed a now you have proaching bars i shtake pretty darn good but if yo one of tem i mean are you really satiated i i do not really feel fosatiate afwer my procing bars my premeal snack right right why because i mean it is process to refined and i made to be very palatable ki but take something a two hundred gram chicken breast very satiating right im an ets whimen people say wall carbal hydrates are t very satiating depends on the carba hydrate i mean when you look at them the satidyan decks a plain bake potato is about as satiating as it gets i i eat a bowl of oatmeal i feel pretty good afterward a for a while right i mean at i usually i'll eat that along with some other things but i i i completely agree am the see your saying that the deform that it comes in may beven how much chewing as required how good it smells the r at all hod asl associations as to me a stake is it an incredible meal lik i mean if i had to pick one food that i can eat even i'm not pure carnivor for the rest of my life it would be that because i think it would get me where i nead to go and then i'd prowally have to sneak some fibre but i it is an excellent point i i have a question that i don' want to take us off track but i'dm hoping it relates enough that you can answer it now the context of this if i'm going to eat lets say two grahams i'm prkilegram body weight protine and i'm not eating multible meals porite maybe i'meating two or three mals per day i'm certainly going to be eating more than the thirty graham threshold that was thrown around for a long time that we can only a sim late thirty grams of protine per meal shi just not worry about that some of it is going to go towards the thermic a affect of food as some of that might be convert into glucosts of all things through luconagenesis should i worry about this thirty graham cut off becaue i think balancing that the one point six gram por kilegram body weight threshold with number of meals with the neeu o exercise and work and live my life and sleep at seter up pretty soon you you you run into bottle nexs thor you just cannot do it all on ar youre spending much time trime o folkas o ad altomize all the thang out at the same time you would lose your mind and your body i'm what wha what is necessary in terms of i'm frequence in if one is getting enough protine and then tied into that question is there any reality to this idea that if you eat one meal prerday or your fasting and then you eat a you willit say a two hundred grahams of protne in a single feeding that you can assimilate more because you were are protine starved is that is that a real thing most the studies with protine are after a fast i'm because a to assess it with stablei stope you have to be in a study state i'm we have not observed that it does not appear that fasting really kind of a lows you to a similate more protine after a fast this gets into a corpe of one of the things i looked at my pge t which is does protine distribution matter because most americans get about sixty five to seventy per cent of the protine at dinner i breakfast tend to be pretty minable protne a foods to any culture's actually eat a big breakfast and not a big lunchein dinner i get on o weall honer that tat was ideal will get into circadian timing an men does any one actually do that stake an eggs for breakfast and then taver off the rest of the day i know german culturetons to have a big breakfast but also to to be sugary foods and what not as far as telilogically i'm not i'm actully not sure about that i'm if you look at that and then you consider that protine does not really have a storage mechanism i people ill say well lean tissue is a storage mechanism i that is saying a house is a storage facility for wood oukno ye if your house as mane out of wood you could get wood out of it but that is not whie you build the house ri your building the house out of a demand same thing for muscle tissue i'm there is a free pool of a menal acids but it is very very small when you consider things fat which basically has unlimited storage capacity crob ahydrate a relst of theu large storage capacity you can store me fore five hundrgrams of croahydrate between your liver and muscles and then protine which almost has no storage capac the a the idea that o ca you could make up for low protine at one meal by over consuming another meal did not make sense to me one of the studies we did and again in rats we took a both groups were getting weiy protine high qualty protine they were geting thesactsim int a calories exactsi mount of nitrogen exact same mackros everything was samed only difference was one group basically got kind of three meals of similar amounts of protine dinner was a lullbit bigger because we wanted to keep it somewhat somebon hw people eat but each meal was could be over the threshold a simulate muscle protine synthesis were as the other group i constructed it the first two meals of the day should not stimulate muscle protine cynthesis it should be under that threshold and in the last meal was about seventy percent of ther tol daily protine and we had 'm eat those for eleven weeks and i'll i'll never forget this this is how obsessive i became about it is therewas a hundred ten animals in the study and i made all the diets and i weight out exactly every single meal for every single animal for eleven weeks i was in there at six i m i was in there at noon and owwas in there at six p m got a page destun that fassors dream a gan a dreams tud anso at the end of eleven weeks we looked at lean body mass we looked at body fat we looked at a ahinds limb weights we generally see differences in lean body mass but wht we did see was a difference in hind land weights an was not massive but there was a significant difference in the size of the muscles of the hind lans of these animals and as interesting that there was not a a difference and lean body mass and what we found at least with the liver the animals that were eating a the one meal with really high protine actually had bigger livers a not a huge amount and not something to havecanciterun safe but they it was a statistically significant differencs and to me at least conm trying to explain no difference and lean body mass but at a difference in these hind land weights maybe there is some sequestering of the that that is fueling a little but more approching senthesis of the splainnic tissues rather than causd you'r capping out skella muscle protine synthesis and we do know that the splintnic tissues are more sensitive or have a greater rate of protine cynthes perday the rate of skelea muscle protine ynthesis in humans is about one per cent per day it takes a hundred days to turn over skalla muscle were is your entire got your entire g i will turn itself over in two to three days rights but ver really and the liver also has a very high amount of protine cynthesis which is one o the recens is acting on the most medabolically active organs s o all that to say it has not it is been there is been one human study that showed something similar am and then thre's been a couple others that did not and then then the nerment fasting studies which s maybe a good tool to look at compared to continuous feeding it one thing i will say is at looks the sixteen eight interment in fasting style there is been a couple studies with grant tensley and this is somethng i've changed my mind ont as well grantinsley has done a couple studies where they did used the sixteen eight protocal they had them train during their feeding window and they had them eat i think it was at least three protine containing meals during that seiht hours a humans these occuments and they saw no difference in lean body mass at the end of the study compared to people who were eating you mou kno as many times do they wone throughout the day now if you look at some of the more ah extreme forms of fasting alternate day fasting or twenty two two or twenty four there are some studies where you do start to see difference as an lean body mass my suspicion is and i' i i'm just guessing this is tinuous my suspicion is probably if you are getting two to three high quality protine meals in a day a you are getting the vast majority of the benefits of protine that the most importanthing it is getting enough total ah and then secondarily trying to get at least two or three mals with high quality protine in but if you are going pretty extremelit alternate day fasting or maybe only one meal a day then i think there may be some effects on lean body mass but again thes can be mimitigated as well if you are doing ino hard resistance training typically that is the biggest lever in terms of lean body mass yes protine distribution may make a difference but i'm trying to put in contacts of people on fill i thington to go on eat you four meals o day am but again what i would say is some of the more milder forms of time restricted eating appeare to be fine for lean body mass now that the caviod is the following one or the nice things by animal studies is when you consider if you one to have a high subject number high level of control in a long duration it is pretty much you'r only option right sa i i've a in our research roview a raps i created a then diagram which basically is three am circles crossing over one is study duration one is am level of control and the other one is subject number and to get all three of those circles to cross over it almost hast to be in animals right in this enraps is not it is a news letter or a book itsa it is our monthly research re view gry every month we review five am studies the come out and fitness a nutrition well usey do at least one nutrician one training in one supplement per per month w i will put a link to where thev can sign out this is a a sign out you or mat gran up yove its se script subscription base service basically when people might look it my study we why did you see difference and and muscle waights whereis some of these other studies do not see a difference i waide out every single meal for eleven weeks an keep in mind that eleven weeks in a rodan slife span is a really long time that is about an eighth of their total life span is it that there is no effect or is it that the effect is relatively small and would take a really long time and very high level of control to see in humans i do not know but i think what i would say relatively confidently is if you are going to do a sixteen eight interment and fasting you are probably fine especially and again what is the goal right if you are a body builder looking to be the most massive person you possibly can or you areoe a football player you are some in some feeld that having as much lean body mass as possible is really important for you then i would say weu're not really gaining a whole lot by doing some form of time restricted eating i think most of he people istening to this do not do not fall into that cat right theng must be want to maintain or lose weight they would it perhaps ad a lit of coton cok shape or muscle tos pas vicarias of their body and lose body fat rt and i think you are nomal forms of time restricting in youre pobly perfectly find for that right and again if i do not want soebody to think while i do im alson a day fasting there is no point to be resisted training cause i'm gan to lose muscle mass non nonono no you can still build muscle doing that you just might not build as much muscle as you would if you were eating in a more traditional format but if that is something that works for you in your goals an e specialy if it is fat laws or you no controll your calories then again it is ha it is about the hiarchy of what is important right to answer your question i do think that timing and frequency matters a not much frequency but distribution more im i thing the distribution matters but it is a it is a much smaller lever than just getting enough total proatine in and then as far as animal vers is plant i use to be in the camp of there is no way somebody can buld as much muscle on a plant base dy it and now i think i've come back to you can it just requires a libut more planning im and i do not wat to say always but it is very difficult to do without an isolated source of proating unless you are gong to suppleme with an isolated plant source of proating it is very difficult to get enough without going over on total caleries because you can figure that especialy take somebody yho may be calerically restricted tryining enough proaching from whole intact plant sources you have got a few different thing's workin against you one the sources approaching youre consuming also have croma hydrate and ore fat im too it is a less bie of elbal form of proatine and three it' she lower quality of proacing in terms of it has typically less loocing less branching muoacis unless essential menoacice you answer the question that i almost interrupted you to ask which was does it weil down to the lucine content and a it sounds that is one of the components and that a a lot of the vegan anvegetarian sources of excellent protine am that excellent protine vegetarian a regan source is copackage with calories from arbor hydrates tand or fat that make it heart to stay stay under thwhich i cor threshold whereas a stake is im not an ovisin for people might one who voy that forathical reasons sirbt that is a different matter entirely but a stake or a piece of chicken or an egg is while negouno has a yoke which is there is fat there but is lmost a pure protine fat source there is no carbo hydrate along for the rit i think what i would say is you you can do it take slitle more planning am and you'r almost always if you are a vegan especially you can be better off something with some isolated form of protine a vegan for approacing now this word gets in to people say w one about the limiting amioacids and those sourts of things it is a consideration am some of the better forms of a vegan proacing an terms of a menoacd content are soy now i can everybody hear everybody screaming on line about the testostro nevels in terms of actual outcomes and looking at testostrone there is a recent metanalysis looking at soy and i think if it is your only source of proacine then maybe the dosageis high enough to cause some weird effects a but if you are just using it once or twice a day does not seem tohave an effect on testostronor astrogen that can be a decent source of roahing because it is a complete proacine source ia it does have a peaty cos of one which peticos is basically a a measure af proacing quality based on does it provide enough of all the menoacid that none are limiting and soy is one of the only vegan source that does that interestingly potato proacing isolat actually has a similar essential menacid content to way isolateo protent approacing it is just really hard to find i've bes n no been tryin to e aging in to take no vegetarians take not because a vegan's rather caus way is vegetarian am an waya is very a hi quallty proatings very hi pos proting oracting directing a creating way now out of am i think it is i may mis characterizis but i believe they are able to produce an ow yeast or something that that a be no for vegans now this is a great option because you can have way that is not animal base that is going to be every bit as good as an animal base way i think that is great am getting to the loosing megaback sorry another reason that the using an isolate approacing can be helpful is am because it is more bile of elbow as well once been isolate tout when it is the proating bo med up in the actual plant material it tends to be less bile of eible now cooking can help increase the bow of ell bouty a bi of ell obillitecause it break some of those bonds and and what not but it still seems to be lower and you do not it is really interesting there is a recent study where they did ay a corn wheat and peeblind of protine verses way and basely the outcome was a thirty grams of eac similar stimulated roting synthesis to a similar degree but the plasmome no acids in the a plant base proating still did not get as high as with way now it may be that that is just it does not matter because what she get to a certain level you get all the benefits a bastill found it interesting none the less that did not quite get as high a the other thing to consider with the vegan'sources aproating is the loosing content one of the studis we did was we looked at wheat soy egg and way i sodni trogenist meaning we acquated proating between the groups i sicl work we accrated cwe acquated calories and we looked at muscle proatine synthesis and i think this was the mules were fifteen persent of total energy from protine a your food guide pyramid level of protine aand we saw that in the wheat and soy group a they did not increase muscle proting synthesis but the egg and way group increased muscle proting synthesis now what is really interesting as we went back and we took wheat and added free loosing to it to match the loosine content of way and the proting synthetic response was identical again i i do not to simplify things too much but loosing appears to really be driving this ship and i'll never forget a laman calle me tis office one day and he would always do these thought experiments a he he liked to think about wy something occurs the way it does dangerous dangerous territory yes he would say one day i'll ev friase e lane why do you think the body evolve to just sense loosing for muscle protine synthesis and of course i'm oh i'll no may i just work here just tryin to get my the ae ty a and hy sai we think about it you would want something that really was not exstensively metabolized by the gotten liver because you would want its show up in the blood in values that reflect what you just at make sense and you would wanted to have passive diffusion across the muscle cell because you want to be concentration dependent which it is get into the tissues inselves that need it most right t you kdo not not having active transport but rather passive transport a soei thought that that was really interesting the way broke that down you fyew diffent options for the vigan folks out there you can use an isolated source of of protine and again those can be good options coming because this plant based way s can to be a great otion for folks i'm you can add free loosing to it to whatever your source of proaching is just by supplemented lusing my housing now it taste horrible yei think iv her that maybe have even tried it a's completely non puller does not dissolve in anything is not a capital roast it cannot be put no capisils ye you cound take a capsil for example if youre eating your nomal meal you could just take a capsil of one gram of losine is public to bump you off bump you up enough that you are gong to be good to go m and then there is there is options im blens especially with corn corn is actually very high and loosig as a percentage of its protig they got a remember you go not eat corn on a cob and you are geting two grams of toal proting as not that much loosing but if you isolate out the protineg put into a powder well now when you are getting eighty ninety per cent of the weight is now proting corn is actal about twelve per cent loosing in terms of the proting great sorce of loosing it is almost frank deficient some other meal ascids but you can blend it with a few other source of proaching you coul blend it with a soy aha pe and you can create these complimentary blens they would actally have quite a bit of loosine but also someof heother essential me to lascid there are options out there for plant base folks and may we have seene people who are plant based im you do not built impress of bouts of muscle ers quite a few body bolers or plant based iunderance athlets it and even though im we tale about muscle weeting about muscle building oft and im performance in endurant sports and also just performance for the typical person who is doing some carty of ascular training hookfully some resistance training also and just living life i min many wont people now seems are vegin ar at least of waiting meat in particular red meat i'm not one of those people i limit the amount and i certainly focus on the quality owhat i but i do red meat which brings me to question im about just generally in terms of food choice i can we come up with a relatively short summary at of the following tell me f this is im correct or not that most of us should be focussed on for forsake of health hel span ind life spend im should be focussed on in jesting menimaly non process an minmly process foods you ay be even cooking our own food i realize that is heresy now but idealy we do some ofthat and and really trying to avoid foods that i'm or highly processd and have lots of sugar and amusingnuss as a segway to get into e question that i really want your answer to ive been dying to ask you this which is if a sugar in take is not actually going up im as much as people think it is wire people getting much fatter i what what you think about u'm just a general statement that we should try and eat foods that are lo to no mentimally to not process for about eighty per cent of our foods is that of yes the number it is hard toacts you get you no completely unprocesse food cause almost everything goes through some from a processings inking and onlything in would not survive long im on we o sho for drats ye on a shell thate an apple oter beanners omeo ground oats to me as lonsers in a bunch of other seventheyewould be minimaly process a a stake i's not really process although it is cut off that the animal it sa there is h there is a few steps in there but am thats sort that is what i'm yet nand i think everybody kindy gets the jist ii'm probably will but pedantic when it comes to the stuff o ti is good o on things i apprecie mate appreciate about you is on that i get tease a lot by a people close to me which is the caviats and the insistents on precision is really important becaus especialy when on line a communications these days is a run away train know what will you i's too easy to mis interpret what your say very easy misinterpret and the misinterpretations are often used to leverage whole new ideas about what is not is not true mustt about what is a i really appreciate the new aunts and this is what a long form podcass fraly allows us to do is is catch every every curve i would a hundred prer cent agree with what you said that if you were going to make a broad stroke that trying to fok us some menly process foods is very important the one cavion i would say is i think it is important understand why because otherwise people can make this weard association that if i eat any mintaly or any process food it is going to kill me or every time i eat it it is am smoking a cigarett my health my long jevities declining based on the studies we have it is mostly about the energy that process food just gets people to spontaneously eat more and and a kevenhole showed this and his study that was very he desin some f te most elegant studies in netrition isgray and they basically took people from a menly process food diet and then gave them access to ultra process foods ver very few instruction just eat to you feel satisfied and they spontaneously increase their calory and take my five hundred calorye to day i mean that is that is massive there is soethin we quite haven' quite figured it out youre people walls is it is car its sugar it does not appear to be sugar in terms are just an isolation i weit is fats then't appear to be fats nicelys wost the combination of sugar and fat hartly what is the commination of sugar fat and salt hartly but there is some kind of overall magic to the texture and the mouth feel an just overall palidability of stuff which is always why i say there is right and wrong way to thse different diets for example lik thoe's right way do plantbase and then there is what is in some of thse documentaries where they are eating plantmakes mack and cheese you knowhit aget i love good macka chees but that should not form li that shouldnot be pitched is a healthy diet just because it is plant base right because i mean you are eating a highly process food that is very polable and easy to over eat same thaing for keeto you have now got keeto ice creams and you have got yu know keeto cookies ad all these sorts of things domlike y and if you look at him th exto have more calories than the normal stuff an unlike yet t is is completely missing the point here you are actually just taking yourself the whole point of those diets is the reason you ten to lose weight is originally good luck ten years ago doing a keeto diet eating process food right you just could not do it really now you can but the probm is it is not can to work becauseyour con to be still consuming tumany calories because even though it is keeto what are thy doing hether try to make it more pallable tor try to make a better mouth feel which i gues if you are being keeto for the sake of being keeto great but if there is if you have hopes of body composition modification hat's going to you are really negatively impact yes i think minimizing the amount of process food you con som cannot be important now that being said it depends on the individual and their goals if you are goal is to for example build muscle or maintain a high bodyweight for a sport for example an inougfell offense of linemen or ore something of that nature or if you are i worked with a an enviateen when they were kind of i cannot disclose anything but they were looking at drafhting a certain player i'm and for them process foods may actually be a tool or a teen agers ryn't we all want young people to eat an more healthfully i think it all great habits but some of them their cloric mees are high high that if they were eating what i an ye're going to am dissolve into nout they are just waste away soi i i describe this again with a financial example its a budget right if i make a million dollars year for example i'm is no came for me to buy a hundred thousand oll resports unce assumed at lonesdo not exestd right is no came for me to buy a hundred thousand ollar sports car if i still 'm able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilitis and take care of my responsibilities the things i should do is no ca if i do that if it makes me feel good and it is fun on me yes fine right you fits in your mudget if my if i have if i make fifty grand a year should i be goin out an buying a sports car probably not because i'm not can be able to pay my mortgage and all thse other responsibilites fo your your proaceen you'r fiber you are my cenutrance these youre responsibilities but those become much easier to hit when you havfe higher calories right if you are if you are eating four thousand calories to day for whatever goal you have i'm you are probaly could have some left over and good luck eating four thousand calories from mentally process foods you i quite frankly you will be mis serable because your youeging have such got fill the you areging to fill you cannot even move and again now it becomes o ca was there is something inherent to that food processing is there something that we can pick out we know o c we this is going to be a negative effect on health even body composition stuff aside and i would say there is not really great evidence of that far and a great example of that is sugar i mean i exshe just wrote a really long article on my web side about why i think sugar was not the route cause of the obisinty epidemic and you kind of mention sugar and takin the last when ye rs actaly gone down will but i' al on take well if you look on the whole it might have gone up a little bit but it certain and certainly in the mal sector it is gone way down drinking used to be for there was a five ofclock people drinking all day now peoplere smoking a lot less am there i thing it is a real puzzle i'd left o know what you are am as mokins to that copy in op opposition because nicotins action appetites at us asn't pressend also increases fokass the promise it often arrives in a delivery device that can kill you ye bunketing itself is a powerful agent it also can offset age rally cognive decomp decline not entirely but it is it makes the brain work better i've got a body who a does not caffin and he just takes those nicotine pouches and basic we has one and almost all day because he is a a he has a very trustful job and is a high performer yet i'vv bee careful how you deliver it but is a nobole prize wining nor a scientists that i will chew five or six pieces of niceret an hour which i do not command an but when he quit smoking he just simply coun function as well and he knows the one who pointed me to the literature on offsetting age related cognive decline an nur on maintenance and it is pretty interesting iit is a pretty it is a pretty impressive neutropic the out to be honest am now the first thing it realizes we were time out consumption data this is based on actual production basically there assuming that o c were producing this amount of these food we can assume the consumption that can the fall that it is not a direct measurement a but it has been value o the fou different studies we know the oil consumption has gone up thot tat' that is that is the ot that is one of the the big ones is in this kind of forms the cruks of the the seadoils or vaan the roote of steving on quiain that i an ae e o a come into yor house and kick your dog and puncher mob and all kinds of stuff ah and i'm happy to address those but im calories have still gone up a the dees some people who claim that they have gone they have con o plateaud i think the day does seems to suggest te callory and take is still increasing and nhe nothing to keep in mind is even if it is plateaud it is still a high enough level theto besityis public on the continue to increase up to a point where plo plateau if callories are what about energy ut im leaving aside meat because that sounds highly individual i mean people are the people we know ore focassing on exercise there are a lot of folks t thowi do not exerct and and and energy output has gone down over the ar some inin and it is very obvious when you look at how people work now compared to even thirty forty years ago it is it is much different lessin an talking also i learned recently that i'm gids in high school do not take pe class in may schools pan we had to suit up and run and set up and if you did not bring your change of clothes or you did not wash them in which case you be better off tos not where i nothing the smell of a boy's lockeroom after a week and wo know i as can still remember it and it is not i'm it is not pleasant that you had to run and do your push ups with everybody else are play bollybl in your in your regular schoolday clothes say that i my understanding is that physical education is not part of the the basic education any longer i buy depends on the state but i i know many states have done away with it just ase af budget cuts sor activities going down colerk and take its going up maybe platsoinglame abat toing is that sufficient to explain the be sity epadamic a tasto what i've seen it i i think it is pretty sufficient it might not be that big of a mistery after all no i now they get's a big mystery i think that i'm people do not the concept if energy balance and i think because they insert judgment into it which is oki if you'r gaining wayt over time at a fundamental level it means you are eating you are consuming more energy than your expending people in sert the judgment which is you are lazy you are a sloth your whatever it is and i think there is a lo people ought thet who actaly think that i i ho remember talking to somebody was why would never hire n obeast person for a job because it is just obvious thath the lazy and i justremembered going are youserious there are plenty of very very smart high achieving people who are obees an tike it is not this is what happens when you just put people in buckets people are much more complicated than this yes there is there is some reand personal responsibility but then when you lookthough the data and you take othere is a study done and obe swomen when they found that women who were a beasts were fifty per cent more likely to have had some form of sexual asalt trama in their past right im we know that people from lower income areas are more prone to be obees i'm there is several people who have a higher a score i believe which is kind of measures tramatic childhood events i believe ther there ias a study showing them more likely to be obees there is yes it is an energy in balance problem but just saying eat less move more that is telling broke people will just eare not more money than you spent it is rtechnically right but it is very un helpful right what is more helpful is to descr i and implement the habits and behaviors that will allow them to achieve that right kind of i realized we konding off tracklu of it circling back to sugar stirk a two thousand five i believe that sugar was fattening and bad for your health independent of any other varuable independnt rusfactor and again i will not be very clear about what independent means independent means independent of all o ther variables this thing is bad for your health and a body composition on its own independent of weather r not for instance eating reasis hunger and appetite right or or caloric intake right i was in a graduate school mixor and one of the professors there with somebody who had done research on hyfrictos corn surup and fructos specifically as well and he was talking to another professr and he had done this study in a rotes where youd fed thinkit was sixty or seventy per cent of their callories from fructos and they saw some really weird things happened in the liver with the nova lieagenesis and all thiscetistoff and the other professor is saying to him yet's pretty obvious that hyfrictos corn surup is you kno fattening and this professor who had done this research said ya because it is people read and as i do not you think there is something inherent to it he said now i think it just callories be wereating to many callories he is we we did a proof of consept looking it ye could we try eating om seventy prercentnyour daily callarse from fructos you actully cannot do it hyfrictos corn surp is only fifty five per cent fructos if you aite nothing but hyfric tos corn surp you would still not get to this level that they fed in this study that got me kind of questioning my beliefs about it then i went through and i sant oke let us take out the epotymeology not that epotymiologies useless but people who eat more sugar are also likely eat more calories then i looked for the randobises control trials were they you do not match calories and vary the amount of sugar and it does not seem to make a difference at least from fat loss or fat gain but what about health for insas if somebody om and i know somebody this who eat loves sweets is thin get some exercise not aton but my concern is that a significant fraction of their callories are coming from these sugary foods and therefore they are not getting enough fiber ri pumay be proteine et cetera let us look at epotmiology for a second and i'll address this more directly we look at eptymeology people who eat hireamounts of sugar ten to be mo moro beast they said to have we know worst bylmarkers of health tut peoplewho eat fruit a lot of fruit sugar do not have those same association why is that as fruit has fiber with it right i started to kind of believe they som the data i was looking at that high sugar and take was not the problem per say the problem was that high sugary foods typically are very low an fibre but if you are getting enough fibre is sugar or problem there as a classic study o by surwit in nineteen ninety seven i think it' still the best studies of this day looking at this i know that people say whall was done nighe to night to seven hesto relevants i know if it is a good study it is a good study i somesdays er time wence han if ike they have greanter n go back and undo the discovery of d na cause it was you kno sixty years ago whatever it is they they looked at an eleven hndred calory diets o localry diet one group was eating over a hundred ten grams of sugar a day sucros the other group was eating about ten grams of sugar perday calories protine carbs fats all matched right and they provided all the meals to these participants very tightly controlled and it was over six weeks both groups lost the exacts amountabody fat does not seem amout of for body composition in terms o sugar per set then they also looked at some bilemarkers of health blood lippids and blood sugar and some other things again there was no real differences of the only difference was all the bilemarkis improved in both groups the only real difference was a small difference in eldiel the group eating low sugar had a better improvement slightly in eldil and but that is probably because they were eating ore fibre and we know fiber can you will bind a cluster on lower eldio clustron is now want up i want a caviot this sugar probably does not have any positive health of facts there is that right and and nutrician is an exchange if you are eating one thing you are not eating another thing right i but what i would tell people is focus probably less on sugar focus more on fibre if you are eating thirty forty fifty sixty grams of fibra day but you'r sugars eighty ninety grams i i would not be that worried about it especially if you are controlling calories as well ayou knw what i would be worried about is if you are eating just a decent amount of calories and not gettng anough fibr and in general right and even in studies there is a few metanalosies out now looking at ico energetic exchange of different carbal hydrates with sugar carba hydrates fructos and glucos and sugros now whise is important well again youw if you are not equite when i say ico energetic that means equal in energy equal in calories basically when they exchange either sucros or glucos or fruittos for other forms of carbal hydrate do they see differencs in these smarkers of health eigh b one see a fasting bud glucos nblood lippids and with rare exceptions and i i cannot member all the day to points exactly but the to take home is does not really seem to make a difference now before anybody out there straw man's by argument i am not advocating for sugar consumption but i think it is important for people to not create wheret associations in their minds because one of the things i've observed specilly the fitness industry is when people feel they cannot eat something i it is one thing if you say i am choosing not to eat this just because i'm choosing to but 's a very different thing when you are purposely restricting because you feel something is bad and this this me the human brain is in many ways amazing in many ways really dumb a when you purposely try to restrict something but tends to happen is youre more prone to benge on it people who will try to while i'm never goin to eat you ow sugar again or i'm n o trying limit sugar this isn'n the case for everybody but they have actually show now in studies people who are purposely restricting a specific neutriant they tend to crave bore that neutriat and if they do get exposed to it they are more likely to have what is called a disinibition reflects which is basely abenge response because the thinking goes while this is bad any and there is no context on dosage making the poison this is just bad in general if i have it i've already screwed up i might as well just have as much as i want and i a spencion odulskis comparisonis is no that is you will gettig a flat and go out slashing yourother three tires because you ow you might as well im i really i try to come from that perspective of i've seen many people struggle with may be not and eating disorder but disorder to eating patterns because of these kind of associations they have made in their mind and that is why i'm pedantic and a stickler about say oh ye yes it is a good idea to yel the menally process food and try to avoid process foods but not because process foods are bad persay but what the out come tends to be from a lot of process food consumption which is over consuming calories and then therefore energytoccicity negably contributing to your health yet seems ti get again returns this the a potential for a positive negative or neutral behavior al change and perceptional change of craving of food all the time that you cannot have as is terrible it is a terrible state to begin and a this i think is a perfect sagway for something that first brought us together which o which you is tisnessing about artificial sweeteners and letme just a for the record a be very clear i have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners i throughout graduate school i did not have the best habits ther healthier now than they were beck than but i would drink youw i coker to per day i still have the occasional i cok i'm not completely am a verse to u to drink something that has artificial sweetener u although i do avoid sucrolos for reasons that may be i get into lobit later but a lot of the things i consume contained stevia which is not artificial plant but it is a plant base non coloricslein er locollerk sweetner u and i do not have a problem with thact i becan very interesting artificial sweetners because of the animal data i'm pointing to the idea that they may distrupt the ga microbum and then disrupt the got rom i corbyum as you pointed out as a very broad statement we do not really know the percentres of lacked o basilis at o basilis of whatever basila whatever silis a illis in there om the all seem to end in illis is ideal and in fact a lot of these companies that are having people send in there a stool samples for analysis of the microbyom i mean take note we do not really know what a healthy microbyum looks but we know what an unhealthy microbyum might look and it is one that does not have a lot of diversity in there i was interested in that then there is the recent human study which i we should defflly get in to but i was mostly interesting artificial sweeteners for the reason that there is this food conditioning a fact and you see it in animals ing you see it inhumans that if you injest will coffees are really good example coffee does not actually taste good folks even though i it but when you taste coffee for the first time most people think it is bitter in disgusting most everybody ninety five per cent of people say this does not taste good whyer but people learn to associate the state of being calfinated which most people in order to just feel normal i havings on the few drugs we an just just to feel ourselves enough that soon myself included really look forward to an enjoy a cup of coffee it is it is a powerful example in my opinion of the food conditioning a fact it is a pavylovian things if salivating you crave ri and it did seem that this study from dain a small slab which midly was a small nopon intended study itself not very many subjects show that if you injested artificial sweeteners along with food that contained gluecost that you could sor i mabeven get a heightened gluecosts response just from the artificial sweeteners after a while you and i connected over this study on chometa you pointed out that the if that this design the study was not superb there was there will co coco consumption of gluecost which made it complicate we can go into that but the reason i'm spouting off all this contect is artificial sweetners are many things i'd to talk about their effects on blood sugar in the acue sense and according to what we might injest them with what and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation at the level brain ender a body and then though got microbyum date i think are interesting enough to disgust and i have changed my view on artificial sweeteners based on what you have taught me this is a case where i've completely changed my view which is that now i do not i do not have any problem with th what soever based on the current data which is not to say that i'm gulping down cupfulls of suim but i feel oc in jesting some stevia and some aspertain and i'm not too worried about it i i think con stepping back from a broad view we have to think about again the hiearchy of importance and what are you replacing with there is no situation where it is not a net positive to take somebody who drink sugar sweeten beverages and have them drink an artificially sweeten beverage the in the medanalysis r was licy recent network met analysis looking at atam markers aboutaposity im you h b one see a bunch diffent health markers and when you substitute we will call it non nutritive sweeteners since stevia is not artificial but when you substitute in an s for the sugar sweeten beverages you see improvements and a lot of different things k what was realy intresting about this network met analysis was they also looked at water substitution in place of sugar seeten beverages and the effect was not as powerful as in these are randomize control trials artificial sweet ner containing beverages are more beneficial were were were better for ataposity for improving ataposity and then in e health markers if as kind of a wash water and im water and anon nutritive sweetener beverages performed a similar but theye ware better than sugar seeten meverage's obviously they then based on a network metanalysis is kind of word you can acompare two things that did not get compared directly there is not many studies comparing in an s for sis water directly but if you have a common comparator if you compare ata be and be gets compared to see you can pare atasy based on how they interacted with be buthering it a little bit but that is kind of the crux of a network met analysis they looked at a in an s verses water and found that actually in an s was slightly better for improving ataposity and an s of course be non nutritive sweeener iso now again i'm i if you drinkin water and you you do not want i'm not tryin to convince anybody too do that what that seems to suggest is there is a little bit of an appetite suppressin effect from these artificial sweeteners or non nutritive sweetners now this gets a little more complicated because if these were people drinking sugar sweeten beverages maybe dhev already developed the sweet taste and tryng to go to water is too much of a jump for them and going to having something intermediate is a but better there is a lot wrapped up in this but these are the randomize control trials which are a litt but more tighly controlled which i i tend to default to a little but more than i do the epotymeology which epotymeologies to messy because sure u know not nutritive sweetener consumption may be associated with different things but there is also a whole nother set of life style on habits they are tied up in that i tend to hang my handlilit more on th roun to ask control trals understanding that oquet now all things being equal understanding that this is a tool that may help some people and whenever i post about nondrutes ove sweeteners in the comments there is always one or two or three people who say all i did was cut out soda and i drank dietsot instead no lost fifty pounds i lost seventy five pounds i even have one per salost a undred pounds that is the only thing i did well i mean that' the pretty mass of lever to pull if you considers somebody who might be having i mean five or six coks to day i mean that is we are talking is serious amout a calleries and that also means that by replacing with th artificial sweetener containing beverages they did not replace the soda with food correct let us now let us talk about right this is where we can get into the micronalysis but is that oby's person who lost a hundred pounds by doing that do i really care about may be a small alteration to their begot microbyum now because the're got micro by m is actually much more healthy now by them having lost all that excess outipost tissue again the ranking of what i'm worried about can change depending on the specific situation now let us take something me whose lean am and does notreally have u no any healf promise i'm aware of am what about artificial sweeteners for me well for me i kind of got using them because of body but in contest prep because it was about the only appetites suppresset that worke for me am but do i think that they are health full probably not a do i think the're unhealthy i would say base one the current data i do not think that the're unhealthy now the information on blood lucos there there is some of the problems with some of these men analysies or these these reviews is the cut a lump all the nonnutritive sweetners together and then they may say whele there is no effect on this that aes an effect on this while the probmis is these probably are dirtlies are different molecules than they can interact differently aspertaing very clearly seems to have no effect on blood sugar or insolent a that has been repeatedly shown am stevia does not appear to have much effect sacren and sucrilos that the jury is kind of mixed now there was the study that we first connected on which a i think thei're primer outcome measureas actually they were looking it kind of hf sweet taste how it affected sweet taste what they did was the group that was getting the sucrolos was also pared with multodextron the control group was getting sucros which the is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste because multodestron is not as sweet as sucros when you are trying to combine sucreloshs which is already sweet with another form of croberhirat you would want something less sweet compared to your control but for the outcome measure of a insolent and blood blue cost probably not as appropriate because we know multodestron has a much hiher glysemic index than sucro sit they they appropriately controlled for for taste but not for the effect of the the sweet ners and i think that tha was ia key compon it and i think yet thet the part of that study that intrigued me i'm actually was i'm in a talk version of that because at that study drove me to watch a talk that and well get dan a small one on the poggasa some point hopefully was that they had they had kids do this study and they shad to cease the study because a couple of the kids became predi a bad echameit seem there were solthing hazardous about this is a yale school medicine's good place om ming have you kon thers im arrange everywhere but i it just seem there is something about sweet taste that if taken to the extreme might be able to impact blood sugar to this is impacted am my sort of behaviour in i trying to i try to avoid really sweet things unless there exceptionally delicious or the occasion calls for them because i do think that it increases my craving for sweet things we it might not be necily accraving but it just programes you lut's your taste buds are extremely adaptable take for example im indian food if you bring indian people over to america and have them eats more food they think it taste extremely bland because they are used to such spicy food that unless they have a certain level spiceley hardly even tastid if you ever done a high sodium diet and then gone to a low sodium diet yit feels very bland that is a stalet but your your over time your tastebud to just sweet is the same thing if you are used to eating a lot of sweet im you get kind of decensitize to it and then if you go to something less sweet i ik can kind of i taste bland at first over time it will get better but i think it is one of those things that again it depends on the situation right if somebody is o bes and they said well this is going to help me you do not eliminate sugar sweet en beverage lik why would you wnt to take that tool away from m that is a a great lever to pull i meane of somebody can lose litterally a hundred pounds from just one change in lifestall that is not even really that inconvenient of a change that is that is powerful but again is it the most healthy thing they can do and i think that is kind of what tends to get asked we do not know is it healthy er the water probably not may be as healthy as it who knows now the but i really make all those caviots because you do not want to have people who could use this is a tool think wal th i cannot do this caus it is acchy bad for me right if it helps you lose fifty pounds or seventy five pounds or whatever it is it trust me its not bad for you right what does hem to increasin atiny signals woatd you think about the microbium effects in this rencent study is the recent study i think had some nice features to it and you have done a detailed am description of the studiyes sor for those that ans it ask is this two weeks study were thes yo ting study ye and weill provideed link you did an excellent viteo on this on your yeu two channel that really parses each beese but they compared the various artificial seeteners and looked at the glucos response looked at microbyum a number different measures what was your general iand this was in humans for the for i think for the first time looking at microbyum in humans you darificial sweetener there is it is there are few studies on the microbyum in humans with artificial sweetnrs the first two that came out showed pretty much no effect a but they were lo a shorter n duration they two to four weeks and again at dependsi what what macteriar getting measured right thes many different kinds of macteria they could just be measuring one that did not change and then there was a ten week study that came out the they got a lot o press a and they showed i think it was suquelos i think they showed an effect of change on the got microbyum now what was interesting us when i went into the species that change the the species that change the most compared the control was a species called am a butcher the tam but looks bloudy a cocoitus i think it is i i must say for those that work on the microbyum it is it is difficult to fer nounce an you needna nominclatur committee and you need acronamse saono already your killing us o bese that anl easy thank you work in a start the nomen glacer committi t you do not do it soon they they notice that this went ut by three to fourefold i i kind of went down the rabbit hole on this interestingly that particular species f bacterias actually associated with lower ataposity better insolent sensitivity and people who are o bes in children who ill bes ten t have less of it i said well bast on that study you caln actually argue that may be sucrelos actually improve that got microbyum now get i'm not making that claim because we have a hard time understanding what a healthy microbium looks already what this last study that came out my my biggest take home was i think it safe to say that some of these non nutritive sweetners are not metabolically inert that there there are some effects now are those effects good bad or neutral i think has yet to be f ully elust stated now the the i focassed more on the blood glucos responsis in my analysis in that ten week study they looked at a they did not worl glucos tolerantes tess and there conclusion i did not really feel fit their data to the conclusion was that and i again i think it was sucualos that it elevated a blood lucos in this is where statistics can get cut a tricky mi take home was the aria under the curve the incremental area under the curve which is looking at the basically the entire glucos response was not different betwen the control and the sucuelos croup to me that is the biggest take home there was one time point at the eind of the study in the suculos croup the thirty menute time point that was statistically significantly higher blood lucos thand the control group it is kind of one of those things where igo cam was at one time point it is thististically significant but even then we have seen things be statistially significant that in at being date artofactcas are not reproduced not saying that is what is happening here but again the overall ary under the curve was not different to me that was the biggest take home and papers that we should a pramention are published because of effacts generally not lack of effect hardered upon o hypothesis does it it it is actuly really unfortunate becaus a nol hypothesis is just as useful data as the the noninal hypothesis but youre right there is a very strong publication by us towards a showing in affact i verst is not unless you can flip a field on its head entirely by showing something did not happen am typically the posiive result out does the negative result in posive meing you see a result am and then of course it is one study and yes and i think that as you talked about earlier the centr of mass of data in a given feld are probably the best basis for what we should do rit in terms of and i'm not changing my behavior around the intake of artificial sweetners i personally still going to consume stevia and aspertain in relatively small amounts i but am now i'm thinking wil cave something contain sucelos i do not have to perhaps actively avoid it whereas before i was i was actively avoiding it the the the new study i thought was very elegantly toes it very involved i mean be quite frank some of the animal stuff they did was extremely impressive there was extric two arms the study one was a human arm al was the animorm i i focess much more on the human side of it am basically this was a two week study and the really unique aspect of this which i think is both the strength and a weakness they had almost fourteen hundred people a apply for this study and t ey only had a hundred and twenty i think that actually went into it because they did a very detailed food analysis of these folks all these people said that they avoided artificial sweeteners where did not consume them and i think people realize how you biquitous sweeteners are prior to the study these people were it was jury selection they would never yes si not ever hearing of that the plaintive in the defendin these ight s are these mutent people who have never had an artificial sweetener right the strength is now you do not have a lot of pre existing effects that may be clouding what would actally happen when you add tin for example if you have people were already consuming artificial sweetners and then you have em consume artificial sweeteners the likelihood things are gong to change is pretty low right i think that that is a strength it is also a weatness and on be really careful because i think people took my words o litt too far which means i probably din do a good job of being new lost enough there is the possibility for a plocibo effect ure to me if somebody has gone through that much painstaking care to avoid artificial sweetners it is likely they have a preconceived notion that those ware bad for you to because they are difficult to avoid a yes it is possible for eading very minably process diht that theyr just not exposed to the then that is very trueths well ah but the other thing that the researchers acknowledged was they were not able to blind the study because if you have never had an artificial sweeter before your only usetice lik regular sugar and you have an arificial sweetener you taste i it is still sweet but as out the same sweet and there is an interesting effect there were a lot of people do not the taste of aspertain the first time thi chan quit drinking died sota for a while thinking i should and then had one it tasted really i can only described as kind of artificial cammie and then pretty soon tasted great again and there is some attenuation there and whether not thats central meaning within the brain or prifero i do not know but very interesting why i see you as a playing a critical role in defining what is in what is in what still needs to be determine am in terms of this landscape an and the entire landscape really of nutrition when in that study did change my opinion in terms of oca i i think we can clearly say now the these are these are not neutral urstright that they are not in ert right that that was the thught process before was wellthey are not digested or r whant not that they must be an ert that does not appear to be the case am but again lik we look at the the blod luco state a there is and i'm not saying this is what happened i won to be very clear not saying this is what happened i'm saying it is possible this happened and this is why we need more studies to verify if these people had a preconceived notion that artific sweeteners were bad for them it is possible knowing their injesting artificial sweeteners the they could have had a a blood lucos respots now then my push back on my own point there would be then we should have expected to see it in all the ar and all the nonatures of sweetners which they did not it was just in sucolos and sacron it was kind of a graindi effact where sagrois an sacron showed the most dramatic change yet a and stevia and a few of the others did not and the o the other issue i took with it maybe its a ticky tack thing was they are primary outcome measure was a blood glucos o the or glucos tolerate's test but they had people ad minister their own or glucos toleratestst which basely they gave em they said okey drink to drink and theywre were not continuous glucos maders which shouldnv been find am but again to me and m on being ticky taky and again i know all studies are limited by funding i think over all this was a great study but i would have liked to seen them a moniter the the a or glucofs tolerate's test at dod miister an were after aw you want to know that they did not injest this sert id in yia yethose those two things but the other one of the caviot is it was a two week study right's we got be really careful how much we interpreted this because it is also possible ha this is a trancing effect right and maybe it goes away over time we do not know but again i think it is we can clearly say it is not inert right now how much emphasis we put on that on a two week study i'm i still will say o ke maybe if youre worried do not consume surclos right but if youre hundred pounds over weight and you wanted use some sucilos as a replacement to help you lose weight i would say do not let this study detur you from doing that because the net effect to sti to be more positive thend you not losing the weight right f it is tool at helps you fine but i do hold open the idea that well there could be negative effects from it as well but again we are were looking it what is the what is the over all outcome right and then when i looked at am they examined some of the a different things that were increased with these different a sweetners and again this work it is messy because one of things they saw was a big increase in buterate production from the change in they got macrobyum porsualy well as we discussed early buterates asier associated with positive outcomes ind turms of insolent sensitivity an flammation and some other things i just i wonto be real cautious before people say whele there is a change the macrobiumit must be a bad change we do not know it is possible and again if we have you knont ten more studies come out and start to show this than i will start to shift my personal opinion of artificial sweetners in anticipation of sitting down today i did solicit a for questions on social media and one of the questions that got a lot of upvotes i likes if if you will was it one that i think raises interesting questions about short turman long turn health and it is the following ithink it is a commencenario a number o people want to know what is the healthiest way to approach a kind of rapid weight loss and hear what i think is happening is somebody has an event coming up or they are just tired of being the weight they are carrying the amount of autopost issue they are and they wanted to know whether or not it is safe to for instance lose three pounds a week for a few weeks in anticipation of a wedding or some other event and whether or not straight cleric restriction and increasing activity a is the best way to approach that a with the understanding that they may gain back a little afterwards they might make think ideally they would to maintain it afterwards but what d you think of that sort of approach ayou know cutting clerk in takin half for instance and then doubling and also doubling your physical output it is interesting because the you might be surprised by whone on to say which is the researchad actu tends to suggest the people who are o bees who lose a lot more weight early are more likely to keep it off which seems the little but cono contradictory right well that does not seem very sustainable but again your your weighing competing things there sustain a builidy aspect with then is also buy in is huge for sustainability right for a lot of oerit or beast people if they start a dit they do not see something quickly they cunt af bail on it because it it is not working whereas that they see some rapid results pretty quickly they buy an even harder right and i think that the conversation especially for if there is any coaches or trainers out there is just presenting that as the dnofor my fevrite lines as there are no solutions or sonly trade offs i think thomas soul that you are your having a trade off here im it is yes you are rittl lose fat faster you might lose lean massle but faster too which can be a problem but i will say the more at a post tissue you have the more aggressively you can diet without negative consequences somebody me doing a relagressive diet is not going to be good fom my lean mass one i've a highelyn mass the normal to i've a lower body fat the normal as youre body fat goes down the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up i'm people who are very obees because they have much out opost tissue to pull from there is very little reason for the body to catabolize lean tissue now that being said if you go on a people misinterpret they wel a in bodyed on and were a decks a done and i've lost two pounds of lean mass and they have eknow they have lost twenty pounds over all wo cue mine out opost tissue itself is thrteen per cent lean mass there is actually u no proateen componet to the structural compone of the outipost tissue and it does have some water it is about eighty seven per cent lipid but the other part is lean at min of em you should expect a thirteen per cent production and lean mass when you diet and then when you consider you lose body water over all which is registers is lean mass i'm and you lose a your splaintic tissues can shrink a little bit it is normal to lose for the average person to lose twenty five or thirty per cent of the weight that they lose from lean mass but that does not mean skellidle mussel tissue and again that the more outopost you have the more agressively you can approach the diet without really negative long term consequences to lean masser over all health but balance that with o cay if im when to do this i need to understand that i'm not going to be dieting this way forever i'm doing this to give myself a boose o the beginning and i have to be oce at some point with transisionin to something the syllable more sustainable bay somewhat you just said it minds me of the a satiety signal effect of exercise you mention earlier that exercising can improve a our sense of when we have had enough to eat i just want it briefly mention that when ally crum was on the potcas she mention that they have been doing a study that i i i have to pair you to and have i hear the conversation as a fly on the wall because when she was telling me was that if people believe that of food is nutricious for them then eating less of it a register says more satiating whereas if people view dieting as a deprovation system olo oh deting as hard in the food soks and it is terrible well then they crave all sorts of other things whereas they can they actually observe in their studies where people report reduced craving if they are told for incance a chicken breast and rockley and some all of oil and rice is actually quite nourishing it isthat you really good for you then people eat that and they feel thay tee actually eaten more this atidy signalling goes out it is just not just a point that ally mad o tos are not mi te diety is impressive because even the rate at which you eat and riht down to the size of the plate and the color of the plate the contrast an color really they they see i cannot remember exacty i think it is if the plate is a similar color to the food i i think people eat more whereas if it is a bigger contrast they eat less even plate color can make a difference on how much eat again human brain very amazing but also very dumb in some ways right i t an optimized algar ithe i always ialways joke wof people just look t how stupid humans are you put some water in front of the you though the ocean the o i'll pay ten times more for this et li but it is jis wer kind of ire that way the the reward signaling pathways in the brain run one chemical mainly dopemin ther are others of course but and very few algarithms its sort of a intermittent reenforcement is on random reinforce but in the end that there are not many algarithms and we we are probably not optim i certainly not otimized for our own health because people will eat themselves to death drug themselves to death et cetera simply because something felt a good at one point whe it is it proves your point one things i tell people i i said the sono and if for sola's podcast was interestingly the diconomy of life is if you do what is easy in the short term your life will be hard if you do what is hard in the short term your life will get easier it is very strange and actually eten suplyt had a great example of this when he was over five hundred pounds he said the amount of work i had to do to construct my life that i could just live was much more work then just going to the gim for a couple hours a day he is the gim work is hard he is i look back how much work i had to do to sustain that life sol first is just going to the gim and be to restricting calories he is to maintain the life styl of being five hunder palence was infinitely more difficult than what i do now and ige gen great example short term hard going to the gim callory restriction long term life'seasier just really interesting diconomy i think about lin and i cannot be restated often enough seed oils people want to ask con seed ols and for at and f and for those of you that are listening who are wondering wyware werds for a chuckling already i shal mention that both in the twitter sphere and in seram and on line that there is there these very polarized views that probably are not worth focassing on for too long but there are a number of a folks out there were arguing that seed oils are the source of all hour the'besity epidamic a e inflammation et cetera luminim everything and then there are those that would argue just the opposite that meat is the source of all problems et cetera and i think we have thanks to your new aunts and and expert easy we a hoefully appropriately frame things that it is never that black and white it is simply not ordeally rarely i love olive oil i no i realize that does not fit exactly into the seed oil category i love alof oil i use it in moderation i do also consume some butter in moderation im et cetera but are there any dada on seed oils and here i good example i think would be conola oil which comes from the rape seed that literally was renamed conol oil because rape seed oil is not good marketing leno now exactly am the first thing i'll say is seadolls have have negatively contributed to our overa health because people in the last me no twenty thirty years what they have tend to added to add into their diet that has increased the overall calory load is oil a these various a unmostly frumseet oils but when we look at one to one replacement with other fats and i if you look at the epodemeology yet you can find sanepedymeology showing people who consume more seatol have more negative healthout comes problem is again tied up with multitude of other behaviors and then you can find mechanisms and the the idea is well these have there polly on saturated which means in the fatyacid chain there is multiple double bonds which those double bonds can be oxidized a when the're exposed to heat and some other things and the idea s well when you cook with these things and they get di they get a ox they make at oxidized and ascon acause inflammation your body that is a a plausible mechanism as always i defer to the human randomized control trials and what you tend to find is when you substitute pollyon saturated fats er when you substute saturated fats for pollyon satrated fats it is eitheir neutral or positive and terms of the effects on a inflammation is basically neutral there there is some studies that show a positive effact of doing a pollyon saturated fats but it probably depends on the individual polyon saturated fat andthat is h no thing i i do not believe is difficult because your you are categrizing everything in this one bucket and there are some differences between individual fatyacids even with saturated fat a for example a steric acid does not tend to raise eldiol collesterall whereas seeno saturated fat as a whole tends to raise th eldial cllusterall but there are some saturated fats that do not again it is it is were putting things in buckets and its sivile more new ots than that then if you look at a the effects of a no pllyon saturated fats on markers of corly of ascular disease again tends to either be a neutral or positive offact when you substitute asaturated fat for plyon saturated fat now if you want to get its monoon saturated for pollyon saturated there is some there is quite a bit disagreement between the studies what i would say base on the human ranmize control trials is that your probably better off consuming monoon saturated n polyon saturated in place of saturated fat but again if the idea is well that means polly's un saturate are good for me i'm just going to douple bunch oil on everything and now you are up in your cal rays well tat's that that is a negative now right because you have to do wit the bigger problem of over all energy taxicity i'm not somebody who likes to demonize individual neutriance i just have not seen really compelling evidence that seedoils are the route cause of the proms atare being suggested and i think this is a good example of kind of whenever there is a something thot pops up in the fitest industry there is always the opposite thing that pops up and is the reactionary extreme reaction to whatever this thing was over here an i thenk thits over seeing with some of the the seedoil stoff is its it is mostly people who are trying to con dispose the virtues of saturated fat and listen i think it is fine to consume sume saturated fat but again i think limiting it to seven to ten per cent of your daily calory and take us probably wise again base on them the all the consensis of the evidence i've seem and once again wwere struggling with this can we have got the sepetymeology in thse mechanisms that sound good but then what acty happens when we we do some human randomize control trials and and far i just have it seem the evidence to suggest that seedoils are independently bad for you independent the callories they contain you said the words over all energy toicity and i just on a highlight that i think thats a fabulous term i do not ut i do not think enough people think about that because they they are primed or we are all prime to think of case seedoils might be bad or artificial sweetners might be bad or this particular component of blood work might represent something good or bad without taking into account over all energy toxicity of the toxicity of over consuming callories energy and a thank you for a pointing out that most of the date a point to the fact that saturated fat should make up about no more than seven o ten per cent of total daily clori can take is there a lower an threshold that can be problematic a for instance i've noticed that my blood profiles especially in terms of formones improve when i'm getting sufficient saturated fat maybe i'm a mutin but years ago because i'm a product of growing up in the nineyeas i try to low fat died i its certainly crushed my andrgen levels i start adding some butter back in and i was right back in the in the in the sweet zone i where i wanted to be i u a seven or ten per cent of tolly a daily clor can take as i'm guessing is probably about what i do now i'll have to check but is there danger to going too low in satrated fats again no slutions only trade off's right what maximise is out testostrone might not be the best thing for longgevity right in advice aversa i'm not i'm not making that claim specifically by then etsimportant understand this that i think we all have this idea that this is one i conic diet out there that is going to be the best iet for building muscle and burning fat and a preventing cancer an heart diseasan and the reality is there is over all healthy dietary patterns that we see there are good for those things but we get down into the weeds there is probably some pushan pull here as well right when it comes to saturated fat am there is some evidence that if you are too low on it t yes you can have a reduction and testostrone now is that reduction in testostrom let us say fifteen twenty per cent whatever it may be is tht sufficient actualy cause loss of lean mass that we do not know that is that is never been shown interestingly a ijust remember this there was one study that was comparing am pollyon saturated fat versis saturated fat a and they equated total fat and one of the really interesting things was the group geing the plaan saturated fat had more lean mass at the end of the study compared to the group getting saturated fat now's only one study i've never seen this replicated i i'm very this is the situationar i i say i would to find out what the mechanism of that is because this could just be random am but if that gets shown over and over what i might say is o k well what is the what are we if pollyon saturateds are somehow increasing lean mass compared to saturated fat who cares what ipens with testostrone i'm less that reduction testostro is causing some kind of impudent e impotence for your life right am all that is say i do not really know and a by the way that something a for those watching and listening a real experts every once all you shoud hear them say the following words i do not know i atyour adviser was exceptional that anus and she was brilliant i a and then in terms of a colustral synthesis you really need a very very small amount of sturated fat for eldol clostrall said the sissur your liver can synthesize the amount af eldal coluster all or collusteral that your body requires is small in terms of just living and being healthy i do not think you at need to worry about that and from a card of astua tos ease standpoint there is some evidence that even taking people who have cuotonco locol lo eldiol of no eighty or ninety and taking them down to thirty or forty that there is still a a a benefit for the risk of crot vascer disease again you'r your waging nees these two buckets right that i say you no for do in seventyten per cent from from saturated fat you are probably fin received a lot of questions about whether or not there are female specific die an exercise protocalls and irealizes is a vast landscape but i'm some of those questions related to manopaus and premen apausit and some related to the menstrual cycle most related to variations across the menstrual cycle in terms of am let us you say diet a maintenance or subchloric diet are there any hins that you have observed and we will talk a abit later about am the this wonderful ap that you have producehis caught carbon ap which helps people a manage their energy and take and a number of other things a mense o there you have a sort of dat a bace or at least unexperience pace and then i'm guessing ther probably also studies exploring male verses female differences in terms of adherence in what sorts of diets work as it are there any general themes that one can extrat from that this can be really unpopular sigment for the women am does not em to make a big difference taly they may be relieved to hear that aus it make sorting through the information space and certainly the information we have covered in this potgas up til now simpler it means that everything is not different for them n if you look at the male verses female studies relation to diet they seem to respond to some similar way a somear colerd calry deficit seems to produce similar results am if you do low car high car regardless it seems to boil down to the same principles now training wise we do know that female the muscle fibrs adapt a little bit differently to training but it without getting too far to the weeds it does not really change the way you should train am because for the most part building muscle there is a lot of dfferent wayst to build muscle we know that light loads up to may be thirty raps as long as it is taken close to failure have basically the same effect on building muscle least in the short term as heavy loads for low raps it is mostly about taking the muscle close to fatigue or failure you will have to go ou'd hove to go too failure but getting close within a few raps am if you are between one rap in thirty raps ifyou aregetting close to failure seem to produce similar results a geiin great you can pick with whichever form of discomfort you you prefer right am when it comes to female specific training again females actually this is one thing the lik do not know they actly put on a similar amount of lean mass as a persentage of their starting lean mass as men in fact there is no statistically significant difference and the amount of lean mass they put on now the absolute amount of lean mass that is added will be greater for men because they started with a geater amount of lean mass but the relative increase in lean mass is pretty much the same from similar training now afemales that there is some differencesn fibra types that females ten to be a libut less fatigable than then men they can they can go a but harlib longer and there is also some evidence that they recovera but better but that also could be simply to to the fact that they are not able to use as heavy of loads to i to induce hypertrophe i kind to have this theory that wile as a percentagyour wonder at maxs you can program things i think absolute load matters when you look at the most illete power lifters the superheavy weights are not squatting three or four times a week because theire squatting eight nine hundred pounds i think that there is an over all recovery of fact there i gan i've no dato to back this up this is just my my observation but when you get into the lighter weight classes and this goes for men too you do see quite a few people who do many training sessions at high arpse and seem to be able to recover from that i do think the absolute load makes a difference now when it comes to minstrual cycle this is one of those things were i kind it tell people do what you prefer there is some people have said you should programe yo should kind of scudge your training around your minstrual cycle which is a whenever you are going throug minstrual cycle reduce the intensity reduce the volume because you are you are notk on a feel as good youd no c train as well what i would say is just ought to regulate that if you go in and you are on your period but you you feel good and you are doing well that day than i do not think you neselling you to back it off and there there was one study the kind of supported that notion but if you go and you feel terrible and you feel you could use a reduction and intensity in volume than it is tolly fine to out o regulate that when i say ought to regulation i'm oughto regulation means you are regulating the individual training session base on your performance a i ought to regulate in far as i'm i'm i'm a supernerted i have a a velocity tovice i can actually attached to the bar and see how fast the load moves and i know it various different warm up weights what velocities i should be hitting if i hit my last warm up and my velocities about ten percent higher than usual a i can be pretty confident that that is can be good day for me if it is lower that i can back at off a little bit in fact that worlds i hit my last deadlift it was thirty per cent my last my last delith warm up it was thirty per cent faster than i usually hid in the gim an i turn to look tot my coach i said the i were goin to get this to day i do nothere is various forms of wast ouht to regulate but again women if you are on your period but you feel good i do not thin theres any reason you you to back off but if you are ot feeling good than it is tolly appropriate tobacco rabver says cookfoods people wanted to know a whether not for instance eyou know yout ay may raw apple overs i don'oos any one cook apples i git is tat an people eas to bake at ever bake dapples was e desertn when i was agan it was count of the let down desert sar now nelike not assom unless it at a scup of iscree minite rayvean tey may me not awso but anyway rovers is cooked am obviously if you burn a piece of meat to the point where it is pure charcoal that is too much in if you there is a small movement a surrounding eating raw meats that is not something i particularly enjoy frankly sushe is the only raw food i i personally en jest an absem i am very careful about the source frankly a reputable places a is there anything you kow real about this in terms of being able to extract the menoacids by demens an minerals from the food a robbers's cooked it just looks cool for instagram a when you cook foods the aciton to become in terms a proating containing foods they tend to become more digestible not less a eggs are this way meats to this way a people well you knowl what you when you heat protine you do nature it and i think they hear that word to nature and they think destroy and that is not what tou nature means protines fold up in to three dee dimentional structures this of course a basin there ou menoacid sequents and their specific energies of those o melascids am when you heat protine or ad acid it starts to unfold that a that proting structure that happens during digestion anyway ilways chuckle whun the hi've seen some companies come out with way that you can cook with right that that is nockin to you kno destroy they mulacids im you mean regular way right a yat cooki typically cooking acti makes a menoacids more bile available not less now am i would stay away from charring your meat a because there is some evidence that charring creates apolliermatic hydro carbons which aat least in animals when they give those a they appear to be carsonagetic if you do charing me by accident i would just cut off the charred portions am and then you should be fine the chatter is delicious a ha ha not not of its charge too much but there is something about a charred cross on o me my dad's argentine i a goud a ary i a what about a people referred to them in their questions as carbot blockers but i thing what theye referring toer things berberine and some of the glueco scavengers and am one glueco scavanger id left fr you to comment on is this assertion that taking a brisk walk after a meal or maybe even a slow walk after a meal some movement can help am down shift the amount of circulating gluecos in some way i've heard that am not a lot of people but some are starting to pay attention to this idea of taking things berberine or even mat forman am can scavange gluecoas i personally cannot take berbery if i take it i get massive headaces unless i've ingested hons of sugar in carbohydrates sijust do not massuround with it but i i know ther re number if people out there that want to know whether not these glueco savengers can be useful i think that is really majory in the miners of my being honest amas far as lhike the car blockers was some white kidty being extract and thos sorts of things they can tam they do block the digestion of carba hydrate some when i say block that is those watching were listening a matabolism is typically not on an offswitches o case n wesin when we say things block or a tenueight or inhibit typically were we are not talking about just a switch on the wall that you press it and everything turns off were talkn about a dimmer switch no ci you it just changes the emphasis a but these car blockers can reduce the absorption of carbal hydrate now they do not seem to cause weight loss it when when you just do it a normal dight now why is that well all it does is once those carbal hydrates get to the a large an testin and your bacterio get a hold of hem they start permitting em to volatolfatiacids which could reabsorb into your liver soyou do not get the increase in bluglucost but you still get almost all the callories from it because it just in a different form itw if car blockers if they actually worked really well i mean if you block something from being absorbed your g i typically does not just let undigested material sittin there you get diarrhoea i mean that would be the outcome it is also how i debunk the whole thirtygrams approaching at a meal you can absorb any more than that i'm if that was the case the when you ate a stake you would just start having diarhoea every time you went over that thirtygram threshold right i remember during college sos to be early nineties there was the olastra craze weas idea of putting in nondigestible a thing in two things partato chips that it would i'm clear through a that the g i tract faster not absorb as many galleries it does raise this went nowhere obviously you do not her about this any more but it does rais an interesting question relate to energy balance which is gastric emptying time im an obviously in in the landscape of eating disorders in particular anerac ya abusive lack use in abusib a laxitives is a way in which people will in an unhealthy waiy a trying control their waig there is a lot of prolmise with that a approach but im what about gastrict emptying time is this one way that people could control thei're energy balance in a healthy way an where does fibra come into play a fibr tins to improve gi trans at time because it adds bulk youre your g i system is basically to and it has paristalsis which is wave contractions that moves the food down to the to well if you have more bulked the food with fibr you can move it through a littlit better now in the gastrict the stomach specifically fibr tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit im probable cause it congeals a little bit im now this kind of gets into the glisemic index argument right if you do o if you do lo g i foods you will have a slower release of glue cose am it is a slower gastric emptying time does that affect energy balance and there are quite a few studies looking at log iversas hyg i foods am in the studies where they do not control calories lo g i tens to out perform hyg i but when they control calories there is no difference and s wit that tends to swhat i think that suggests is log i food just by their nature tend to be hirer in fibre and i think it it just cini comes back to the fibr issue got it i to ask you about supplements for a moment it is an enormous landscape but i believe there are a few things that you believe in meaning they exist and and there are decent data tos support their use maybe even some anic dotal data based on your own experience as long as we highlighted as such could be interesting i've heard you talk about to in particular a one that i'm very familiar with wich us creating mono hydrate youd share your thoughts on that not just for muscel building but maybe any other purposes for it am and tthe other one is one that i'm frankly 'm learning more about all the time now thanks to your prompt which is redolia rosai think i pronounce that correctly and and why that might be interesting or of use to people yes touching on creatin it is the most tested safe and effective sport supplement we have i mean it just there are thousands of studies on creaton mona hydrate now and i i would i would say very clearly too am if you using any other form of creatan i think your wasting your money am creatiin hydra chloride has some am hipe around id it is apparently sittle more soluble am the claim is that you need less am but there is only couple studies on it and it is more expensive it iy mono hydrate is not particularly expense no is be bly therin budgets but it is not it does not land it is not a gagion brake yet it is gotten more expensive because of covin supply chane issues even the there is forms af creating that appear to be as good hydra chloride but it is more expensive and in things lik creat an ethel ester has been shown to be worse than creaton mona hydrate a bufferd creatan is as good or worse and it is much more expensive i tell people just take creaton mona hydrate it is tried in true it is been shown to saturate the mussel cells one hundred per cent with phossel creaton and that is what you want creatan i works ther free diffrent methenologies one through increasing fosspil creates in content which hulps im prove exercise performance am it also appears to reprove in cover it appears to improve recovery and it creasees lean mass a lot of which is through bringing water into the mussel cells but that is mean mussel cells are mostly water when peoples o wach this water that is what mussel cells mostly are a and a it also in creases strength and s ome other metrics now it also has been show in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage now that is probably because they aregetting in increase in lean mass and the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage but there are a few studies to show at decrease in fat mass as well i only the creatans af fat burner i think that people are able to train harder build more lean tissue and that is probably having an effect on fat mass then the factually shown more recently some cogulive benefits to creatum which i find really interesting as well but the only knock on creaton that anybody's been able to come up because they at they have debunk the kidney stuff they have dbunk the liver studed it there is no evidence tha the harm helthy couldn' cidneyor liver a is hair loss what abyut hairloss cause there was one study in two thousand nine that showed that creates an increase d h tigue a but they did not really show an effect on any other sex formon it is kind of strange you would think if there is an increase in d h t there would be something else that changes as well a and it is only one study and again did not directly measure hair loss measure d h t which we know as involved in the loss of the folocu the folical what i would say is that i am not convinced it is only one study never been replicated to my knowledge and it was looking in a mechanism rather than an outcome ah if you if you are somebody whose prone tair loss and you want avoid creatine because of that i understand but for most people y i do not think it is a i do not thik it something to worry about you ememphasizea the classic loading of creatine taking in a bunch of times perday and then backing off or just taking at consistently at the i think fivegrams perday is con a typical a dose that people take again no solutions only trade offs am you can load it and you wwill saturate your falsphor creating phosphi creats an stores faster usualy within a week a if you just take phiogramhs per day it will take two three four weeks ah but you will get to the same place and youre probably gon have a much lower risk of g i issues some people it creatin can be a got irritant a if it is for some folks i recommend splitting it into multiple doses may be multiple to one or two gramdoses per day and definly do not load it if you are somebody who has gue i issues from it as far as a roal rosaa the research is stole its infacy i was just reading a a new systematic review that kind of concluded that we need more high quality research but the research that is out there seems to suggest that not only does it reduce physical fatigue but also reduces the perception of fatigue and may also enhance a memory an cognition as well and it is referred to as an adaptegen i i really it am my anecdotal experience is when i combind that with cafine it tends to kind of smooth out the effects of caffine it is a more pleasant ex perience and there is also some evidence that if you were coming off kaffine that it can reduce the ah the negative side effects to kaffing withdrawl which by the way i i didnt really believe in that until i actually did a cold turkey a cassle before meat i will cut out kaffine for seven days because you can basically reset your affine tolerance in seven days and two days and i mean i'm groggy i've got the head aches usually i'll get body aches that come up because kaffine is acftuay a mild analgesic am and yas sos very interesting tos it by slope a baby i'll tell you that i tn na o ga gaffin priorty to your esiment to the meat i you really want the maximum punch ro ye that is why you kdo that yet and a said a rodio at tends to it does not eliminate those those negative effects but they tend to tends the damp on im a little bit i really it again would to see more research on it but there is a lot more stuff coming out a ashregon does another thing that looks pretty promising a seems to increase testostro an modest sleep interesting am i do not think it is they have shown increases in lean mass i do not think the increase in testostrone ah explains the increase in lean massage just not a big enough increase could it be the decreasing qarters all people at talked about possible it does it decrease astress stress hormons it it also has been shown to helpless sleep a but i would to see more research lookin at mechanistically how it is increasinglan mass before i kind of say conclusively that this is tha youknow the next creaton there is more research in these to come out n then there some other things that that have an effect am sitraly mallet there there as a new menanalysis that show that sitrlyn mallet can reduce fatigue and a increase i think time to fatigue an may ax yo have some small recovery benefits as well am different forms of carnane carnatin connactully have recovery benefits and actually interesting am i think it is carnatine tartrait actually has been shown a vollic publish to study e actually show that increased anjogen receptor density an muscle scells sats interesting now ol carnatine and it is other forms at ar pretty i then there is good evidence that they can improve a mspermanag health for people are looking to conceal interesting yet theyre am surprising number of studies onness in inhumancs am but yet androgen receptor density and that that is from orwell carnatine peertin castles not injecting directlen to muscland then you have got things oviously the other most effective supplement out theres probli kafine i mean if you look a the research tudies kaffine produses very consistently improvements in performance a that is nothewent some people the effect of kafne not s of kay but i would not know cos at never come off it eexactly exactly why interestingly they they do show that the effect appears to be consistent that that even if your a habitual kaffine user you do still get a benefit every time you take it but you sake yours use to it am the o theres those thin s you thin youve got things a made alamen which for it is in our it is in our prework out probably not superhelpful for a most people for resistance training it does seem to have some a benefits for high intensely wou get out kno more than forty five seconds or sixty seconds of rally hard training it does appear to help with the laying fatigue for that i'm and then yofve got things a b tane re also called trymothali seen which there is some evidence it can improve lean mass am there is some evidence that it can im improve power out put theres a few things out there but most the stuff is not very good ah i think that that is those kinds of supplements very useful a but a get i will never tell people they need supplements again even something crits and is going to be a very small effect compared to proper new trition recovery and hard training ya one f the things i i wus ove talkin ben bruno the other day and i said some people will ask me how does this person make progress because o knother programming as is not evidence based or or o the skyhouse he eshis exercise or dumb and i i'll say yet but they train really hard for twenty years none commonality you see between really successful athletes or body builders is they train really hard and one of the things i have observed is the more ind o the weeds people tend to get and again this is just my own anicdonte observation the more in the weeds they tend to get the less hard i see them train and one of the things i realy that a mike israeltoll said who is got a p h t and is a bodyble er himself he said you cannot out science hard training that if you are looking to build muscle an your looking improver body composition t the main thing is just doing the work over time sils y and the hard work and i would add to that and this is true a academic endeavors im to of course i think i hope you will agree i'm absolutely wi which is tat yah the other thing has given the mental side o earlier we are talking about how sotiety signals and the brain and what you think about foods can be relevant learning to really enjoy training hard in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well not just for the effects that has on body composition it composition excuse me those to of course but just learning to really enjoy the process of training hard and a and a really hard work out or really hard i'm paper that you ave the sort through or really digging through a book that is challenging learning to really enjoy that i think is is a if there is a power to go out there it is it is the psychological and and i think a lot of that is getting the confidence of doing something hard that there is a pay off at the end in a lot o people i goun asked a lot my cunays how do g t more confident how i become more confident i'll tell people you have to do yet there deres no hack you cannot read about you gont to get nhearena and i do not mean compete in sports necessarily but doing a pagety or doing something just something hard where you are putting yourself out there you are saying this is my goal when i'm in togo for it you just learn much by doing that about yourself im and just what you said i will reframe things in my mind when bad things happen from it is not e sad never get stressed out cause i do and it is not to say that i never get down because i do cause i'm a human but when something bad happened i should post about this my store to day what something bad happens i very rarely any more to i go woe is me why do this happen to me because you are in the universe random bad things are oin to happen in's thead i say will if i'm not dead it is that i say well what an exciting opportunity to overcome an obstacle and i bat because in the spirits of my life the biggest lessons and the best things of my life have actually come out of the most challenging worst things that have happen and again this is i would never have been able to do these sorts of things if i had not taken up weight lifting because weight lifting taught me much about perseverance the laid gratification overcomeing obstacles and that is why leve iting even to this day and i'll still get butterflies when i go in for a squatsession even thouh i've been doing it for twenty three years it is wonderful what is clear that you embrace hard things and i for people listening to this a obbyusey does not have to be weight lifting thinking hard things learning and instrument earing in language i'm challenge is isabis a absolute builder and the factualy shown a those sorts of things when you challenge yourself and also mentally that i i think there was a new study that came out basily showing a reduction in the risk of allshimers and other age really the cog decline to ben basically use it or lose it right yhave that the the will the desire and the will i'm to persevere i no doubt translates to this thing we cwe call the will to live right it is it is related to the will to live well i think that what you just said you on beautifully embodies what most people are aspiring to which is to i think most people actually want to do hard things i they do not just want to have a the results i think that must beel deep down under have some understanding that theire reward system works that way i must say this conversation for me as been tremendously rewarding first of all allowe me to meetyou in person for the first time sha've really enjoyed i'm certain thist will not be ar last interaction on this podcast and and elsewhere i also the amount of knowledge that you contain inside you is is astonishing and there is los stuff rattle around ter and and we all benefit because you are ability to pull from the mechanistic side again i think in not limited to but relate to your backgrounding bo comistry all the way through to the the impact in humans animal studies being able to understand where those sit relative to one another and then you are obviously a practitioner of a you practise what you preach and what you talk about pertains to men to women younger people older people people who are vigan keto carnivor you really are able to net a tremendous number of ideas whilet staying really nuw ance and data driven and s o ut say for myself and non behaff the listeners really appreciate you coming in here to day and and sharing with us your knowledge we will absolutely point people in the dirction of im where they can learn more about you and one of the places a that i one i doufly wone to mention before we we part however is this carbon ap and i should just mention i'm not this is not a paid promotion or anything that sort actully one of our podcasttee members is has been using carbon for a long time this is an ap that you devised which allowus people to navigate the exercise nutrition energy balance space for wait lost muscle gain fat lost weight maintenance i would just to briefly ask you about that before we con clude without necessarily telling us everything that is in the carbon ap i'd love to know what are the major things that it does and is good for and then what were some of the key things that you wanted to make sure were in there when you built it what what is the sort of logical backbone behind it cause i think ther're a lot of am food counting callory counting exercise aps out there u everyone i've talk tou that yuses carbon im including our mutual friend cigar and getty this member of my podcasts et cetera raves about it what is carbon and and but what is it do and what was your mind set in building it what did you really want to see there that yo did not see elsewhere those those thing may not know but i really i started on line coaching people for nutritian back in two thousand five and that was the the vast majority of my business all the way up until two thousand seventeen and i had a lot of success for that where whether whether it be just average folks look into lose weight or build muscle and right up to illy level a compenitors and physiquesport i kind o had this idea i wass n't i the idea a few people have the idea what if we could take what i do in coaching and try to autimate as much of that as possible cause you do not by the time i was becoming a really popular coach a an i was expensive you thoug youere looking it me to me charging i gopt the point ry chargeing about a thousand dollars a month for coaching right and not i'l most people cannot afford that and i would to not just coach rich people you do not i man hiwould to be able to help other people the idea was to create an ap that could do some of the stuff now there is always a place for human interaction but for people who cannot afford that our ap is basely ten bucks a month and basely what we wanted to do was set up an ap were think about if you went to anatrician coach wut what would they do they would probably ask you some questions about your goals a take some anthrometrics a and they wuld use that informate may be dietary preference and then yuse that information to count of formulate a baseligne plan that is what carbon does we ask you i think there is eight questions in the sign up flow about your activity am your exercise your life stile your body weight your body fat percentage and if you do not know it we hop you calculateed it is not perfect but it is better than nothing a and then you dietary preferences and we use that to come up with kind of your baseline and your baseline will be your calories you areproaching your copirates and fats and what is different about our ap is apsolike a you now my fitness powerer will do that as well ah what is different about ours is you we encourage people to log their weight daily for the reasons that we talked about earlier aand then you can also track your food in the ap and odestly i think our food tracker is actually waser to use then most of not there are are whet we typically get great rave reviews about is how use our friendly our enterfaceis that it makes into it of sense and you track your food try to hit these these mackroes that you'r prescribed and each week you will be prompted to check in with the coach on your checkin day and then you you put in some information and then based on how your progressing the ap will a just or not a just base on higyeur progressing for example if you'r hitting aweightlost plateau it will sinse that and it will younowl reduce your calories or or if your trying to gain weight and your hhitl plateau ill increasoure calries and there is a lot of you o back ind algarithm stuff that it takes care of this but the fundamental crucks of the ap is we we try to determine your total daily energy expeniture because hat's cong to tell us the first big thing we need to know which is how many calories do you need to be eating for your goal right on the front end we we basically am do our best guess base on your athromatrics not can be perfect but i'll give us in the ball park and if you do know some people alrea while i know what i maintain my body weight on there is acliost bot we can manmanually enter that during the sign upflow that is helpful for people who are supernerves me a but then if you'r just people wil ask what you do you take apple watch data you take this tou take that and know for the reasons we talked about that it over estimates energy expeniture what our apt does is it is an algebra quation if you because your body weight your your maintenance calories is your total daily energy expeniture your average calories that you eat to me ntain your body weight will be the same as you are told daily energy expenditure if we know how body weight is changing and we know how many calories the persons consuming we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is h nd you can see in the ap that will others ta kind of a a maintnance calory tracker or energy expenditure tracker and tymically after about three to four weeks even if the ap was off at first it will have you pretty darn close because letk let us say somebody a comes on and they their goal is to lose pound and half a week or something that and the first week they lose three pounds now the ap actually accounts for the fact that you can lose more water weight the first weeks they probably would not get an adjustment but let us say the next week they lose three pounds the ap will since that and a just their calories up because it will be estimating that their energy expenditures to acin higher then what id previously estimateed based on the amount of weight the're losing and the same thing goes in reverse if the're not losing the amount of weight thathere 'suppose to ah it will lower them base on the fact that it may have overestimated their energy expenditure but a that is the first crux of it is tracking that energy expenditure and then the next thing is proaching when the the back end algaro them stuff has happening calories are set first based on your energy expenditure and your goal for example if you haven a youon ressivfe diet a your calories yong to be lower even if your energy expenditure my people but high a just because ef you trind o loose two pounds a week i mean you aregong to be in a pretty aggress ofe calory defficit th cus tat the calories first then it will set proacine base on your lean body mass then the calories that are left over will be allotted to carba hydrate and fat depending on your dietary preference and we have a few different dietary preferences there is balanced which is a abou fifty fifty to sixty forty crobahydrate to fat of the remaining calories then you have low fat which is obviously higher ratue of carbahydrate you have low carb you have a kee toginic diet which is very very low carb and then there is also a plant based option and within each of those options still you can go in and actually shimmy the mackroes a little bit within a certain range that you can kind of dial in what your specific dietary preferences because again if we go back to what is going to produce the best long term results it is whatever the person can adhere to we really try to start with the concept of adherence by allowing people to have the dietary preference that they want and there is another appsout there that are good aps a for example we gat aslot with the drnour ap and the renissance peritization ap and they have a great ap abut there is is kind omore rigid and itill say you do not your need this many meals and you can have these foods at these times work on the opposite we want to give you maxim flexibility now for some people they would prefer the the rigid structure at first but we find that for most people giving them more flexibility a typically improves it here and over the long run that is kind of how the ap works and again there is moltiple different goals is not just await los ap there is a maintenance there is a musslibiliting a you have got all kinds of different goals that can be accommodated different rates of each of those goals and i mean i've used the ap for over three years now to do my body wa and i mean what i say that it is diled me and because i i'm very regimented with met o logging in and and logging my waight what i targeted to weigh in at worlds i got down to the point one kilegram ie's ere's pretty cool to be able to use a tool that i hope develop to actually coach me it is a great tool im we we we did some sitistics we pull twenty five hundred members and ow one of the questions we ask is would you recommend this to a friend and ninety one per cent said yes we we are our average i think our average retention is seven months which for an apt that costendollars a month is is really great yas i mention a number of people i know use it this is not a pap promotion i but i think people need guidance and tools and what we know about the human brain as that winging it can work but that a the brain will cheat itself often am what there is a fine men quote about this and i'll get it wrong and always bad to try and quote finemend because he said it much better but that we are the easiest o you it is easy to foolar ourselves basy is what he was say easy yes to absolutely sounds grape we will put a link to it that people can ofm check it out again at sounds o a wonderful tool and an a tool that nats a lot of the the principles that sit as im major stheems for weigt loss weit gain i would assume a directed a lean muscle a lean tissue gain is what most people are after yon weit mainits because a number of people would to just maintain listen i really appreciate your time and all that you are doing im certainly your time and energy an knowledge to day but also what you'r doing on the very social media channels and an just the fact that somebody

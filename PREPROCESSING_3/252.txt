a banata on the wind shold of his truk amsterdam is one o the rare examples of a city that really decides to take on the kind of boys club culture and firehouses and the fire fighters do not lay down the fight every step of the way and when they is unusual about te guy running this department lane scop isthaid he is shockingly frank about just how menstup his department really is one of his tactics is to be utterly transparent show the public what he learns is happening behind the close doors of the firehouses he is alo on about the push back he gets and and other fire departments and police departments with similar problems in this case for once we see exactly how bad things wore laid bare and we al to see all the resistance when somebody comes in and tries to change it as he just how hard thit is to accomplish it' smarcing li from our glass to the honor show we have this very unusual look inside of plac this eported joanna consus has been digging into this for months that be act onted to day show and this is such and embattle department that the only way joanna could get most of the firefighters to talk to her was to change your names and replace their voices sur you can be hearing a bunch of that what is bet to follow thasily only lane shop and one of his man opponents let us use their voices a pretty ser making meique reported this with joanna you hear meke's voicein there now and then asking questions heres joanna to take on a bunch of tough guys the may or hired summon who was used to bang the topasky in the room lanes hop climbed to the upper rangs of the ampsterdam police department by speaking his mind and not caring who did not it he got things down by moving quickly in a grass of late he ran the riot squap he was known in town for forcing out anarchists squatting in a full city block of abandone homes amsterdam is a progressive city and sympathy was with a squaters lots of people hated lan for what he did they threw paint boms at him alan luff lightis d he dok of it only cowardly leaders stone show up laneterviews with ham are filled with these kind of tough guy cleshase not te sit icom this is the battle and one of us is going to winn and it is not going to be you sometimes it was hard to keep a straight face o some bette but on't to ishbodysion bont fo for you ye amin defire departments from not really word mat getting bur an your top yer dop lane smile he knows when he is lang it on that he is intanse with redtish fown hair and blue eyes that look incredibly isey if yo pestamov his first week on the job there is a welcome lunch for him fire fighters do not show up then he gets an anonymous letter telling him not to enter any fire stations he goes anyway and he notice his right away there is nowhere for him to part the fire stations parking spaces are filled with recreational vehicles boat gimpsh ge bo its with care ovans with campspervans because basically the fire fighters was using this area round the firehouse is their private space saing wee youre twenty four hours this is kind of our house this is our place lane gave fire fighters their first order he sad get all your personal stuff outer here then this sid you do not run the show you are not the one who desides this the actually said you do not rune you don' rums it is you proble thatthit is what i whit you mim gondte be littling why you getting work up i out this little boat we an and what was your response to that en he been that e to conhum top sbeen a new i fi told thims you have to get these boats and the camprpence out of here if not i'm goin hire somebody to take on that step away i cou be dot and they were linten wol go ahead tloticl and ti took a step forward elece but an it stood my ground ni threatene to take a police crane and lifted out of there firefighters were curious and thought lane was acting too much an uptight cop but everyone complied they got rid of their boats and campers except for one guy who ignored lane and definatly brought a boat bright back the only boat in the parkin lot lane put him on probation and moved him to another fire house it was one of his first disciplinary actions they go recaliated by not coming to work and take a department afor lane was figuring things out pretty faste he estimated there were about fifty of these guyes in the entire department guys we joined the brigade daccates agol and ow ran their fire stations it kept tabs on their boses through a five at what sap channel some fire fighters called them the brotherhood lane always called them then and yo it men e still av thin angry white man he says ore against any change that would force the out f their golden cages he knew guy's exactly this in his polece department days the whope made wit the mackhad en sho to they i o stotes these are som gie and burn ras and am stam in the streets te nal mam theyare ligemhi the li im i fiturator they has slotso ta toshn have big mat theyr not much as su persmart but their cunning yo wocs and m if you trin too approach them were too much new onc then your not gin to mak it because they know how to play and then a few months into his job morocten dutch fire fighters on the for started coming to him about a particular guy one of the brotherhood who called them cansor marackins in dutch this was a racial slur when i asked for an english aquivalent some one told me camps or marackan is saying fucking maroccans come i shmos to blushy n opsinon tisu moltishaid and also when he was suppose to put ot fires an abstam wes t where there is a lot of maslimps living he would say that he had to go to the califate the guy had a long list of tirges against him he walked around in a nots he jacket he threatened a nailo crucifix to the shower door of a muslen fire fighter and he refused to go to a fire drall an a most again lane doft i shorforbill mon e doful did i fi this is really wrong what if there is a fire in a mosk will he do his job ono he save te people if he does not one to go in there now for the practiceand is the first responder in this milty coatha sity and you cannot say that you do not wont to know somewhere because of religion and a for the jock of it otit and an dotic hyomhemoted ech ma do when i heard about this case i thot bu i have to do something about this tom i cannot leave this line lane fired him it was the first time racism had been sided as the reason to fire someone from the ampster dem fire department he got rid of the boats he' fired a guy for racism progress but the brotherhood started o petition for the fire fighter to get his job back how did you feel about that now tut they migt open them open really open my eyes instead of kind of unitingits around the people who were discriminated against they united against the gisson who was discriminating and they formed a block around him the problem run much deeper than lane thot why when they won to stick up for the guy getting harassed for lane it was obvious he instinctively sited with the fire fighter getting picked on and he did not understand any one who did not that empathy for the outsider it made lane an unusual commander he started investigating to figure out just howbad things wore the numbers were not encouraging when lane started there were only five female fire fighters on the entire full time force of five hundred the fire deparement is not allowed to recort race but he estimates that only around ten per cent of the force for people of color these numbers didt mor floce the city at all at least the third of ampstams population is non white lane visited the fire stations and talked o fire fighters of her coffee at the long lunch tables there and he learned the lots of them liked the changes he was bringing in he had a silent band of support he asked people about their experiences in the department and his surprise people opened up to him threr their stories he started to get a sense of what it was liked to be a person of collor or woman in his fire department maraccad an serinamys dutch fire fighters that they were called rats and monkeys the brother had told some that they did not belonged that fire fighter should be doch and white one muslem fire fighter on calling a lee told me that ovher time he lean to go along whit the rachel slers when his coworkwas called him been lotten he acted he was an upset youyou have to bigknore it if i find out thit she do not it they will keep on coming back and back ad back have you ever reported discrimination in the past it was not possible to do that nobody does it you you could report whatever you want but nothing was can happen in worst of cases when it really got out o had what you would just do is shake hands on it and get it over one axcuse hil to say i come on tan was it joke nothing's can ot happen lane hired a consultan to help him reach out to women who quit the department they felt they never belonged they set her raspen an thelittleman happened every hour of the day one woman sat men in her station asked her to leave the room thy could comment on her ass men told women to sit in the windows of the fire house as if they were prostitutes in the red light district during job interviews women were asked how they do their jobs on their periods one of the few female officers in the ampserdon fire department is a woman i'm calling yuty the guyss respected her she was strong physically and she was top had no problem standing up to these guies but even she felt she was constantly being tested when a fire fighter under her command purposely opened his towel in front of her when she suggested that her bosses not put women into fire stations alone but with other women one of her superiors called her a highly educated moaning female one night she was doing arounds checking in on every one and stopped by the canteen i was saying good night to everybody and then they were sitting and what she born did to say something bat no i did not i did not say anything about that horn was a regular thing an the commonarias of lots of the stations i do not know why i do not know why i did not say anything i did not comfortable to say probably it is al me being influced by e bu ty brother whod i think because saying something it is it is always uncomfortable to say that yi have to t mat thit i avoided it too everyone is grip on what was normal was out of wak yudy remembers a woman at a fire station who had this particular bedtime ritual she would go to bed and somebody would come to tuck her in wait they talked her in to bad at night wat o talking in it was when you put your little one to sleep and you poolior blankets tits a round the person do guy who would do that sad i'm going to tuck her in and i felt un comfortable about that for her i made it it was her choice but i would never do that because it makes a certain situation that i think you shoold avoid she was fine with it is she did not mind this happening o i thul i do not know i i i cannot remember having iv er talking to her about that why yethat is a good question maybe i might be putting her more in a danger or why i might not be helping her or maybe i was telling myself w e maybe it is her choice and and she likeshes or something but y i don' now hering all these stories lane realized he had to spoll things ot what is normal behaviour in work place he wrde a manifesto on how to behave a professional fire fighter and sent it out to everyone it begins all of us are going to at normal normal mant we do not yell at each other we do not still coffee from the firehouses we do not make a fenceif comments on social media we always were oure uniforms we do not store our personal panning bads in the women's tormitories of for men if you wrike the rills he will be punished and if you no longer know what normal is please find out one of the biggest ways fire fighting is not a normal job fire fihters work twenty for hour ships everyone leds together they work out shot for groceries cook watch to be lik socker sleep professional boundaries get blurry lanwon in to push the department to aid our ships it would make fre stations more a work place unless a private club and tot su sho litticot tie is i thinks the fire tarmment many if the fire fighters will find bot almost literally to the deft to defend tis twenty for hour shift fire fighters liked being together for twenty four hours and hanging out and then getting a couple days off to spend with their families or hold down sicond jobs and the brotherhood argued that bonding in the fire station is a sential the push back was strong that laine managed to open just one firehouse on eight our ships as an experiment the brotherhood prastured fire fighters not to drowns for that the guides in the brotherhood are afraight to talk to reporters every one i reached op to is worried he would loses jo but i did get four of them to speak to me on the condition that i not use their names i'll call this one yon he did let me use his real voice s he said the problem in the depirebent was in tham it was lame and talking women into batenhe said it was not sexes i can only confirm that that it id bhen me as wel i seldem betters about it in that molment but wot o oyouinto bed is at oter than the men ye come on e thet there are yale somethimes o knalaysis i also went to bed then i as that he mi bet than somebody el else can from the show any was soready before me my bet this kind of think seppen but if youere women and somebodyis talking you in to bad it is a different experience in i is not sothing thats e that they want to shop you or they want to in baras ou or bet yis what im saying is o ce there are people who are minorities an who are women they are aut jujust too fraid to speak out to you because youre fraid to of or professions tiss is i stupidy a si all ta time i tid thosn't hap not that thas not at it probably happend one we one female an pl and probably one female ampl nest also no n do you have to say then ol ae ti ii sexis company or all the females i believe or all thi rather people ir i believe i do not think i asked him about the fire fighter laid fire the one who called the muslem neighborhood and ampser down the califit and used rachel sflurs on his morock an dutch coal workers hes not a ricest that is for hun prersen wewhat you deed tthat to mea is an in cident still an incident in a big in a big company do not i mak is a bigger than it is i twenty nine years is my wife i five folcas on al ll the bet tings sat i said about er thand e we would never get marries you ry s r not ononor mogt you none ave to finemat al as long as you not saany rout make it in is roltescase he socaten yeesiter lake cancer barackend in your not a raser not ocay that is in the heed of the discussion use si change wanotocay that yon otonotosa and and and thet thake party will le desae poly and we as right always wrong i do not just tit i must not dare that one thing is o sure i know he is not aras how much do you think that the force should adapt to new fire fighters the ching is then we have the feeling that is that' we are force to change then its can be n thiss i my be in the wrong way no if syou want to change and the chicase and not to force it and do it in a fery gefterway that he in a cletter way that you will change and without noticing that will be to perfectlay and this is not haping ry them this is what lane says hey was up against a group of men for whom normal man keeping things exactly the way that always been e i worting dasin a bas have the right to impose boundering onwork place we are not sin thise business for him it is not a dopis to wa of lie well wise that make this very clear that is not fors int a yopis way of life lane's approach to making make institutional change is bas on af progressive fairly new management theory designed to curb lall thi sorgansations it is essentially draw hard boundaries make no concessions be consistent on relenting and intend to fifteen years may be they will be a real shift it is arduous the beginning is the hardest part this approach made a lot of sense to lahn because of his experience on the ampser down police force he helped clean up and reform the department as ae rorky cop he 'd seen the problems first hand he started in a corrupt presinct the red ligkt district in the nineteen eighties he says cops stole sold drogs were excessively vilent changing that meant rigorously enforcing rules riting up bad cops disciplining them firing them lanes as it took about ten years for the rules to be accepted as normal but this confrontational approaches not the way things usually work in the netherlands srui nat we know the dutcheltreis very much everything pease everything together no conflect nd with the fire department to condis traditional recipe is talking talking talking not but not the dutch have this term pulder madal the take pride in it the idea is to bring everyone together despite their differences just their ancestors came to gather to build dykes and damps to protect their land from the see his storins debate whether that' sactually trubut anyway everyone from parliament to the local amateur socker club tries to make decisions this way through discussions and consenses lane did dabble and pulder madal a little in the beginning he spent his first six months going to fire stations trying to convince people that diversity would make them a stronger fire department in the city with almost a hundred and seventy nationalities and that women bring pragmatism in emotional intelligence to the brigade but lane was almost always met with blank stairs guys told him wemen are not strong enough for this job one of them said he just wen an excuse to bring in a hundred broad again hereis lne ti for halfale is in the scrucyofor deficien i intellecto is bonnicalba intellectuallywas onhard to hav these conversations about diversity and i don'son on crass and i do not want to be un kind about my people but some of them or kind of to stupid to keep having this diversity conversation and in ins in that way in i some point cndi just have to say togin a stolp talking about which is going to do it in wo itoithis wiuknow this is an organization it is not some kind of democratic wo by assing we ong and a talk about in n jority ros hou can take it or leven he was don reasoning with them he did not have to after all he had the full support of myor ever heart fonderlon he was wildly popular the city adored him he snobed to flot of mare pudent when he was in town because the russian leaders antiogy tios the city counsel back the mayor and he bapped lane which meant but the mayor support lane could do whatever he wanted en he had a big idea for how to get the kind of countability h wanted in e fire coming out in this pon people he can threaten their jobs when osfals tia talk thit is in a minute chicago bobocedio went our programm continues it is is marc on mi from mor glass to day sho burn it down we have two stories of people who think they have no other choice it is time to burn everything down make enemies do what has to be done who in the middle backed one a policeman burns down a fire house joenni ca kiss is in the fact is reputting on the amsterdam fire department the resistance changed from inside the department and in this half of her story haw the bigger politics to the city start to shift everything quick po grenda before we stood t second half of this a joena discovered when she stud a looking into this story that the fire commander's partner hofs a journalist te somebody of joannas worked within the past joenna has not discussed the content of thes story with this journalist the journalist was not inbolved in thi story in any way again hers joan lane had devised the very unusual plan but to pull it off he happ tonlest the mayor he did something that i varily seein any public oficial do he took all his criticisms about his own fire department and made them public and by doing he made himself the biggest critic aof some of the most beloved figures an amsterdam imagine the head of the police department in new york or chicago publishing a long list of all about stuff the are officers had done it would blow up in their faces that did not happen the lane here is how he went about it he started by writing a single letter to the mayor detailing his findings about discrimination in bulling at the fire department did isnon the homemine day of do not e and as itsolation as e read the letter an then there was a certain surprise becaus i think he literally said i thought there were all contetings going on bat it turns out there was even more going on than i thought but now i ax we have the proof nd now wereging to work on this together and oji ashamada for the in response the mayor wrote his own letter blasting the fire department and sent it with lanes to the city council making them public record reporters pounced i did did you in the mayor that did the to you talk abouted i sert of a strategy ya ya it is ush it is ush usly ea mighty day my and i overlik there was absolutely my idea and i knew it was gin and up i emediat i knew thisin i make the papers overso that was something in a thought i before that if i write this letter there is going to be a certain amount of tressures that i would get the munisip counsil and also the public to see that something needed to be done and anfully din do bevust therll ha pocosio om heeli a madia the till tthis was very very calculated even to the point where i did yuse words that hey knew the medium wi you hounce on ifd you get in discussion going but what the prusison this cree me tat thrace is in my discrimination thosly anim about lusin conslees ar terms that i know ar going to get people's attention it is really unusual for i'm a public official to du something this tha that u shot show ma dad would hase o o well effect yes it is extremely unusually it makes it very effenis and i looked at what former fire commanders did and ie felt that tit did not ou use a mostabilities they had enough and i the consciously decided i'm gon make more if beand that means you have to get your hands durning and you have to go public do you remember any discussion you had with the mayor or with any one else who was less sure that this was the right way and yah yah okea i gi but but te but th spuri in my old sating is conct when i noticed in and which people around me was must be fere and that wich a lot of the peop we management here the saworded me that they were kind of redicente me to sa new this kind of organization if you go looking for a fight heare going to get a fight did the mayor ever have any reservations about this is a strategy lok onsicons the details in lane's report landed on the front page of the main newspaper and amsterdam then the mayor an lane went on a medio lets here is lane on a radio shell flinging open the doors on what really goes on inside a fire house the host of the programes has to lane what you found was a very mach of culture i you en he give me some examples of that all shu all mut a colse on golay ho cafulse what if you are sitting at a table in your marocc and and something comes on to ve about his lam than people start talking about those cants for marackins and when you are sitting there as a serious professional fire fighter it has an effect on you and then of course you ere the exception ha we do not mean you it is those other cants or marockins that is one example an remort i ceplok mantion o ofer latei yet in wee shelf the cot my slap camacisie and i've got people telling me i can survive tha twenty for our shift iu to stay in my room and then is a group you could think a o e case somebody spending the hoseshift in the room but you could also think what is going on here but thi's not thehantin sholch of laat lasted te lav and that is really what i want to happen that we are able to engage with each other in a healthy way people wrote to newspaper saying they were repulsed by the fire fighter's behavior sity council member said they were shocked the mayor told lane to keep pushing on with his reforms but inside the firehouses lane's tactics did not go overwell his support srunk even people who agreed with his gulls whe thoughthe was fighting the good fight fell loc he was smearing every one lumping them together making them all look bad the way that he did that he turned every fire fighter against him this is a long time fire fighter of color in the brigade lane and the maore whence about is really redically the use to newspapers to tri to turn public opinion against us ther're very very hitful stories in newspapers that we wraces than we were sixes all cands of old stories really from e decator more ago wer brod beck to pay the black picture os and of course the brotherhood was pesst it was a public declaration of war on social media fire fighters called lane in the mayor know at all political losers and vile full of lies they wrote in dit this mayor and hav im sued for defamation and thanks lane were all painted a bunch of raciss inside the firehouses the atmosfere changed attitudes hardened again here is alane the fire fighter color who says his white coalworkers called him been lawden he said things got worse for any one who was not light something na tredy broke enoug for first time you see that people for instance one shake yor hand is his tradition after we put out of fire we always sit inside weave a coffee an old fireman shake a chat is hands that is that is readya tradition enoug for first time since i've been here what fire fighters ar refusein to shak er hands meanwhile lane got more don than ever he doubled on on recruitment what to mosqus and dinners during romadan tried to convince more people of collar and women to join the fire brigake slowly those numbers of increased he also back managers who discipline bad actors he stream line workships opened a new fire house and improved fire prevention he made home safer by setting fire fighters door to door in the citye lane with the backing of the mayor was making the kinds of changes he was hire to make an exactly the way he wanted to make them quickly an agrassively but then something happened that lane had in accounted for six months into his job mayor eberhart fonder lan revealed he was seck long canser a half year later he died immediately the ground started to shift under lane when the mayor died the brotherhood grew embolden here is lane it bate betise ton the noml bintan int frobopobom adsind of the dot people commented that it was great that he died and there was eeten somebody when fon ther lan was on his dethbed who said fon ther lan the cockroats is slanying away on wonult distin tion and it was quite shoin somethaty is on his despete from a hanser in your kind of rejoicing in thatbut for them it really was one enemy liss soon a campaign to push ly not of his job kicked into high gear were tired fire fighters in unions rallied around the brotherhood publicly demanding that the city investigate lane for bad mouthing the fire department in the media fire fighters did interviews anonymously e nouncing lane in a conservative nes paper the biggest paper in t anotherlands from the moment the mayor announced he was sek lane started getting anon om his dathrads one letter sad a headman was being hired another tarted ed his forteen year old dader he was told the thrats for coming from inside the fire department are in the summer of twenty eighteen amsterdam got an energetic new mayor the first woman in the city's historye famca halsama she was lane's new bass and spet many years in parliament as a high prophile lawmaker representing the left wing green party a champion of women's rieds as a politicians she pushed for tack brakes to address poverty she also wrote newspaper columns and made a documentary about moslem women mayor halsome a condemned the dat threats aganslane and publicly through her support behind him but not long after she started lane remembers her stopping by for a private meeting he told her about some of the changes he was trying to make her reaction chocked him to from the butetamasion i shilf when we having this conversation afbout races in indiscrimination than mayore herself came wit the following example apparently she heard it from one of the fire stations or ar some one to firemen ol onc did we have a number o nat callyers working here en are not you the yet states ot and there was one that all the other fire fighters were calming shar which is san a dutch name and that was not his name it was a races to word play joke they looked for reasons to say no to ham they could say no hair ore in dutch nay hair which means negro and the sou bucamson musta hot to lookon blo is ad litli tits fetishow the maore you laughed about this insent shethis is really funey i find this extremely hilarias she seriously laughed sho e locte hell hat she laughes very loudly and a for me that was really a kind of pevinal moment mon which i realized i am fighting against all tis and i am dealing with the mayor who sees tis his funny am that ik a not a fo shoked fush that shi mu lo i told her i was immensely shocked that she had to laugh about thes suncle of humorous remarks and i really asked ir the vitib what is going wrong he ot that bustip o my o cant mayor halsama veemel denied lin's account she says she is only told the joke in meetings as an example or po in tolerable behavior that is not always recognizethe such by fire fiters for lane that moment crystallized the world of difference between his own an new bas after that who gave up on er mayor halsama hat liked the rest of amsterdam sen lanes fight with the fire fighters play out in the media and she did not i she talking out problems an reachincon senses the dutch way fire department managers who sat in on meetings with the new mayor in lan said it was clear right away that they did not get along that sometimes he was abrisive their styles were totally different they called the mayor high che an rane boxing the mayor ordered her own investigation into the fire department the new investigation acknowledge the her problems but it concluded that over all the fire department was quote at its cor not a rasist or sucksis organization and it called o lane to take a different approach and build trussed with fire fighters a city hall reporter told me this report basically through lane under the bus when it came out at the end of twenty eighteen lane had been on the job for about two in a half yars i spoke to him around this time he seemed unfaced by the report he was still going about the business of reforming the fire department and airing its sturdy laundry this problem fire fighter not i uch lotmuso ol sh lald he is not

leadership is not looking over our shoulders than we can do our job o city counslwas a political possession they get voted an and the fire department it is mostly white under the old maore the counsil was in full support of lane when he first exposed the raism in secism in the department two years before this theyd been on his side but now that was old nos the public had moved on amster dams a progressive setting but on rasot has blind pis during the holidays some people still wear black face when they dressd up as saint micxs halpers and the public shock over the racism in sexism in the department did not last wat was more shocking was the waylane was speaking out the city counsil was tired of lain waging was loud messy fide and at this meeting they were simpathetic to lane's cretics and my neek met to best pot o ma there is one city counsilwoman saying jo i know you cannot talk to the crass bt you can come to me she also said i think it is very brave t you to be her to day it we

at looking over my shoulder and lik what tis melly you cannot do your job when somebody is looking what you are doing lanes has cop ue the same arguments to fight any change in monea the pe plic opene how do you alarms son this opinion my suggesting that whan were doing is making depublic unsafe the befor concon de fa on the thru bunctian if they cannot do their jom because toure fraid and that is unsafe for the public mayor hossuma did not feel the same way after the meeting she gave the sintervene o local news o at last sesinc i calsonesince an il smend at seon tots elp an indeed ex to a nettle shiny tat yar o show com yarment oshouteon she sas of course it is very worrying if they do not have a good work in firemans that could indirectly affect their ability to do their job as well i m the foolishenon a man an you have to take these fire fighters concern seriously after that city council meeting lane knew he was running out of options city council had lost faith in him the mayor was not on his side and four hundred fire fighters more than half the brigade signed a petition saying they did not trust him to run the department wtinside the fire department lane supporter started to hear rumors i caught up with some of them in mad not long after the city council meeting do you think commanders cop is about to get fired i hope i hope it is nat fast i hope he does not leeve again here is ale wat would that mean for you personally if he was i be very disappointed what he did is give mynorityes a plat form where they could speak out and that was not there befor him now were we are in direct contact with and the operationlons of management and we can immediately reach them as for help we get a love support and det definitely makes difference lane had been there almost three years and aly in a couple of female managers tell me they were finally starrying tas he change fire friters were thinking twice bef ore making ricesten sactast comments everybody's c more careful now people really correcting each others still things happen a people make an make jokes that but some one will say what chat something you could have set before and the old days nowadays you cannot do to s any more now olty improvements wee see ow for the past few years if he leaves you can you can throwl that in yomstery foris it is going to be beck to square one these these angry white man have always been dominant they always decided what went own thit hy does a city does a mayre to she understand that this is now the situation well i i do not know about the mare she is new but i hope she will not fire him if she does fire him just shake hands on it with us and say o k we do not want people of color in fire bricade they ple be fair way to go about it just say o kay would it we only one white people cause that is message it would give wut it signal to you is she saying i do not need any more people you i do not need any more my wars not just i do not ned any more people i do not need people you any more the sculture forms ofer a hundred years it is reely hard you try to get a foot in te door while people just want their old firebricate bak and they will resist any change butthat is reality i asked layine to give me a got check do you feel your days or number big i e an se then al the women te ovp if ye you once tati think we should talk about thet may be a different moment and is noft something that you really want to talk about right now nidn no not now am have youi have you made a pitch to the mayor about why you should stay d ye n that is dic think i told her that is ta face where and now it takes about six years yo rak than habits ry and m only after six years on just art night thinking about you nifying things and i think now thn unisib organizations all about trying to find unificationthingis but ii think that is too soon and i told her you should just leave me here for another couple of years to do the breaking beot my don m my a do ono tesome wet mayr whet the mar say an a not sets toconit she nodded the mayor declined many request for an interview i wonder decline was regretting his management style if he was thinking yeu should have been more palder madal more diplomatic do you feel there is something about the way you do things that perhaps am contributed sai ths something that you may see in i in in mytrospeck i shtak on tis differently i should have approached this differently i'm just curious ya e a thet and yeritrospect te going you sif dot e sometimes i think may be and in rit rospects an i anted results too fast you ur only goin ou oubut a real cultual change really cannot be and force or speedet up instead of creating more support you cond of get mor resistance because the organization is not ready to change asot e don te on onol and dont she to inplutual but you me tnough what they i was very black in white and i do not really regret ted maybe i think now with more new once i would have opened it more to conversation instead of just resistance do you think a conversation would ave healped no t that is attto ti stilty still to do lima that is the delemma gettinfras long youl got honestly begs me to say that i also really did not try i jus went down and lay down the law it may be if i tried tan it would have been slightly different govo but the question really is how long do you wanted to take do you accept this kind of behavior to continue for another twenty years and i'm trying to change in sooner rather than they lane im in si think i ma meas me just think very di bed for to think or that your telling me that your days are numberd is a what your delly be rade out the mahaneshofishes i am not allowed to speak about this lane's last day is commander of the anser don fire department is on

you hop the day lane's departure was announced a fire firhtopart to camper band at a station dman i kisses ch normally reporter for and peras daily is programs a me a stra e a sa a n ean a a a a a a an a e a a to ma a ma ma ma he ma ma ma i'm we have time to shuwtid iy for o just on mar a quickstory about somebody deciding that the onway forward is to rip something down at rebuild from the ground up own a baker tells what happen here is a typical day from whon katy dir was fifteen growing up outside to tryit she gets home from school yand i our torlist was posted on the banastair and i was really frustrated cause it was longer the normal and i there were chickens from where the slighting glass store had been left open this happened all the time her mam love chickens and they got in the house here a chick there a chick everywhere a there were chickens perched on the couch there were chickens on on the kitchen counter and on the dining room table i mean they were just chickens everywhere im and i looked up the stairs and che was yes sitting at the computer and i was just in that moment i was very frestrated because now i've got to heard the chickens outside complete all these shores i was just very irritated and at some point rather than c oing straight into my chorers i sat down to at journal will you rean me what you wrote ya on this entriet says my mamm never does anything but sit at the computer and play the stupid sims on line any more that is what her mam was doing when she came home from school playing the sims the vidio game where you get a simulated family and a simulated house to liv a simulated life to day she made me do all the real chores after school because she was busy doing fick ones on the sims she brought home three fancy chickens to day oh great more fucking birds o ke got ago i katy says her mam moved out of her bedroom and set up a futon and the computer room to sleep necks to the game she would play crash on the futon play more katy craved her attention i remember i used to just sometimes go up to her little den area where her computer was set up and sometimes doing things just too intensionally anoa her but in kind of a funny way i would take her headphones off and i would just come up to her in sort of leke zerber her neck rasberry her nag or what can i do to get your attention katy began to feel invisible i was just standing there waving my arms over my head which as holarious cause that something the sms would literally do wiin they wanted your attention they would put their arms over the head and waveom an shout at you in whatever sim linguage they be sometimes katy would catch glimpses of the world her mamm was building an the sims her mother played the guitar an piano hat dinner partyies she also had a sim's family named after her real husband and kis her sister and father looked bhear sims but not katy in real life katy died her hair and dressed edgy but i remember the sim that she had mamed after me headlike the stupid almost bulcut looking brown hair and always more these inse skirts and button up and i remember thinking that is not me at all is that who you wish i was she tried everything she could think of to coax her mam off the sims she would tried to reason with her joke with her bargain with her finally katy reached a breaking point one night she sat down at the computer and opened her mams sims world with her literally sleeping on the futon just fi've feet away from me was well i'm do in this the first thing i did was there was a acheecoat i think it is a simy colin in an explanation point over and over you put it in and you can get it was a lot of money im i got enough money that i could buy moltipol stoves mostly im another thing that i did i remember is you could buy i think it was a those oversized teddy bears people give you could buy these giant oversized bears and put them nearer the fire plays and stuff that and m and i remove the fire extinguishers in the smoke detect ers and staf and i remember walking the sim she had named after me out to the yard and the leading the door behind me that went out to the front yard and just waiting ther dat and sister sim go to the stoves and start cooking say in a kitchen anna living room fire break out the sparks had the tetty bears game on and the simsar just running around screaming with their hands in the air and and they really scream right yes they scream in whatever that weird sim linguageis w hosolakeays it is just that is just shiverig and i'm lauvhing hardly i remember is i'm waintingingly iwen it be my pands and i'm trying hard to lake not laugh out loud because she is sleeping right behind me there were firemen but they would only come if you told your sim to call them im i burned her sym house and family alive iy eventually the firestops the katy character stands in the yard her mamb father and sister are dead when a sym dies this little ern appears in its place i i went back in the house and you could pick up the le earns and i picked up the little erns and just sort of pleace to them near each other and new well i'm going to be in a lot of trouble to morrow because katy was the only sin left it was going to be pretty clear who done all this i got up the next morning to leave fer school in i remember im as i was leaving she was just sort of starting to get loged in to her game instead m wen i got home she yelled at me to come up the stairs i came up the stairs and she paused her sime game that she had been rebuilding to turn around and yell at me and she was you owe me in apology that was weeks of my life and it still felt a small victory i guess because it was one of the first time s in a whi that she had two step away from that life to engage her real life she wrote in her journal grounded figures but it was fiingi have to do all the house work now sic she can rebuill i do all of it any way whatever that thinks i'll go to

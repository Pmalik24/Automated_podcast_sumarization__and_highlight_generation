graham grew up in a working class town north of england and whe he was eleven or twelve his family moved into on the first houses in new development that was being built it was kind of hitting the jackpot for him at that age is all around everywhere were homes under construction which i remember this from construction sihtes in our eghbourhood when i was a kid was incredibly fond this became my new playground tis graham i we in a climb on the scaffolding to bit of can amater gymnastics but also buill stiff and the big thing amongst us kids was lighting fires and the was tal paper was one thing that bunt very nicely his ef yeu ol kinds of troubled getting to bricks im boards to play with and wat concre to rit in they bent frough the workers left ncigarettes which they would smoke once epent worn magazine nd when day graham was there alone and he had this great i dea h put together a little makeshifts he saw or as he calls a heetr tawter t a plank of wood balanced on a brick at the center e but another brick on one end of the plank his idea was to drop something really heavy rereally really heavy onder the other end of the plank from a great height to find out just how far he could send that brick catepolting into space it accomplished this he said up his teeter titer by some scaffolding i climbed up on the scaffolding and i carried up this cana massive piece of curbing stone iv guessing around twenty five pounds se you are how high up probably at the sut a second floor window level and bout fifteen feet twelve feet he care which is to line up the stone directly above the near end of this he saw below down on the ground and then he dropped the stone it it landed perfectly i really had lying this up pretty well and the brick launched and the following few moments ir probably the most vivid memory i have of my childhood i was of to see watching to see what the brick would do ecause that was the experiment really to to sut a foll ow that in its in its journey but the brick it did not move at all look he thought he thought it was going to ark in to the air a rocket instead it dis emed to be getting bigger and bigger i now have an image in my head of this brick just getting larger and larger as it headed right towards my face i i even remember very vividly that the brick had a the construction of the brick had tree circular holes in it and i can still picture them now as they headed towards me in a kind of slemothon why yes very much i feel that memory is minutes when o tis it was jus not even a second i i believe instinctively jerc to my head back as this brick came directly towards my face and i have a very clear memory of the can a sound and the wind and even i believe the brick as it flew past me flicked my fringe the fringier hair yen it it sut a whistled as it went aeven when i throw my dogs ball now which has a little whistle device in it that memory comes back to me this moment was stunning li nothing this had ever happened to him and i remember having to sit down for ache quite a few minutes to recover i really fell and probably for the first time that i was inches away from death i rember walking home in some state o sholk afterwards he dice to wonder if if the brick at hathy hit me and killed me an you knon't maybe id fallen off the scaffolding or something i used to wonderer whet then the crime sceene investigate us came to look what what would they make of the whole set up what the even understand what had happened u no e you get i by a brick bik where did it come from yet this des dead child who layig in a building siht ah that was the teatho taut of that but i i even had this survision of what if my body fell folad and destroyed the little structure that i made down there and how did i get hit under the chin with tha brick and wher's the brick what the ferensics would have made of the whole set up that isthe thing right your on death that is not bad enough on its own there isthewhole question of the ferensic's death wards what people will make of it it is we are to think of the stare at the scene of your death wit th the objects scattered around you get it all wrong get you wron that is the bigger thing i he bigger question after you are gone is not just how i happen but you your motives you state of mind what to make of it your whole life you good qualities you bad ones to

memorial one of those people were you feeling guilty about something here something that is ben eating at me for a while are read that you actually do not mind when people die from something you were

more potent than the drug given to my father when he was dying from cancer a death from the stuff is a collincard is that true the my sisters of bituary bringin business for you in i've a friend whas a jehovas witness and she told me that in the resurrection i'll beou ble to hold my sister i used to and speak to her nothing happen i this idea but i cannot get myself to believe it her body was burned cremiated a one thousandy hundred degrees i do not picturing that but i do the side from my own body hers was probably the other female body i knew the best lean taught muscular she wrode horses she was fearless always wanting to ride the ones that wer trouble she could lose her saddle and gallop at a flat run a wild woman gripping the horses main with her hand her leg muscles were iron cables she used to put me in the vice a move in spired by our love of the w w f restlers she would wrap her brawny legs around me in squees untill i almost could not breathe my mother always called sacha the daughter with a bleeding heart the one poit when she was working in new haven you would walk down the street with her and she knew all the homeless people by name if you were driving with her she would jerk the card of the side of the road get out leaving the car door swinging open and call to the man or woman to see if they were oquet if they needed anything that was her life's work she was actually a clinical social worker with two masters degrees and sochal work and public health bit the last five or years of her life she had trouble keeping jobs she had trouble committing to anything the daughter with the bleeding heart her of topsy report says that her heart weightd three hundred and sixty grahams one i had to identify her body the edges of the sheet she lay on were pink from her water down blood the water down blood of her compassionate bleeding heart they should have cleaned up better kleaned her u better though i caught myself thinking how perfect her eyebrows were how ill you were you my sister's age younger did she was forty for maybe that seems old to you but it is not she looked old her since she started using but before before my man she was gorgeous sexy she probably met you at your place wete the tocco bell parking lot in her filthy car baseball cap picked at skin too much yliner maybe you coul never imagine that but she was ask any one who knew her asked the multitude of men who knew her asked the ones i would to lind up against a wall execution style an actually execute asked her first to mind fuck of a boy frent at age fourteen an the obsessive one that followed an high school asked the professors married men random men apparent friends the one a first gave her crack the noxy con aske her coach who slept with ha young women on his team and pulled her into a coke field party scene while she was still a tenager he denies all this to day i find myself fixated on the men they circle her memory these lose her dead beak ghosts or something how dare they have the nerve to be alive thea year after sasha died afterd visiting her grave in a summer day i drove through the center of our home town by the town green there as a cluster of boys and girls not yet high school age the boys were on their bea mex's doing trixks riding down a little hill the girls were all clumped together watching these young peacock strut their stuff knowing their jaw was to sit there and be imprest they were nearly silent whispering among themselves by the boys were having al the fun i drove by them and shocked myself by rolling down the window and yelling girls get a backbone they are not that cool i worried what my sister's death was doing to me what woas your daylike to day you'r day is a dealer i much heroine and fentinel on the streets these days an pretty sure you'r crushing it as the kid say on the radio i heard the chief medical examiner for connecticut actually get choked up about how they need to build new buildings just to keep up with all the dead bodies from over doses i grown man who seezed dead bodies for a living cride you my man are powerful is that how you feel a few days before she died sasha sent me a silly text there had been an incident about a weeking a half before at my mother's house where she had been hosting a cook out for friends sasha showed up in bad shape sloring her words fighding off drowsiness i forbade her to use some combination charcoal gas grill because i thought she is oen a blow us all up there was a fight she felt wrongly accused and was crying a lot i tried to get her to talk to me about what was really going on and that went nowhere my'm om confronted her with some hard evidence a text i saw ding on to her fone sasha did this thing when she knew she was caught shewould stare hard into your eyes while she sized you up what did for sure what could sou convince you of wlook coul she get away with admitting without completely throwing herself under the bus ieventually she jis sort of faded away into the next room trying to clear the table but nocking things over instead i was still holding a grudge about it but i was happy to get her a nokyu was text asking if i remembere the drawing in our middle school french books an went with the word feble meaning week look a man with no bones making a face lik he had just eaten something distastefully blan growing up my sister delighted in imitating the man feble you are making me crack up she did it often it was such a stable in our repertoir that i thoughtit was odd that she would even have to ask if i remembered but this was our pattern there would be an incident then after thing subsided she would reach out and we were both be happy did not have to deal with ha larger issue but each time i knew i was being roped into denial i was less willing this time an i held out on riting her back i wanted to punish her a little more show where i was not a push over but this thought came to me strongly you do not want that to be the last text she ever sends you read the subtext she may need you and you need to let her know that you lov er i never texted sasha back i waited too lon after she died i looked at the texts in her phone from the night of that cookout the night we fought about whether she was ondrugs she wrote befriend how dot i not hate my sister my family truly hates me i on' want to talk any more her friend wrote back dam naughty a the fuckan nark seeing the word hate in association with me knock the wind out of me i want ed to yell at her no you have got it all wrong i'm the one who loves you not those people but by the time i read that she was arety dead i'm july thirty first twenty fifteen the day she died she had just seen her drug counsillor after our dad died and her diction blossomed he became the father figure in her life she was working in his garden toward th end of her life she created gardens for people just because she loved it gave her place to put her anxiety her manic tendencies he called to her saying he had to go an was she oke she waved him on i'm fine i'm fine this was maybe three thirty p m i'm glad that she saw her counsillor that day they loved one another very much at four ofclock she has a forty seven second out going call to allen at four o two there is an in coming call from allan for fifty four seconds at four or weight she calls garry for one minute then garry calls her back at four twenty and they talk for forty two seconds at four twenty seven she calls gary again and they talk for forty one seconds at four thirty nine she has an outgoing call to tim for one second at four forty she has a call out to jerry for one minut ire you allen gerry tim bjerry were yu the last one to talk to her did you see her too were you with her both her windows were rolled down at some one been in her passenger seat were you with her when she died and you got scared and ran tell me what were her last moment's what was she saying befour did you watch her die my mother worries that she wanted to die but i do not think ow long ofeyou been cutting heroine with sentinel i do not think sasha saw it coming you suck her punch people she had meetings coming up written in her day book about possible work she was trying in an email we connecting with he beloved former colleague two days before she died she said hi surpri surprise wrumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated ello well her offtopsy says six fifty four p m as the time of death some time between four forty and six fifty four sasha and haile the drugs that killed her she hated needles she was found in her car an the parking lot of a seafood restaurant i'l fin ninty five the detective on the seene happened to be an old high school friend he told me that he thought she had probably used felt sleepy i needed to pull over the restaurant is on the water i was happy that maybe she was seeing water in those last moments there is an off track betting place next to the restaurant with galloping horses painted on it two stories hive maybe she saw the horses i just wonder if she knew it was happening er did she really just think she was going to take a little nap i do not want her to have known what was happening i do not want her to have been scare if i'm going to be honest here mi going to be honest here maybe i do not want to believe that you deserve my empathy i doft want a look you in the eye because she may not look much different than my sister you may be her some one who cannot be around their family that much any more because pretending is hard seeing sasha trying to dri the wine glasses we used for thanksgiving while she nodted out bretending that she still had one foot in our world was one of the most heart breaking things i have seen you may look that you may be sick yeu deing to get hig just to maintain some equilibrium you may have been her frien i may have even met you you may have called her sage you may have loved her god help you if you loved her to be fair my sister dealt too as i was writing this to you my husband offered me a gentle reminder of this fact it was manly she could yuse there is long handed dishion and subdraction in the back of her day book with people's initials how much they owed or paid her how much she owed and paid in return it is chump change really written af you times as me free drugs wer her pay this was not high rolling dealing this was survival what my husband reminded me that my sister was dealing too i quickly defended her yeh but she never killed any one he said again gently you do not know that i was dune it is true i did not know that the fact is she could have killed some one i worse fear when she was alive was that she would be driving around high and kill some one the idea of her killing some one kept me up at night i often thought about having her followed curious i was about what her days were where she would go i was once driving to visit her in my mother thinking about how i could spy on her whn i was a traffic slowdown an i ninty five a few egxess away from our hometown on the radio they said thre was an accident up ahead my mind went to my sister ad she cast it i pulled up in the trafic jam ript behind a purple car i gasped it was sasha here was my chance to play detective she moved to the right lane in the middle one i was in began to pull forward i woas at risk of being scene i decided to not try to hide i pulled up next to her ready to make a stupid face and stare at her until she felt my presence to my horror she looked half asleep her head was back her eyes at half mast i could not believe she was able to drive a car my heart started racing and i pulled in behind her as if that might shield other cars from her i followed her all the way home to her house trying to steer her car with my body a bowling ball headed for the gutter she was still living in her own place with an ex biferiend turned best budy not yet avicted and forced to live with my mother during the last year of her life i pulled into her street and watched her drive in to her driveway i wanted to follow her in barged into the apartment that she never let me enter but i froze becuse i did not know what i'd do once i was inside del if her some jonovarch opera hull cogan speech shoe'd go for that i did nothing i told myself she is going to an out patient clinetk she has a therapist o drug counsellor all these professionals helping her but unfortunately she also had you and here is the thing my man i need you tu i know that i know what i'm doing here because of you i get to say if it were not for that guy because of you i dn't have to blame her because of you i can not my head when people tell me there is nothing in could have done but i do not know if that is true i did try my family tried interventions honesty confrontation rejection love she once told my parents that out have any one in the world she cared most about what i thought of her i ache at the possibility that if any one in the world could have saved her it was me but to save her i would have had to go to her live with her make it my life i would have had to physically remove her from her life and stand guard at the door holding a shock gone would have had to somehow wrestle her denial get herd ha finally go to her knees and raise the white flide but i got engaged i got regnan to day whenever i' tell some one about my violent feelings towards you they inevitably say well if it was not him it would ave been some one else there was not him it wuld have been some other guy but my question is why did it have to be any one at all why should my comfor be that there would have been another one that all we can expect from life as a game of a wackamole what was shiddy people i cannot accept that because what man it was you and ye i'm raging at you i do not have to rage ot myself or my sister to save myself from falling into a sad heap on the ground yer i'm using you i do not care none of this is fair my man fuck you fuckyou because you are still here and there will never be another hur fuck you because i will always think about you you are my dealer now man you tdent me a life without sasha because of you i'm going how to do this alone and i'll never let you forget that you ares for ever this sister not y bours reading a memor about his sister coming up proba with having a facebook account after your dead that you have never ever ever thought about that is in a minute from chicago bubl gradio when our programme continues is this merican life frm my reglass to day's programme the secret of my death stories of people who die and the stuff about them that is hidden and the stuff about them that is uncovered after the deaths by people on a mission to figue them out we have arrived at at two of our programme ac too commento morry is that is that actitle to obscure athoping it would be a kind of a play on momento mori which is a moment of awareness of one's own death but even i know maybe that is to obscure im but anyway alow o thes story happens in the commen section of facebok comento morri anyway sepnipou explains after some one you loved eyes suddenly even their most anoying traits and retrospect seem endearing blake birkhart's friend was his guy dave mar there were both commedians ain chicago ment their twenties in the comedy scene blake was drawn to dave because he was this extraverted weirdo loud and absurd he was also a problem drinker and constantly high heven at a bit about being stoned he could not order food in the movies and he had this laugh i remember that cand of bugging me hou he would just ter talking of festbeti oliyo it is hardly doin fiction wethe goolikoblcomlon anythat grabmen shake my shoulders insteat if he was excited about ti's the dumest thing a new at new jok he showd dave saw himself as this in your face brutally honest i conic last but blake says thinking about it now he cannot reaely remember any actual instances of dave being much of a rebel he just remember dave as being disarmingly nice to me it was almost little that annoying how kind he was because it made me look bad in comparison han we were always together yet he was that he would go up if people that he had only that once or twice sande say hey hows to go n how ere you to day and you cou tell he really meant it on stage you could often here this earnestness ang dave's comedy this almost chollike excitement mot ridiculous stuff yoer surly es ye oh y o irso iiy y bo be on o lo o lo ye got to recording of his sat dave did on october tenth twenty four tn helf days later blake gt a call that said dave was in a coma ite was sudden dave had been a diabetic and somehow his blood sugar had gotten high that his body shut down his kidneys were failing blake visited him in the h sbital it was jarring then after three weeks of doctoris trying to jump start dave's body they told his family twas probably best to take him off life support they invited his friends to the hospital to say good by when i found out a he was not gon to be coming out of the coma an and was gan be taken off i support i just said i i cannot go there is noway i can i can see him that knowing that i never be ab te talkt him again instead i went to my housewhere at the time i was living it for other camedians and all friends with dave and i said i man i go home and every one should just come over to night after you just y dave we just made a hole night out of it and just canomata basically awake for dave and i just can awaited for the news of him officially passing how many people came i was at least fifty sixty people while that is a lot everyone knew dave was con o be taken off life support that night and finally a face book post confirmed it rest in peace davf mar then his seventeen hundred face book friends began to post eulogies of him to his face book while thoughts and prayers i had a gigantic crush on dave on admitted another said let us all be the most dave mar versions of ourselves blake's post kept it simple ti wrote i love you did had you ever told dave i love you to his face i do not know i do not i do not think when your face was actually losing them you cannat you have realized it more unfortunately that is how t works two weeks later on thanksgiving day there was a post on dave's face book page from dave oh man it was this it was it is hard to explain this is dave mar sboiler aler youare alive i yetspoiler i'm here his friends all whipped out their phones in the middle of their thanksgiving dinners and started shouting enjoy on his face book page people are saying no one celebrates thanksgiving the wy dave celebrates thanksgiving a dave turned thanksgiving into easter it turned out dav's parents never did wind up taking him off life support they transferred him to another hospital instead and a couple days later his dat walked into his room and star talking to him he had countless times since he would fallen into the coma and ats some point perhaps i recognized his voice my eyes popped open and i was still intibated at this point i had a whole mess of tubes sticking out of my face and attempted to scream but because i was intibated it came out silently but i just mouthe the words what dave had been in the coma for a month he is a type one diabatic who just on an awful job caring for himself he had not paid much attention o what he was eating drank too much and he had no way of monortering his blood sugar because he sold all his testrips for weed money he had no idea has led sugar with sky rocketing ventually sending him into a coma the last thing he remembered was puking into a bucket and figuring he must have food poisoning and then after a month he welcome in hospital bed completely bewildered by the entire situation but the upshot of all that was that he was in this weird situation some of us fanousize about that tom sawyer thing of being at your own piano reget to hear all the things people say about you he get to finally find out how your seen what people will remember about you dave did not get a chance to look at facebook for a while he was still recovering his hands would not stop shaking he could not even use his found it took another month or for him to be discharged from the hospital and that is when he finally decided to read through all f the uligies people had left on his page about a hundred of them it was neears day after the ball droped and everyone went to sleep he was recuperating in his parent's house he went down to their basemen and that alone at the little kitchen iland scrolling for hours it got to be two and three and three thirty a m and i'm just there at this island reading these things from my laptop one of the first things he spotted right in the middle of all that i misus was a post from his brother trying to quash the whole thing written the day after dave supposedly die i think my family was honestly pretty upset reading as some of these things to friends of david there seems to be some confusion and unofficial word on david's passing at the time of this posting dave mars still with us untill you hear official word that david is past please out of respect for him in our family refrain from posting about david in the past tence it got seventy lakes three comments but the facebook algarathem had buried it it was overshadowed by all of the comments coming in facilitating the dead dave narrative some of those got twice as many likes and reading these comments was sorta you would imagine people brought up alout of memoryes things he did some of which he didn' even remember funny stories and he got to see what this life he bumbled throug actually looked from the outside there is pretty ggood ones in here ythis one i had forgotten existed i o get to this woman rights deep into the late night hour of a crazy sexy cool party i found dave pounding on a closet door and then she transcribes this conversation where she says what you do in dve and i say i got to go to the bathroom and she says that is a closet and i say no it is not it is the bathroom and there are people in there there are people in there and they need to get out and then she says i show dave that it is indeed a closet and then the last line is me saying just let me knock on the door for a little and then i'll walk away that people do not know what i did and that is great man that is funny a bunch of post perplexed him just cause they were random there was one from a next girl friend who was appreciative of the fact that he broke up with her and fighed his car because it was cold outside one woman said he was a great story teller and also quot unreasonably sweaty ay yeabsurd right what it is easy not to include that is sentence but as dave kept scrowling past the funny memories of course things got heavier many of his friends had been devastated and they took to facebook as a form of fairapy pouring their hearts out about their loss dozens painted dave as a devoted friend the kind oagi who was there with hugs and advice and beer whenever you needed him manhy got to this one post from a friend the just got at him he did pretty sure kit took this photo right before i told you i was going to leave her party in order to go to bed early and then you made fun of me for doing that i guess i never thought about this before but you were totally my best friend in college even though you were senior when i was a freshman you insisted on treating me and every one is equals even though we were not did you really made me feel effing cool my dum smile in this photo is one hundred per cent genuine because i was happy to be with you all the time it was not just me who felt that way whenever we went to se v s or walgreen every employ recognized you and said hellow we have even need not a chopollay for free because you have it going on did thanks for telling me not to be hard on myself and then laughing about how funny that sounded coming from you thanks for all the ride's home thnks for being my best friend it looks it is finally your turn to turn in early you earned it i'll talk to you later duffer that is sarcwey ye yeit is it is just really sweet it is really i do not know it is many these things i an remember i do not remember things that way i do not remember im'pleas it walgreens on knowing my name i remember shop lifting from walgreens and spending the night in the in jail that is how i remember this steff this was the main thought dave hot going through his ealogens even though everyone was being nice he thought theyre all wrong i know that people do not really talk shit about some one when they died but it it is jus really tuftt square the image that i have of myself with the way other people talked about me when they thought i was dead and that is why reading his own ulogies it actualy made him feel awful he felt overwhelmed by the complete disconnect thet tween the go he thought he was and the guy everyone else was talking about he thought that he was at cor a bad person that he took his depression out on people that he could be infensitive self centered i put myself in this coma it was my carelessness my recklessness that got me to this place in the first place and on the one hand while it is moving here that everyone at

retired officer in the navy a guy im in a called charley it is not his real name the document he detached to the emo was an essay it was four pages long he dwritten it quickly after addy for lawnie's funeral at he was a stranger to him tut there was something about the whole experience that seemed a kind of haunt him that let him to write an essay something deeply emotional i could not tell what it was gave him a call why did you write us i neu es crion im the rate radio shows a lot i i do not and i think i wrote you gas one time prior because an that soly is live and knew haw a contact you tho case him ma be charley writes radio shas more than mos people i asked him to tell me the story of eddy for lawnie's funeral last summer the story begins with a randam tax message from a friend of charley's a guyname mark he in charley went to the naval academy together after graduation charley went on to become a naval aviator heflew met a va celicopters in a rack in two thousand seven his friend mark joined the navy seals the navy special operations forces what was the taxed that you got from mark i actually started with the good morning i say good morning hows a houseley an yer son and a his next texis he i got a jout for you and iur bast for reshpons came back doesninvolve explosives he says e ten the service a frog made in my absence frogman is i nicnme for a navy seal atdy for lawnie a mark had bee navy sals together the funeral was in be in sandiego and mark who lives in florida could make it i asked charley who lives near by to go in his place that was tha moment where it was that moment to saysor as well do i really want a goot o a funeral of someby i do not know in his absenceoye if it was anybody but mor a probably would have whata made excuse did he sit there for a minute or two before ye rote him back thinking of excuses not to go ive yely if i said now ii did think of a few excuses not to go because funerals or ore those things it people a tending to begin with and lett on the funeral someme that you do not know which tecan ly shes lell real bekiuse just ont imporpent the charley wrote mark back said set me the details and i'll do it and then in the swirl of his own life and work and family he cann't forgot about it two weeks later he woke up and realized it was the morning of eddie for lawnie's funeral he put on a nice baragines some nig shoes in a dark button down shirt he thougt he go to the service dering his lunch break catch the eulogy and then scoewed out of there het back to work he realized he did not of any of the details about the service and he also did notknow anything about edie for lawnie he did some googling and found a face book memorial that mark had set up and it go fun me page asking for donations to help support eddie's family it mention that he had passed suddenly in the essay charley sent us he writes there are pictures of his three children and the smiling face of eddie and seale training submerged in mud and smiily and giving a thumbs up with green fatigues on the date of his passing was listed and i sardy googling to for military tragedies be aneral lumni from a military academy means that rarely is there military accident where some one i know is not involved or affected found unusual that i could find no reporting on anie's sing y at the time i a i told myself thit he was a a maybe feel at ther had youll died in tlia dide he had e ni it was a if it was a major fire fider era conflict there would be o there would be yellow rvas there would be prays orould be flags everywhere there would be people weeping the streets if it if he had died in commet it was not that you knew it was not abouti el death well ii ae lwas noti i did not eet that little lam bug in the back your head becausm lik te cae will how he dine it was a caraxen the uner net did not ched any light on the mystery's surrounding eddie's death at anyway it was the day of the funeral charley would probably find out what happened there i's a weard thing being a proxyat a funeral he reminds me being a plus one at a wedding only miserable he do not know the person who died or their family sos hard of any feelings about id the fact that eddie for lawnie was gone it had not changed the course of charlie's life at all just course of his lunch break rilly charley gets to the chapel la because mark texted at the last minute and asked him to pick up some flowers for the family crsages for eddie for lawnie's daughter and widow as soon as he drives into the parking lot he notices a woman sitting on the sidewalk dressed in black ae tending to a little boy who is having a total melt down over his pants and how he does not want to be wearing them charley recognizes the boy from pictures is eddi for lawnie's son when charley walks into the chapel the service has alreadys started and he is charring those flowers one of the funeral directors intercepts him and asked him if he is the flower delivery guyd charley tries to explain awkwardly and in whisperd talk because again the service has alreadys started that no he is there for the service but no he does not actually know the deceased and no he does not know the family either he just there for gin florida as a standin the funeral director lets him by and charley finally squeezes into the back row of morners the pews worell worlful and the walls i'm wish of the back the walls were wind with that men three pieces that were six foot four iletic kee built werex and glasses of a year clearly may be seals people were giving eulagy es in is es say charley writes that have felt odd to hear about the achievements of a stranger stories from his friends the men on the back wall with him were still faced betrayed no emotion until edie forlawnie's daughter e seven year old name zelma broke down in tears the little girl was a youo sobbing you knont in that s deep heartbroken deep heartbroken sub anram shep mother you knalmost can at bent over and escorting her out through the door and she is just sobbing a sobbing id again youcan imagine always six foot pluss three hundred pound athletic maybe seals and iis that everybody just look helpless it was the is not anything these guides cannot take on and wi and id is a little girl sobbing a you are right behind us it is not off that anybody youl do there is a part of your essay that at that really struck me i'm jusconried yeu wrote the military tranes you to separate the emotion from the mission at he is oldest girl zelma was old enough to understand what was happening but not military enough to know not to show it did you want zelma to be a little more military in that moment i dnnot say that because that little girl waily out there the whole way am yet it that that again set off a cascade of grief that everybody there had to con out stuff away charley stuff the grief away with an old military trick he focused on accomplishing the mission to deliver the flowers mark had sent him with i stupid an i feel barresed even admit this but ivi that is mi clung to is i need to give the flowers i clen i clung to that idea that my mission is to give he the flowers luckily a voice intharly's head his wife's voice he says told him that delivering the flowers then was a really bad idea he stayed put it made him deeply uncomfortable all these feelings for a stranger he was in being military enough you lose i degree of empathy in the military because mpathys not a nat a it is not a advantageous skill to have an most specially coat arfields empathy is not e useful emotion have and the fact that im sniffly and and carry up is generally you dont thought is week i i say you you your your empathy your empathy setters tand to be a atrophed well i man i think that you could all surcee his proof that you are empathy sentrs havenatrophied that their actullye quite present they just come out at the wrong times at with odd things which is i guess all thos i think some people would argue that a funeral is the exact right time for it to come out it at present an the service finally ended the chaplain asked everyone not to talk to the family just proceed outside to the flag presentation but charley ignored these instructions and walked up to eddy for lawnie's widow eager to give her the flowers to accomplish his mission at last when he told her she was there on behalf of his friend mark she brightened and gave him a hug she told him mark was the whole reason theyad hoto service there in sandiago he deranged everything charley got back in his car and called mark to give him a report and then mark said something strange he told charley he was relieved to hear ther had been many people at the service it hid hid me it hid me almost at touching lightsik hat he said i'm glad people showd up how was wher no one was going to be there i an tand and you get that kind of shinking feeling that you have mis something important andne ahe told me was is because because of how he killed himself and and that eddie had disappeared from home three and a half week's urliere he been missing for about a week before his body was found under a bridge he had aback back filled with pictures of his family and his service record and his essay charley writes about that moment after the funeral when he was in his car talking to mark and he finally understood how eddie had died it all came together in my mind suddenly no mention of cause of death no new stories of training accidents no mention of the end of his life at the eulogy the monster that hides in the dark the one that you do not mention lest she summoned his attention how did that change things for you to understand that eddie had committed to hi side i i got light head it es i had at physical at a physical reaction i just casn' there was nothing there was nothing about it that me met non no no oricles of it the chaplain's in vocation tod talk and nobody said anything about it both mark and ady's wouldow as i found out this smorry wh i thouht wore they were terrified because i expect to sho up to an empty chapel they expected no one to come in fact the navy chaplain had mentioned at the start of the service that eddie had killed himself but charley arrived late and missed it and charley had missunderstood mark's worry that no one would chow up mark told me he was worried about that tat not because at he killed himself it was more it all happened suddenly and he was not sure people would be able to com the morning before our interview charley called eddi's widow to make sure i was ocet with her that he talked to me and during that conversation he learned something about zelma's break down in the chapel whes on ly she werne to leave this cause she was ashamed she felt that she feld ashamed that everybody new her father had killed himself and that the other felt that she was a a bad person and i was who was horrified to hear t hat i he o e holly yet athe things for o think asshe was somehow tis priot for father passing wayifat everybody that baworld seris whoas theras sporter and she was i i is hist hor and i was horrified to hear that and that she want to leave ad he left the military and twenty twelve the same years charley charley says when heu go back to civillian life you get a job you have got your family and friends that you missd having a greater mission your your sense of purpose is gone it is you have to evolve but when i heard what ady did id i i i understood what he i understood what he was thinking of that moment i ariousl credit o try to explam an a basicallyin terbs without no you do not myself but i ydo not maybe i i i i can put myself in few ther sheis eel with o talk e an about what i being able to put yourself in their shase i mean k k can you talk about that are you up for it ut for talking about tha soi been caridreading this you wn't take a little brak i i can keep the lik i i to say of brave enough to take that subject or but i do not ot i do not i do not think gi in thick i can n think i can do that io thi tht sier thi's fin that is fun charleys had his own abouts wit suicidal thoughts he brought his creer in the navy to an end he told me about it when the mikrphones were off he said it was ocade to talk about here i asked him if in retrospect the thing that got him about eddy's funeral he reason he felt compelled to wite the essiy was that it could have been his own funeral but he said no that is not iy and then he explained why he wread the ssiy he said he knew from his time doing madofour flights that the mere sound of a helicopter approaching can improve the vital signs of a person on the verge of death he said i wrote you because i wanted to be the sound of a helicop turn to some one anach of us we wernt t share the thone of the national suicide prevention hotline that number is eight hundred two seven three talk et hundred two seven three talk thik i

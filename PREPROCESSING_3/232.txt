not it five million dollars to houshem in mexico the mneit is not go to ten camps this one but to the official mexican government shelters it is enough money to shelter eight thousand people but we sent wan more people than that back across the border ofer fifty seven thousand under the remaining mexica policy pas another twenty one thousand we e migration officials have not even begun to process we have told them he systems backed up should sit on waiting lest stay in mexicup will get tog your cases in a few months these are mustly people who in the past before presideent trump weuld ave been lout into the united states wait for the resil court dates here it many people r pwushing back across the border resorting refuge camps that we do not call refugei camps werin our countrys storestep toe day we tri to understand what this new policy means for the people we send across the border we alsayer from youu officials to sent them there weare not feeling great about t themselves e b easy chicago siycs mericand life or our clast s ther weth us aguan good by stranger leke i said to the top the program to day show was first broadcast in november and we are rerunning it today because a just on the polit surprize this is one of the spotswhere im jumping into the original broadcast to say a the president's policies at the border have only intensified since we first broughtcasta chell since coverd nineteen in march the administration shut down the border to all asylum seekers asit i'm hearings are not going to resume until late june though seems possible that even that date is goin to get pushed back wy first brarcast a this programp one of t thing that we were specially interested in was the uess officials on the front lines whos job unde remain in mexico is to send people back lot's of them were resigning sing now that is actually not my job osantials times reporter malio tool talk to a bunch of them and here is the rision of the story that we ran in the fall before the remain in mexico policy began and up ended the asylum system and completely change what it is to be an asylum officer here is all the ob used to work when ae central american showed up at the us maxco border and said let me in i'm afraid of going back to my country that is where the asylum officer came in the officer did something called a credible fierce screening to check if the person was likely to face harm or death if the us sent them back home if there is even a chance that they would the asylum officer would let them into the united states to wait for a court date were an emigration judge would make the finum call dug stevens says people do not understand how hard the job is at the time all this started he was an asylum officer in sam for sisco si'd have people come to my office and wy job a sentually is tell me the worst things that have happen to you have an hour go and that all the sid of ro toime of the truth and all theside of hou justic you are expected to be or realy to do the job well need to be an expert an the political cultral sotural and economic situations in he nueral countries around the world and your expected to be a human wi detector all at once present trumptokspot asylum itself as if it is fraud he says it is a hoax a big fat conjob thet people come in with fake asylum claims that asylum officers just let everyone through and then asylum sekers never show up for their day in court that it is a border wide two thousand mile loopholl and it is true then most people do pass that for a stap with an asylum officer and enter the united states but ter's a good reason for that it is builtin do u s asylum law a common sense humanitarian idea we do not want to send people back to situations where they would get tortured or kill the legal term as non refalument and u s law set the bar law if theres basically any chance an asylum seker could get killed or harmed the officers pas to let them into the us and does not need a lot of proof or evidence at that point later when they get before an emigration judge and by the way the majority do sho ab there they need proof and most of them get rejected even before president trum took offic less than fifteen per cent per year got asylum that is because most people do not meet the specific criteria in the law or do not have enough evidence or it does not check out all the asylum officers i've ever spoken with see it as their job to weat out the fakers the people who do not really need protection the one whore just trying to gain the system oh mi god heres where i'm ging to be real with you this is an asylum officer weare calling ersula this is not her voice she is afraid of getting fired we had an actor copy what she said as closely as possible the frid hap is happening on a skaled thats that is huge we are talking hundreds of people a month i interviewed three asylum officers for this story and all three said the groups that have been the primary target of president trumps emigration policies they actually are not the main ones committing fraud it is not the central americans it is not the middale eastern people it is the indian people and the chinese people they all have the same bulshit is story about getting beaten with haky sticks three times because their part of is seek party and the police told them they are going to jail them if they ever badmouth the ruling party ever again bulshit just hap they all just happen to do the s ame thing and suffer the same fate even though thereis absolutely no confirmation in any media that any of this persecution is happening and studyes done by our our department in st a counterparts in the country ar straight up this is not a real thing the chinese our running as similar scam with christian claims in the fall of twenty eighteen asylum officers started hering about these big changes coming the policy that was first called remain in mexico and then later migam protection protocals m p p but the asylum officers who were going to have to implement this thing they did not know any of the details of how they were supposed to do it it was all shrouded in much secrecy this is another asylum officer we are calling her ann we used an actor here too to protect her identity ovr the next few weeks and starts picking up around the office that some of her colleagues were being called in quietly and ask to go to the border in santdiego and instead of the credible feer screenings they would always done they seemed to be doing something entirely different under m p p a whole new kind of interview with different rules she knew she is going to have to start doing them too she pulled aside a co worker who would already been sent to the border i was asking her hey what is what is the training what is this and she was i'm not allowed to talk to about it another asylum off ga is eone who youd consider a friend ere a sorter professional colleague good colleague a good colleague some one that we had mutual trust for sure and then was told was brought in by a supervisor for a special brief about about it before i was going to start doing these interviews and was told here is the skinny on it and do not tell anyone why because i think they knew that it was legally dubios and suspect and they wanted to keep thethe the leak to aminimum the leak being a major pollicy roll out that was can a change asylum yeh that is the leake that is the leak yet two months go by before they do a formal training session with the full asylum corn nd it is just a power point here is eir asila again hands were going up and being we how is this legal or how are we going to be doing this and how do we know how this works all three of theasylum officers i talke to said that the presentation left them with lots of questions including the biggest on how was this legal these officers knew better than almost any one how dangerous mexico is nd this policy seemed design to send tons of people back to mexico it seemd to be in direct contra diction with you was asylum law which says that at the very least we cannot send people back to a situation where they would get harmed or killed we cannot violate the principal of non refalment and the response was i'm just the messenger bringing this down from h kew and this is the power point they gave us i was well if you do not even care about double checking that this is legal and you are just the messenger as you say you are afuckan ashol all three officers say they raised concerns and got roughly the same response just get out there and do your job wut they found out soon enough was just how radical a change the new em p p interviews were from the old credible fier screenings for starters not everyone would get an interview only the people who volunteered that they were scared to go back to mexico would if they got an interview under m p p aslum seekers would have to prove that they would be harmed in mexico not their home country and not jus any harm they cannot just be threatened by gangs or the police they have to be threatened by gangs or police or whoever because of some very specific reasons laid out iny aslaw because of their nationality race religion politics or being part of a particular social group i'll g b ttio and they would have to show that the mexican government a cop or an official was unable or unwilling to protect them and the aslum seker could not just say all this happene they could under credible fear screenings now they need to prove it it is as asylum seekers were travelling through mexico fleing for their lives they should have been gathering evidence of all the screwed up things happening to them there making a paper trail and they shoul have had all this evidence on the right then right after crossing the border which of course his next impossible especially because they had no idea any of this was required dug saw all this happening and wanted nothing to do with id s we tried to keep his head down to try and avoid having to do these interviews hoping the courts would kill am p p but they did not by june m p p returns had sky rocketed and it was all hands on deck for the asylum core dug could not dodge it any more and i do not temo it said youre doing em p p interviews to tay i had a father and son son i thinkwess pretains eleven or twelve the fleeing on underes because of violence another problems did not talk about that much cause it does not matter for the purpose of em pp and fokeset only un why they afraid to go back to mexico of course the guy nd his son do not understand why there even talking about mexico they do not understand any of this at all the interview continued he had tried to find a place to live there had tried toge a work permit in mexico and was essentually demied and as their canseing his talking about ye are encountering cartells and witness saying other my grancs being murdered tortured in front of hs son and fleeing and barely getting away whall dat thats are being shote thim and tilk him hout his son having mightyers for weeks because of this and then they get stop by the police and the pleace take all their money herselfans and because i cannot get them to say these magic words flak yet they threaten me because i'm hunder but that is all they had tobut they don' know that a tbe cause i'm hunderin those would be the magic words that would put them in a protected category they were targated because of their nationality though even if the father had said because i'm hunderin they probably still would have been sent back to mexico because ods ar he did not have any evidence proving that any of this happened dug he did what the pausy told him to do he sent them back to mexico the old credible fier screenings usually took an hour or less these emp p interviews can last four five six hours when i asked these asylum officers to describe what these interviews are for them for the migainst in front of them ursilike gave the most fivid picture she told me about the very first and p p interview she did a family from alsavador two parents in to kids she had ascript she had to stick to the family was exhausted and tromatized and totally unprepared youere putt into a sell you are separated from your kids and your wife you have no idea what is going on because you thought to day you were going to be interviewed about al salvador and you were going to get to enter the united states couple hours later they lead you into this reason cold cell where they chan your hands to a tablol in handcuffs and some one is sitting across from you who does not speak your language and starts talking to some one in the phone who starts translating to you that you are going to talk about mexico you smell shit because you have been living in a shelter without any running water for a month and a half bess you have travelled all the way across central america to get there and you do not understand why someone is talking to you about mexico this interview goes on for an hour and a half and the person keeps pausing it they can talk to some one on the computer which they say is there superviser and another gard leads your wife in that you have not seen in the last twelve hours into the interview room and you can brush her hand as she passes by your happy to see her because you have been separated you have no idea what is going on where are my children i do not know sir i'm sure they will be fine your wife goes through a similar intervieu on but she keeps being confronted about the answer she is giving because thei're different from yours and the officer can understand why this story very differently between two people who experienced it half an hour passes before her children are brought into the room and then the officer has to talk to a ten year old boy about whatever his parents said and then confront the ten year old boy on inconsistencies between his story and his parents story and then the wife is when am i going to see my husband again the officers i have no idea let them know if you need to use the bathroom ursula made the case of the family should not get sent back to mexico and to her shock her supervisor agreed in fact she happened to walk outside the moment the family got released they have got their back packs on their holding hands she thought maybe this will not be bad but that was the last time the very next interview a woman told her over and over she was afraid of being raped and killed in mexico ursula believe shewas going back to a place her that was very possible but because the woman could not am a specific person whof to sault her ursula had to send her back since then it is essentially been no after no after now asylum officers told me that even when they find one of those unicorn cases they check off all the boxes and recommend not returning to mexico their supervisors overrule them ann told me and mi producher naughtya raymon about one asylum seeker's case were theire attacker yeven spelled out their motive and it still did not fly it was basically a situation where there was a really clear connextion to the nationality the persecutor head really said i am harming you because of this nationality you are nationality and the harm was really really severe it was lyk definitely torture and h it was really clear that the police were not goingto do a thing about it did not care at all and the superviser rejected it why lidelitawy they said ah we cannot show that if this individual went back to mexico the persecutor would be able to locate them the standard to day's upside down from what it used to be intercredible fear instead of let us ere on the side of letting people in because we do not want any one to be tortured or die under empy p the standard is almost impossibly hot almost nobody gets in the department of homelyan securithy says only about nine hundred and sixty people interviewed have not been sent back to mexico ultimately of a little more than forty seven thousand m p p cases registered as of october with about thirty seven thousand of those still pending of those only eleven people have been grantsed asylum or some other kind of relief according to syrks inniversity which tracks all this husint government sitistixs eleven and thats of the policy was meant to do the administration credits and p p for a sharp drop in the numbers coming to the border mark morgan the acting had of customs and border protection calls it a game changer and absolutely successful it only took doug two days and five interviews to go home after work and pull out the law bok he is a lawyer he actually ownd a beat up copy of the imigration and nationality act the law hundreds of pages long that makes up the foundation of view as simigration system he drobbed hat off his bedroom shelf along with a few of his other books from lawscul he printed out a bunch of court cases and supreme court decisions with more cases pulled up on his competerscreen in the middle of all this was his pen and white legal pat as an attorney he wanted to get his feelings about emp p how much worse had felt compared to everything else they did down in writing he worked for hours and he wrote down seven bullet points the main ways he thought m p p was a legal once he saw the list laid out there on the lined white paper dug knew what to do the next day he went to tell his superviser he was not going to do any more im p p interviews his response wes i know these interviews are hard were all required to do then its orturn spread it out it is roling basis it cetera at cetera and an he not that point there is this this moment we culd i could ave just said youe righ an ow the sax and gone back and a pas and i told hin he would understan im not doing thise inters an wa sn't what e you are not doin his enermies mos now siy i can thirlegal to defly moral and i'm that dat his boss was stuned he did not really seem to know what to say eventually he told him he was probably going to have to write him up somehow to start disciplinary proceedings dug went home that night and decided to escalat he went back to his legal pat i a sentye rat a legal memo explaining all of the reasons that of that it was legal and why s refusint to do it and than on that monday i he now that to all of the administration an sanfance isciw hand a the two supervisors that were involved in the dispin perspixs and then nothing nothing happened instead of sparking some kind of rebellion or at least forcing a confrtation it is crickets he took it as step further he sent his memmo to has senator's office then he dropped at his good by gemal attached his memal and sents it out office wy to all of san fracisco asylum about eighty people and to a representative of the union for asylum officers across the country and with that dot shut down his work competre and walked out he quet they make one change and everyone f the officers o this is terrible but well figure it out and they make another change yos is terrible but but i mean mi jab i' man a do it even if i don wont yor al complain about it it complain about the work an ot complain about the hours the and of the day i mean a do it and the more i do it the easiritis to do and that is terified me that is how all the awful things in the world at happen that is how you get many good people doing really bad things and that is what is happening and it is terifer you are literly from my people back tourape an gilt that is what this is the three officers i spoke with are not alone a union representing the asylum officers and u saas employes file do brief in a lowsuit against the administration arguing that m p p was allegal and a ton of officers are quitting i've heard this from a bunch of people in the asylum cort and that citizenship an emigration services the parent agency several use the word axciduss and if officers cannot quit they are calling in sect anything they can do to avoid an p p interviews we trid to get some numbers from the government they would not tell us how many people had left they did say that by the end of the year they hope to have seven hundred seventy one asylum officers but as of a month ago they had something five fifty meaning theyre roughly two hundred people short i trid to get an interview with the acting head of u c i s can cuchinalli to talk about all this he sense been named deputy homelandscurity secretary he did not give us one but i did get one questionin it was at a press breakfast this audio was recorded on my fon i ti mollyo to s whow you eto the concerns from some of them you are asylum officers theyre concerns that many tese policies being handed down by the trump administration particularly targeting asylum arin fact a legal wt thid they are ben ordered to implement policies that are i direct contradiction with t emigration off their pass by contres oe a eeonyou waswe mats e ouople os yes ire expected to ust we reagree ot all this a but i you expect that o yees the professional mployes tat you s s wor n olicies an plays they are wor they are part of the executive branch he said and long as we are in the position of putting in place but we believe to be legal policies that have not been found to be otherwise we fully expect them to implement those tfaithfully and sincerely and vigorously now we are jo shy a p ps first birthday after chaotic start it is thousands returned each week it is expanded all the way east a cross the es borter from california to taxas is colf coast and it is not just central americans being pushed back now it is cubans then aswilums pregnant woman i'll g b p cu asylum at least at the southern border has essentially ground to a halt here is ann i'll say this the administrations been successful what do you mean they want negative decisions they do not want asylum seekers in this country they do not want people to get positive decisions or determinations for asylum they umhave felt that the standards for screening interviews wer to low and they wanted those standards changed and those standards raised to end they have succeeded what do you think the administrations end goal is no more people from chitholl countries anne throws up in the shower almost every day she has recurring nightmeres she says she cannot focus cannot sleep she thinks about the people she is returned to mexico all the time it is nearly a hunt erit but thre's one family in particular that she cannot stop thinking about a father and son why do you think that case sticks with you kid was really young what happened to hom did ist git get kidnape he gett murdered happening happening a lot wat was santent what is my moral culpability in nat i interviewed that case in my signatures on that paper work and that is something now that i live with ye i feel i feelin some mis that this administrations made me humanerates piecer the irony of this policy is that under our asylum law to qualify for asylum you have to have been harmed because you are part of a particular group a certain class of people and the way that the asylum officers have implementad an p p they have created exactly that ut huge group of people in need of protection about sixty thousand migrans forced by the you ask back to mexico to be preyed upon there as they wait on their request for safety in eu ass it is exactly the sort of situation that our law was supposed to prevent one asylum officer told me it is the first time that we have been asked to affirmatively do harm to people you are not just saying i do not think you are oligible youre literally saying i believe what you are saying i think you are in danger go back to that danger malyotoo covers immigration for the los angeles times sured a print version of the story also is that their wetside by theway in the wake of her story u s a stout o a hunt to figure aut who talk to her and to us and issued warnings to asylum agents not to speak with the press about what is happening inside the agency coming out what sound when the cartells get on the phone and bargain with your family for your life we have recordings that is in a minute in ocagobobagridio wen our programme continues this merican life my r class to dayn a programm the out crowd stories about

our programm at two is about the danger that these asylum seekers face when ther sent back to mexico ac two take the long way home if you ade to pake which border city in mexico is the most dangerous wavelareto ret across the border from gareto texas woul be a good contender the state partment classifies that is level for threat that is the same threat level as a rack and serio an ot of danger there is kidnapping can it bing is prevalent there that one of our producers met men and a migran shelter wofre terrified to go outside i youn cupingi told her just putting one foot outside the shelter makes im worried at trprutus two minutes his looking all around he scared were interested these kidnappingscas are comment e porter emily green wenton wevegaretor and august jus this story about one kidnapping and whatd happene one family including recordings and details you really never get to hear the family ended up in wevegareto because of m p p here is emily tis gy who got kidnapped i met him by chance actually before he got kidnat an he told me how scared he was that he would get kidnap i was on a bridge and wa vel lereo that connects nectico to the us every day a round one p im that mon the us was sending back migrants from the u side to mexico under im p p that day there were a hundred of them they were easy to spot they all carried clear plassic bags fith a couple of document in them and none of them had shoe laces youes emigration take shoelaces from anyone the detain most of them were men many of them with her heads down and one par stands out to me a father and son in maching polo shirts both of them sweating in the heat theire chabvy soft faces dad has his arm around son they seemed the talk to me the man i'll call him davide quickly tells me a story do o e te e e te a te o e te te a oa lavy tat tet tea a boe a rebo he says he is not a criminal he is a person who is always made a living but he cannot live in his country any more they are from hunderes davide was a business man he ran a little cloothing store the gangs there demand money they call it a war tax the tax gappitting higher and higher and told davide's family could not pay it any more one night the cartel broke into his house threatened to rape his daughter and they fa i've don lots of intervies with people david mygrancs and really difficult situations this one felt especially hard i think just seeing a father fall o part in front of his eleven year old son in won te me we ce o e e e o e e te bet e in the on te he tat ee ge yoon the board davi says he wanted to ask for asylum in the us but the agents did not listen to him they just gave him documents to come back to a court date in desember he cannot go back to hunderess he says o then e te e te e o e te y o te o e e te te a ee e te o t o o e te te e e we te e te a te e te e te i don have anywhere to go i do not have anything i do not have money he says they say that here we were being sent a lot of people get kid napped and i do not know what to do we only talked for ten minutes i anted up lending him my phone he called his sister new jersey and explained what happene then he made it to the united states only to be sent back to mexico it was getting dark out and i'd been told not to stay in noi e lete lo past dusk i crossed back into the uss to go to dinner probably not a mile away from where i last seen davide and my phone rang it was davide's sister i'll call her lauda she had my number because it was my phone he called her from earlier to day she was crying hard i struggle to understand what she was saying she tells me tdavide in a son of in kidnap just hours after i left tem she would got in a call from a cartell demanding ransom o a a i o o e e e e o lauda says that the cartell told her the ransom was nine thousand dollars for davide and another nine thousand for has son eighteen thousand total they put davide on the phone briefly she knew he was alive and then the kinappers got on e eo o do ey and i told them where in the ward are we ging to get this money the man on the other and told her she had to get the money he said he would call back to morrow i asked lauda to record the phone calls ar en and she did when they called the next day she put them on speaker and used her relative's phone to shoot bido of it e cin lookin on no e ben o on a t nontmonin a mntin anen yeto etino o meni tien an may tell her i need you to depassit the money as soones passible be a hata the ahutha means old lady lauda is thirty eight she tells them again that she has no money that she is sick from anxiety in her conversations with me lauda is scared crying but when she talk to the kinnappers she holds it together she askd if tdaved in a son aroqay they cannapers tell her they have food that they can bathe for now each call and le last a few minutes o o ared ao by the third day the cartelle has lowered the price to five thousand dollars each for daved in his son lauda works the nightshift at a printing factory and new jersey hardly makes twenty thousand dollars in a year plus she is a single mam and all o these calls the canneppers talk super fast i'm guessing because they have other ransom calls to make canneppings a big business a volume business with a whole in for structure cannepping migrant has been common an mexsico for a long time what is different now is that the ues is making i as besialy easy for the cartells to identify an snatched victums they are sending asylum secres back in big groups all at once same time each day and theire easy to identify with heir plassic bags and missing sholaces homeland security did not respond to my request for commen on the cinnapping situation but this week the acting head of customs an boarder protection sai the uess is quote sending a message to the criminal organizations to stop exploiting these migrants in noevoladeo the most dangerous part of these has sylum secrs journey is probably that hours rite after they been sent back to mexico after walking across the bridge their transported to the mexican emigration office by van laudside the office men in fordor trucks monitor whose coming and going locals call them losmalos the badguises one migrant told me about getting chase as he walked to a shelter from there but by far the most dangerous place as a best station it is a place they go to escape nuavell letel but it is a place sand of getting call canneppbing is routine the cartells refer to it as passing through the office on the extortion calls you can tell its a well oiled machine it is methodical they sound the negotiating the price of a ar they do this all the time i louda turns to everyone she can think of she goes to hour local police department an ter her mayor's office to ask for help they reach out to the office of sendeter cory booker but by the time to get back to her about a week later it is too late lauda eventually scrapes together money from her mamman sister but just a fraction of what the cartell is asking for et jatoi te yo te tin minosino nati she tells them look i've already pulled together twelve hundred dollars tell me what were ging to do and give me time to get the rest the man says hof confer with his bals in the meantime he says she should wire the money lauda asked to talk to her brother and they put hem on ta onoo nnta she asked ave how are you brother worried he says she tells thm do not worry that she is pulled together some money the next day the cartells release taved in his son i talk to daved on the phone three days after his release he is distressed it is hard for him to finish the sentencs respid cesida cespida greed i tell him i wanted to help him that is not something a reporter spose to say but back when there cinap their lives were an immediate danger and i helped in small ways i connected lauda with an ingio in mexico city that advocates for migranc since davide in hi son were released i've suggested safe bassoptions the family they always knew that i was a reporter during a story on them but they came to see me as one of the few people they could trust that they could rely on lauda called me almost every day with that dates she stilld oes a few weeks ago i went to meet tavit in his family in monthodey an northern mexico when they were hold up they were staying with an acquaintance of laudas an exchange for grocery money and hoped with construction davide did not want us to interviewing him there he feels his welcome has run out we do the interview at our hotel it sdavide his eleven year old son and his nightenural daughter he is also been sent back to mexico under mp p ytes is poticatic i'm here with my producer lina we figur we talked to davide in one room while the kids watched te ve in the other i wbut the kid sit by their dat on the bed they will not leave one another side i wanted to know what happened when i left him that day on the bridge and what he described were all these details of how the cartells kidnapping bus in this actually works wonte youre victim on theanside details that were routine and also terrifying here is what happen he said he and the other hundred people who were sent back to mexico that day were taking from the bridge to the local emigration office for processing after that he says tha man wearing a mexican emigration officer uniform agreed to take him in a sen to the best station they can go to a safer city but as soon as they got to the station he got a bad feeling genlen ti me o ilo me me wen i wenting wit my son this god grad me was a told gon strong fool of te tuse he grot me an he said i want a talk to you and i said id have nothing ok to you mont and he said you on not giin to the carr reanas is comequersions an i it do not and he since you can giin to the car these who were r the hard won no a le ma let them mont tem he says that least a dozen migrants also arrived at the best station that night and the cartell hustled them into different trucks all the trucks were brand knew he says he remembers that the one he got in to was a graynew sin and there were four or five other migrants in their with him he says the emigration officer who drove him to the best station sat in his car and watched them all being carted off we cannot confirm this but there is a long histery of long force ment in the cartells working hand in hand for example an two thousand eleven seven tof officials hat mexicofs emigration agency were fired a mid aligations at the agency was involved in the cinnapping at migrants and it squares with what his sister in new jersey told me she wired money to that emigration officer for davide's best tiket and when she got the ransom call they cannapfirs told her to wire the money to that same account the wone the emigration officer used she said something is not that the emigration officers account and they hung up i asked the mexican emigration agency to respond they told me they have no knowledge of recent complaints of emigration officers turning migrance over to the cartells e er and the truc davide held on to a son the cannappers did not speak i lol nigledio goacee molagavithe gid jus told us to keep er hance ton it is a stop looking at the sides and the gat who was driving us was keeping aniyh on us and he was making sure we were not chyning they had the windows sol rold at sa anso they talked over round for a while but davide suspects they were just going in circles that they did not actually travel very far they pulled up to a normal looking house with the big gate tinside the cannat presue eir self fones to take pictures of davide his son in the rest they interrogated davide about where hes from his line of work how he got to the uest and most importantly what family members he as there it was patient an take at a house clanec except for by cartel we talked about the cartellsas organized crime but i never imagine the book keeping they keep records in fotoes of the migrants i kitnap and also who they release davide says there were more than twenty migrants at the house the men an women suppd in separate rooms during the day the cannappers hit any the men who tried to look at thet woymen the room david in his son sutan had one mattress every one else leppt on the floor at night davit wul lay on the ground holdin hi son lokaasiis comagosagon in yor and gono asala la asal a would lay don we him in a corner and that would hack my son tha yor an aor hiy could not see you crying but my hes were almost folling out i one beavi they what heard le the most temly onse that when thes ty arrive the bals he would always tell me that my sons organs were good for seling that he was in a good age that he was only leven years old they da he had ono wu gu bate and my son once head the gui the sayn that he kidnis that he sawgans were good for selling and he was almost crying and i told him tont crie but i was this ber i hid ben havaon as davide tells me the story his two kids are sitting on the bed beside him neither of them is looking at anything in particular tey're just sitting there blankly dvide also seems devoid of emotion he does not at all resemble that davide from a few weeks ago the wene i talked to rite after his release now his affect is completely flat ms on the fourth day of his kidnapping when the bosses woke davit up and told him they would reached ta deal with his sister they maye hol and he said to me get up with your son fad gy this to they an gona release you gas because yous se te already paid made a the pulsin solo socomocael the man told davide if he talked to any one police reporters the cartell would come for him take his son and killed avide the same man who kid napp them in the first place drove them back to the bust station and bought them he chul tickit davie does not know what happened to the dozens of other people on the house most migrans were a kidnapped in released the cartell gives them a key word it is a past cote that indicates the migrant has paid off the cartel they are not kidnapped again bhet david is not kiven one maybe because he has not paid a high in a fransom when we met david in montaret he did not know what he was going to do on dey one of the kidnapping the cartell had taken davide in his sons emigration paper work and they did not give it back without that paper work he does not even know which day he suppose tust show up in court but even if he could figure it out he told us he is too scared to return to nowavelavelo under im p p he' have to passure the same port ofvintry to get to his hearing what if we get kidnapped again he asked last week i get a ponecov from davide the family they been staying with an montere wonts them gone and he is lost hope in the asylum process he thinks they will not be listened to that the hearing processis alive and in fact he is right about how escaseis likely to come out under this administration it is virtually impossible to gain asylum based on gaing violence davids decided to tape his family back to hunder us the country they tri escaping in the first place according to home land curity his own sitistics thousands of other families are making the same choice emily green jaser reported on to vide for vice tot cam little up dates his refirs ran this story davd returnd to

welcome to the huberman latpotcas scu science science thace to s for lii'm andrew huberman and i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls et stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is inside tracker inside tracer is a personalized nutritian platform the analyzes data from your blood and diana to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals i've long been a fan of getting blood work done and the simple reason for that is that most of the things that you want to know about your health such as hormones metabolic factors blood sugar levels et cetera can only be analyzed from blood and nowdays there also excellent dianatests that can also give you valuable information about what is going on at the celler molecular even the nerral circuit level within your brain and body inside tracker makes getting blood andian atests easy you can go to a testing siht where they draw your blood they take your diana sample or they can come to your home if you prefer that as well they have a really amazing dashboard the dashboard lets you understand what your levels of various hormones and metabolic factors et cetera mean and what you should do about them i think that is one of the main things that really separates inside tracker apart from other blood indian atast most tests you get the results back but they are no directives about what to do specifically in order to bring the numbers into the ranges that you would for your goals inside trackr makes all of that extremely simple and extremely clear if you to try inside tracker you can go to inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen and if you do that you will get twenty five per cent off any of inside tracker's plans use the cot hubermen at checkout that inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty facde per cent off any of inside trackers plans today's episode is also brought to us by athletic greens letic greens as an all in one vitamen mineral probiotic drink i started taking athletic greens back in two thousand in twelve and i've taken it ever since i'm delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take it now is that atletic greens really lets me cover all my nutritional basis and terms of vitement's minerals an probiotics there is much data now pointing to the fact that the gut microbiom and the gut brain axis is importand for metabolism and for endicran health the vitans minerals and probiotics inathletic greens make me feel confident that i'm covering all my basis i do take other supplements but withouthletic greens i know that i've got all the foundational stuff handled it also tastes really good takes find on its own you can mix it with water which is what i do i add a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice cause i a little tartness flavor in there is wealth but most pe wle just mixes it with water it mixes up supereasil ly i drink at once or twice a day usually once midmorning and once again in the afternoon if you to try at letic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen and if you do that you can claim their special offer which is a year supply of viteman d three k too there is now a ton of evidence that viteman d three is involved in countless metabolic processes hormona processs there important for over all health and well being vit him ind three you can get from the sun of course but most people are deficient invite him in d three i you go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen you will get the athletic greens you will et the year supply of viteman d three in too and you will get five free travel packs once again it is athletic green stock cam slash hubermen to get athletic greens the viteman d three k too that is a year supply plus the five free travel packs today's episode is also brought to us by monk pack monk pack is a company that makes qito friendly snacks that taste in credible but have just one gram of sugar or less and indeed they taste incredible in fact my production team here the huberman ladpodcast teases me because i shally have to keep the boxes of monk pack bars in my basement cause otherwise i'll tear through all of them i remember the first time i tsails ii here we go a qito bar i'm not a big fan of bars in general most of tem do not taste good to me ad i tasted the monk pack bars and they are absolutely ossum they come in a lot different flavors i'm partial to the carminal sesalt one but they all s have s salt are chocolate pan a butter dark chalcolate they have a bunch of flavors they are all incredible iave tried them all which is why i keep them in my basement as i mention previously on this podcas i'm neither qito nor carpo i do not really follow a particular died in that sense i eat in a way that maximizes my alertness and my levels of focus during the day when i want a work and that maximize my transition to sleep at night i basily eat lo carb qito ish during the day and i know the qeitanistas will say that i'm not in quitosis and i can manage to get into quitosis but the main idea s that keep my carbohidrates low during the day and then at night i do eat carbohydrates for me the monk pack bars are really good snack usuallying the afternoon they with a cup of coffee spushif i'm going o train soon after that or if i just want a snack and i'm going to continue working as a mention before they are absolutely delicious they also do not have any of the stuff that is bad for you no soy transfat sugar al calls artificial collors all that stuff that we know we should avoid if you want a try monk pack bars you can go to monk pack that is m u n k monk pack dock cam and enter the cod hubermen at check out and you will get twenty per cent off your first purchase of any monk pack product that is monk pack m u n k p c k dock cam and enter the cod cubermen at check out to get twenty per cent off your purchase this month we are talking all about hormones hormones are in credible and they control many processes in the brain in body last episode we talked about the roll of estrogen and testosteron to day we are going to talk about how ormones in pack feeding and hunger as well as totiety the feeling that you do not want to eat or that you have eaten enouth now it is important understand that hormones do not work alone in this context to dam going to describesome formonts that have powerful effecs on whether not you want to eat more or less or stop eating altogether but they do not do that on their own they do that in co operation with the nervous system to day i would say asmuch or perhaps even more than any other episodes we are going to hear a lot of biology but there are multiple what i am going to call entry points for tools that you can apply in order to regulate your levels of hunger your meal timing your levels of setiety of not wanting to eat more and many of this is actionable with behaviors but of course we are also ging to talk about supplements and rashing in a talk about a little bit of brain machine interface devices that can actually be involved in manipulating these incredible things that we think of as hunger and appetite and setiety the first thing that you need to know about the nervous systemside the nurl control over feeding and hunger is that there'is an area of your brain call the hypothalemus it is in the forebrain which tells you its in the fruntinger brain and it is at the base of the forebrain now the hypothalmus contains lots of different kinds of nurons doing lots of dfferent kinds of things there are nurons in your hypothalemus controlling sectual behavior controlling body temperature controlling circadian rhythms that desire to sleep or be awake even nurons controlling rage theyre actually nurons that if were we were to stimulate them would send you or any one into a rage it ther just powerful control centers for the brain and body there is a particular area of the hypothalemus calle the ventrimedial hypothalemus and it is one that researches have been interested for a long time now in terms of its relationship to hunger and feeding and the reason is it creates these paradoxical effects what i mean by that what they found was that sometimes leisioning or desrupting the nurons in the ventrimedial hypothalmus would make animals or people hyper phagic they would want to eat crazy and other lesions in other individuals or animals would make them anerexic would make them not want to eat at all it would make food aversive that means that the ventrimedial hypothalmus is definitly an interesting control station for hunger and feeding and sotiety but it does not really tell you what is going on at a deeper level in fact it is libit confusing or paradoxicl turns out that there multiple populations of nurons and there were going to talk about those some are promoding feeding and some are promoding not feeding or not eating now the other nurl component of all this that you need to know about acti as to do with your mouth ther's an are of your quartexs that sillabit further up in your brain call the insolar qartexs and it processis a lot of different kinds of information mostly informatio about what is going on inside you calld in terraception the insolar qartecs has nurons that get imput from your mouth from the pouch recepters in your mouth and insolar quartec has powerful control ov ere whether or not you are enjoying what you are eating whether not you want to avoid what you are eating whether or not you have had enough or whether r not you want to continue eating more and that has to do believe it or not with the touch or sensation of eating i'm very familiar with this in when these people i love eating much that i just the mere act of chewing now i celery sticks enough i'm not crazy about them but te yon they taste find me and i cheng on celusis but ashy just chewing on them i i could eat all day long except that it is not healthy to do that but the mere act of chewing forome is very pleasureful people wh chu gum feel this way as well and just as a point about gum or chewing if you chew something celery or cucumber slices or chew gum provided it does not have any sugar or col orat content it is not going to drive increased hunger that generally is not the case but if you eat something with sugar as we will find out it has a very specific action in the insolor quartax and another airs of your nervous system that promotes the desire to eat more but the keep point right now is to know you get these two brain aireas the ventramedio hypothalmas that is involved in hunger and lack of hunger of an accelerator and a break on feeting and you have this insolor quartex that gets imput from your mouth and cares about chewing and the consistency of foods and all sorts of interesting things that are just very tactile i think most people think about the touch receptrs on excuse me the taste receptrs on the tongue but we often do not think about the touch or tactile essence of food the thing that comes to mind just now as a i've gone to suce several times and some people really the urchin i do not the urchin there soething about at the kind of creeps me out about the consistency other people loof it 's highly individual and it is probably learned and there some proudly cultural background to this if you were raised eating urchin some people love the that a consistency or that touch touch has a lot to do with whether not you want to eat or not now let us get back to the ventrimedial hypothalmus sometimes it makes animals or people want et eat more sometimes less what is going on there there is a classic experiment that was done in which researchers took to rats and called perobiose to them to each other what that meant is that they did a little surgery and they linked their blood suppli that they were forever physically link to one another and could exchange factors in the blood but their brains were separate their mouths wereceparate and they assentialy did everything a cseparately except tht they were link to one another they walk together and go to the same places in order to do it this parobiosis experiment reveal something really important when they leision the ventrimedial hypothalemus in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat that rat got very very fat is just really obest huge rat superat jumbl rat the other one however got very thin it actually lost weight despite consuming the same amount of food that it had prior to the other one getting the leision what is this tell us this tells us that ther's something in the blood that is being exchange between the two animals because it was their blood supply that was linked and that tells us that there is hormon or indicrine signals that are involved in the desire to eat and hunger and appetite and next ware ging to talk about what those endicran signals are and then i'm going to immediately point to some entry points that you can use and you can use these even if you are not parabios to anything and that can allow you to time our meal frequency and predict when you are going to be hungry or not as well as drive up appetite believe oare not there are people out there who are trying to eat more although i think far many more people are trying to eat less because nowadays you the data just point to the fact that there is it essentialy an epidemic of diobedies type to diobedes and obisity and most every one agrees now that maintaining a healthy bodyweight enbody weight composition is one of the best pads to longevity and to just feeling very good and actualy being able to think cognative functioning is actually linked to levels of atipost tissue and forth let us talk about the endicran factors that regulate feeding hunger and sought tiety one of the really exciting things to emerge in the science of feeding and appetite in the last twenty years is the discovery of another branary not just the ventrimedial hypothalmus but s an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus and the argueent nucleus has some really fascinating sets of nurons that release even more incredible molecules in chemicals into the blood and these chemicals act as accelerators on feeding an appetite or breaks and the really cool thing is that you can actually control these molecules through simple behaviors and once you understand what these molecules are you will tart to understand why thats the case and the control points that you have right now in order to control your appetite in either direction increase or decrease first of all there are set of nurons in this arcuat nucleus called the p mo c nerons ok i dont on to get into what the acrnym stands for but i'll do it anyway it is the pro opio milanicorton system ok these are p m osenerons pro opio milanicorton and if you heard milano that should tell you has something to do with pigmentation in skin cells or in hair cells pigmentation of some sort because of melanan last episode i talk to lit about about the relationship between light dopomine and melanans y should already be thinking weight malano means it probably has something to do with that system and indeed it does now the pamcnurons make something called alpha m s h milanistite stimulating hormon alpha milanicite stimulating hormon if you do not wont to remember any of the other acranyms and terms i've talked about this episode far do chine remember m s h ok mause sam hampster m s h ok m s h reduces appetit and it is a powerful molecule are igt just put that on the shelf emesae reduces hap appetite now there is another population of nerons in the arcuant nucleas called the ag are penerons and there i'm truly nockin a read you what that stands forcause it is related to the malstrain it was first identified in but humans make these ehave these cells as well but ag are penerons the ag re penerons stimulate eating and any time you are approaching food or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety because some people actually experience a kind of heightened anxiety some people actually get a little bit of arresting tremor before they eat even if they do not hve any sort of eating disorder thi's kind of a ramping up of autonomic activity that is largely due to the activity of these ag are penerons the activity in these agi are penerons goes way up when animals are people are starved and i do not mean starved for long periods of time but i mean when they have not eaten for a while and the activity of emisae the release of emis age goes up when we have eaten however there other things that will stimulate the release of things emesage just briefly the experimental evidence if you killagi are penerons animals and people stop eating there are people of lesions they just stop eating tey become anoraxic atacually i know you are familiar with annerecy as a clinical term but that isuctually a term that is used in the scientific literature about a pattern of behavior oc as well as a clenical term of course if you were to stimulate the agy are penerons animals are people eat crazy they will eat to the point where they burst which just sounds horrible but it just tells you this is the accelerator on eating and yes as relationship to the ventromedio hypothalmus i talk about earlier but i doft want to go back theire just yet we will circle back malanicite stimulating hormon such an interesting hormon thi think can shut down the desire to eat the malanicite stimulating hormon is released from the medial petuitary we talked about the petuitary last time this is a a gland that is very closely position to the hypothalmas actually some of the hypothalmus nerons actually project their neral connections directly into the petuitary to release things ganatropens and lutinizing hormon stuff we talk about last time in reference to testasteron an estrogen but emisage is released from the medial portion of the petuitary and its stimulates the desire do not eat to cease eating what is really interesting is that malanicite stimulating hormon is activated by ultra violet light and it is not activated by ultra violet light to the skin or directly to the petuitary it is activated by ultraviolet light to the eyes now if you have been watching this podcastor listening this podcast for any period of time or you have heard me on other podcasts or you follow my instrogram i am a big fan of this whole thing of getting morning light in ordert sin cronize circadian rhythms et cetera avoiding light in the mill the night this is yet another reason why getting ample light i deally sunlight but it could be other sources of you velight to the eyes stimulates emis h this as been shown over and over again and keeps the desire to eat or appetite in check in healthy ranges this is also why in the spring in summer months animals and people eat less now for hibernating animals its different because the bare hibernane ashly bears do not truly hibernate technically by scientific critery they do not hybernate but they go into a kind of torper the hibernating animals they do not eat much cause there in burrows or dens ore there just wrapped up in a low ball or whatever it is that hiberning animals du there of course can eat far less in the winter but that is a unique cenarea we are not hibernating animals but humans generally have greater appetite in the cold winter months it is not just because of the holidays in the abundance of food that is we are presenting ourselves with but when we get a lot of sun our appetit is reduced or at least its easier to control and that is do in part because if your getting ample sunlight to the eyes it is converted into a signal for the emis h neronhs then nurons that release emis h escuses me these palm senorons release emes h and then emis h can bind its recepters and can keep the breat on appetite in check the take away tool from this is make sure you are getting enough light not just in the morning but throughout the day and yes t has to be light to your eyes and blasting your eyes with sunlight or artificial light to the point where its damaging or painful will not accelerator improve this process it is about getting photons ultra violet light to the eyes consistently throughout the day that is best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses provided you can do that safely and if you do not have access to enough sunlight than you can do this with artificial light this also points again to our old friends the blue blockers many people know i am not a huge fan of blue blockers especially not during the daytime because they block a lot of the u v and shorter wave length light that you want and need to create alertness but also to create release of emis h from the medeal patuitary now there are people out there subcultures that actually in jeck emis h that are taking emis h or thing similar to it i am not suggesting people do that but there are three man consequences of doing that first of all it reduces appetite no surprise there their actually using it as a dieting drug this is kind of in the underground i do not know what the legal statuses and again i am not proning thet people do it too it makes them very very tan which make sense right malanicite stimulating hormon and the third is it purportedly never tried it proportedly sends lebito through the roof to the point where it is actually distracting for other activities it actualy can create preopism which is a kind of cronic eraction in males to the point where actualy can be physically damaging to the genitalia this is a drug of or a i do not knwhether not's call it a drug it is a it is a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels with sunlight and perhaps artificial uv light i have not heard much about treatments for obicity involve in getting ample sunlight or getting ample uv light but to me the logic is just very clear and if youre pursuing a those avenues you might want you certainly should talk your physician but you might want to think about how some of thos logic hangs together absoly fascinating hormoni think most people are not aware of it and the subcultures that are aware of it are using it to parvery particular end points and ther using it at superphysiological levels a that is enough a about that cause i really do not know i ave talk to a few people in research will hever not for thispotges a reach out to few people and ask whether not the these aseciteffects a in erquotes i have heard about are true and indeed they are true but again that superphysiological controlling emes h it is auctually alpha emesh levels through al viewing ultra violet light seems a interesting and a mechanistically logical thing to do if your goal is to keep appetite in check emes h inhibits hunger next let us talk about a hormone peptide that activates hunger and this is a really interesting one because it relates to when you get hungry in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all and it is called grellen its spelled g h r e l i nd grellen is released actually from the g i tract and its main roll is to increase your desire to eat and it does that through a variety of mechanisms part of that is to stimulates some of the brain areas the actual nurons that make you want to eat in addition it creates food anticipatory signals within your nervous systems you start thinking about the things that you happen to to eat at that particular time of day this is fascinating grellen is sort of a clock a hormonal clock that makes you want to eat at particular times now the signal for grellen is rereduced glucos levels in the blood we are going to talk a lot today about glucos and insolen waighs to manage glucos and insolen but for now the simple version of this is you normally want your glucos to be in a kind of mop modest range and i'll explain what that range is in lubet but if it drops too low grellen is is secreted from your got it activates nurons in your brain at various locations including the piamo see nurons and the other nurons of the a rcu it it also it activates the viamach in particular ways and it might even acivate some of these nurons that are in the periphery in your mouth that actually make you kind of salivate and want to eat right at we all know about the famous pavlovian experiments of pavlogue's dogs they start salivating to the bell after the bell is presented with food you remove the food nd than just the bell constimulate the this alevation we become pavlovian at times but rarely is ever discuss what the nurl pathways for that are and it turns out that these hormons there secreted from the gut can stimulate the nurons to creat a sensation an a desire for certain foods at certain times of day you have done this experiment if you are somebody who eats breakfast at more less the same time each day let say eight a m pluserminus twenty minutes and then you eat lunch twelve thirty pluserminus twenty minutes or tlet say your somebody me who tipically skips breakfast and just eats lunch usually around eleven thirty or twelve or something that your grellan secretion we will start to match when you typically eat and it does that and it is able to override the low levels of glucos in your blood stream because the grellan system also gets in put from a clock in your liver that is linked to the clock in your hypophalmus in your brain and what this means is if you eat at regular meal times you 'll start to get hungry a few minutes before those meals times if you have ever wondered why your stomach kind of starts to growl because it is a particular time of day nlik oit i must want to eat well that is grellin and for those of you that do not know why your stomach growls i'll also tell you that to day it is actually really interesting it not at all what you expect in it is not just the gurgling of liquids in your stomic that is not what it is it is a it is actually a muscular phenomenon grellin is secreted as tha kind of food anticipatory signal to get you motivated to go eat at regular times nowadays there is a lot of interest in intermitten fasting thereis also a lot of interest in just what meal plans and sceduals and what to eat in general in order to maximize one's health and well being and people have all sorts of cosmatic reasons and brain reasons and metabolic reasons for wanting to control this kind of stuff let us make it really simple by first looking at the extremes some people need to eat every two or three hours they of this i need to eat every two or three hours or else their blood sugar drops in general blood sugar does not drop low that they truly need to eat in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue although sometimes that can happens some people are truly hypo gly semic low blood sugar but most people as the bloudsheer starts to head down towards the low ish ranges grellin is secreted and for those people not eating on the clock is very destruptive to them because it activates these naurons in the brain for people who eat once a day or twice a day or tend to shift their meals nown they might eat a lot but during a a limited a call feeding window it is condof interesting humans now a eat and talk about foods and ways that for years i used to hearabout in classes in courses and restrearch lectures about feeding animals in a restricted feeding windows and and we owe a a great a deal of gratitude to such and panda who is a collyu of mine when my lab was in sandiego at the salk institute who really is a one of the pioneers of this restricted feeding window a work and as done a beautiful work yyaza a book that is excellent call the stircedian code that ae highly recommend and he is done a lot of important work on nurons and the retna that control circatian timing but also the relationship betwen feeding windows and health and hes sort of the a major proponent out there among the major proponents i should say of circatian eating that means eatin during the daytime not at night or intermitin fasting restricting feeding windows to anywhere from for to six to eight hours i'll use myself in exas an example of the transition from regular feeding schedul to a more intermittent ish fasting although i do not really fall into true intermittin fasting i was on of these people that just got accustomed to waking up and eating about an hour after i woke up that to go from eating every three or four hours to eating twice to day lunch and dinner may be a couple snacts in the afternoon or something at first was excruciating i rememberything it this is really brutal pushing out feeding i did not think i could exercise unless i had eaten first we now know that during most all forms of exercise unless your really focust on optimal performance you have got a hitkey lifts ir you have to uno sprint at your maximum speed a maybe even then that you can exercise fast at just fine because you are mainly relying on sources golikagen from the liver some undigested food sometimes is grosses that my seem it is true as well as body fat if the exercise about is extremely long but what that means is that if you suddenly go from eating on a very regular schedul to skipping a meal or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all you are going to have grellin in your system and that grellin is going to stimulate the desire to eat by acting at the level of your brain and it is indeed at that point just mental when we hear but just mental just physicals really kind of the same thing cause it is all chemicals brain and body but it is the stimulation of nurons that inticipate feeding you are stimulating the arguant neucleos nurons that make you want to eat those ag ar penerons grellin stimulates the agy are penerons which makes you want to eat what can you do at this what this means is if you want to start shifting your feeding schedule to one where you are not eating quite as frequently and there are some advantages to that that are not just in the bile chemistry and health related a youceller health related a things but some of them include not having to think about or by food right you actually do not have to think about food all day if you are not eating often the other is it gives you a far more social flexibility right you can go to a noon meeting if you have to or you can go out to dinner at a particular time and nou i gess it makes it kind of tufgh if you want a meet somebody for breakfast cause they near the you are the doork whoise just sipping black coffee an refusing everything but anyway i've been that dork it is one of those things you just kind of work with but the fact of the matter is grellan secretion because of its relationship to the nervous system can be shifted by about forty five minutes per day now it is going to vary some of you have more called will power it but if you really wanted just start pushing that first meal out or shifting in any direction some peal migh want t eat in the early part of the day and not in the evening trying to shift the meal times out the spacing by about forty five minutes is what the the the nurl circuits that link the grellan system to the nurl circuits the control feeding really can handle because it is a form of nurl plasticity and what this would look is if you normally you eat breakfast at eight a clock plucermin is twenty minutes and you want a start eing your first meal at noon you would take may be forefive days and jus t art pushing the meal out by about forty five minutes to an hour each day it is not quite as painful or you can just take the plungin just do it all at once i have a colleague who i was a nuro surgeon at stamford came up through my lavees now at nurling and he has a great practice he keeps his grellan system at random what he does is he skips one meal per day and he makes his external schedul dictate that sometimes he skips breakfast sometimes he skips lunch sometimes he skips dinner he just skips one of the three major meals per day and in doing that the grellan system is always kind of a kept off kilter and it probably also allows him to have a lot of nurl flexibility what we call top down control just the knowledge oh you kow the hunger i'm feeling is not necessarily hypoglysemia and in his case it is almost certainly not and therefore what i'm feeling here is an act activation of these g are penerons and therefore i can push my meal schedule around hover i want now i should mention that top down mechanisms are powerful belief motivation these things can really shift nerl circuits wor in a talk more about that lill bit later but there are also people who are genuinely hypoglyseamac and that need to take really good control of their blood sugar levels an try and keep them stable and of course you want to do what is medically safe for you i'm not at all recommending that people that suffer from hypohypoglyemia suddenly you now jisrupt their blood sugar patterns in any direction that would not be healthy but for most people out there who have reasonable a bloodglucos levels a it is kind of interesting and con of fun to play with these perameters in order to optimize what you want to do and sometimes that might change across the year or with schedules many people find great benefit in having flexibility over when they eat regularity of eating equals regularity of grellan secretion equals regularity of activity of these ag are penerons meaning you w'll be hungry at very regular intervals that' something tht you can work with its grounded in deep mechanism of hormon and nurl systems and there is a lot of modern research to support what i just said if emes h inhibits feeding makes us wenty eat less and grellan makes us want to eat more there is another hormone called c c k coli cistecinan that is potent in reducing are levels of hungar now i learned about c c k back when i was an undergraduate well over twenty years ago when it was first discovered and there was a lot of excitement about c c k at that point as a diet drug any time there is a molecule or a chemical discovered in the brain or body that can suppress feeding the diet industry just goes wild an think this is can be the thing that is can allow people to move from being obes to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight et cetera a similar phenomenon was observed with lept in leptin is a hormone that is made by body fat that signals to the brain when there is a lot of body fat and in animals injections of leapt in can make fat animals thin they lose a lot of adipos or fat in humans it did not work out that way it just the studies were done and leppt in was successful in treating a certain rare form of diabedis but it really was not very potent as an antiobecity drug similarly c c k has been looked at as an obicity drug something to reduce obecity but it had some pretty unhappy side effects om ashally causs some pretty serious side effects now that is as a drug however c c k when released at normal levels by your got has a powerful effect in suppressing appetite for a period of time and there are healthy and direct ways to activate c c k now c c k is in the gitract it is release from the geitract and it is release is govern by two things one is a subset of very specialized nurons that detect what is in the gut the specific contents of the got and by certain elements of the mucosa of the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microbiom what is really interesting is that c c k i stimulated by fatty acids and particular faty acids that will talk about a meno acids and particular ameno acids that will talk about as well as by sugar now let us put sugar on the shelf for a moment we are going to talk a lot about sugar because if c c k inhibits appetite and reduces feeding and it can be triggard by fatty acids a meno acids or sugars then you might say well then in eating a lot of sugar should make us not want to eat more but we all know that eating sugar makes us want to eat far more that is the roll of lot of sugars and that has to do with a separate mechanism will talk about to day which fatty acids in the g t stimulate the release of c c k it turns out it is the omegathre fati acids the ones that come from algi or crill or fish oil a talkd about this in the appesode on nutricion and some of the things related to the gupmycrobiom un om a revisit that now omegathree fati acids and conjugated linolic acid c ela either from food or from supplements stimulate the release of c c k which then reduces or at least blunts appetite and i'm not talking about blunting appetite to anorecic levels whre we do not want to eat at all untie about regulating appetite to the point where animals and people do not over consume it is keeping appetite at a healthy level the other thing that stimulate c c k thi mention are a meno acids when we eat we have the ability to break down different macranut macranutrean uno carbohydrates fats or protines in to sugars and glucos that thn we can convert a t p an all that stuff from ancrepcycle from high school were not con to going to that to day that is for a future episode but a meno acids are one of the things that we are eating for a meno acids both can be used as energy through a process called glucaneagenesis of converting protines into energy or those a meno acids can be broken down and then rebuilt into things preparing excuse me repairing muscle tissue as well as other forms of celler repair involved in all sorts of things relate to protine synthesis what dies this mean if we eat the properamenoacids at the proper levels if we ingest omegathrees and cales conjugate linolic acids at the proper levels or get them from supplements there is a blunting of appetite appetite is kept clamped and we do not become hyperophagic we do not overeat we tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges this is very important because most people do not understand that when we are eating we are basically fat foraging an a meno acid foraging and there are several studies now have shown that people and animals will essentially eat until they feel they consumed enough amegathrees a megacixis cealas and certain a meno acids in other words even if it is not conscious we are eating until we trigger the activation of c c k now there are other reasons why we shut down eating too are literally the the volume of food in our gut can be large and we can feel very distended that is the physical reason obviously there are other reasons maybe we just have top down control we we have knowledge that this is the end of the meal and we stop cas wehave to go back to worker to a meeting or we tell ourselvesthaf we have had enough but at a subconscious level the gut is informing the brain viac c and other mechanisms when we have ingested enough of what we need and these omegathrees and cales and certain a meno acids are vital for sending out that signal that we have had enough now which a mino acids is actually really interesting we have essential minoacids hand we have nonessential minoacids among the essential amino acids there is one in particular that can trigger the release of c c k very potently and that is gludomine gludomine is a very interesting amino acid first of all it is been shown in a few studies to play a roll in bolstering the emiune system it can increase the number of killer cells in the amiane system it is can soon but insupplement form people can take it yo teaspoon of gludomine or some people take gludomine throughout the day if they are really into it or for whatever reason they think they are battling oft an infection or something of that sort gludomine can also of course be derived from foods and you can just put into the inernet put doing in an at search and find out what foods are rich with gludomine some of the ones that i'm aware aboff the top of my head or cottage cheese and things of that sort but other foods have gludomine as welt once a threshold level of gludomine and other essential mino acids are reached once the threshold level of these alphithre escuse me o maga three fadiacids and cielles are reached c c k is released and helps reduce the activity of those a g are penerons that promote feeding as you can see feeding is an interplay between brain and body and it is some of the micro neutrients and even the break down o particular neutriance that is putting the accelerrator or the break on the feeding process it is not just one thing from an actionable standpoint you we should probably all be trying to get are a megathry a magasix ratios correct anyway because they are anti deprescent i talked about the pere revieued studies on that they are healthy for the gotmicropiom and we should be seeking sufficient gludomine now whether not you decide to supplement with gludomie or not is up to you one of the reasons why one might want to do that and again you should always check with a doctor especially if you have any predisposition to kancers or you have cancer many cancers and tumers gludomine that something to note but one reason why you might want a supplement with gludomine or consider eating foods that are rich in gludomine is not sjust to keep your appetite in healthy ranges but as well gludomine can actually reduce sugar cravings this very interesting i have a friend he is an absolute chocolate sweets atit he is a groan adult but he eats candy and chocolate as if it was ouknow as if he was a fourteen year old kid hanging out at the local convenient stort it is really incredible and he as probably a a sugar adiction but he is very aware of this and he is managed to kick all other edictions for whatever reason it stimulates his brain and body in the ways that make him want more but he hates that it is actually quite frustrating for him he somebody who cares a lot about his health he took the approach that i know many other people have who know about this roll of gludomine of taking a teaspoon or couple teaspoons of gludomine several times throughout the day t ere any time he craves sugar and indeed gludomine will reduse sugar cravings some people who are really on on the ccount of qitoganic front will mix it with a lo bit of half and half and down that becaus i guss it makes it taste better to little bit chalky gludoming a sam very interesting properties but i think for most people that are not suffering from adverse levels of craving making sureyou getting the right omega threes that can come from variety of sources check out the episode we did on nutritian if you want a learn more about that and siales and making sure that you are getting enough gludomine is going to be important for making sure that the c c k signal gets through the one thing i do ant o mention about gludomine it is a minor effect but it alone can have a small increase a excuse me it alone can increase blood sugar it is not of huge increase in blood glucose but because the gut takes protines and breaks them bdown into these aminoacids and essentially looking for gludomine and things it other essential munoacids as well when you injest gludomine or branch chanominoacids there is a small but real increase in blood glucose and that is because they are essentially food and there i'm ting by the supplemental version just know gludoming can increase blood sugar slightly specially diabetic should know that it can reduce sugar cravings and just know that what your gut is doing at a cors level is it is forging it is waiting in its trying to ascess levels of a mega three fatiacid conjugate linolic acid and gludoming and other escential minoacid you are esessentially trying to eat to get these neutriants and then a signal can be deploid up to your brain that you are not really interested in eating that much more whenever preparing an episode for this podcast i'm always faced with a particular challenge which is how many tools should i offer that involve doing something new o new behavioror new exercise supplement something things of that sort and how many should be related to not doing things avoiding things it is never really fun to talk about all the things that were spast to avoid but some of them are powerful in light of the mechanisms of a given topic that i'd be remiss if i did not mention them now you understand how hormones and peptides c c k in grellan impact appetite there is one particular aspect of food that can powerfully impact c c k and i think most people i'm guessing ninety nine point nine percentif people out there are not aware of this and as to do with highly process foods there is a lot of reasons why one would want to avoid highly process foods fact if you are interested in that topic and the history of whole foods transition into highly process foods in this country i highly recommend you listen to a utu vidio by doctor robert lustig he is universy of california san francisco it is very easy to find put stamford robert lustig it was a talkhosted by stamford gives a a beautiful description of the history of this and why the food industry started packing in additional sugars and salts and turning foods into commodities is really fascinating has no conspiracy theories just all scientific facts hat's really a wonderful lectras millions of views should be very easy to find we can provide a link to that and we will there is another reason to avoid highly process foods however and tht has to do with what is called a mulsifiers now many of you are familiar with taemlsiiers even though you do not know it when you put deturgent in the laungry that is an it contains amulsifiers the the goal of that deturgent is to bring together fatty molecules with water molecules and be able to dissociate them and break them up to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort there are a lot of amulsifiers put into processed foods and those amulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions to occur that extends the shell fly for those food its candy bars and syreoles and all sorts of things that are in process foods the worst of which are the typical kind of apastries that you see the convenient store but this extends into chips of various kinds and even some meats of various kinds they pactised off into meats they have names soy lecathen and other things wire amulsifiers bad oc therere lotter reasons why they are bad but the reason why they are bad for the mechanisms that we have been talking about today is that when you ingest those foods you'r bringing those amulsifiers into your gut and those amulsifiers strip away then mucosil lining of the gut and they actually cause the nurons that inervate the gut that extend those little processes we call accons into the gut to retract deeper into the gut and as a consequence you are ingesting a bunch of food and the signals c c k never get deployed the signals that actually shut down hungar are never actually triggerd and as a consequence you want to eat far more of these highly process foods in addition if you then go from eating a highly process food to to non highly process foods you are not able to measure the amounts of amenoacid sugars and fatiasids in those foods as accurately you have actually done structural damage atd a micro level but structural leved damage excuse me to the mecosi lining of the gut now this can all be repaired if you stay away from highly process foods for some period of time but the negative effects of these amulsifiers are quite real to make it really clean and simple a mulsifiers from highly process foods are limiting your guts ability to detect what is in the foods you eat and therefore to deploy the setiedy signals the signals that shut down hungar in addition to that there is a parallel mechanism at play that i talked about in a previous episode but i'll remind you again that you have nurons in you'r gut that are sensing sugar and are sending a subconscious signal up to the brain via the vaguest nerve and those nurons trigger the release of dopamine which makes you crave more of that food to nigh have got parallel signals making want to eat more sugar making ou unaware of how much sugar you eaten and that ir dsrupting the imputs to the nervous system that signal to the rest or your brain andbody that you obtained enough fatyacids and to obtained enough a meno acces these highly process foods are really terrible and i'm not out here to say never enjoy of process food of any kind i'd be a hyppocricas i do eat process foods from time to time although the ones that i tend to eat i try and make of the healthier variety but eating whole foods has tremendous value and eating highly process food o has tremendous negative impact on the gut and on the gut brain access and recently there was a paper that came out in sell sell press journal its kind of the apacs of sell journals is phenomenal this paper showed that injusting highly process food leads to more intake of not just highly process foods but other types of food in general thre was kind of an overeating compensation generally a pross foods for people that consume these highly process foos and there a lot of other reasons to avoid higly process foods again i do not to focuss too much on the do nots i tho army with tools to do but i think this visual of certain foods and these amultifiers actually stripping away some of the critical lining of your gut and disrupting the hormone signalling to the brain controlling feeding is important enough and criptic enough meaning it has not been talked about it works at a sub conscious level and that it is important that people are aware of it they can make decisions about what they do want to eat or not want to eat for themselves before moving on i just want to say one more thing about highly process foods there was in absolutely beautiful study done by my colly cris garner at stamford exploring whether not certain diets were better than th others they looked at vigen vegetarian omnivoor i doft knoiwf they looked ot all meat or not but they looked at the different forms of diets interment fasting et cetera and they essentially found that whichever diet people adhered to whichever one they followed was equivalent to the others provided that they followed it they lost the equivalent amount of weight there really was not a strong effect of the food type or the pattern of eating et cetera however in a study that adherence is very high because people are part of a study and for many people the ability to adhere to a certain eating plan is one of the most if not vemost powerful determinance of whether or not i given diet meaning nutritional plan works now this hing about highly process foods however is rally diabolical because it truly says and i think the recent data in selmotabolism and other journals really proves that a calory is not a calory that is absolutly absurd because of these amultifiers and the contents of these a highly process foods in fact the data inhumans points to this what they dis they took a impatient adults they had total control over their food and take and they received either ultra process or unprocess diets for fourteen days is short study the diets were matched for calories sugar fat fibr and makeronutriante everything else was matchous process or nonprocess is the major variable and basically what they found is that the people who were eating the process food di happen to eat much more right this was after this period of of putting them on either diet and clamping for all other variables then they would eat much more and the bodyweight changes were much more and those bodyweight changes wore such that they could not be accounted for by just increased calories the bottom line is that highly process foods are just bad for you they increase weight gain they disrrupt the lining of your got in a way that disrrupts things ceci k and proper society signals and they contain a bunch of things in particular sugars but other things as well that disrrupt not just the hormonal systems but also the nurl systems that control the desire to eat after the diet is done there is just many reasons why these highly process foods are terrible and they can explain a lot of the ill health effects that we have seen in the last fifty years notjust in the united states but all over the world the enormous increase in diobedes juvenile diobedes it is just a remarkable how far down the path of bad we have gone and it is clear it is almost a smoking gun what the cause of this is if you to learn more about that preplease referred to the lusty lecture he also spells out why non process foods is far more economical in terms of o just that the level the household or individual as well as at the socetal level really interesting stuff a highly recommend you check it out now let us move on to some other hormones that regulate hunger and society in particular insolen now youve probably heard of insolen before insolent is the thing that is lacking in type one diabetics that is why they have to inject in solen whenever they eat the reason they have to do that is bease when they eat the foods are broken down into glucos and in order to shutdle glucos to the appropriate tissues in the body and also to keep glucos levels in check you need insolene the simplest way to think about insolent and glucos is that when you eat that food is broken down into sugars that is true whether r not its fats or its sugars or eventually if its protenes they are oxidized into fuels as we say and those fuelse can be used as the name fuel implies into energy theyre eventually made into a tep is a munch abyout chemical steps there were not goingto go into to day but that is he sentily outwarks you break down food into glucos now if your keetogenic will talk about that in a litle bit but in general you eat food is turned into glucos your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range hypoglycemic means too low hyperoglycemic means too high and what they calld you glycemic e you glycemic is the healthy range now what those healthy ranges are in general the healthy range the uglicemic rangeis about seventy to a hundred nanagrams por desoleder but most of you are not walking around with a glucosmonitor some of you are but most of you are not the more important question for us to address right now is wy is it important that glucos be kept at a particular level once you understand that keeping glucos in check starts to have a rational behind it and the ways to do that start to make a lot more sense the the reason is if glucos levels get too high because of the way that are sells in particular nurons interact with glucos high levels of glucos can damage nurons cannectually kill them you construct getting what are called periprperiferalscues me nuropothes one of the symptoms of some forms of diabedes is that people start losing the sensation of touch in their fingers or their hands or their feet and they can start going blind there is diabetic retinopathes it is very important that insolent manage your glucos levels now there is also type to diabedes where there is insolen secreted from the pancreus but people are insolent insensitive there is a destruption in the recepters and insolent insensitivity is not quite the same as having no insolen at all but it parallels some of the same mechanisms now type one diabedes is often picked up because some one has a sudden weight loss because theyre not processing blood sugar the same way they were before type two diabedes is often although not always associated with being overweight and with obecity both of them are are challenging conditions type two diabedes almost always can be managed by managing one's weight and of course there are prescription drugs and supplements that can help manage those we are going to talk about all of that but for most people that do not have diabedes the important thing is to manage glucos to keep it in that ugliycemic range and there are number of different ways to do that some of them are behavioral some of them are diabase and some of them are based on supplements are prescription drugs let us talk about those now if you eat and in particular if you eat carbohydrates blood glucos goes up if you fats blood glucos goes up to a far less degree and if you protines depending on the protine it will eventually be broken down for fuel or assembled into menoacichains for protine synthesis and repair of other tissues in bodily functions but glucos goes up and then is kept in range when you are hungry you secrete a different hormon and that is called glucugon and glucogons main roll is to pull stores of energy out of the liver and the muscles and once those are depleded you will eventually tappen to body fat and this is for people that have a typical blood glucos range that seventy to a hundred a youglicemic range the to kind of pushiin pull systems that we are goingto think about now to keep this simple is that you have the insolent system managing glucose and you have got the glucugon system pulling energy out of your liver and muscles for immediate fuel and eventually you will pull fuel out of body fat if you have been active for very long time and all your glikage in stores are depleated or close to depleated what is this all mean there is a lot of important byle chemistry in a and a lot of important cellar processes involved in weather not your anabolic or catal catablic withor not your breaking things down are building things up let us talk about feeding in a simpler way however and let us weave the tools to manage blood glucos to keep it in check as we do that let say you had a meal and that meal consisted of rice a carbohydrate some meat or fish let say a piece of salmon and some vegetable some fibrous vegeale a sparragus are cabage or something that if you were to eat all of that at once you may take a bite of one a bite of the othera you have mix it up you kow one of these at all ends up in the same place cun of people mix it all up thend you will experience an increase in insolenan increase in blood g lucose that is moderately fast isgony increase pretty quickly what is remarkable is that the order that you consume each macronutrian has a pretty profound influence on the rate of insolin and glucose secretion into the blood and how quickly those levels rise if you will make it really simple if you were to eat the rice first your glucos would rise in a sharp spike especially if it does not contain any fats to slow the absorption now that might be good if your very hungry and you want to get and increase in glucose in fact this is the reason why you are often served bread before meals because it is and sometimes its bread and butter but or chips before meals or appetizer are designed to get your blood glucos going up high because big steep increases in blood glucose tend tos promote the desire to consume more glucos and this also relates to the dopamean system in the way that something tasty in the mouth and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the mouth sugar the activation of a lot of systems in the brain abody to consume more of whatever you have or whatever is available to you the basic ideas that eating carbohydrates end or fats early in a meal will give a steep rise in blood glucose however if you were to eat the fibrous thing first a lot of chewing but not a big rise in blood glucose cas in general there is unless its laidin with sugar something were just talking about a some some vegetable fibrous vegetable that will actually blunt the release of glucose until you eat the fish in the rice but believe are not it will actually blunt the glucos increase that the rice would cause now i'm not tolking nout neuradically eating each macronutre and separately and sequence i'm just trying to give you a picture of what is happening ordinarily what this means is if you feel a lot of food related anxiety or you feel your one of these people that a you can conticense your blood sugar increasing very quickly lot of people con sens is some people cannot has a lot to do with how well they manage their blood sugar as well as some of the psycho logical factors and yes their family and historical reasons for you ow i've got friends who had lot of siblings and when they sit down to eat they have to really suppress the desire to not you do not beat up every one else at the table and take all the food it sortf not a it is hard for them to understand that there is plenty go around because of their upbring tere are psychological top down effacts a lot of t e psychology round food is gere towards getting people to be relaxed when they eat in these sorts of things but these blood sugar effects are real just celler and they sic bil chemistry of how the body manages sugars injested into the blood what isthis all mean it means that if you want a steep increas in glucos you are very very hungry than you should eat the the carbohydrate late in food first or you should eat a bunch of macronutreancs combines that would be the hamergar or the sandwich the the bread the whatever's in that sandwich all together usually that is protine and and vegetables as well if you want to have a kind of more modest increasing glucos r you want of blunt that increasing lucos than have the at least some of the fibrous thing first and then the protine and then the carbohydrate you will notice that your bood glucos will lot rise more steadily and that you will achieve satiety earlier in the meal or at least you will not get this in huge peak at sort of the thanksgiving a meal effact someof you are international if you are' tdo not celebrate thanksgiving as ha time a year where a used to be the one time a year or two times a year where americans would give themselves permission to eat enormous meals now that seems to happen a lot more often but there is this effect of your full and yet your hungry for more that is gets your lood glucos has gone through the roof and its truggar t a number of other mechanisms there is also usualy a lot o alcal consumption am and alcohol itself because it is a sugar will increase blood glucos very very a sharply it depends on the alcohol some alcalls have more sugar than others but theysly what youre trying to avoid are steep increases in blood sugar and the order tat you eat foods has it enormous impact on that the other thing that has an enormous impact on how long and shallow or how steep that curve of glucos is depends on whether or not you recently were moving are moving or start moving after you eat it turns out that your blood glucos levels can be modulated very very powerfully by movement if you did any kind of intense exorcise or even just walking or jogging or cycling anything before you eat your blood glucos lev les will be dampan somewhat and that has to do with the release of something called some people call glut for wer sound glutton other peple call it glute for these are things that are involved in shuggling glucos to particular cells and the body namely toward muscle and glakagen stores and away from body fat stores it has to do a sequestering of glucos from the blood the point is that if youare somebody who struggles with blood sugar regulation and addition to getting your body weight in a healthy range doing all the other sorts of things that you should be doing the key thing is to try and get some movement some time sirku meal now very few people can actually eat and walk at the same time although i do it all the time a not because i'm trin to regulate my blood sugar ber just as i tden to be busy i eat an drive are you are busy busily if i'm not giving this podgest or sleeping i'm eating but o except the early part of the day when i fast but the bottom line here is that if you for instance take a thirty minute walk after a meal your blood glucos will be blunted in ways that are beneficial if you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal that can be beneficial the order that you consume foods is beneficial and there are few things that you can consume that can also adjust blood glucos levels let us talk about those but i thought it was important to really tamp down that it is not just what you eat we talked about that before but also the order that you eat those things blieve or not whether are not you combine macronuterients carbohydrate's protines and fasts and fibrous vegetables and whethe or not you have moved recently the hiher intensity the movement the grater the the glute glut for increase and the more that the blood glucos will be blunted and you will shuttle more of that to glakagen and muscle stores and even just moving after a meal even just a a calm easy walk can really adjust the ways in which blood sugar regulated for the better i do not want ta perseperate on this process foods a hidden sugars thing too much but understanding now a little bit about how insolin and glucos work you can probably imagine why hidden sugars are such an attractive thing from the stamepoint of process food manufactsurers because if they can put sugar in that you cannot even taste that sugar is going to amplify the amount of glucos it is going to increase the rate of glucos increase in into your bloodstream and it is going to promote more feeding in that case youre really being tricked it is not that you are actually reaching for the additional appetizer and your blood glucosa's going up the food that you ate is actually increasing your appetite as you eat it it is a positive feed back loup do not want to demonize those any more than i already have but you should be aware that these things are happening at the level of your blood stream and brain the other thing i'd to address for a moment is this notion of stable blood sugar verses labile blood sugar or unstable blood sugar some people just have stable blood sugar they can go long periods of time without eating and feel fine other people get really shaky really jittery and w or when they do eat they feel really keyed up sometimesthyll even swet sometimes their bision will go blurry and some of that can actually be of because they become hype hypergli semac and those effects that you experience when you are hyperoglicemic are the early warning signs of the kinds of things that damage nurons and lead to the really terrible stuff they talked about before perferal nauropathes now take some time for those things to occur those nauropothes to occur but whethere not your blood sugar is all over the place or wither n ot stable can be impacted by a number of things one of those things is exercise tht these days there is a lot of interest in what they call zone to cardio which is that kind of steady state cardio where you can just nasal breathe even at pretty high output where you could may be have a conversation although i'm such a huge proponent of nasal breathing during exercise most forms of exercise especiallyszown to cardio that a you proly should not be talking a while youre oing that cardio unless it is absolutly essential but period s of zone to cardio that last anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour or sometimes more for your endurance athletes can create posive effects on blood sugar regulation such that you people can sit down and enjoy whatever it is the hotfloode sunday or whatever the high sugar content food is and blood glucos management is good youre insolent sensitivity is high which is a good thing that you can manage that blood gluecost to the point where it does not really make you shaky a does not disrupt you and it a to say nothing of the the weight related issues or the adipost a youknofhatgan et cetera that is a separate issue cause people vary there but basically doing zone to cardio for thirty to sixty minutes three to four times a week makes your blood sugar really stable and that is an attractive thing for a variety of reasons on the flip side high intensity interval training or resistance training a ka weight training are very good at stimulating the various molecules that promote repackaging of glikagen sprints have ouwait lifting circuit type weight lifting provided theres some reasonable degree of resistance those are going to trigar are all sorts of mechanisms that are going to encourage the body to shuttle glucost back into glikagen converting to glykogen into muscle tissue restock the liver et cetera depleading one's glikagen actually take some time if you do a couple sets of trysep extensions and some crunches you 're not tepleading your glikagen glikagen to pleading workouts are very high intensity am generally their less than an hour or but those are the the sort that are going to lead to big increases in the kinds of enzimes than metabolie pathways they'are going to repack glikagen and shuttle most things towards restorage of foods not into adipost issue not into fat but taking glucoses and making it into fuels that you can eccess later for more of that high intensity activity and i should mention that one of the advantages of high intensity interval training or weigt lifting a various kinds is that it also it causes long standing increases in bazil metabolic rate ind only go too far down this fact as were ging to do an entire month on on human performance and athletic performance but it is not just the increases in muscle that increase metabolism because muscle burns more energy than other types of tissues except your brain which truly burns the most energy a am is the main reason why your bazil metabolicrate is what it is well high intensity trainings what could be sprince it could be hy intencs the interval training of different kinds could be weight training also has an effact of increasing thermogenesis a even long after you have completed the exercise there is a long tail there is a kind of post exercise metabolic of fact that is also beneficial i's not in either or it is really that hygh intencsthe interval training and resistance training and things of that sort are very good for one reason and the zone too cardio is very good for other reasons and now you can see why it is just a healthy thing why most people should probably be doing exercise most days of the week a if not everyday of the week if your goal is to manage blood glucose and your goal is to manage some of the metabolic factors that control repackaging of likagin and encouraging excess glucost to not get tiverted into body fat stores we have not talked a lot about lipids to day that is because most of to days discussion is about hormones and insolent is the dominant hormone in terms of mobilizing and managing glucos in the body least for most people but fats are very important and there is just a little anecdote about fats that i think will be useful in thing about why you want to manage what they call the eldeeller dell ratios this is deserving i an entire episode many that perhaps even several episodes but some of you may me familiar with eldeells in h dells some of you may not the eldiell is lodensy lipe oprotine this is the one that you do not want it to be too high costill's dreaming he is barking at he does not that he loves all forms of colestrol a but that is just costello dreaming el dells of the ones that you want to keep low you do not want those to go excessively high h yells the hydensy lipe oprotines are the ones that are the called healthy a liproprotines that is all fin and good but you might ask yourself what are they doing what is the actual roll of these things and why would you want healthy levels of h dell and not too much el deell well one of the reasons is that fats do not water right they are hydrophobic and yet you need to move fats in your blood stream all tissues in your body need fats they need collestrals that last ep we talk about colestrol as a precursor to the exteroid hormones estrgen and tustosterone and other hormones as well well h d l and el dl actually cot fats that to allow them to be transported through the bloodstream they do a number of other things as well but h d l is a key component of the delivery system that brings those fats to the liver overies testis and a drenals in other words having adequate levels of h d l is good because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues that manufacture testosterone estrogen cortis all in healthy levels and the liver this is why when eldeels are too high what is happening is your not getting fats to the correct tissues and you can get build up of fatss faty liver disease an some of these things om can happen a high sugar content can even lead to ot that some of these fatty liver conditions that starting to happen is is yu the first time in human history perhaps that we are were of anyway that we are string to s liver conditions that normally were associated only with severe alcoholisms starting to come from sugar contents what does this mean this means keep your eldeel and h d el ratios proper you want those h d ls in order to dheliver fatty molecules to the very tissues that use collesteral in order manufacture hormones how do you keep eldeels and h d ls in their properatios well lot of people do not realize this but the debate about dietary collesteral and its relationship to eldl and h del ratios is a it is a barbed wire debate i do not wat to get into it right now there are still lot of open questions as to how much dietary collestral impacts eldiel n ah del ratios i do not want to get into that now i'm not taking a stance either way but what is very clear is that having highly elevated glucos consuming too much sugar or not managing glucos in your body through some of the mechanisms that weve in talking out up until now can also negatively impact eldel h d el ratios managing glucos goes way beyond just managing blod sugar and making sure that you do not lay down too much body fat making sur yor metabolism stays high making sure your not getting gittery at meals it also has to do with making sure that you'r creating enough of the molecules h d l and not too many of the molecules eld l that are going to disrupt the delivery of things to the organs of your body that allow you to make healthy levels of testosterone esterogen and forth if that was not clear letme make this ultra simple you want healthy levels of h d l and you want low levels of eldl because if you have overies it will allow the fats that need to get to the overy to produce esterogen to get there and if you have testis it will allow the fats and the colesteral molecules that you need in order to manufacture testosterone to get to the testis as well in order to have proper drenal function and proper liver function you want h el and el diel in the healthy correct levels now we have talked a lot about behaviral tools and the underlying biological mechanisms that justify those tools in particular circumstances now i to turn to supplements and prescription drugs that regulate the hormon systems controlling feeding and satiety there are huge number of these some have more powerful effects than others their two that i want o describe because they have getting a lot of attention recently first of all there is a prescription drug met foreman which who has developed as a treatment for diabedes and it works potently to reduce blood glucos it has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucos met forman involves changes to might acondrual action in the liver that is its main way of depleding or reducing blood lucos and it does through the called a m p q pathway and it increases insolen sensitivity over all met foreman is a powerful drug in fact i'm surprise that many people have sought it out given that most of the people that i'm aware of that sought it out are not diabetic i think for diabetics at seems to be a useful drug for non diabetics it can also of course lower blood glucos it also has the potential to make people hypogli semic genuinely hypoglycemac you really need to approach met foreman with caution iyellow concern when i hereabout people blasting met foreman simply because fasted states or low blood sugar states are healthy doing that pharmoclogically can have longstanding effects you really want to approach that with caution now thereis a comparable drug it really should be called a drug but it is non prescription that is also in fairly prominent use out there called burberine b e r b e r i n e ber berrene correct berberine is a really interesting compound it actions very much mimic met foreman let us talk about berberine for a secon burberine actually comes from various plants and tree bark it is sold in supplement stores its sold on line it is as far as i know unregulated it is powerful if you are going to experiment with berbering you defly want to toctyour doctor and you ont approach it with caution it also works to activate the called a m pq pathway a m pqu by the waystandsfor a denizine monophosphate activated protine chinas a m pq and it inhibits approachine tyracine phosphase one bee pathway i thing that is enough nomen clature it in activates a certain pathway that is associate with fasting and low bulow blood glucos the effects of berberine r as far as i can tell when looking at the literature ar very similar if not identical to met foreman now the number of studies out there on this are a many i'm just con review a few of them and their major effects as always i invite you to check out examine dot com it is wonderful websit were you can put in any supplement or compound or biological goal for that matter and it will list out the various effects and the human effect matricks o studies on humans if theyare available and it will tell you whether not their strong effects are weak effects are modest effects and it will point to the specific subject population wonderful resource berberi not surprisingly has very strong effects in lowering blood glucosts ar four studies on this in fact they say that burbering is one of the more if not vemost effective supplements for lowing blood glucosts it talks about dosages there although i'll just mention that i've tried burberine and the dosages that are typical on the bottle a of most supplements a is much higher then i needed when i took burberine two things happened a first of all a i got a pretty splitting headache it gave me pretty vicious headache for me it was a no almost immediately the other thing is i became hypo glicemic that in order to get my blood sugar back up i think i ate song ten doghnuts and i did not feel ihad injested all that much sugar it was really kind of weird ous hyper fagic for sugar outs craving sugar craving sugar and ows very thirsty is well and i do not want a promote any bad behavior but i know that certain people use thus when they have over eaten sugars are they are doing their cheat days something that i'm personally just not afanof and they want to keep their blood sugar and chackor they know ther gin to consume a huge meal they will take burbering to keep blood glucosts clamped and it does do that it has very strong effects three pure reviewed studies on h be a one sea levels h be a one s is something tha can be measured in a blood test that is sort of an average read out of your blood sugar levels over the previous two or three months sometimes shorter period but that is mostly what h be a a one s is about it ratically decreases your blood sugar levels it actually lowers colleestral it acts remember on the liver and the livers involved in collestral metabolism and remember it is both sugars blood glucosts and dietary fat perhaps it still heavily to beted ah in terms of how your blood total colleiestral h yell nel deellar regulated it seems to lower total cleestral and it seems it lowers h dell an el dell in parallel that is interesting ah one study showed a miner increase in eh yell the called good collestral in some levels drop not surprising another sti show slight decrease in eldell though seem to be kind of miner here is a kind of interesting one just help you remember burberine as if the fact that it comes from tree bark is not a on truger enough to remember it direct contact of burberine on cankersore seems to eliminate cankersor is very quickly which is kind of cool i'm anit cankersores in a few years but when i dig down they are extremely painful a do not those that is kind of interesting and there is a some study references there i've findy amazing that these compounds exist you get thes prescription drug met foreman and then you have got berbering the stuff from tree bark and they have effects that or essentially equivalent to one another again i'm not promoting their use a or even their exa exploration but those compounds do exist theire out there and check out examined ot com if you to learn more certainly do your reading do your homework befor you start just popping the stuff and if you have hypoglysemia or hyperglicingia be especially careful and also do understand that dosages and dose requirements very if you do do go down this path a really approach things carefully always a start with the lowest amount that a you could get away with for me the headache thing just made it a kno go i do keep a bottle of it in a full disclosure a in the odd chance that a i feel ye tunadoghnuts a it is not much about a not ingesting the calories is just that i do not the feeling of being hyper glisemac the blourry vision just feeling lousy i do love doghnuts other things that impact blood glucosts in supplement form cromium has been shown in twenty nine studies to have a miner i want emphasize a minor effect on reducing blood glucos things ell carnatine something we talked about here on the pockas befor terms of its relationship to a power ou' put in a t p production for both erobic and anerobic exercise as well as sperm quality and a egquality we talked about that long ago a things pannach ginsing a can have positive effects on i i should say can have effects of reducing blood glucos slightly i do not want to give a valance to or judgment to wether not's positive or negative here is something that is interesting that you should know about cafine has very reliably been shown to increase blood glucos just a little bit oso i ways thought that cafin would drop blood glucos but it actually can increase blood glucos just slightly things magnesium talked about magnesium for as a tool for enhancing the passage into sleep a in particular magnesium three an eghte and by glicenate magnesium can also have a monest roduction on and blood glucos you shuin to get the impression everything reduces blood glucos but that certainly not the case and then a couple episode o go on it when we are discussing nutrition we talk about artificial sweeteners sucrelos aspertan neutre sweet that some of those are generic names some of those might be brandnames and how they have negative effects on the got mycrobyum and that supported by a number of studies there is one artificial sweetener as a stevia est e v i a which seems to lower blood glucost just slightly and i still cannot find data on wheather or not stevia impacts the got mycrobyum in either direction a many of the things that i consume do have small amounts of stevia on them id love to know if anyone out there is aware of quality pure reviewed research as to whether n stevia impacts the gut microbium similarly or differently from other a artificial sweetners please let me know please send me the references that really appreciatet you put in the comment section on you tubor elsewhere comemensition on you to be the best place stevia seems to lower blood glucos a little bit which makes it kind of an attractive artificial sweetener if one is going to use artificial sweet nurse but remember sweet taste itself stimulates the desire to eat which will increase more blood glucoso i'm guessing that they proudly cancil each other out see afe to think logically about these things vithim in bee three some of the beevidemens do indeed stimulate appetite by triggering increases in blood glucos vidiman be three in particular i do not know of be six does things zinc seem to lower blood glucos and then there've been an enormous number of other things that have been tested for thee rolls in blood glucose apple side or vinegar anything acidic this is well known now that any kind of a acidity to be lemon juice or lime juice or appleside or vinegar lowers blood lucos slightly some of those can also have other effects that we are not talking about to day that is kind of interesting because there is a movement now towards creating a sor people talk about becoming more alkaline whon hes a a hate to break it to you but you do not really want your body to be to alkaline you want to stay in the right piatr else you start a ther conditions that make you more alkaline a you doft wanto be toacitic or to alkaline a if you see a beverage or something that a repurports that in jesting that beverages going to make you more alkaline a thats absolutely false ther no evidence for that is impossible by ol chemically is just just marketing but none the less in jesting foods that are acidic can make some slight adjustments to the piach of the gut in ways that can slow or alter the absorbtion of foods and can blunt blood g glucos you can try the sometime if you want if ever your feeling can over sugard out t you at something with too much sugar youn drink a small amount of lemon juice makes with water lime chuice and you will notice that it will blunt that kind of a hyperoglicemic of fect just a little bit again you dn't i uses as a a medical tool but a the effect is is fairly potent and then excuse me and then there are a number of other things capsasin and hot chilly peppers that will lower blood glucos the list goes on and on the most powerful one is absolutely berberine an met foreman but those that is really heavy caliber stuff and the other ones i mention have more minor effects i do want a mention because i'm sure some of you out there ar curious about the qetogenic die i'm going to do an entire episode about qeetosis and the brain and the body but the kitogenic di has been shown in twenty to studies to have a notable decrease on blood glucos and that is not surprising because you are they the essence of the of the keetogenic diet is that you are consuming very little or zer ol of the foods that promote big spikes in insolenin glucos if you consume enough protine some of that protin can be converted in to glucos of course through gluconea genesis but the qeitogenicdi has very strong support as for it is roll in regulating blood sugar which is glucos but the specific effects of the qkeitogenic diet and one particular effect that i'll address later but i'll mention now which is the ability of the the queitogenic diet to a just firoid harmon levels in ways that make it such that if you return to eating carbohydrates after being quitosis for too long you do not manage firoid and carbohydrates as well that has been shown as well worgan a dive deep into quitosis in a future episode for uquitonice does out there do not worry i certinly have nothing against qeitogenic diet actually do not have anything for against any particular nutrician plan i know it works for me at least at this stage of my life and 'll update it if i need to i'm simply trying to get you as much information as i possibly can that you can navigate through that landscape in a way that is in keeping with your particular golls now you understand a lot about blood sugar and how it is managed and the ways that you can manage it better depending on your particular needs this is also a good opportunity for us to look back at some of the medical literature because it really points to just how far we have come in terms of understanding these important mechanisms and it points us in the direction of some actionable protocols diabedes which is these huge increases in blood glucos because there is no insolen was known about as early as fifteen hundred b c which ist just incredible and the way physicians then understood that certain people had high blood glucos without actually knowing what blindglucos bloos is that they would take the urine of particular patience and they would find that ants preferably move toward and consumed the urine of certain patieants and not others and they understood that there was something in that urine that was correlated with the suen weight loss and some of the other probably very unfortunate health you symptoms that these people were experiencing they knew tht there was something in blood in and urine but you might not be asking yourself weight that is urine but as i tell every kid that i meet two things i tell kid your brain is here i make them point to their head and then i tell them do what do youknow that your urine is actually filtered blood and they usually go i get parental permission to do this first but most adults do not realize that your urine is actually just filtered blood and that is why if you see blood in your urine that is a problem you want to filter the blood but urine is filtered blood now this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine h as been something that lasted way beyond these early stages of in ol fifteen hundred b c turns out that as late as sixteen seventy four physicians at oxford university were figuring out who had pathologically high levels of blood glucos by analyzing their urine and again they were measuring the sweetness of their urine but and this is medical fact they would do this by taking ur insamples from disdifferent patients and tasting them and they developed an intuitive sens of whut excessively sweet urine was relative to the other uranes that they had tasted for those of you that are in the medical profession are those of you that are seeking out the medical profession do understand this is not done any more and you can also just reflect on how far we have come in terms of the medical profession itself in our ability to measure things from the blood and measure things from urine without having to ask ants which urine is sweeter or ask oneself which urine is sweeter indeed we are making progress as a species before we close out to day i want to talk about one more tool that many of you will probably find useful i certainly have i may big consumer of cafine although i do not consume a ton of it i consume it very consistently i'm big on consuming mate which is a strong cafinated t and i generally do that early in the day although i do delay about two hours after i wake up for reasons i've talked about in previous episode to maintain that nice art of alertness in focus i do drink black coffee as well mushroom coffee as well lof that stuff but mate also called erbamate is an interesting compound because unlike coffee it has been shown to increase something called gluccugon peptide g l p jon and increase lept in levels now we did not talk a lot about glucugon today gluccugon is really elevated in the fasting state i mention that it sort of the opposite of insolen in kind of rough terms that is a one way to think about it but golpwan or glucugon peptide jon is increase by ingesting mate and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppress it now i'm not trying to suppress my appetite i to eat as i mention before but it works really well to stimulate the brain and to give you a level of alertness and to do a lot of the things that coffee does it also contains electrolite we meaning our nurons and our brain ron on a variety of factors electric electivity and chemical transmission et cetera but they require adequate levels of sodium potasciman magnesium sh if you were to learn the biology of the physiology of the action potential the firing of a nuron something we teach every first your nursient student and i be happy to teach you if your interested you will hear about sodium rushing in to cells and petassium entering and leaving cells in order to allowd nerons to communicate electrolites are critically important for the function of the nervous system and many things that act as diaretics that promote ixcretion of water caffine can also take electrolites out along within particular sodium and sometimes the lightheadedness of the brain fog that people experience is not just because electrolits are low but becaus the're out of balance i mate because it has electrolites it has caffine it stimulates the release of this gluccugon peptie giel pe one and it is been a big help to me in extending that early morning fasting window out to about noon or when i eat my first meal it also just taste really good i do not drink it out of the gord even though i have argentine lineage the gord to me is a it is jist kind of an inconveniencs i drink it out of a mug a there is no promotional here i have no relationship to any yerbomate a plantations or ar or companies i just happen to really the stuff and the fact that gluccugon peptide one is enriched or is released more when you drink mate and the fact that go pe one can regulate blood sugar in ways that keep your bloodsugar in that a we called you got glicy make not too high not too low mode is one reason why ingesting mate is attractive to me if you go to south america what you will see especially among urguines but also argentines is people ashe carry a firmis of the stuff with them around and bring it to meals in restaurants and it is just considered cultural convention it is not unusual to see that we do not see that much here in the states but i happen to really love the stuff i brew my own am cause hat's the most economical way to do it and i really enjoy it it can be a little bitter for some people am the real key there if you want to know the mate trick is to not use water that is really boiling hot you go just shy of boil and then it doesand then it does not have that same a kind of a to tobacco or asreally acitic a flavor to it it is it is lobit just a little bit sweeter although not quite sweet youre romate gio pe on can manage in healthy ways lept in levels gluccos levels and gluccugon levels in ways that if it serves you you might want to try once again we covered an enormous amount of material focusst on how hormones regulate feeding hunger and when one feels they do not need to eat called cetiety that you have had enough as always we covered a lot but i could not be exhaustive about all the information related to this topic it is just vast for instance we did not talk about firoid hormon and extremely important hormon and pathway in the body and brain we are going to do an episode related to thiroid and tools to regulate thiroid i promise having seen this episode you will be able to digest that material with far more ease we al lso did not talk about the fact that testosteron and estrogen can impact blood glucos in ways that are opposite to one another that when estrogen levels are hig appetite tends to be reduced when testosteron levels are high appetite tends to increase ther're ll sorts of interesting interplays between the various harmons but that is much too much of a deep dive for now right now we have just focus to day mainly on things grellen on things malanicite simulating harmon incredible powerful harmon that can suppress appetite on things colicisti cinen that comes from the gut and can suppress appetite on things fudamolsifires on the fact that when youre eating you are a menoacid seeking even though you might not realize it that you are also seeking out particular fatyacids and particular the conjugated linolic acids and omega threes i try to give you a number of actionable tools many of them re behaviorable behavioral some of them are based on supplements or even prescription drugs again always do what is best for your health and do that in company with a health care a professional i'm not a physician i do not proscribe anything i'm a professor a professor lot of things and i try and share with you what i think to be the best high quality pere reviewed literature that is what i've done to day really appreciate your time and attention many of you have continued to ask how you can help support the podcast and we really appreciate the question theire severalways to do that the first is to a vidio that you have seen if you it and please subscribe to the utube channel that is perhaps the most important thing about the utub channel as well leave us ta comment if you leave us a comment in the comment section that helps us and please ask questions those questions and your comments do inform content of future appisodes we read them all except the negative ones we do not read i'm just getting we read them all in addition please subscribe on apple and or spotify or both if you and on apple you have the opportunity to leave us up to a five star review if you feel we deserve that apple also lets you leave a comment some feed back for us as well please do check out our sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of the odcast thats the best way perhaps to support the podcast as well we have a patrion account it is patrion dot calm slash andrew hubermen and there you can support the podcast at any level you and to day as well as in previous episodes i've mention various supplements if you areinterested in seeing what supplements i take and you want explore for some other supplements as well you can go to thorn t h o r n e doc calm slash you the letter you slash hubermen thorn is the supplement company that we believe to have the highest stringency in terms f what they put in the various supplements that they make in te amounts tha they put are very accurate they have partnered with the mayo clenic they have partner with all the major sport steams and we have partnered with them because we believe in their levels of stringency and accuracy if you go to f orn doc calm slash you slash hubermen you can see what i take and you will also get twenty per cent off any of those supplements or any of the other supplements that thornmakes that is where you can find out more about supplements and the ones that i take and again you get the twenty per cent discount on any supplements that thorn makes and last but not least thank you for being with us i hope you learned a lot i hope you explore some of the tools and that the mechanistic information that you learn to day will serve you well if any one that is interested in this topic or you think that some one could benefit from it pleas suggest the podcast to them as well and most of all thank you for your interest in science

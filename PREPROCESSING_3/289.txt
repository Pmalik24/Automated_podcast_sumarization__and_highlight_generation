his granddaughter discovered the messy real story of what actually happened which as you hear thres had to be allowt more interesting than the legend to day shows rerid by the way town macthenia his ou reporter everybody in the family knew it the legend of bobby dunbar the lost boy who was found whell the legen was the beckond early nineteen hundreds my grandfather became missing my grandfather had gone on a camping trap with his parents om it was on a alike swazy lake atually a swamp in lusyema and she disappeared bobby was just four years old of the time and swasy lake was teeming with alligators surrounded by dark thick woods there was a massive search that started in the swamp and spread across the country but nothing for eight months until they found him iin mississippi iin the and of mister walters the peddler in columbia mississippi they brought him home rote in on a fire trock there was a a tremendous parade wit a a fire trok on and the whole town came out and there was a band and everybody salabride ad and and he was foun thut bobby dunbar was not out of danger yet some one else tried to claim him another mother shed lost her child too and said that the boy they found in mississippi was hers there was a big trial that proved her wrong and bobby stayed with his parents percy and lesse dunbar in opolusas where he lived for the rest of his life it was a it was just a story a tale you would tell yet a your your grandchildrid which she would know she was one of them margaret dunbar cut right out of every one in the family was a most captivated by the legend of her grandfather's kidnapping as a girl she would beg her grandmother to tell the story over and over when she had children of her own margaret told them the legend too then in nineteen ninety nine her younger brother robby died in a plain crash a month later she was sitting in the den with her father and he gave her a scrap book that had been her great grandmothers over stuffed with photographs and letters and newspaper clippings from the early nineteen hundreds all about her grandfather's kidnapping i's about four hundred articles not in cronalogical order dad said you this would be a great broject for you margaret he had no idea i what o what would come of that withou t realizing it bobb had set his daughter on a path that would nearly tear their family apart but in the beginning all margaret knew was the scrapbook felt the thing she would been waiting for in nineteen ninety nine her kids were growing up and in the house less and less her husband wayn was working in a different state and only home on weekens and margaret was in mourning for her brother she had long empty days in the scrapbook could fill them but te more she dug in the more she began to realize this was not the breezy adventure tale she would grown up imagining even the simplest moments in the story when her great ganparents are finally united with their son after an eight month long national search reporters from several papers were following the couple lessie and percy dunbar on the trained to mississippi throngs of people were surrounding the house where the boy was being kept lessie and percy went inside but reports diverge on what happened next this article that says that the mother faints th the headline rads mother faint sight of kidnap child when the mother reached the house where the boy was being kept he was asleep missus dunbar made a careful examination of the lad without awakening him and was standing over the bed a few hours later when the child opened his iyes the boy recognized his mother instantly mother he cried as he reached up and stretched out his arms to her the mother convulsively embrace the boy then fainted and the second artical the headline was missus dunbarn not positive ladis for missing boy when they reached the hum the child a sleep at the time when awakened it began to cry missus dunbar looked in the dim light of a smoky boyl lamp and then fell back with a gas i do not know i am not quite sure faltered missus dunbar in fact percy and less ie both told the papers that the boy did not look their son his eyes were too small but thin the next day they came back anlessihe gave the boy a bath and identified the moles and scars on his skin and declared he was hers and according to some newspapers bobby did not recognize his father or mother either or i's brother olonzo one paper said e bobby at first meeting turned upon olonza with a scowl of anger there appeared no recogdition of his little brother and then another paper said the instant they met robert said there is my baba olonzo and reached over and kissed him it was a fraquent o carrents in the next pipers to contradict one another thit is very difficult to om to night for certain what really happen te sort out what happened to try to get to the truth of the story margaret went on n obsessive quest to small town libraries and arcives and court houses all over the sout for her birthday her husband gave her a cart for the library of congress and she spent weeks in the reading rooms there and as she dug into the historical record certain figures from the family legend started to seem real people for the first time take the mother who came forward and claimed that bobby dunbar was actually her child margaret had never given her much thought she juspend the woman trying to steal her grandfather but in the newspapers this woman has a name julia anderson she is a single mob working in north carolina as a field hand and a caretaker for the parents of william see walters the kidnapper walters claimed that julia gave him the boy willingly that his name was not bobby dunbar but bruce anderson and that they would been travelling together for overyear when julia first shows up in the papers she confirms his story although she con test them of his details the first article that hat even brought her into light and a why there was an affidaved prented william see walter has left barnsfall north carolina with my son charles b rac sind february nineteen twelve saying that he only wanted to take the child with him for a few days on a visit to the home of his sister i have not seen the child from that day to this i did not give him the child i merely consented for him to take my son for a few days walterss had been at the home of his father mister j p walters near barnsvill since november nineteen eleven and while he was there he and the child were together a great deal and seemed very fond of each other the boy would go anywhere with walters i would know my son if i were to see him and i am sure he would know me i have no picture of the child but have a lock of his hair what was your reaction her statement struck me as a very truthful statement this wome i mus telling truth she did have a son im dim my heart heart's for julia at this point believing that this boy is her son ye hos really awkward becaus lessie and julia are in the same position there both missing children from may of nineteen thirteen on julia was all over the headlines a new orleans paper paid for her trip to opolucis to see if she really could identify the boy as hers the story as wit played out in the front pages was this julia arrived weary from an overnight trainride and was taken into an opluce's home five boys around bruce's age including the child the dunbars had claimed has bobby were brought in at different times and julia had to choose when bobby came in he was in tears and was julia he showed no signs of recognition even when she offered him an orange but julia asked the lawyers in the room if this was the child who was recovered they refused to answer finally she said she just did not know and the test was declared a failure julia begged for a second chance and the next day she was allowed to see the boy again and undress him this time she felt more certain that it was hers son but her failure the night before was already national news julia had no lawyer and no money and very few allies an apolucis she left town and began the long trip back to north carolina and from that point on the boy was bobby dunbar the more margaret learned about julia anderson's life the more tragic the story seemed julia had three children by two different men neither her husband and she lost all her children in just a single year he daughter she gave up for adoption a baby who sudden death she was wrongfully blamed for and now bruce but the newspapers were not very sympathetic they implied she was a prostitute called her illiterate and naive take this article in the new orleans item titled julia has forgotten julia has forgotten i'm by derym she bady her long journey had been in vain she had not seen her son since february of nineteen twelve and she had forgotten him animals do not forget but this big coarse country woman several times a mother she forgot she cared little for her young children were only regrettable incidents in her line i see i hate this article she hopes her son is not dead just as she hopes that the cotton crop will be good this year of true mother love she has nine see how judge mental then one day margaret found a julia an derson listed on an online geneology siht with this biographical note quoe julia had a son from her first marriage named bruce who was kidnapped from north carolina when he was six years old and taken to louisiana she tried to get him back but the people that kidnapped him won him in court and changed his name to bobby dunbar well that was not what my grandmother told me that was not rng it was an upside down world opened up to margaret with the family who believed exactly the opposite of what her family believed and in two thousand margaret did but nobody else in her family to her knowledge had ever done before she went to meet and visit with the dessendants of julia anderson her two living children hollis rawls and juel tarvar and juel's daughter linda my i must lend a tarver and i'm the daughter of juel rals tarver who is the daughter of julia anyerson and she yanderson wol to be my grandmother all of us cousins grew up a we knew that we had an uncle that had been taken by the dunbar family an opolisis louisiana i we always said kidnap we said they kidnaptiam from the anderson margaret learned what happened to julia after the controversy over bobby dunbar julia moved to papperville mississippi two hundred miles east of oube luses got married and had seven children juli an hollis or the youngest now in their eatings talking to juel in hollison linda a very different picture of julia emerges than the one in the newspapers of a barely literate woman of loose morals here is linda grandmother left to read and she is to read sign gray a books and then she was set him around at night and she would tell them the stories that she had read that day but then when she became a christian she decided reading sin gry with the wrong thing to days sach they never got hing mor sin gray stories but they had listene to the bable te we went te church im ded inne be e doar her this is jul and hollise julias children and we would woll de thes wood cro know he redlo a ro su cread and go to churchh and the would be dinner dim for wed ly and we would starve to dam for go home hollison juel reviewe their mother julia didn just go to church they say she founded the church sh was a nurse and a midwife for the entire community during the depression she shewed all her children's clothes out of fertilized her bags and they were always well fed there was only one thing missing she always tot tobot bruce but she called hin bobby she was always lookin far she never forgot it never ever forgot the boy shed always watwhile bring it ip and what what a boy look an no she take a while to tailet thot he did and this that tea the it if thit would have been ad been possible for her to not te chal legally back or anything it she would have done it eif possibshe would she loved the chel she loved bruce she shely growing up you knew thet bruce was out there we knew we knew we had a e ule out a we e you thit we cannot thank it well one day we will get to go to this town and we will find it but we never did go even though marbeluc's sug gest two hundred miles from poplarville they did not have a lot of money back then and that kind of travel was expensive they told me that when julia went back up to north carolina for her mother's funeral they had to sell the family muel to pay for the triv but it was not just the cost holli says sot i reckon you would beafraid if you want no real word i knew according to the signs and things tit they had in op lucy thet de don bard well well all people dunbars everywhere if a wer you look ir's a dun bar sin on a bel in ther somthin other and people a has old sin e o was always thontit you did not mest with wut we tae did thank to mom ton well what kind of people were they to begin wiit and no if people can do that dru the lolls and git away with it o who ere we the duce try to do or interfere with something that for all the new things margaret learned about julia anderson's family one of the most surprising revelations jewel in hollis offered was about margaret's grandfather as much as the anterson's wondered about pobby it seemed he would been wondering about them as well hllise remembers the day in nineteen forty four maybe when he was in his late twenties he was working at an ice plant and poplarville and a man he would never seen before came in and started making small talk finally he introduced himself he was bobby dunbar from opolucas louisiana hollis was startled but before he could crosess at a customer came in and hollise had to rush off to work when he came back bobby with still there more small talk and now a lot of looking each other over but hollis's work got in the way again and eventually bobby left but thirty minutes after he left it do not on me what i had done you wul demand it ot been looking farfor it er for twenty almost thirty twenty seme years anyhow wother been telling me aba here is look an be straight at and i did not o non about trying to find out moll about the situation but it did not i just did not and i re get it hollise is hister jewel had a similar story she was working at a service station that she and her husband ran at a crosford's outside poplarville a man came in and talk to her for maybe an hour she says just sat and drank coffee looking only at her and asking all kinds of questions but he did not identify himself a do he la thene not got thank in mad it i said that it too i believe he wa bote when margaret heard this story during her first visit with hollison jewel back in two thousand she had her doubts but water margaret was visiting with her uncle and aunt her father's siblings and while they were in the car margaret was telling them about her research and the mysterious encounters at hollisond jewel remembered in the reria mirror she saw her uncle and aunt exchange a charged look then they told her this story here is margaret's uncle gerald bobby dunbar's youngest son i was to it'vd been ninething sixty three sode an thirteen years old we were coming back from a trip my brother's wedding an no hi since that and o on the way b act we went through mississippy and a i remember my dead sang pointin sis tho through the people that that they came to pick me up from and yes i e should i stopped and my mother saught her responded if she think yhe should and they did we stoped then he went in and a to the store and we stayd there for may be dhirty menute she sho nd he came back and and we left margaret the granddaughter of bobby dunbar and linda the granddaughter of julia aderson interpreted this erecoincidence differently theyd been discussing margaret's research on the phone and online since they first met on the one hand they were ideal research partners since they both were singularly fascinated with the story but on the other hand it was on uneasy alliance here is linda margaret is totally convinced that it was bobby dunbar all along i was totally convinced that it was bruce anderson al along we understood that we were both coming from from different angles again margaret but what was there to do but but hads ye now and yet we tried to do it very civilly for months agreeing to disagree gets old fast the difference is between margaret and lenda came to a head an columbia mississippi when margaret was invited to share her research at the historical society in town the sound her hearing us from abidio of the event in the front of the room were julia anderson's children hollis and juel several times during her recentatio margaret used phrases this jilia hands the illegitimate child of a domestic julia anderson julian holis bristled that was their mim she was talking about margaret went on to described julia a character in a story working in the fields with course hands and bare dirty feet and she made it clear that she did not really believe the anderson family's version of what happened that bobby was bruce but her own familyes that bobby was bobby son of her great grandparents percy and lessie dunbar when julian halwas got home and told linda what happened she got mad i truly do not believe that when she spoke and and the way she spoke i do not believe that she meant to say it to be is derogatorias we took it either if you wanted ow the truth she had spoken the truth of julia anderson ad a children out of wedlog she was ia a loose woman out would which if if you have to accept that y have to accept it but i wanted hard to see it from my point of view i felt she looked at it from her point of view long it was my turn and i do not remember if it was a written letter or emale but i told her the very woman that you maline at that meting to day ca very well turn out to be your great grandmother she said to me again margaret you need to look a lot more clisely you keep wanting to know all about julia you ned to look more unto lessie and parcie and judge their characters and that did not make me happy at at sort of anger to may i o tat taf er sat i that an rahry spat she was absolutely riht i did not a ti put cown what i believed and be aul to look at it with frah i coming out what margaret discoveries lus the kidnappere speaks at's in minute hims cog a ba blogadie went o progham continueus this macking life myr glass our story unravelling the sentury old mystery of what happened to bobby dunbar continues again his tomic thenuon by two thousand three margaret had been researching for four years she would taken all the articles from the scrap book and all the articles from all the libraries and tiped them over twelve hundred total margaret had maps and photo albums and capery cordings and books on her shelf social history of the american alligator that year she started looking for decendants of william walters the wandering handy man the man who kidnapped her grandfather in ineteen fourteen walters was convicted of kidnapping bobby dunbar his lawyers appeal and the state supream court ordere o re trial but incredibly because the first trial cost the town much money prosecutors decided to drop the case and stad walters was released in two thousand three margaret opened up something called the walter's family genealogy book she pored over the names in the book and started making fone halls i'm jan cooper and i'm the great niece of william cannot well walters we always cold him uncle cant i never knew he had william cannot well untill all this came up he was always uncle cannot we met with jeane and her sister barbara in sovana georgia just hollis and jewel and margaret they would grown up hearing the bobby dunbar story too only their version was a little racier well the story we heard was at this o miss julia anderson was a fine young lady but most of fine young ladies get in trapped and i tell you what his many a handsome young sweet talkan men come aroun and an trapped em that is what happened to miss julia as the story went now i know it was rumored that uncle cannot was the father and one of his brothers was the father could a been uncle bunt he was arounder he was a real rounder but om they all nied it they said it was another feller jene and barbara grew up on a farm in georgia with their ailing grandfather rad william walter's brother after getting release from jail william walters had gone back to his life as a tinker a travelling handyman tuning pianos an people's parlors and fixing organs and country churches and at least once or twice a year his travels would bring him around to his brother's house for a visit seein uncle cannot come with his wagon a trinkling an abouts in the pots and pans of boutsin against each other but you could not help but know it was unle cannot but grandpaul would lighten up oh he would just brighten up there is cannot there is cannot youngirs pussible wood on't to fire go to wuts on the kitchen fixives om supper you would always come about dark every time i remember him coming it was about dark was not it bobby niht it ten matter if we would already had supperin to far goine out and stow we had light up the fire cook uncle cannot fix uncle cannot from some supper he could sit with grandpa tile midnight but each an every time he come and he would come several times a year and stay a month at the time and er three two to four weeks they set and talked over the case of the kidnapping and how innocent he was it was it had just happened during one visit jenian barbar's grandfather asked william walters what he was doing travelling around the country with somebody else's boy in the first place walters explained that julia was en dire straits and she could not take care of bruce and he was planning in bringing the boy back once she got on her feet and also there was the business element uncle cannot to grenpaul it with that little boy with him people were not nicr when he stopped spend the night gose she would stop along the road at farm houses and ram and his travels and ask for a noght's lodging and hay for the horses and then he would do things for them seing ta pianofs orgager whatever and man he said with that little boy the mother's just could not wait to get ther hands on the little boy and feed it been cudly been bathie in in fact a woman told me one time she had a neighbor i i get noth the beaten bath bitte kind of explain it that was ugly as home made seein an she was all e time will not take her little grandchild with her everywhere shopping and to the grocer's stor and walkan and askit wl why dos she wont a carry him along with her ald tic well she is ugly it makes she look better to have a little child along with her su i could ave gould a good cannot havein that little child especially the ladies in the house where a lot nic this a tay defence file it sir bat a copy margaret had also track down the granddaughter of william walter's lawyer who had saved in a closet the complete defence file from the kidnapping case when margaret heard that she dropped everything bought a portable scanner and showed up at the woman's doorstep she spend a week scanning the entire thing and then four months back at home tiping and deciphering it the defencefile was a gold mine it had correspondence from the governors of mississippi and louisiana hand written letters from julia anderson and dozens of sworn affidavids from mississippi residen's saying that the child was bruce anderson and that they would seen him in the area with walters months before bobby dunbar went missing and then there was this letter written by william walter's himself just days after he was arrested and thrown in jail a dres directly to percy dunbar who had just taken the boy home with him i see that you got bruce but you have heaped up trouble for yourselves i had no chance to prove up but i know by now you have decided you are wrong it is very likely i will lose my life on account of that and if i do the great god will hold you accountable that boy's mother is julia anderson you ask him and he will tell you i did not teach him to bag or bom but inasmuch as you have him take good care of him you have a lost robert and me a lost bruce may god bless my darling boy write me if i do not get lynchd i think you will be sad a long time but hope not too bad the defencefile was four hundred pages of evidence that directly challenged margaret's family ledgend and pretty soon margaret reached a breaking point t toward the very end of of me tiping the defence file which was not in chronological order i'm i came across the latter at that totally ah it was my peffany it was the letter written by a christian woman i dont even a har name she just signed it a christian woman an it was threaten to the attarneyis of william wall tars an it sas im kindly pardon ma i am ell an bad but this matter has just worayed me dear sir in view of human justice to julia anderson and mothers i am prompted to write to you i sincerely believe that dunbars have bree anderson and not their boy if this is their child why are they afraid for any one to see or interview him privately i would see nothing to fear and this seems strange the dunbar's claimed that the letter goes on for six pages laying out a point by point common sense argument that the dunbars have the wrong child why have not pictures of bobby and bruce been printed side by side the world could see whether they look or not why is julia judge more harshly for wavering than lessie when neither of them recognized the child at first which gets a christian woman to her biggest point a look back at that fateful night in mississippi when the dunbar's first saw the boy and did not recognize him until lessie gave him a bath and saw his moles and scars if this had been their own child and he had been gone eight months to you think his feaktures would be changed that they would not know him only by moles and scars this is a farce if the dunbar's do not know their child who has only been gone eight months by his fetures why they do not know him at all breasan by reason by reson this woman is giving me every and she apparently followd this very closely in the nase papars and it just simply doned on may oh my gon she is wriht this what a farce what a farce this is the idea for a deona test had been floating around for years but margaret had not wanted to do it unless all her uncles and aunts bobby dunbar's children agreed to it and then four years into a research a reporter from the associated press allan breed got wind of the story margaret remembers being in the room when ellen asked her father if he would consent to a deonatest she was startled at his answer yes he said he wanted to do it now hed waited long enough margaret's father bob dunbar junior was bobby dunbar's oldest son he would heard the legend of course but hed never heard it from his father it was not something that we discusseat home it was just the the stuff was in the addi newspaper articles some pictures it was suff that my mother gathered in at home we never discusstd but bobby had been watching margaret's research with interest remember he would given her the scrapbook that got this whole thing started bobby had just spent weeks in the hospital with congestive heartfailure and explained his decision this way in a letter to his family daddy did not have the science of deonae to confirm the decision of the court in his youth i feel it is my responsibility to achieve that before i go the easiest way to do the test would be to compare the deonae of two different lines of dunbars some one from bobby's line since his identity was in doubt and some one from his brother olnzofs line since there was no question he was at dunbar bobbyd margaret spoke with elonjofs son david and he agreed to do the test the plan was to keep the result sealed until all bob sibblings agreed to open them a month past i calm to chack with the laboratory and the laboratory assistant i'm and di not blarding to may the results on the over the fan the deanay did not match yen as far as she was concerned it was a paternity test you now im she had no idea that the umpact of what she was saying to me it was a shock to me not really that the conclation to hear it margaret got off the phone and drov ten hours that day to tell her father and person he was still in the hospital it took my breath away and i was i just did not i had not considered that my thought was to prove the deady was bobby doneboy soi iit took me well had lot a time i i was in the hospital a wile and i i jus pondered di you knowin i if if if my past is wron bobbe done bar all the legends all etories a in a and and ten all the sud you fund out well that is not that is not who your blood says your what is that leave no wh is if if my rampal iys in my grandpa who am i bob siblings had no idea hed takeng the test and that an ap pe reporter was preparing to write an article for the national wire bob had to tell them and when he did they were all stunned and really mad mad at bob but especially mat at margaret who they blamed for orchestrating the whole thing and making at national news margaret's younger brother swin explained what it was yes she was really going up against the entire family you o i e cluad myself fact id not sure of any family umber that was ford a ou except for her and possibly my dad im e knone and retrospectin es she was doing what she felt adry but a fellow she as alienating everybody else o doing when she was i the other thing about all that is some of us i an the family i and probably ven me at one time probably fellow she was being little selfish im we why you no do this wha you need to do this yow nowbo the family once to nat after the story ran on two thousand for a thick silence to sended between margaret and her relatives and that skhism has persisted to this day when she told them i'd called her about doing this radio story the relatives were furious they told margaret that yet again she proving that she could not be trusted they said she was disrespecting their heritage and destrorying family relationships they told her that they were dunbars and that is all they wanted to be pbut the other two families involved took a little better virginian barbara cooper the great nieces of william walters it meant their ancestor was not a kidnapper which was nice to hear you do not to think if you peopwud being guilty of something that and we did not have a lot botl tey we had many people bid with it was falsely accused the ones that were accused very easuly yelty pruent and for the anderson's it was literally the answer to a lifetime of prayers margaret's father bob and his wife a melta went down to mississippi to deliver the news in person to lend the jewel and hallis we did not know what was a i said be there youwu have son they would tell us what that we got to the meeting and now he told us that de dan a had been ron it tit he was not e donebar and that is where has we oll jis i got up from whower setinon the couch o we ron ot think i hoped id make just knowin thet or and we family we jus family when on bobby

welcome she would received two days ago from the andersons in poperville is hard to miss jilly anderson's children have done nothing but welcome an embrace ma into their lives and they think that i'm brave and smart and william walters family thinks that i'm a wis i think from my family when i started this project i thought that this wood sort of keep bu bonded and it did not it cet it it divided an away i feet failure there are people upset by it and on there are some people who stild on except that the truth it is they do not believe me they do not they do not believe me the disappearance of bobby dunbar blew apart the lives of thre different families but the people you would think would be hert the worst biit actually come out the best julia anderson before bobby's disappearance she was a field hand in north carolina on her own not making enough money to feed her own chiald the people she worked for mis treated her the man she married shot her in the foot the night after her wedding

known fixtures in the boplar vilarea he an bruce stayed in people's homes for weeks at a time while he tuned pianos and repaired the church organ and when william walter went to trial these very people at least twenty of them came forward to testify to his innocence and that is where they met julia the mother of the child they would known and cared for who was also there to testify for walters after the trial julia had no money and no place to go the people for mississippi took her in it was almost she was adopted just bruce was taken in to be bobby and both on were given a new life

promise her that jus said come home with us come home with us to you get on your heet come home with us thinkin can get up and do for yourselve i cannot regret it i cannot regret for one menute that she came down round sad that that she did not have that child and i do not believe that she would ever made given the opportunity say in o cat wild give you a new life if you give us this child she had have never given that child a i do not believe that but if you hate that it happened then you hate that you are if that mates any sance and i do not hate that i am i'm i rejoicing that i am i rejoice in the family that that we have got and i feel grandmother felt the same way as for the consequences for bobby even juli anderson's children ollison jewel figure he was probbly better off with the dunbars i do not want to putyt him down o my mother down either what i me she did best she could wit what probby she had to do wivh the yearsome people it he got all the wagon to get in a car thome and closed her the divorce papers i promised i know that these her official cropies because the notary sals are raised the divorce papers of ercy un less ie dunbar a brief but even the barefactor enough to imagine what life in the dunbar family was for bobby after the trial was quite lessie and percy separated in nineteen twenty meaning five years after the court affirmed that bobby was hers lessie left him her husband and her other sent alonzo behind and moved to new orleans bobby was twelve and alonzo was ten also in nineteen twenty percy beat and stabbed a man while on a trip to florida on the eighth anniversary of the day of bobby's disappearance it is court record for this assault is included in the divorce papers lessie makes accusations of repeated in ongoing in fidelity but percy denies the charges elsewhere there is another court record that corroborates lessie's claim it is in a rest record for percy on charges of a dultery in cohabitation but perhaps the most compelling detail as a handwritten note that accompany's the packet it is from lessie herself to elizabeth her granddaughter who took care of her in her old age this sas for elizabeth dunbar t to read after my death she may know why i stayed in my shall of grafe shet stayed it hershell agrief i think she had to hive on some level known and maybe she did not i do not know i think maybe she was in a denial ar entire lie i from everything i've heard she truly believed that this was her son bobby but i cannot help it but wonder that maybe underneath where you go and cannot talk about she must have known that this was not her son that she birth and this is probably at the heart of the dunbar family's unhappiness with this story what it suggests about their ancestors and their ancestors motives and characters it is likely to me that percy must have known somewhere inside of him that this little boy he took from mississippi was not his sin and i do not say that lightly it took me it took me a long time to come to that conclusion i'm after reading all of the articles and the court records i'm thes divorce papers i realized that if he was capable of doing these things if percy was capable if he could stab a man if he could be with another woman while he was married e naw he lies in this pa percy e im could he lie about this child did he lie about this child he had a motive to save his life's sanity could he di that i think he could i think he did it charged to look square in the face of this and doing has put margaret in her father bob at odds with the rest of their family but bob says only by looking at it squarely can you see the re demption in their family story when bobby dunbar was eighteen he fell in love with ha girl from nearby town it took him nine years to get her to marry him but whent she did they raised four children who all remember very happy upbringing full of love and bobby dunbar gave rise to this family despite all that hehad been through whisked away from his mother at three living in a wagon with an old man huddling by fires in the woods at night a two year long gauntmet of undressing and parading and sobbing and staring and when that was all over his new family fractured and fell apart and once again he was abandoned to come out of that to create a family after that to bob is a story of triumph i feeu my dady gould have had all excuses in the world to be a drunk in om child a bus yerar anything a rascal he had a terrible tramatty young life but he chose my mother and he chose to be a family man that was his world that with his life and i assurlylieve that those experiences for hen and for mother who lost o a father before she even knew him wha forcees did gravitated them towards one another and towards a common feeling that ynow they would be fam i realize tat i grew up in it chamed and vamily and everybody cannot say that and that could not say that but he made that adviment for us ats wazy lake there now houses were fishing chacks used to be margaret standing on the congry bridge that replaced the railroad trestle looking out on the embankment where they found the four year old footprints in nineteen twelve after considering what bobby dunbars tis appearance did to everyone in three families for a hundred years there is only one person who is not accounted for if bobby was really bruce what happened to bobby i think he fell off this bredge and was etin bon alle gater and died that is the mice likely senary i when you think about who the boy that died here to that peelike your grandfather it is my grandfather became two people he was fairly bruce anderson thats who he was born that is where his blood came from that he lived bobby dunbar's life in nineteen thirty two when bobby dunbar was twenty four he was asked to look back on his kidnapping the linburg baby had been stolen and some reporters came around for a word with the famous kidnapped child of yester year a lot of people still believe i was eaten by an alligator bobby said in the interview i can assure you i was not he went on to recount a memory of being with william walters on the wagon on the road before the arrest before he was recovered by the dunbars in the memory there was another boy with him who fell off the wagon and died and was buried there was a theory put forth by the prosecution at the trial that william walters might have been travelling with two boys bobby dunbar anbrews anderson this would explain why two boys had been lost but only one was found it would answer the question what happened to bruce nineteen years later in nineteen thirty two bobby had taken that theory and made it into a memory a memory which might have served in other purpose altogether if bobby dunbar is to fully become bobby dunbar then bruce anderson needs to be dead maybe it was by settling on this memory the other boy on the wagon that he created the legend he needed to begin his new life his own legend a bobby dunbar heto

everybody i re a gloss here se hereit or programe during thse weeks of protests and sorrow in the wake of the killing of george foid we thougt that today we would of for a different way of thinking about where we are and where we might be going and we would rerand our show atat af for futureism which is a way of looking at the harsh realities of the present that at least has a little hope biltin we first ran the show rite ifter a very different kind of violence and very different protesters that were saying today this is back in the summer of twenty seventeen just one week after white nationalists with tortes marched in charlott's mell and whites su premise as deliberately rammed his car in to a crowd cilling woman ame heather higher this is in all our heads as we made the upposide your about to hear all of us ontin to feel some shred of hope here is that original show from twenty seventeen tis american live rw sy chicago e cke can be level i this is we about how much about i alt now ongo when my cor workers here at the radie or sow kno drumming an i feel trit ofo adolphia i we are going to a malcolm comics and coffee it is comic shop it is a comic book store ye and also e cofesa then i got that from the yes but it is it is i think the first our comic book store owned by a black woman on the east coast when the east coast i have to add that i think we do we here cans recently kneels got really interested in afor futurism and it is whole interstection beteen afr future ism in comic books the founder somethng called the afor future is am net work it speaking at this comic store on this particular day andwat exactly is affor futurism neels from praping for this question n under this i this i this a long winded academic wiccopete explanation which i've never even been ampled sinternal iyes or remember honestly if we ring honus what i about ou for futurism is it seems very it is this way of talking about black people in a way that is really hopeful it thi idea that we would be engaged in the same kinds of things that science fiction writers have always talked about that we would be engaged with trocnology that we would have a future on space that we would master time travel tha we would have a future in in utopian ore dis topan landscapes it is surprty this o that science fiction thit is reug just the tipidi isper and the science which a prite is meaning ful because while theree been whack characters in sypiht for a while now promise never the potagonist the neverthe one's driving the action and for long and many imaginings in the future in much science fiction there were no black people at all which as no points out makes no sonds he says you can tell black people can make it into future cause theyv survive much already over the centuries whe things that sort of really specific about ou for futures in that i is that it takes an account that pass in a lot oways it imagines that in a black people tforms of survival through the slaves trade through persecution that that is almost the technology in it itself the ways in which we come through those things ow i say thes srfival skalles ye and that everything tht's been a part of our culture has made it possible for us to pave away for the future that is the thing that i li about it i think the feeling despite whatever trials or trevails you come through that you will exist in the future that r that just cono makes me it makes me cona lik love beit makes me feel what i love about tin black oye we can get though this ten have known about for ever yeos thays are now called out for futurism olds will stop parliament funcadelics pimped out shif be rides doutor pace which predates the term by twenty years r we have ryi o e mome latlyo see lots of famous black people

coats the story about androids shings about spechip o san comics n an iron filled up your frecomics after all the thing it neel was must excited to see in the comic book story was the new iron man where ind if you heard this in the comics tony stark is in a coma replaced by a black tean age girl genius and she invents a suit that is comparable the tony starks iron man sut which is my favorite piece of fictional t acknowledge anyway it he plaints thot replacing tony stark with the black tean age girl that peers is right into the ack reacter heart of the techno superhero siphie pantheon i may think about who tony stark the original iron man is ishe is a wealthy white man he is a millionaire white i us unattainable ye it is great to have a robat suit and save the world but how do most people imagine themselves in that contects ye wheres this girl her education takes her to this place that a a billionaire once was that thats i mean that is inspiring is moving i do not know maybe in being the i was thinking about it a lot and wise my interest been sparkd much recently i've always love science fiction ri but the idea that the idea of black people in scienc fiction af peals to me now because of that notion of telling your own story because the wat black people are talked about it is often oblique future and i d a bleak presse ye a bleaqu present and may be no future at all you knowman n and i may think about it i mea if your i do not know i mean now t maybe not everyone feels his but i've been watching there is just the lot of phidios of terrible things haffing to plac opl it just i mean it is literally almost the jonra and and there is got to be a parallel narrative a me this got to be a parallel nanarrative and i think for me that the parallel narrative is affor futures and i do not knowit is it is a way of feeling iit is harf me to say this without laughing at myself but it is genuinely hopeful in a a way of feeling hol we sat on a ger way too long talking

eh heh ocas my thinkhen is our thinking is ubsence i know really very loitle about this about after future is m and i think i a little it more i ga more our plan is that i'm going to go away at lweast to half way through the show and you will stick around you ave not justbeen i've been writing pieces in talking people al over the country about this tok i have a little bit of a grass onet i cannot i i'll see you half way through till then om i'm going thrssomsifi here you have the con i appreciate that i sthey were t a acked one metropolis now i sthogted really puzzling overe affor futurism a couple of years ago when i went to an affor futureis m conference in new york ipuntill that day i'd mostly heard the term use to refer to musicians sunra what a science fiction by sanmuel telany o colson white head but at this conference they were affor futures artis designers programmars fil makers fashioning to heelers yogenes it was even a woman selling home made hot peppersauce in the lobby i began to realized that afor futurism was not an art movement in the way that i thought of tubism or impressionism it was not static or rigidly define the people that this conference who were liberally applying the word were doing because they thought it made their work seemed somehow more active and vital but i did not understanding tavery how as the term became more ubiquitis and the ner time suse t affor futuris m to talk abouk beyond sas mordrol changes i was still tryng to figure out the assince of the thing lik what makes something affor futurist i called the woman who would given the keenoter drass back of that conference in twenty fifteen actifist and wrider atrian marie brown adrian told me that if i wanted to see afor futurism that i should visit her home town to short michigan a postapocalyptic city she said the auto industry is nearly gone the city's infor structures crumbling many people can aford basof resources water and ligkt it is the setting for some distopian siphy story as soon as i started reading up on the place i came across the headline in the detroit metral times inside and goidle floors af for futuris to mayoral campaign well it was a woman running fom mayor of detroit and the basis of her platform was not socialism or libertarianism it was affor futurism i flew out therge to hng out with her i got to hear do some fun raising give speech talk to some betuch of loters and we drove around the all bet different types of arcul tachin here in goodi strikin an e eccaly styled and glamorous yet still very bohe an when at the shock of gray in her perfectly proft hair i dofnshe pointed out her favorite landmarks we visited a compact erban farm thay make something edable called afogam we drove past the spot and detroits north end we george clinton's band parliament foncadelic plate one of his most iconic albums george clenton ded i create the mediship connection in detrates and he profimed at yer ot i ben avene wic thistreet er ot migt now taking a reporter around and dragging about your home town is what you would expect from any one running for mayr but t was along before anger the afro future as showed up as well the mothership is this wonderful simble is of our future space and it for me its this reminder a a this impowring futures tas that can o the possibilities iv and how it is always pesents we were talkeng about stuff i knew i grole lhistening th parliament records too and reading the comics on the outum covers i lways thught it was cool ground breaking stuff but when inger talked about it shes killed it up to something more grand and spiritual and a little eseteric to be honest i found her a bit difficult to follow on this and other topics but with her enthusiasm she was just fund the listen to anyway i came to detroy to find out about our for futures and here she was one supereager and ready to talk about its whether or not what she said made sense to me i my a my orientation iter wit in our for futureis and has always been cosmic an a'm a cosmic person here she is discussing time time can be defining twenty milly different ways theking go diagonally up akin go dagnaldown below our feet an in just in the universe to mate and here she is on the subject of lunch pleasure postu resiny all through the future through your movement into your world a a pleasurable experience for me eating wise to be eating a great green sai a god a time travel a little myself here and let that ingre le flor did not win the primary she never even got on the balat officially when i was there with the election rapidly approaching she was still sorting out her policy points she talked to me vaguely about reviving to trots creative economy to rival the glory days of motown and about the city's liter problem two days before the primary she published a more thoroughplan that called for among other things a universal basic income for detroiters paid partly in digital currency i guess that is pretty futuristic but at the heart of ingrrd's campaign was an idea that i found far more compelling an any specific policy sheput forth in her plan for detrot she rites in order to manifest true revitalization we must consider the histories and op pressions of the black american population the foundation of every institution government police education the museum whis built to silence disalow this place and render powerless black americans these institutions were never created for black americans to truly prospers tit is time for a new plans that is not something you heare from many politicians wut make sense here because the troit his eighty per cent black fixing the city means fixing it for blackpeep angradse's black americans as the pretagonists and the story of detrot his future end its pass when i was groing oup people love to say as i a hundred and tempers than black it was is tuperva it was jus black this was the other thing about angre maybe she is idealizing i wouldn' know but she carries a shining vision of e troit is past with her everywhere she goes we drove past vacant houses and empty lots much of detroit is folling apart neglected or abandoned but underneath it all she still sees of vigment city populated with a thriving blackmital class g up i walking e is cak a dust dereby people writing ba jogin lan squash i dast ge getting we a dark an i my mother and i we colk om la me comfortable an da wacking git is wed in the car we talked about aut for futurism at one point i told her about the conference that i'd been to and how by now i'd heard the word affol future as amused to describe everything from comic books to contidence but it was not coming into focus for me i was sordin o wonder if it was just a term for putting a positive spin on anything a black person has ever done or whatever de but i was moved by the optumism that seems harrent in aters of bat i was also this gets everything e what is the point of it b sut i wis e dlat i magining an a mor holtie casin an ticha and inde e can casilizing co that i a carring anstat o eco ma its way a o o ian a o sawa ateling an oi i ca to i everyt its tarcle a pesnt a it is away a alain asoun o shepsheto a commini whatever comes a way hingred eventually dropped me back ot my hotel earlier sheld givehin me a greasy brown back continug a cooky which i now finally got around to eat ing it turned out to be the most delicious glutinfre ca he had ever tasted but i was still feeling hungry and a bic confuse by our conversation whatever bigger point shehad been making about aut for futurism i was afraid that it been lost on me i whont looking for burger and a stiff tring to mall it over at a bar over burban i met a guy that i'm good call sam with dark skin and hand sof gray in his sideer ans that betrayed his boyish face he was dressed for a nght of the town light blazer berberry shirk pattered silks car i asked him and another patron both to troit residence if they heard of ingrir the floor for mare they had when sam got up to pay his check after we would only been talking for a few minutes he surprised me by asking if i wanted to go with him to check out some of the other spots around town i was not dressed for it and ihad left my recording equipment on my room but with a hell sam said it was locaye for me to describe what happened next sam had a nice car and mercedes at never cost him more than ten dollars to parket in a lot he loved that about the troit parking was cheap he' moved here from new york some time in the late nindies and fallen hard for the city as we drove he talked up the real estate he talked about his job and the itea business he ran out of his home thing seemed to be going well we met i with sams frund rick a bawled beirded alphamale type in a reddish leather jacket and followed him in his new beam w to a place called the greo it was the type of establishment was commonly referred to his grown an sexy riccorded another round of burbon and some wings and floatered with the bartener by now was clear that these gots were looking to be women and tha was weird because of this thing that sam had told me earlier while we were in the car together he said that not too long ago his wife had gotten sick and he would taken care of her for a year and then she died leaving sam and their teanage son with only each other sam did not actually want to be doing what we were doing to night this was only his second time out as a single man he did not feel ready to meet women to date but he also felt it was time he could not wait for ever he was doing what he felt he had to do to move forward samon rig took me to a few different spots that night but the one that i remember the most was a place called floods from the outside it lo li e a common family restaurant i thouht it was closed until we rounded the corner unsi the cluster of people leaving their cars with ha valet inside floods was huge sam said was pbbbly about twenty five hundred square feet ia mass of bar separated two rooms i one point it was both a band and the dege playing simultaneously and wallto wall it were well dressed grown up blackfolk dancing and seeing along to classic soul fonk an arby it reminded me of how angred had descrived the detroit she grew up in and its thriving black metal class a hundred and ten per cent black she said superblack just black i've been drinking all night y was already a little on my feeling but i swear i cheered up at the sighte of it all sam had not wonted to come to fludch at first because he thought too many people would recognize him i think it din one o be judged for being out on the town after his wife's death and when we walked in he semed a little uncomfortable we splid up for a while and later he found me standingin a corner at the edge of the dance for mesmarise he pulled out his fon and showed me the number he just got of wha beautiful woman who walked in earlier and drawn rite bit f attention earlier in the day ingred had said a bunch of af for future stuff to me about detroit shape shifting and reckoning with its pass and healing i tfelt i was seeing some small aversion of that now with sam most days he was pobbly just a gui an ome pain struggling to survived this very tramatic thing that happen but t night in spite of that sam was imagining a batter future and doing something about it he smiled shated some words of encouragement at me over the music and waited back into the crowd his spirits were up his evening was at over fack true passed in perfect theis this idea that occurs over and over an af for futurism that somed up basically says the past is always with us it affects us it as the power to make a stronger if we learn how to use it properly some west african cultures represent this idea with the image of what is called o san cofa bird it s a bird walking forward but with its head looking backward meaning no matter what we carri the pass with us into the future in one of the most well known af for futurest novels kindred by actaviar butler the main character finds herself travelling back and forth between ar normal con temporary life in th present and the world of her ancestors in the antebell him south were she treated a slave and the two time periods start to merge that is fiction are next story is told by a woman ho went to aversion of that in real life when i graduated from enwa you with the beean drama and a mostly unplan double major and anthr pology my mother asked me what are you to do with that act in a museum this seemed especially read coming from a sociologest but cheata point for the first few years of my dult life that is exactly what i did during those years asy dungee was living in oer home town a suburb of washington you see working as an actor at night in place for which she was paid almost nothing ind tot make some extra cast for christmas she took a gig time travelling to the least desirable job of the eighteenth century she was a slave were she played one anyway per forming for tori said george washington's estate mount vernon for we can events called mount vernon by candlelihe the halls of the mansion were decked for christmas tvisitors would walk through stopping in each room to meet a character and here their monologue about thi season there was missus washington beloved wife doctor james crake washington's physicion and best bud nellie custus sweet natured granddaughter and me caroline branham slave i had a script that i used to talk about caroline's life it was short besides the odd i mas slave at christmas too a slave to my husband and kids joke from forty year old white women people were interested and respectful after christmas i decided to stay in the job it sought it out fine the winter weather i met the visitors were mostly local and relatively few i enjoyed my daily walks on the trelined lanes soft snow falling on my who ded mulbury colored kape as they looked out at thi standing view of the potomac river and when it was too cold i was stay in the library and read through musty old books and primary source letters and notations ut helped me understand this distant world i inhabited and the woman i pertray i was caroline branham a real woman whohad been housemaid to missus washington i studied caroline's life und times for months and every day when i put on a beautiful crimson dress with tiny yellow and green flowers i became her with each ilet i laced on my corset i felt myself get closer to her posture how her body related to the world with my hair pulled back and two large french braids under bonnet i sat on a bench and set my fingers to the work caroline did rose of stitches on shirts and brightly coloured embroidery i could picture her laying down her head at night next to her husband peter and their six children wilson rachel jemima lane polly and little peter i imagined how she hoped that one day they would wake up in a world better than the one she would been given then spring came and torust from around the contry started pouring into mount vernon my job was to simply be available to the visitors to talk to them and answer their questions as caroline this time there was no script and i realized pretty quickly that just being there existing as a black woman in that place was a threat to the fantasy of a noble america i was the stain on george washington's white house and i watched them grapple with this right in front of me me the least confrontational human being youllever meet i mean it took me till i was twenty five years old to tell my mama i did not her bake tofo smothered in craft barbahu'sause some people were uncomfortable with me that they bumbled through the first random thing that came to their mine you are a slave oh oqey are the vegetables in the garden reel fake vegetables this is an outdoor garden they are literally coming out the ground and there is a man standing their watering them or they immediately asked questions with obvious answers that they just had not thought thtrough why do not you go up to massachusetts and go to school instead of being a slave one person asked right as soon as i can get rid of this very obvious bround skin steal a horse in a map that i cannot read i will be on my way or they would go into immediate denial mode the old woman who out of nowhere yelleded me george washington had no slaves i said yes he did she responded no we did and this went on back and forth until her son got embarrassed and pulled her away or they offered another offence as some sort of defence but the irish were slaves too oqey that is not really true and what the held des have to do with me and of course there were those who would take the opportunity to teach me instead slavery was a good industrious life where you got room and board for your work u e one room cabin they built themselves with eight people sleeping on a dirt floor and a bag of cornmill every week room and bore all er was just a bazaar situation to be in playing caroline id be sitting next to miss nellie in the midst of her role play who would be going on and on about the lovely letters that her dear grandpapa george washington had written her ore all the fancy swuareys that she attended we would be in the green house with a gorgeous garden outside on an estate that overlooed the potomac i'd literally here white visitors sigh listening to miss nellie read from her letters full of nestalgia for this time long gon they would talk about how much simpler things were back then how touching george washington's letters were what a fine man and how lucky miss nellie was to live such a charming life it was charming i was charmed by it then i'd be my turn here is what i talked about how my husband is rented from missus washington's relative ndow we could be sent back at any time how i go home to my cabin at night hoping that none of my children have been sold the once my friend was whipped bad her fingers were torn and she could not for three weeks all real stuff from caroline branham's life one time and old lady just walked up to me while i was talking hugged me whispered i'm sorry and walked away another time a man handed me a twenty dollar bill i guess that was reparations i caroline's day there were typically no more than ten white people who lived in the washington household at any given time meanwhile there were three hundred sixteen slaves and who was there to tell their story me i was the only black actor i felt it was up to me to be all three hundred sixteen people to resear to them too i could talk about my friend the blacksmith thor delfe the woolf spinner hi learned much about being a slave that to this sty there is space in my brain devoted to this information i can tell you had to shine silver with horse year which herbs to use to make your owner sick but not killer how beating a slave and then dousing them with salt wetter to disinfect the wounds was called pickling hickling i hate that i know that as my time atmount vernon went on i began to notice there was something that would happen an particular with white men it was almost to spite themselves they would act out the power dynamac from seventeen ninety seven i can remember at least five times when a white man of a certain age sat on a bench way too close to me in said something life i used to be into a black girl back when i was young then he would pause presumably waiting for my response when am i supposed to say to that exactly thank you once a man got physical i was walking down the lane on a particularly hot and busy day when a tall burly white man grabbed my arm hold me towards him and said show me where you are branded i was startled and could only get out the words sir i have not been branded and then he and his wife began laughing heartily well you got a good up here we are from south carolina and they branded hem down there girl you got a good and then one time one of the guises i work with also in cosstume wearing a try corn hat he and i were walking from the farm back to the mansion and we decided to take the forest trail we were having a nice normal conversation when out of the blue he says hey the three and act a slave rate you tear up your clothes a little bit and go running out the far screaming and i'll follow behind you pulling out my pans he laughed i did not say anything i just sort of titter i titered as an old timy fancy way of saying i laughed with the masterd i laughed because i did not know what else to do as i felt completely and utterly powerless i started calling in sicka lot because i was sickalt i stomach would twist in turn i would sometimes get at choking feeling and cough as if to vomit but nothing was there i had terrible headaches and i could not do anything but sleep and one day it occurred to me that caroline felt this way too this exact way the farm manager who oversaw slaves on the mansion house farm noted that caroline quote complained of a pain in her head and side and had quote a very dry bad cough george washington's friend doctor crake is recorded as having treated her for such bad stomach pains that he had to bleed her give her stomach drops and prescribed twenty pills for bowel obstruction my job was to inhabit caroline's life but she started inhabiting mine i had this weird sensation that i was living in multiple time periods at once the sanculfe berd i started seeing mount vernon everywhere in the modern world and evolutionary psychologist wrote a block post for psychology to day were he claimed that he would objectively proved that black women are the least attractive of all races of women with science this happened in the year of our lord two thousand eleven i saw this only a few days after reading thomas jefferson's notes on the state of virginia for were apparently jefferson who by the way was known to have slaves with the lightast sgain possible i come to the same conclusion about my race in gender over two hundred years ago he said that black men prefer white women and black women are preferred by a rangotans oh that is wiansing then travon martn i was watching the news one evening about a black boy harassed and pursued by a white lateeno man who was convinced that he did not belong in his neighbourhood and because of this compulsion the innocent black boy ended a dead my heart was in my gut the first thought that came into my head he did not have his pass pass i shook it off no that cannot be right when a slave left their plantation they had to carry a pass from their master or overseer saying where they were going and when they were expected to return not having your pass or your free papers if you were free was dangerous at any time any white person could stop you and demand see your pass if you did not produce it you were thrown in jail having black skin alone was enough to make you suspicious and a white stranger could be the judge and jury of your fate travon martin did not have his pass there is a thing white people say to black people all the time i've had it said to me why do not you just get over it it being slavery and all historical oppression why do not you just get over it they say it is in the past what i would say to white people in response is that you are not over the past every year you flock from all over the country to mount vernon and other places it to monuments and museums and reenactments there is president's day and the fireworks that blast over george washington's house every fourth of july thereare the confederate flags and statues of robert elee that you do not want taken down no i cannot get over it and neither can you none of us can thesy do not you these days she is coexecutive producer on a new comedy from bleanaway called twenties and writing a book of essorys about her experiences an not bernon called how i shubad the eghensen coming up we worke from the pass back to the future to deve digs and an underwater world of to morrow that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our program continues its this american lif from yr last to day's programm that we are in the future which were first broadcast in twenty seventeen i shall inspired by afro future as am which my co worker neal drumming became interested in back then as a lands to view the future the past and the present when we made this episode a few years ago we named it after anabum by the experimental jazartist sunra we are in the future and now here we are in the future three years later it does not look good here and it feels even worse in terrifying ways it resembles the futures of many dostill be in sify novels that i was once happy to think of as merely fiction still even though this episode was created from hopefulness pain confusion rage they will all baked into it because that is the reality of being black in america affr futurism doesm say that black people will not still be fighting for rihts dignity breath even as private corporations are building rockets to send torus into space affor futurism just asserts that we will still be here then and that fight will still be in us here is a song by sunra nlyo recall on re spots it is called the space sages here to stay it dono be lakaa t e you lotecoae bospeee ye we dring actl a three the blackseaso of this one i know

band's name which is the wood clipping without the vowels se l p p eng not come act for childhood's end looking intor affro futurism over the past few months i found myself thinking about time and space a lot time because many of these stories involved people thinking about the past or the future or seeing the past and the future in the here and now and space because all of that time travel is cewed by very specific places detroit or mount vernon or philadelphia or wherever during those same months i also became sort of obsessed with these two vidios that i saw on you two i could not help connecting them in my mind because for me they were both about a particularly precious intersection of time and space the time is that period when children have left school for the day but have not yet made it home an the space is that distance however many blocks however many miles it takes those kids to walk from one to the other in other words these two vidios are about those moments when kids are out in the world on their own the adults they bumpinti you may have seen the first vidio it takes place in at lantic city two blackteen ages an sweat pants an sneakers are fighting in the middle of a residential street on their way home from school when a slightly older black man it been ally miller emerges from cammera right and puts an end to the fight with a stern but passionate talking to the clipf went viral miller was honored by his city stevarvy had him on his couch i saw it for the first time on my face will feed this past winter and hav viewded on you two many time since it does not disappoint it gets better every time i watch it o mywhen it begins the two boys grappl and flale at each other slopily one tall one shall be both defiant other kids crowd around recording with their selfons egging them on sgaa oabr a a then seemingly out of nowhere miller bops in to frame his hands in his pockets wearing work boots and in it cap he immediately sturts to call out the kids who ere record aery yo fos no al yor yo o cow cal nexo a ma fo col ne o every ma co fo rayl cow cowards miller calls him then he turns his attention to the two boys in sent isnat ol o brng o se you ring o se you mor madns isee etings you finful rease you mi you because you wone my yo di you ma enemy me sa soets net ors oa o tyou divineso another listens and then he tells the boys something they probably had not considered that they were most likely tricked in defighting by some one who thought it would be entertaining and now all of their called friends are recording them go

what sin fit sin sinins at yal me r a mi yo a o e mi iso we are not going to get nowhere this he says hear what miller does that i love i steer the conversation away from personal grievances towards something bigger he tries to tell these kids that they are part of a community he tells them that their actions have consequences an hat those consequences only get more serious as they get ollder without condescending to them miller talks to them about their futures thes a game awa ion't game awa is well away lolbra wereru do not make yo drat likenis yo it ther ra is wi go as at a he is no longer justrying to get them to save face or avoid humiliation he is warning the boy is that as they become men young black men the world will become even more dangerous for them miller will not leave until the two shake hands they do not want to at first only the shubby kid extends his hand youros i i not noke e ga understak ou nan te ga the other kid does not the shubby kid pulls his hand back it yen ye woiis i or ashinhe does w sh h sh it is actually difficult for me to express how wed i wasch by this fidio the beauty of it is that even while miller is insisting that these tea naturs become responsible for themselves his actions demonstrate that they are not necessarily alon that there is compassion an wisdom and guidance available to them it was a window into a worl where people do not know each other she will give it dom i window that i culd rewine and repwotch and forward to my friends to quick it was at once exhilarating and comforting i rode that high for a week maybe two then another vidio popped up in my face book feet thei's one is shakier and from a low angle obviously recorded surreptitiously the view is of the intersection of bedtford avenue ind campas road tmid wouod high school on one side of the street bookin colleges on the other i recognized it immediately because i used to live ten minutes away there is still snow on the ground and the selphone is buffeted about by wind it is camera wobbles up behind two uniform police officers walking slowly down campas road the one on the left has both hands in his pockets the one on the right has his batan already drawn a handful of black teanagers walk obstinately before them headed away toward flap bush avenue there is no way to know for sure what happened before the vidio started rolling there were most likely the beginings of a snowball fight but it is unclear who was unhappy about that the police were not called they were already on sight in the footage one o the cop says come on let us go though the kids are already going the cop on the right reaches out it looks he shoves the boy in a pink hoodie the boy flinches snapping his head around stop touching me he says the cop responds with what you going to do about it which is obnoxious and a stupid question but that does not stop him from asking it at least five more times a kid taunting another kid it at one point one of the teanagers fires back that is why we out it sounds bad ass but if you think about it the kid is saying we are walking away because we cannot do anything about it and we all know that another kid in the procession kneels down to pick up some snow but this left hand the cop on the right pulls his tazor out of his holster and barks pick that up again rock paper scissors snowball tazer the kids keep walking away the cop yells pickd that up again one more time and follows with a do you want to ride the lightning the vidio ends as the kids cross the street to safety and the cops stopp on the corner i know i know it seems you can see worse more unjust things happened to black people on you two just about any day of the week here fortunately no one was hurt but this vidy it was still hard to watch especially having seen how ad been alley miller talked those kids down in atlantic city whereas miller was tryng to got the teanators to think a little bit more a dults they cop in this vidioe sounded a tea nater himself bullying and provoking wat's worse he almost seemed to be enjoying it it is hard to imagine he cared anything at all about what happened to those kids after they deserted that corner i told my friends about this fig or too i senthen link aroundd it was not as popular clip as the one wat miller i read everything i could about it i found out that thet kids most likely went to midwood high school and a few weeks later i went tim id would high school and stood on the corner of bedfrd avenue an campas road wea wanted to find some one who oad witness the incident i was angry on behalf of those young men and i wanted to know how they felt yet i found one of them immediately and then the others found me me al he back al a os the back tortusthere in tapered gray sweats an colorful napsacks they told me they came to thi spot almost every day what chicken and fries and rice slat box with each other kicked it with girls and waited for the rest of their crew to goplay basketball down the block he wanted to know what my microphone was for and if they culd get money and girls from being on the radio and if i could buy them lutch i asked them what they were doing on the day that the vidio was recorded one of them said he was cutting class t others said they were not i asked them why they think the cops came since their high schol has its own security one of them said that some other kid's cross o shoot were throwing snow end the cops thought it was tus yeone o the boys said it was them but still it was only snow balls i i i i wa just la o a o i adon li us goin i os hadn i i asked if they were scared when it happened ia couple of sixteen year olds cooler than i'd ever ben at that age said no not really a fourteen year old said emphatically of course he was sixtoo my height i was surprised at how tall someof the boys were none of them older than sixteen i was al surprised at how not angry they seemed i grew up about forty five minutes from here in a similar neighborhood and queens not long ago i thought but when asked them why they thought this had happened to them at all one of the older boys talked to me he was explaining why humans need food lie the cop was white no black a i i an we lat te iit imaybe this is just me but i looked back on walks home from school as my first real flirtations withindependencs a sacred time and space between my teachers rules and my parents frestrictions thet ckitson that vidio this was their school this was their neighborhood most of the ones i talked to live only four or five blocks away as far as theighbor concerned this was their corner i cannot imagine what it would feel to be firmly in your time and space and runt up against a cop with a tazer threatening to electrocute u if you do not put down that snow ball was crazier to me is that i've walked through this intersection at bedfrd avenue in capus road pass the high school and through the brooklyn college campas many times in the last few years beneath its landmark gilded clock tower brooklyn college could be a campas quat from a corny nineteen fifty except teeming with students from culters all over new york e something about a practically streams welcome things only get better from here the young blackmen in that vidio came out of their high school that day and stood at the edge of that promise what could be the next grate space an time in their lives was a college literally across the street but they were shoet away told they did not belong as far as metaphors schod this one could not be less ambiguous but none of this seemed to bother the boys or at least not that they let on this was not the first time that they had been made to feel unwelcome close to home in school yet they were not fastering with resentment thit were not seem the tragedy in it that i was seeing after i finished talking to them i went across the street to find the brooklyn college professor whoad recorded the incident alex wat talley teachers sociology and also happens to run the schools policing and social justice project leaving work that day he would seem the two cops to send on bedfrd avenue and campas road followed them and it was his recording that ented up on you two as well as a few local news websights we talkd briefly about how repeated incidence this could effect the boys psyches he agreed that no matter how cool they seem now over time their hopes for their own futures could possibly darken but then alex asked me how old i was when i told thim forty three he said that i had missed the height of the stopin frisgera i was not a tea nager or even a young man in new york city when unprompted police harassment was at its worst the tazor incident outraged me but what these coud had seen their older brothers sisters and in some cases parents go through had conditioned them to be a bit more stoic it stung a little bit to have this white academic told me that i could not quite relate to a young blackman's experience i gus when i first approached those boys a pard on me hope that ibonaly miller in the atlantic city viio i would just roll about a nowhere i know everything about their world that they know plus some more instead i was just another adull taking their time in invading their space cwoproin is produce to day by nown druwning i staffin to our staffor ce susan burton ben calhounso we chasetin

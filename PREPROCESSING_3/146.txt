as hunter bidons former business partments o von archer prepares to testify the stage os set for jobidons possible impeachment republican struggle to fill the stage for the first presidential mate and israel passed the judicial reform package prompting spasms of apoplexy i'm bensper this is venshbarro show to day shows ponterback sprescivve pin thousands my listers have already secured the natwer gey tad join them expresty pians i coms flahspen jobidon is not cest and innocent elderly gentleman he is also in amazing father who cares deeply about his drug addicted son hunter and that is the only reason why he has been squiring hunter around or by them h hunter has been squiring him around their connection is purely on the up and up at any accusations of bidon family coruption involving jobidon are absolutely out of balance they are wrong enshuldn' talk about them this is the narrative ou've hred over and over again and jobiden is repeated this narrative over and over and over for example jobidon hasbeen asked at this one about thousand times that hunter bidon's business is because hunter bidon for a decate made money by running a round planet earth picking up jiant bags of cash and then doing gid knows what with those ciant bags of cash then when serious questions about how jobidon accrued all of his wealth where did all this money come from serious questions in fact a lot of those questions wort the center of donald trump's first impeachment inquiry when donal trump called up the presidens of yeu crain and asked him to look into allegations of corruption involving beresemoch is paying hunter biden some thng eighty three thous and dollars a month while jobidon was bices president and prosiding over the for policy of the united states with regard to you gran remember that resulted in donal trumping in peach for the first time l the serious questions have been swirling about hunter and jobidon for a long time at every single time jobidenhas that i never knew with damn thing about my son's business not once i'm purely innocent hunter is wonderful gui and there is nothing to see here here is jobidon saying it over and over and over again a yo ever spokin here son about is fover tin ini ferwing ni've never sproken my son moersnn what is your understanding of what your son was doing for n extraordinary mout i do not know what he was doing i know he was on the board i found out he was on the board after his on board and that was it and there is nobody we nat lot of time is not the something you want to get to the bottom no because i trust my son i have not taken a pany from any forn sorce ever in my life we learne tis president payd fifty times to tacks in china has a secret banka count with china does business in china and in fact is talking about me taking money i've not taken a single penny from any cuntry what ever ever my son has not made money in terms of this fingur bard a word he talkn about china i have not had the only guid made money from china is this chi the only one nobody else has made money from chine cam here is the thing jobidon is a liar he is a liar we know for a fact the jobiden knew about his son's business es the notion that he did not know about his son's businesses is absurd is absurd honen's face rou go through te intire time lide and now it increasingly appears that joe was in on it and as mornmore people round hunter bidon are called to testifie and as mormore records immerged showing peoplel openly talking about attempting to bribe jobidon ve a hunter impeachmen is going to be on the table ia'm as predicting it right now in side the next year there will be im peachmen inquiries into jobiden forget inquiries there'l probably ben im peachmen vote inside the next year onjobidon because of the corruption that he is pretty obviously in golfing the bidon family here devon archer is the latest person who is seto testifi to the house republican over sihte committee he spose to do that within days three times they have moved this tesmoin devon archer and hunter formed rosemont san a ca partner's back in two thousand nine along with christopher hines the son in law of former senator john carry he an hunter served is managing partners of the firm archer and hines had been polger matesat yale archer and hunter bidan according to the ucadili mell each landed lucrative seats on the board of berisma despite hunter not having any expertees in the field despite him being a drug adic bad that he was kicked out of the united states nave the firm brought an y recported eleven million dollars through the the arrangement they's done in formation glean from hunters infamous labtop they'r photograph golfing with then bi byspresinent biden back in two thousand forteen a now deven archer is expected to talk with the house oversite committe his interviews suppocto take place behind close doors according to an aid who noted such appearances are ually lead by committee's staff pann'll chargams comer who issued the cipina as he will testify about quote all the times he saw biden meat with hunter's business associates following reports hunter made a habit of putting his dad on speaker phone an a possible bid to imprescipothential partners and clients and that cimes after comer andother top republicans have repeatedly accuse jobid enogh taking parting crimes but failing far to produce the hard evidence but here is the evidence that is coming a letme just begin with this and this is the statemen that should hover over everybody's imagination when youare talking about joe and hunter biden first of all joe knew full well that hunter biden was drug atict first rule of drug addicted family members or friends deprive them of money becaue they use the money to by drugs jobidon did not do that instead he lent his name and apparently air force to to his son sa they could run around well hunter picked up bags of cash here is the statement that should hover in all o every one's mine as we examine the time line here of the relationship between hunter and foreign businesses and his dad who is now the president of the united states and was vice president for much of this here is the statement this is a text from hunter bidon to his daughter in twenty nineteen its on the infamous hunter bidon lab top the non russian dis information labtop that hunter biden druggedicted dirolic left at a computer ro pairo store quote i hope you can all do what i did and pay for everything for this entire family for thirty years it is really hard but do not worry unlike pop i will not make you give me half your salary that is a text from hunterbidon to his daughter twenty nineteen now that is kind of the ball game is it not th uthing the hunderbine is lying to his daughter when he tecs that that actiin no money mov v a hunter bidin to jo that' you just making all of this up oes that sound a kind of thing that you would text to a family member being entirely false then no money had ever change thance ever or's that sound that has the ring of truth about it in just one second reen go throuh the full time line here because there is now mounting evidence thet not only was hunter obviously speaking with joe about all this in fact we know that you are speaking with joe about all of this dan gold men who is a democratic congress person essentially spilled as much the other dan an open hering it dat goes much further than this the chances then money was flowing from foreign sources to hunter and then from hunter to joe are extremely high and when jobidon said nopen debate thathe never received a forein dollar technically that may be true heu may receive the money directly from son there being very squarely and very lawyarly over at the white house there changing their tune even the have a bandin now the line that joe knew nothing about hunters business dealings is obviously not true ti rean goe through the time line in just

ben o case let us go through some of the time line here because the time line is really really damning and is perfectly obvious that there is no chance at all i mean the're there is a zero chance zero that jobiden did not now that hunters business dealings and there is an extraordinarily lo chance that joe never benefited from hunter bidon's business dealings those chances are vanishingly small i'll explain why becaus wren't go through the entire time line here and we are also going to go through some of the documents that 've now been provided by confidential human sources talking about what you cranians for example we are saying about joe and hunterbidon i will talk about what exactly 't ov an archer has already said what tony boblinsky another business partner of g of hunter bidons has said a on november first twenty thirteen is a time line that is been put te other by the house over sie comittee on november first twenty thirteen hunter bidon and some of his friends created china b char a chinabe char was a chinese investment firm bohi harvest arist equity investment fun as control by he bank of china was foksing on emanay and investment in and reforms of state owned enterprise hows in november of twenty thirteen in december of twenty thirteen vice president bidon traveled with hunter bidon on air force too to china and met the c e o of the company jonathan lee shortly they areafter b chars business licence was approved and hunter bide was magically aboard member to understand that the way that it works when it comes to forein corruption is foreign states believe that access to high ranking american officials means that they are going to get sweethartdeals the reason that believe this is because in their own country this is in fact ow works if you are in china and you an to get something done oiu cn hve to go to the top levels of the polit bureau anu you have to talk ithe members the c c p and if highranking political members the c c p approve a thing at that means that your cn get special benefits and the chinese assume that the same thing works in the united states that you have access to jobidon that means that magically you can get sweet harp treatment in the united states the same thing is trunu crane this is whuy their constantly attempting to buy access to american politicians even though connection with t american centr is is work a cupo coffee the reality is heu ban connected to a thousand a bunch of american senters an it may make no difference ts your business is future you be connected to lator politicians and will not do anythng if you live in a foreign corrupt country where you have to know a high ranking member the government to get anything done knowing highranking members theamerican government you think is going to get things done d you thing it is quintons then november f twenty thiurteen hunter bidon starts a fund wit th chinese government effectively and one month later jo is squiring hunter there and

time now the international communisan lihtvictar shoken any more but that does not matter because there could be a conflict of interest when it comes to why jobidin wanted victor shokin to go two

very fameous mal from hunter's labtop mentioning ten held by gh four the big guy now we know from a variety of other documents that the big guy cgenerally refers to jobidon sgain the idea heres that hunter is wholething in scro essentially a bunch of money or could b if the yell gos through a bunch of money four jobiden july thirtieth twenty seventeen this is the one where becomes absolutelear how this operation works july thirtieth twenty seventeen in what is that message to a chinese company hunter bidens has quote please have te director callmy not cames or tonia or cim have him call meet to night i am sitting here with my father we would to understand why the commintment made has not been fulfilled i'm very concerned that the chairman has either changed his mind and broken ar

them saying i warned you from this moment until whenever he reaches me hunderd by n then continued quote o ka my friend i am sitting here waiting for the call with my father i shure hope whatever you are doing is very very very importan that is hunter openly saying two chinese business partners make the money happan i'm sitting here with my daddy and my daddy is very well connected and my datic can make things happen that are very very bad for you a few days later august second twenty seventeen the arrangement between c f c and the bidan family changes becase the original bidan ssociates are now removed hundred bion writes quote the chairman change that deal after we met in my amy to a much more lasking an lucrative arrangement to creet a holding company fifty per cent own by me fifty per cent own by him tconsulting feeses one piece of or income streem but the reason this proposal by the chairman was much more interesting to me in my family and my family is that we would also be partners in the equiti m propits of the j v in vestments the jointentity a few days later is formed fifty per cent ownd by c fc asen gong wind dong whoas eight chinese commeu stagent and fifty per

the mony sarchs flowing a hundred thousand dollars from c f c to hunder bidnss company a wosco p c c f c a one day later or four days later wires five million dollars to hudson west thethree which is another fun in which hunter is associated september twenty first twenty seventeen hunder bion request keys made at his office chared with his chineses partners novmember eight twenty seventeen patrico c f c asen n in america is arrested at j f k airport on suspicion of bribery and money wandering on behalf of c f c china in march of twenty eghteen ye shon man is the hat of c f c was detain by chinese authories for suspected economic crimes is whereabouts remain unknown presumably he is dead presumably the chinese government killed him e all of this is insanely corrupt o cantn remember sa hunter bidon says quote thes october of twer nineteen hunter nither platerrule in the formation or lacenshure of be chare nor owned any equity in it while his father was vice president he served only as a member of its board of directors where he joined based on his interest in seekin ways to bring chinese capital t international markets het was an unpaid position to day hunter is not received any compensation for being on b chars wore directers he is not received any return on his investment ther're been no distributions to b ch or shareholders since hunter obtained his equity interest moreover hunter played no role in directing or making be charcs investments hunter and tensters ined from the b char board of directors on or by october thirty first twenty nineteen om ya no i'm to go no on all of that all of this is at deep believe suspicious obviously and her's the thing the the ires knows about all of this ocay the cover up is what is truly astonishing according to iris whistle blowers the amount of money that was cleared by hunter bidon during the period twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen was a leven million dollars a tons and thuns an tons o money much of which hunter never payd taxes on and the iris did not investigate and according to those iris tho those iris whistle blowers there were sabatoch in teir efforts to search store junits of hunters they are not allowed to obtain search warns they are not allowed to ask witness is about the big guy they were told not to dig into this i mean this is deeply suspicious stuff again one of the iris whistle blowers testifies it was an eleven million hes tustified to seventeen poin three million dollars from twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen in total foran in come streams through various shell companies to hunter and his associates that includes three point one millin dolars from amania three million dollars from state energy h k h k a from a filiated with the c c p and c f s another three point seven million dollars from c e fs of filiated hudson west three and six point five million dollars from berisma of that seventeen point thre million dllars apparently hunts received eight pointhre million dollars the rest went to immediate family members and associates again i read to you the taxt that hunter bidon sent to his own daughter in twenty nineteen quotes i hope you all can do what i did and pay for everything for this entire family for thirty years it is really hard but do not worry o mi pop i will not make you give me half your salary do we really believe do we really believe that jobidon knew about none of this in benefited frorm none of this that jobidon was pure as the drivensnowe his sun is running around all over the world using his name he was calling his daddy on the fondering business meetings he was havinghis fathers stop by business meetings he was meeting with officials were meeting with his father are we really supposed to believe that jobidon was sitting theire off in the corner and nobone if it a crued to him and he knew nothing about any of this it is absurd it is absurd on is face n everybody knows it is absurd on its face and when he is vice president and he is doing thes sort of stuff if he was actually effecting you crane policy based on this which it appears he was then that is actual bribery if that is the kind of stuff that people get in pech for the stuffy's doing in twenty seventeen wishis influence peddling is not illegal it is ugly but its not illegal it also happens to be the jobidon was lying consistently to the american people when he says over and over and over i know nothing about my son's busines dealing while squiring his son personally on heir forse tu to china can pick up for im bags of cash that is obviously a lie how it is really a lie because yesterday the wite house gave wit the am wi how is pressecretary world's most untalented pres secretary creen jomp here she is specifically asked about jobidin saying he knew nothing about the business is with his son and here is her answer i carha nwi ni been i beent ask his question a million times the answer is not going to changewer to answer remangs the tae the president a was never in business with this time it just not have anything else to ack that is not the same answer that is not the same answer shes the answer never changed and then she changes the answer notice the phraseology of the question there the phraseology of the question as the reporter asks is did jobididn it kno about the usiness with his son did about the business with th son er the benefit fom any business and her answer is he was never quote in business with his son he is never in business with it that is a very lawyerly answer as a lawyer et me tell you that is a very lawyerly answer dbecause when he says in business what is the definesion of in business ser'sly what is the definition of in business my wife an i shar bank account are we in business together not really she work for me i' work for her we are married we sure bank account now our our find ansial activities deeply intworts wine completely one hundred presents intertwined aps a frick and

business partners and we all own stock together and daily wire another business is that i own i'm in business with ton an mind business with my wife wor'sh my children i'm tectimcally not but does the money flow to my wife from our bank account of course notice what the're doing there that is most squirrelly language ovailable thatis a big change from i never knew a damn thing i never spoke with my son about this jo bidon was lying when he said that and he is lying when he says that he never benefited from thess it is very dificult sy how he is not lying in fact and they are asking you to pull the lol over your own es er asking you to be an idiots an'sthe question is how stupid you want to be i gan i think that the e straight line from here to impeachment is pretty clear and it appears that there is gin be a lot more digging and a lot more data that is going to emerge i i cannot get over that text in which joba in which hunter bi he jut they are multiple instance is of hunter bidin acknowledging the scheme they are moltily that there is a literal what is that message where h's saying my gdaddy sitting next to me send me money my dadd he is right next to me he is literally telling his own do water that he picks up bags of cash for hi's dad nd we are supposed to believe that thisis all above board absolute nonsense get to the the one of the kickers here in just one

and also germs go to gerames razor is dot com order this delightful green ta an citras hansop to day o kam meanwhile the gall of the bidin family in assuming that you are a more on is truly astonishing iare not that the most obvious example is hunter bidin a crack atdict deciding to become in our teast he is an ourteest guies he is just you he is some of the people from labolem and he lives in a in apartment and he paints in his free time and he paints master pieces and and those master pieces go for half a million dollars to unspecified byers do not a i mean in fact hunterbidins paintings are mazing that he can deny them to his own biological child his name but if he gives her the master pieces then that makes up for it these amazing works of art to one of the questions that is always been hanging over this is that this pretty have yus money landering retine where hunter biding is clearly selling these pieces to unspecified byers for allies of bine family it is whoarer the people horbinas well now we know according to one report insider is reporting that elle realistate in vester elizabeth hursh notolly who is given tens of thousands of dollars to the political left purchased a piece of jobidon's art work several months after hunter bidon's art went on saile the president appointed not tolly to the commission for the preservation of america's heritage abroad o how magical ofm hunder bides arcos huntal some lady bis the art for wait to much money and then she also magically appeers on the president's commission for the preservation of america's heritage abroad wow wow the report said it was not clear if the art she purchase came befort or after she as appointed to thecommission hunter bidon wrote in an emell dis covered on his abandon labtop that he could have sway and who gets on the commission to hunter by t literalyordy mellers that you knw i could probably figure out who gets on the commision for the preservation of america's heritage abroad also i paint finger paintings who wants to buy a finger painting everis i'd to be on the commission for the preservation of america's hers er i woll buy your finger painting another owner of hunter bion's art is ala a turneyn keven morris who ise recently spotted smoking a bong during a visit with the president son how nice the your time said morris might have received the art as a gift whll insideis a the morse purchase the art one buyer identity unknown reportly purchased eleven pieces of hunter bidn's painting for eight hundred and seventy fat as seventy five thousend at dollars eight hers uny five thousand bucks for eleving garbage painting by hunter bidon jensocky said at the time all interactions regardin the selling of art in the seting a prices will be handled by a professional gallorist ad hering to the highest professional standards yes i am sure i am sure that dot there is no corruption it is all abube to things tey dwell tis out in the open and an now the press is never gcan ask about it and they also know the presingan down plan now if this wort the trump family and let say the donjunior had gone around the world picking up bags of cash whell his dad was preseden let picking up the bags of cash and pretty obviously funling it to his dad and also pretty obviousy callingis daddy on the phone while all of this was happening do you think that maybe that would ernsome medic but instead here is the narratie again the narrative to go bact te beginning the narative here is jobidn such a good carring father how deare you ask haabout hunter he is a carring father and he is had a tragic life filled with tragedy and because it is tragic life filled with tragedy there som truth to that that means that you should not ask about this in fact s is appalling that any one would ask about any of this well here is the thing i thing a lot of democratscan petty nervous about bide not just because they think that he is actually falling apart as a human being according to a new harvard heris survey fifty nine per cents registerd voters have dous about the president's mental fitness but it is that that by the way includes seventy one per cent of independents who doubt bidons mental fitness and to twenty four precent of democrats according to this poll it is not just about that i think the deep in the back of their minds democrats are getting a lena worried about the fact that joe is not actually all that clean and he is never been all that clean and the're starting to n see it the're starting to promont comola again the gn ta try and make fetch happen and fetch are not gone a happen comla harris is superbad about this comla harris as been speaking a lot more often chin the press a lot more al ffin and here' the prom for them the more she is in the prestmore people despise her because she is just terrible at this she is she inhabits the actual uncanny valley she is she is built a summer home in the un canny valley here she is explaining the work that they have done together i know what shes even taught no one knows thif she is talking about we all just kow that she is annoying in a noious at abo hat or wor together an ir progress together hat's the men to i soonking o somamic ah i think about the progress and also by nomic that is the call it the call it by nomic alles is part of our blue prent together for what a man the cannedy together this is bidao or her hands can hut to to mamizing an tean amerian bild future bin all people can truly it is ri is by nomic its but i'm would it surprise you to learn that there is a person behind comela harris who is actually the arms you now int to ame that used to play with your little brother where you would stand behind him and you put your arms out from behind him he as she move the arms where the arms are disconnected from the actual body that is comal hrs a good luck with that democrass this the working now grat got your corrupt elderly dotter president backed up by comal heris the worst politician who is ever been put to paper i'm good luck with that and meanwhile the republican party continues to spirol it is the unclear who the nominy is going to be at this point but it appears the donald trump of course has the upper hand it i've said ae thousand times you do not be greate isthe campagn run against jobidon thatw'ld be the best thing is if you ran tae campaign against jobidon the media have to missions here one is to make suer the donal trump is the candidate and the other is to rip down any potential other candidate the latest attacks from the media art onestly fome the most scuirrilous yet with regard to ronto santis i got to say this is just ub surds o first of all the republican bates are coming up the first one is supposed to happen to august twenty third and that really is the the cano opportunity for somebody to start jumping in the poles is august twenty third the problem is that donal trumpet sad he is not con a pretise paitin the debates because why should he is she says because he is the front runner there is no point to it andi he does not show up tos anyone care what all of the other sort of alall the little people in the race are what does it does not matter them fighting with each other what difference is man that does not make the people who qualified far are do santis nicky haley tim scott the vak romasuamy cris pristy says he wants to do it as well former vice presen and pends might not actually make the debate stage becauseyou have ohave at least fort forty thouson individual downers and one per cent in three national poles of republican voters i he does not have that number of downers yet i think is is the idea i but if trumps not on the stage what difference toes any of this make and tat's really te questions a trump ors at somebody else right that is the big question every knows that is the big question and the medi ore trying to take out to everybody else to the biggest potential rival right now is ronisantis everybody knows that as much thi th vicor omis wiing personally the vake is not taking the nomination away from trump he is ot even running against trump the vakes entire nominating strating would would basically be if d don a trom keels over then maybe he gets the nomination and and he is not he he is basially running a very very trump supportfe campaign the sansis obviously as one bang attact by trump at this point and the media are helping about hey're doing with lies theyir latest lie is that rondasantis sponsoring some sort of corriculum here in the state of florida that is th e anti black which is absurd t the african american corriculum in the stateof flora was written by a commission largely comprised of black academics we have talked about this they are two specific things that the left is claiming that this particular corriculum does one they are claiming the corriculum talks up the benefits of slavery why becaue ther's prase in the coriculum saying that some slaves used skills that they learned while they were slaves to benefit themselves after they were slaves that is not about the wonders of slavery that is about the razilian see and amazing ontroponorialism of the slaves clearly it is not about the wonders of slavery thet idiets in ya lyars it is tat is one the other one is that apparently the oriculum talks about the white on black violence that occurred during particular race rites in the united states as well as black on white violands that also occurred in some these race rites ge well ya that is a thing that happened am me coun pretend it did not happen but it absolutely did happen now as that mean that the race riotes we are not based on white premisy no but was their violence that also curd tere wite people sure i'man it is all li but he meter can run with the lie to try and portray rondasantas the races this the dummest thing i really is garmage and yet your seeing the media pick up on this of course of course it is pretty obvious they thing the trump is the one that that they can be most easily here is stephen a smith going after rondosantis but the ma tese stories this te more it alerts me to the fact their ronto say te you do not need to be governor an o ti you do not need to be president either the battles that he is fighding i just unconscionwhy is the governor conserning himself with african american stadies by the way the thay the florid is beebe is it is is it is the be itorts this nigeteen nightyfol why you consudious offor such things and when it is sits here becaus i wone to make sure that i'm cuortit correctly baws dinstructures of schools that suggest any one is privileged or pressed based on their raceles skin color are you trying to deny the fact that white folks have the priveged compare to other races of people in this country are you kitmy that is ha fact that even white folks havenit enugo ge to me stavery ther stephen t have been and i have been and re are not the same thing of course white people were privilege based on their race in nineteen sixty are they privilege faced on the race an twenty twenty three i know stepen a smith sin youave a thirteen million dollary year salary from yspian thirteen million dollars a year the stude sittn here talking about how rough black people have i in the united states compare to white people overall in the united states i'm sorry this is not nineteen sixty if i can very happy is not nineteen sixty ma gis it it truly maziy meanwhile washing suppost ucing robinson toing these actin thing then the number of lies the people ll tell in order to go after a candidate and by the way it shows you wha the medeas actual gendot what they are actual gendot is because if they'e are gendo wort you stop trump they would presumably not be elevating trump at the expense of his opponents but that is precisely wha they are doing this why do not believe them whn thy say trumps of fashist an tha th the country's at staken s can be the end to the country novis i do not believe you because if somebody is actually a true threats the re public you on't you do you try to defeat them at every stage i will give youn example this i think burny sandrs ee true threats of the united states i'ving burney sander's ideology is just wrong i thought in twenty twenty that burney sanders would be far more defeatable candidat by donal trump then jobiden i wanted jou biden to whin the primaries because i did not want burney sandars to be presidents of the united states because i actually do thing to burney sandars the threats the country the democrats do not think that which is by the perfectly willing to elevate donal trumps they are liars on both scorts of lires about the sans is the and their lives about trump here they are going after a sans again base on ali my conclusion is that vi u han ars and our at a tor board are right hee tasa ta tat only in that pasa by an other basi as as as well the standards sen to me to me atemptinto sort of im contextois a a a sirin te win ca tan normalwis a reallyteto can san ble ither peopbli ting in oothers peoplei other ti saslaery im eman tton' in mi asto main a a ly i explain teting mek horror that wis a tar can chat chattel slavery i'm sorry that thit is all is al te but again it is about for the democrats op holding trumpey they think trumpis mon it may be their own may btheir ong maybe trump ensicating t a nomination than ctrushes bi maybe or maybe democrats are right and they they are trying to elevate trump for reason meanwhile is trump running against jobidan is trump really going after jobine verry hart of course not its going af for rondisantis an cacsmeth those are his actual targets or here is don a trump going after tosantus if they do not ron to sanctemonious now they will not him any better six months from now with the start of primary season the more people get to know im the lower his pulls are going he is thow in the midtins and falling fast he will soon not be number to looks it will not happen much longer but he deserves it because they' very disloyal person make a mer i great again thanke you very much me mean again is everything an test of will teach you donal trump personally this is what you on run the campaign basedon s and not on jobite ins cruption not on jobidon not being capable of doing his job not on his crap policies there are placing the american aeconomy to position of permanent stagnens and our foreign policy in a position of permanent weakness not on that we on run on personalolty ale at a manguss fore publicans want to do it this is exactly wht they are going to get an meanwhile one bring you the latest over in israel supposedly is really democracy is on the brink of absolute destruction why well because the israilly cannasset the parliament over there with a sixty four vote majority voted in favor of a law an amendments what they call the basic law which is cannety quasi constitution be out really over in israel that says that the supreme court of israel can not simply overturn any executive or administrative action on the bases of quotn u reasonable mess i imagine that the present of the united states issued and executive order and t supreme court did not determine whether it was inside the authority of the president they just determined whether it was quotinqu reasonable you see how this would be a problem because this means that the supreme court is basically the tatorship they now get to use their own judgmen of what is reasonable to substitute for in elected person or n elected bodies judgment for what is is reasonable which makes them not a court it makes them an actural legislature just not elected i the originally proposed judiciral form package byly coud and by the majority in israel was a lot more far reaching the that allowed a change and how the suprengor justices were selected it got rid of attornes that existd within every burocratic de partment in israel that allowed them to preemptively strike down pieces of legislation and and and other measures taken by those department in the judiciaries extraordinarily powerful an israel because it has arrogated to its elfit has it has simply usurped in extraordinary amountof power since the nineteen nineties because basically the judiciary which is been a preserve of the left in israel for very long time saw the rise of the political right an israel to be better grab of bunch of power right now to prevent the elected branches from taken that power lator and that is really what the battlean israel is abhaut the the the real story an israel is that the break down of the israelly population is a fect of among the jewish population is about eighty percent of te entire population israel is jewish about twenty per cent is arab moslem christian the the eighty percent breaks down about forty per cent is what you call kilony which are people who are secular and then the other forty per cent its really split right down hal is people who would be considered mosor te which means traditional who are dotilumi whic wou be lice religious inist and then people are carty the which is the ultra orthodox and the kilonem they serve disproportionately army they pay disproportionat share of the taxes largely because the hardem do not serve in the army and pay almost no tax because their income is to lo the kilonem have for a long time had sort of a tacit deel where its we will pay the welfare and we will shoulder the burden but we also get the political power and now thet emographics are turning against them as their freaking out about all of that theyre afraid escentially of a shift in israel from their power to the power of the oposition the selection was a perfect example of that becaue the opposition right now is secular parties as well as the ara parties and the colision is sentially ultra orthodox parties religiousign is parties and lecould that is that that is the current colition and what the fundamental debate is is how jewish is the state going to be rain terms of sort of religious precepts the the idea of the left is that this the state were a lot of juslave but its basically run just the united states or any other liberal democracy and the idea of the pol tical right in israel is that it is still going to be a liberal democracy but it is going to have more jewish elements of its over example buss is not running in particular areas on sabbath or the ability of harradium to have sex segregated workspases stuffh dab ri they the or or weather there should be commates levin in the hospitals on on pass over an these are these are questions that in israel actually have significant impact hebut here is the thing the rift that is over judicial form is not over that because the actual reform it is pretty mile an thereare these mass protest that men going on for monton montonmontomonts and the idea was that the protestors were simply going to shut down the economy shut down the roads shut down everything intil they got their way this means these really gvernment cannot abide this especially because their reservice were saying here not going to serve if the government did what it want eed do no country can survive a bunch of people who are not elected dictating to the elected government what the elected government sho do means that elections have no meaning of course this thing had to pass now tell you one thing that did not is it not only did it have to passitactualy a good piece of legislation the white house the bidon white house pathetically actually sounded off on this piece of legislation i'm not aware the bine white house does this routinely anywhere else except for israel truly there is no other western democratic ally of the united states where te united states sounds off from their internal politics a j jobidon does not make statements about the economic policies of france here is a make statements about the emigration policies of the u ka only on it comes to israel does he feel the necessity to actually speak out about all this but here is the thing the reason that much of this divide is being exaggerated is because a media coverage of the divide and polot politicions inisrael politicsions an america have a stake in playing up the idea that we have reached crisis point everything's on fire that is what yo have to support me it is not true everybody whose culoni an israel has a cousin who is dotuloumi and everyd who is dotuloumi has a cousin whoskiloni and if at the end of they everybody canand up going over to eich other house for chabat right that is the basic idea butt if the media exasturated if the political leadership exactorbates it it gets worse to take a perfect example in the aftermouth of this very mile judicial form being passed the there is a in ultra a haridy party an ultra orthodox party calld the united tory judiisen party ou t j and they proposed a basic law aimed at saying quote toris study is a supreme value in the heritage of the jewish people and there for it is an equivalent to serving n the army instead of actualy hving a serve in the army becaus the carrydi generally get religious exemptions that is originally based on they have been going in the first prime minister of the state of israel who is a secular he made a deal with the ultra orthodox that in return for their support of the government he would exempt at the time i think i believe six hundred yushiva students fom havin a servin the army to day that exemptions sixty dals an people a year being exempted just demonstrating once again all government programs get very very large in any case the there is been this basic conflict between the seculars and by the way the dot to loumi and the mosarty against the charide where the harridde ar saing that us studying in shiva all day talmod is the equivalent of use serving in the army which to my mind is in incorrect and wrong position morally from a tor prospect by thing's wrong as northodox jrerthing is wrong again just go back to the bible and the fact is that that pretty much everybody n the bible is a warrior scola in any case put aside the actual halaco the jushlaw of all of thus which u i'm invested in by know n lawd my listers on ke but here is the here is sort of the the basic thing the media played up this proposal by u t j to exempt all haray deem from army service basically for ever in shrin an basic law thereis only one problem the coalition is not backing this this is the headline right now at the jerusalem post o my god thet the the the theocrasy has begun thereis only one problem le cood which is the leading parity in the majority in a in a coalition with u t ja says quote this is not on the table and will not be advanced it will not be advanced another caridy party shas ry which is a sphardic caridy party actually said that their party was in shock the proposal was even put forward without its knowledge or consent s anotherwors of the media artempting toou its course play up the exaggerated difference is in order to jar more discontent that is the basic idea here and it is anit is really grows everybody is to take a breath by the way i say the simething n the united states here is languich arn't in th united states the next selection is the last election gess what ame when jobide onethe last selection gus what it was not the last election and in fact the person who was defeated by jo bidan is likely to be the re publica knomany next hem around in western democracies language that people should never use is this is the end of the country the end of the country begause gess what it almost certainly is not and yore can to have to deal at that tomorrow an you ave livin country with those people tomorrow and the same thing is true over in isra by the way is quite possible that over an israel after this sum after this judgement ave after thi sa wall was passed by the by the sitting majority it is quite possible at thi point that that is going to be overturned y the suprimport this how crazy the system is in israel the supreme court could theoretically on the basis of reasonableness over turned a waw saying they cannot do that that is how crazy th system isia thank god for the american constitution oke time for a quick thing i and then a quick thing that i hate things that i today if you look at rottn tomatoes o i i have a basic rule about rotten tomatoes the basic rule about rotten tomatoes is that if a if a movi clocks in at some ere between sixty per cent and ninety per cent on rotten tomatoes sixty per cent and eighty five per cent on rotten tmatoes it is very likely to be goo movy if a clocksin ed above eighty five per cent particular its cotton cannimovi it is probaly crap an if a clocksn blow fifty percent is poblic crap a well indiana jones and the diale of destiny fall squarely in that categuy read sixty nine per cent on rottn tomatoes right now sto the rule applise and dum i i do not know why this movi under perfored to the box office other than the i pe is a litte but old and lot of people who have sor loyalty to the indian jones ip are people older than i am and i'm thirty nine however this moi is delightful s i went out ton my wife to see it yesterday and the movi is quite wonderful the last five minute t this movy are li ke the best thing in the indian jones series maybe'sn's raters i thnk i think that it better than some the tuff in last crusade the first of all the movy is predicate on the notion that indian jones his actually eighty years old i will say that the d aging technology use in this movy is much better than it is in say the irishmen or or rogue on it is really advanced a long way lic the first twenty minutes of the movy is young harrison ford and at least the facial technology is very very good i men much much isot on bigscreen much better it is at they have really advance will not be long before yeu have fred a starstarring in things again in al likelihood but the movy is again it is predicatt on the idea that harison for his eight years old and he is now living in nineteen sixty nine america and he has to go track down youre n art o fact but but what th movy's really about is is harrison fort a man out of timeright is indiana jones a man out of time or can he find a place in this can of new world that he is not used to inhabiting is there a reason for him to continue living cause the premise of the movy is that they basically tried to undo the shil abuffof if it of al all that you remember the child buff was in i believe crystal skull i and tom and child buff is now he is been killed in in the war at presonmov the via now more and ta and indee has lost i son and he is broken up with his wife marryan jones and tom and he it has nothing to live for basically an he goes on this koun of one final adventure there is a call back near the end ofthismotama can giveit away there is a call back near the end ofthis movy two raters tht is one of the best writing reversels i've seen in movies for a very very long time gea reversal in movye is where you say a line in a particular way and later there is call back to the limebut and completely diffrent way there is a reversal at the at the end of this movy that is really one o those beautiful reversals i've seen in a movy in years highly enjoyable all movies today isby fifteen minutes too long some the chases go on will bet to long but why this movid in't do better at the box officis beyond me because honestly it is pretty good it is pretty good n again the end makes up for all that the end is really really strong the last ten minutes o this really great highly recommended indian an jones in the dalf dustn't he when my dad said that houwas kenna surprise and then we heard from producer's act the same thing it is as i say delightful i' gate time for a thing that i hate uga it is amazing to me tht the left has decided to own the idea that parents should nove should not be told as social service workers working for the state try to turn their boys into girls in vice versa this not insane position and yet it is now been adopted by wide swaths of he democratic party phill murphy the governor of new jersey who barely on a gomnitorial race he shouldhave won easily a lost to a person him jack he he on overgon him jackson a relic no one knew who the gui was and he almost lost to him wu hereis governor murphy explaining that yes school workers should hide from parents the corncod social transition of their children this is nuts why is mister crissi wrong when he says parents ar the l nce who knows no bast chere and they should be infault let us at we took these actions because it is the right thing to do to protect these precious young people well one of the attorneys fair school boug bord an marbara one at these districts said that this am blocking of a school councillor saffnumber from telling a parent about this is at a violation of a constitutional right for a parent o direct ind control the upbringing of their cholder and why is not that compelling yisly parents are the th the existential a reality in t in the upriging of any child without question i do not deny that for one second but let us not vily the constitution a constitutional and civil rights a

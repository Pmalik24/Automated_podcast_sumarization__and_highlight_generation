welcome to the huberman science science pace to ri mandrhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and optomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor peter atea his second time on the podcast doctor peteratea is a medical doctor who did his training at stamford school of medicine john's hopkins school of medicine and the national institutes of health he is a world expert in all things related to health spin vitality and longevity in this episode we focused on many topics focusing mainly however on health spin and longevity and mental health healthspin and longevity of course relate to how long one lives and doctor atea goes systematically through the seven major causes of death world wide beginning with cardiovascular disease and cerebral vascular disease also cancer also accident related deaths de mensha deaths of despair and in every case explains the three or four major levers that one can employ in order to offset that is to prevent those major causes of death what follows is an incredibly informative and actionable set of tools for anyone male female young or old he explains the behavioral neutritional supplementation based and prescription drug based approaches that one can use in order to extend healthspin and longevity doctor ate explains the key tests and markers that we should all pay attention to if our goal is to extend our healthspan and how to do while maximizing our vitality this is something that not a lot of people think about when they think about healthspin and longevity but as doctor at illustrates for us emotional health has everything to do with our physical health and vice versa and he shares quite openly about his own experiences in pursuing ways to improve emotional health and thereby healthspin life spin and vitality doctor atea is quite open about his own experiences exploring different practices to improve emotional health as ways not just to improve healthspan longevity and vitality but of course also to derive the most meaning and satisfaction from life throughout today's discussion we also discuss doctor atea's newly released book which is entitled outlive the science and art of longevity this is a phenominal book i have read it cover to cover now three times i have extensive notes written througholth and the book of course focuses on longevity and healthspan and also has and extensive section on emotional health gets quite detailed into doctor tea's personal experiences with emotional health and tools to improve emotional health that are very actionable for anybody to use think the best way for me to summarize my feelings about the book would simply be to read the bachacic quote which i provided i read quote finally there is a modern thorough clear end actionable manual for how to maximize our immediate and lonterm health firmly grounded in data and real life conditions this is the most accurate and comp rehensive healthguide publish to date outlive is not just in formative it is important and indeed outlive is an important book as is the discussion that doctor tia graciously provided us in to day's episode outlive is released on march twenty eighth twenty twenty three and is available for preorder prior to that date you can find a link to were it sold in the shownote captions before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desir and effort to bring zero costoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is element element is an electorolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolites and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactrolectorolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that one gram of sodium two hunder milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolites and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleement doccom slash huberman and now for my discussion with doctor peter a tea doctor ata peter welcome back tanksman gou to be back and sounding better this time looking forward to talking about in number of important topics with you that you covering your book maybe could start off by trying to set the frame for what people should be thinking about in terms of vitality and especially longeevity i mean i think you im have to be mindful how you define these terms and i'm not get a suggest that the way i define them is the only way rneserly the best way but i think from a climical perspective it is the way that makes the most sens to me having thought about this for the better part of a decade it involves some bifrcation between life spend and health span lifespan is very easy for people to understand is binery you are alive were you are not alive and a clearly part of longgevity is about how long you live i think for a lot of people that tends to be where the discussion ends that tends to be the focus of it righted sort of wik longgevity somehow implies living for an a hundred years hundrand twenty or some something liketo that ixtone we talk a lot about maximum lifespan i'm even in laboratory experiments with mice that' sort of one of the metrics that is that is discussed is what is what is maximal life span of the animals i'm but there is an equally if not slightly i think potentially more important partalongevity which is healthspan and healthspan is squishier and i think it requires some definition now the the medical definition of healthspan is the period of time by which you are free from disability and disease ai find that to be a not particularly healthful definition because by that definition you and i have the same healthspan to day that we did thirty years ago but i know you pretty well me pretty well thirty years ago we were twice the men we are now based on what we believe our healthspan is right interms of our cognitive function our physical performance andthings that i've clearly experience the deterioration of my physical function as i'mture you have going back to when you were attean ag or laeteen ager early twenties and i think that needs to be captured somehow in healthspan the way i think of healthspan really is along these three dimensions physical cognitive an emotional can not necessarily suggesting that that is the only way to do it but i do think that clinically it makes the most sense and therefore any thing that really becomes a question of longgevity has to address all of these issues life span physical health beyond that of just straight up disability and disease cognitive health independent of and separate from pathology such as dimension an emotional health which of course is by far the most complicated of all of these because we have no biomarkers for it we have now is not you can get a scan on somebody and determine the state of this i'm but nevertheless it is its important ret and it dramatically factors into quality of life with all f that in mind what are the major exit points for people along the life span routh start with the the binary one deat ar alive yet i i think most every one shealthy would to be alive rather than dead what are ther typical ways that people exit from alive to dead and a how can people stay on the a free way of life to speak this is again a greate analysis we internally a in our practice call this the death bar analysis and it is the surprisingly trevial analysis that i'm just surprised the death bars are not plastered front in center on every doctor's office i' if you simply just look at actuarial datea which are readily available through the s d sea and do a little bit of data manipulation in a na alysis you can pretty quickly realize what the horsemen of death are cause there is largely speaking can a four horsemen of death a the first and most a consequential in terms of the numbers is the diseases of atheros carosis that is a cardial vascular disease being the lions share of that but also cerebrovascular disease anything that has to do with atheris corosis rises to the top now that is that is true in theunited states but it is even more true outside of the unitedsites is even more true glowbely son o the words when you look at the relative difference between the number one cause of death in the u s and number too which is cancer a the gap is actually smaller in the u s than glowbily globily it is enormous we are talking about eighteen to nineteen million people a year that are dying of athero scarotic card yo of ascular disease in the world where is number to is cancer out about eleven million how does the nmber change when you include a sreup of ascular disease yei it adds it adds a bit to it a strup of asco disease has there is largely speaking you can die sort of through embolic events which are the majority of them tho se plaimed for people at what embolic of thente are yes taking a step back wt what what is the brain need more than anything it needs bloodflow anything that interrupts blood flow to the brain that results in eschemia is a devastating and it is devastating in a more redi ou now readily apparent fashion than virsally any other organ a one way that that can happen is if a clot or disruption of blood flow occurs through obstruction of bloodflo sop that con cur through clotzo for exemples presentas atrial februlation and a blood clot gets festering in the right atrium and they happen to have a whole in between the ou know atria of their hearts called it paten frmen of valley and a clot goes from right to left it can make its way up into the a arterial circulation and an happen that way where yuically blufdflow the much more common way it occurs is the same way it occurs in the heart which is you have plack build up and that plack becomes unstable that plac ruptures and the rupture of that plac results in an immediate attempt by the body to fix the problem but in doing it walls off the ardery meaning the blood flo distal to that point that now blood is acutely being robbed of that however there are other ways that people can a have this problem and you have the whole hemoragic side of this you can have blood vessels that ou now small blood vessels in the brain that will rupture as a result of hi blood pressure for example hypertension factors both into both sides of this ocquasion a both in the hart and in the brain a the majority of these are embolic however do not quote me on this exactly but call it four five to one strokes result from an embolic phenomenon as opposed to a a hemora gic phenomenon a bleeding phenomenon i do not want take us too far off on a tangu but as long as we are here talking about bleeds of erisos clots whateres some of the major risks for bleeds i mean i know some people out there have at it predispositione for being a bleders as there sometimes called or cloters sothings a factor five lidon mutations h which can be exascerbated in women for incence by taking certain or contraceptives a min it and there is usulests if people arnc in the they can look up theo what are the factors a controlling a bleeding and a predispose people to be in clotter but for the typical person out there who feels healthy but might do well to know whether not they are predisposed to be a bleader or a clotter whall what sorts of things rise to the top of that list and that people might want a checkn well imean there might be sortor two diffrent hings going on in that question but i think if your question is when we look at the subset of people who ware at highest risk for hemoragic strokes the far more germain question is not underlyine coagulopathy the far more germain question really comes down to blood pressure blood pressure would be the first second and third driver of that high pretension is hands down the leading driver of hemoragic stroke phenomenon o caso i'll just a briefly interruptand as am since sometimes your recommendations deviate from the the standerds that one would find on liner in the typical doctor's office atd what point do you get concerned well i i actually find myself a quite in line with the most recent available data on blood pressure and this has been am obviously is a topic that is of high concern to any doctor whos taken caripations who even pays a fraction of attension to the available literature which is that basically with each subsequent blood pressure trial the data are becoming clearr and clearer that the more aggressively you manage blood pressure to be within the one twenty over eighty range the better et otheres a recent study that even looked at going from what used to be considered acceptable which was one thirty to one thirty five over eighty eighty five we use to basically say that is kind of the first level of high pretension and we would say well do you really need to be better than that and the answer turns out to be yes you do if you want to reduce hartatacxs an strokes be it is better to be one twenty over eighty than one thirty five over eighty five now this is a whole other rabit all that we do not need to go down butit is a total obsession of mine which is how do you measure of person's blood pressure i think this is potentially i have to give a thought but honesty i could say top three under diagnosed fixible problems in the united states to day and probably globily another wers there are too many people walking around with high blood pressure who do not know it and i think part of the problem is it is something that is mostly done in the doctor's office and the readings that you get in the doctor's office can be often misleading you you have heard this phenomenon of white cohigh pretension to you go tothe doctor your blood pressures virtually never measured correctly in the doctor's office the cuff they put on in the yes squeezebull yes not you i you look at the rigor with which you me to measure person's blood pressure the right way to do it is the person has to be sitting this for five minutes doing nothing o cafolk when u go to the doctors now do not let the do not let te lit cress ut pressure again sitting for fivementes and that does not include in the waiting room caus it ren lifinma had i hae an walk over right it is to make them stand there you you wonto be sitting there this i'm a manual cuff is better than an automated cuff but not enough people use manual blood pressure a manual blood pressure means that put a cuff on you and they she put a stethoscope on the breakial artery and there using the human ear to listen which believe or not you would think a machine is better but it is not the machine can be misled by different sounds no i do not want to suggest that atomated cuffs are useless the're not but when an automated cuff gives you an answer that is potentially suspect always back it up with a manual i'm pretty relentless about checking my blood pressure and im i'll do side toside manual verses automated every day and there is easily a ten to fifteen point difference between them if tis the silly plession but can people check their own blood pressure a meaning manually yet just coud it could i get get a comea malban and learn how to do it yet i thinks o man i can do it but on esa u av my wife do it she is a nerse i'm but it is not rocket science to check blood pressure i'm i'm guarantee there is a great vityo on you tou tit explains the physiology of it and if you are willing to splurge on a good enough stethoscope and cuff the the cuff i have is really easy to use it is once you put it on you knw it is in a single thing i'm squeezing the bulb and looking at the pressure gauge while i've got the im a stethoscope on my partery given the importance of blood pressure and this a cis claros is being at the top of te list of a risks ri'm dying i'm it seems to me it might be worth the expense what wouds that typical range of cofs for or quality i i i do not get's not it is not an ordimates i feel my blood pressure cuff is forty box i'm and the stethoscope is a couple hundred box if you are getting a good one and i'm you kno good automated cuff there is i i i have no affiliation with any these companies i use a i use two automated cuffs one's called withings the other one's made by company called omron o m aro and i'm theyre both decent but again they tend to run hy and i have yet to find a credible explanation from carteologist as to why everybody acknowlodges that the manual one when done correctly is the answer but i've heard wonkey andsures about why automated ones are sometimes in correct and again its just made me realize we are not checking lood pressure often enough on people were overly relying on blood pressures in the doctor's office which are not being done correctly o we basically have our patience do this relentlessly how often a let' say one buise this cause i think for two hundered forty dollars an if i realize that is prohibited for some people but geven the cossas some the other things theire discussed on this in many other a a i would just ow people start with an automated cuff to begin with in start wetd there we generally have people do it for two weeks you no we we give our patients a little spread sheet that automatically calculates averages and stuff that tells them what to record and wear and we just say look for two weeks we wanto see two recordings a day and you kow do in morning and an afternoon slash p m recording twice a day for two weeks and let us see those numbers and we'l scrutinize them further and if those numbers come in fine let us re visit in a year we will the day ever come when a a watch were i rispand can do this really well i hope and i'm investigating it i i'm actually gon to be trying one out yin a couple of weeks with a company that i tried two years ago two years ago when i try that i was not impressed i cont of punted on it the company which i gess all not share the name of the company ju see at but they they claim that it is significantly better i'm n to put it to the tast again and it is basically a continuous monitor it it is a risk device that about every fifteen minutes throughout the course of the day will check your blood pressure to me this would be i honestly probably more import how much emphasis i place on c g m as a great thing to beable to gasclycosman right i i would argue this would be more important when the day comes that we can cantinuously assess people's blood pressure m it would be an integral part of a persons healthcheck up once a years do two weeks of continueus blood pressure monitering right now to do that which i've done as well is cumbersome that it borders on absurd you actually have to wear a blood pressure cuff that is attached to a clumsy device that goes through the whole inciflation exercise every fifteen minutes including while you are sleeping you ow it provides some in sight but it is disruptive that it is not what we really want what we the dream would be a patch that you could put i do not know over youre chest that can somehow impute changes in blood flow or something that and regulate but we will see o between optical censors and things that i hope that we are getting closer to having something i do not want a stroke i do not want a bleed in the brain i want a clok u as long as were at this number one on the list iculer claros is being the number one killer what are the major ways to prevent it yes there is three big ones that stand out top and center and then there is cunt of a fourth one that i think is the the foundational piece the three big ones we have talked about one blood pressure if your blood pressures one twenty over eighty or better that is important the second is not smoking turns out that smoking and blood pressure are both devastating for arteries a but for different reasons right smoking is devastating from a chemical perspective it is completely irritating to the endithelium to the endithelium as is the single cell lining that is the innermost part of the arterial and arterial wall this a pretty special organ i'm again it is it is it is a bit naive but understandable that people just think of arteries as tubes im they are much more complicated than that they have many layers to them but this particular layer is unusually important it has an outsized importance because it is the one that is in contack with the luminal side right where the blood is flowing in the tube and anything that injures that has significant consequences smoking is irritating to that in achemical way and blood pressure is irritating to that in a mechanical way thoug those two things basic we you just want it but that is the lowhanging fruit in my world reat you just do not ont o have those things causing irritation to the endithelium because that renders you now susceptible to the third factor which is apo be bearing lipe approtines i want a talk about apo be i'm in depth but as long as do not smoke is the second recommendation on the list i can we better define im smoking aand what is being smoked it' sume nicotine for i'm right what about canabuts and what about vaping of nicatinin canabus because vaping has become much more common gow it is a great question and it is sadly something we do not have a great answer for i can certainly tell you that there is no reason to believe that smoking canabas is somehow better than smoking cigaretes but the dose seems to be significantly lower in other words let us consider a person who smokes a pack a day for twenty years we call that a twenty pack year smoker some one who smokes two packs a day for fifteen years is a thirty pack yer smoker that is a person whose dramatically increased their risk of a many cancers including lung cancer and also their risk of cartyovascular and subrovascular disease again i'm not a i'm not a t h s ga i do not i cannot niserely speak for the habits of people that are smoking maroana i cannot imagine the're smoking that much probably not yet while on a on a joint to cigarette basis they are probably equivalent in terms of harm it i do not know lets say a person smokes a joint a day that would be smoking a cigarette a day it is a twentieth of a pack again i do not want to say that there is no downside to that but it is is probably significantly less i do not i do not think the risk fully tracks i think the same is probably true for vaping and i i might be clear i do not think vapings a good idea i might my you kdont the last time i looked at the data on this it was surprizingly sparse but to me the only advantage i could see to vaping was if it was the only way a person would stop smoking there was you ni sort of looked at it as it was the definitely the lesser of two evils but tho but far the better snaria was not to do any of these things if if niccotine is lwhath you are after there are better ways to get nicotine for example throug losanges and gum and things that that you should not be turning to those things to to do it but but if it was if gum is here and cigarettes er here you do not vaping was probably here but boy i do not know for those listening a a peter spaced his hands far apart for gum and smoking and put vaping about a third of the way a from gum a tord a smoking in other words vaping is not good for you but it is not as bad as smoking that would be my that would be my do you have a you have probly ooked into this as well would you nver did not hav asod on niccotin i did an episode on canabus and that the discussion around canabas gets little contentious for reasons that are importance we have funny people the moment some one starts to confront canabus as a potential health harm people say it is not as nearly's bad as alcohol which is a crazy argument right getting hit by a bosses in nearly's bas getting hit by a morter cycle in most cases but sometimes now that is this kind of silly it and clearly canabas has medical applications ye clear clearly and then it becomes an issue of the racio of t h c to c b d pirc b d forms a shaly being quite effective for the treementser informs of apilaps the a suncle charlotte's web this ischay wants called very highteac se containing canabas clearly predisposes especially young males to later on at pcychosis those tat re suring to become clear clear enough to me anyway that people ought to be aware of them at least to may me mak decisions on the bustness op those when it comes to the smoking verses bapings just very very apparent that the chemical constituents of the vape and what people are inhaling are terrible for people and are loded with carcenagens and a much o other stuff many of which cross the blood raing barrier that is what worries me the mos niv sam not clinition but any time i heare about small molecules that small enercanic molecules getting across the blubing bary and then being maintained in ther ons for many many years i worry because the experiments is on going mostly in young people anway without going too far down that track i i think if people can avoid smoking and vaping they should and as you mention tere are other delivery devices for nicotine and canabas tinctures at patches and a gums and things that umedibles that im if people choose to use those substanceis yi i i think sometimes people would benefit to to imagine what the surface area of the lung is right if you took the alvialer airsacks of the lungs and spread them out you would easily cover a tennis court remarkable now just think about any time you inhal something you are exposing your body is adept an absorbing it i mean we have this unbelievable system for gas exchange that was designed for gas exchange and any time you are putting something else in that wag you are doing a really good job of getting it into your body be mindful of what that is im and in that look that applies to to pollution to i mean that the the pm two point five dat is pretty good i think once used particulates thaetr lessthan two point five mycrons ar are getting straight into the body im which is look a great argument for avoiding air pollution rightoman i i i was finded findin not to get off on this tangen but to me the most compelling arguments around cleaner energy have nothing to do with greenhouse gases they have to do with air pollution i promise you more people are dying from the particulate matters in air that result from burning coal then are ever going to die from see o to omissions that result from that it is not its and and i woul argue tht's king to be two orders abagnitude it is not even n the same sip coat make sense during the fires would seem to follow me ah because when i was in orte colt wern i ar bunch of fires thand weconstantly looking i ma wake up in the morning everything was covered with ash i ma dog was having trouble orthing i was having trouble breathing ever n was suffering a but thereare websides that one can go ecu just at air pollution and we tend to only do this during fires than no when i'mas southern calfornia that than to be fires here im num it is correlation not causation but for sure i did not set those fires folks but it is clear that it dis drops your breathing for a very long period of time but it is the long tail of that that we are really talking it ear the very small particulate that we know fire fighters for instance and certain im industrial workers can end up with that stuff inbedded in their brain tissue for extremely long periesis just not good i you make a really interesting point about em that the a the call for cleaner energy canwe run that one up to to a washing a settle some of the debates about climate changest by getting straight right right a hellic flagis vi pass all all the garvage that is im that is being spewed back and forth and just and basily get to the issue at hand right ye just just just make it better for people to not die from the direct consequence i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens it letic greens now called ag one is a vitam in mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundation ol nutritional needs i've been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast hereas i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me i the probiatics that i need for got health ir got is very important its populated by got mycrobioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turm health and those probiatics enothleti greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition ithletic grens contains and number of adaptigins vitemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste cripe if you' to tryath letic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubormen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera and they'l give you a year supply of vitem ind three k too againd that is thatleti green stock calm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitem ind thre k to trying to avoid a sers c ach such a difficult word to say especialy for narro scientists are terial sclerosis i get right while it is athera which is easier casia atherosclerosis o there yot have not makin life more complicate for myself typical of me o k am blood pressure keeping it your one twenty eigh one twenty over ety or better do not smoke let us jus throw in do not the sir oman is plant my flang iddonaways wade those things in your system if you really want to get nhe catineor canabus in your system apo b what is the story with apo b ok to explain this you have to tolerate a little bit of chemistry i'm everybody's herd of clesterall and a i i i certainly devote quite a bit of time in the book to explaining this because it is important a man it is defonally one of those areas where i initially received a lot of pushback from the editor and there was a thought that a this is a bit more technical than it needs to be but i i think that sometimes you dou need to resort to longer dissertations to dispel mythology colesterall is a lipid it is a molecule that the body synthasizes it is a molecule that is essential for life if you cannot synthesize clusteral you cannot live you yofll die in utero there are rare genetic conditions that prevent the successful synthesis of clesterall i you don embryos that have those mutations do not survive o k why do we need this stuff we need this stuff primarily for two reasons first it makes up a very important structural component of sell membranes as a cell is a sphere wwe look at them and think their circles but their spheres and their fluid right they they they are not just little perfect big bowling ball s or balloons they actually morf and shape and move in these pats that this whatswhat allows cells to be next to each other and all soats in these they also have channels across all of them and those channels are held in place by among other things klestrall and pospholipits the second thing that makes clesterall important it is the precur sir to some of the most important hormonts in our body our sexormons testostron estrogen porjestron in addition to glucocorticoids if you look at them it is really funny in of people with your looking if you guge givemeg the structure of these things ore con wather all basically the same they all look really similar and they are all pretty much just ten plates of clestral understandably when it is something that is that important the body would leave nothing to chance we make all of our own clestral the clestral that you eat in food largely irelevant it is sterified clestral it means it has an estraside chain it is too bulky to absorb in the gut most clestrall that you eat in food just goes out your gei tract okso we have this superimportant molecule that every cell in the body makes but there is a bit of a problem is iccel two probs the first probm is not every cell can make as much as it needs all the time you have this demand problem for example if you are sick you are ging to need to make farmor glucacorticoids your body's response is going to be to ramp up cortoisall production to mobilize fuel ind do a whole bunch of other things and certain cells the adrinal glands aregig to be called on to rise to a higher level of performance and they are not n beable to make enough cortoisall they are going to have to boro or take clestral from other cells in the body ec crene things we use to notice in the icese you i never knew why it was happening i now know is the few times i would accidentally order the wrong set a labs on a pation in the ice you and also order a lipid test or something you would always notice their clestra levels were dropping surum clestral levels and i now realize why because they were basically just funneling klestrall to the adrinals to make more the cortoisal but they needed to combat whatever theywrein the ice you for which is usually the most severe form of you'l stress the body is under you have to be able to transport this stuff and then the second problem is as klestral being elipid is not water soluble the the most dominant highway in the body is the circulatory system we we can use the lemphatic system in things that but for the most part we use aur circulatory system as the highway to move stuff around and the highway is made up of water klasmw which is whicher is the liquid component of your blood is water and therefore things that are water soluble move easily glucos a sodium electrolites all of those things are dissolvable in water and therefore they do not need a carrier you just dissolve them in the water and they can go that is why your liver can make glucos that your brain can easily get and there does not need to be a carrier or an intermediary or anything that but unfortunately with clestrall being alipid we cannot do that just as water and oil do not mix clestrall and plasma do not mix the body had to come up with a trick and the trick was designing a vehicle that was water soluble on the outside and fat soluble on the inside that you could bary the clestrall inside along with triglesterides and on the outside it was covered in protine which is water soluble and that is the that is the thing that moves around and that thing is called a lipe arotine and as its name suggest its part lipid part protine lipit on the insipe protine on the outsid and those lip approtines am come largel in two different families a one family comes from a lineage called apo b the apo b family which is short for apo lipe approtine b one hundred is a family that is derived from the liver and each of those lipe approtines has one and only one apo lipe approtine b one hundred on it we shorten it and just call it apo b cause we do not really worry about apolipe approtine b forty eight which is a sat attached to cilo mipcrons that are responsible for fat absorption in the gut the're very short lived that on't really factor into athros grosas soreni just for the purest out there there is an apo b forty eight when im talk about it when i say apo b what i'm talking about is a protine that raps around a subset of these lipe approtines there is another family of lipe aprotines called apo a or apo lipe approtine a this is a much more complicated family and i rant a talk about it here icaus were wetake an our to just explain how the apo lipe approtine a family works but i'll i'll i'll ugge the punch line is there are many apo lipe aprotine azers variable numbers of apo as on those protines and they are all part of a family called high density lipe aprotines back to the apo b gie they are of the lo density lipe approtine lineage you have heard the term el dell an ah d'el what as it referring to it is basically referring to thei relative concentrations of protine and lipids in the lipe aprotines and not surprisingly based on their names the h d ls are higher density more protine less lipid the el dls lo densy lipe aprotines and vl dels very lodensity lie approtines and ideels intered intermediate densly lie arotines are a'll lower density which means more lipid doprotine ther're different sizes there is a hll munch of other things going on most important fact in all of this is that the apo bs are athrogenic what we are about to talk about n ext is perpetuated by life ofprotines that have an apo b on them everything in the story right now is just about how do you get clesterall round the body and these m protines that have lipid in the middle u less jus take apo b for example many many billions of them flooding round in our body even in the healthiest of people e u and there being shuttled to tissues that need them em the adrinals muscle heart et cetera what sets the demand for these things for instance could somebody have relatively high el dl a mabeven higher than s from high end of chart or even above high and apo b but there is some sort of demand metabolic demand or or ther their wait training a lot or the're running marithons and they need a lot of ell the al he reason i ask us is because it is easy for the uninformed person which i include myself in that group sujust that here oh eldiel bad collesterall bad apo b bad when in fact you very graciously spelled out the fact that the these things ichally perform of functional role in the healthy body before we get into why they are or can be bad why would you want a lodensy poproting what is that doing for somebody and is there any circumstance where the wa people are exercising or thinking or not sleeping or sleeping too much its that a higher level lafhi reflects a a healthy metabolic need we do not have any evidence of that to dat em all of the functions that i described can be function can be done by the ah del the hidensy oprotines the apo as can do all of it apo b and lodensi lipoprotines are just there just the necessary a we do not easily i mean now we do not understand why we have em ander this is the part that is really interesting to me em most species do not even have apo b and is a result of that most species are chemically incapable of athros grosis if some one could zeero out theire apo b in their el diel we assume they would function just fon we know they would because we have certain people who walk around with genetic mutations that render them that way well furthermore we also know that there is a bit of a mith out there that collesterall the clesterall you measure in your blood is essential for brainhealth for example it is an understandable thing right you you can speak to this very eloquently the rule of colesterall in the brain the i r ate done when i was a postock at stamford siwas went out i was moren't stamford train ta stampor wheries upbright diet stamford hofully along tur im now do tell me how long well wr y the and darly oredy the charley monger thing and make sure that you never go back to stamford that you cannot either there exactly we cured already thit when i was a postock i were to the gining ban barras o i know covly ats ta different person then o for reasons that people can look up men's name anyway incredible scientist and but there was some one in his lab that discovered that colesterall is a critical component of the snapp to genesis proces the for the formation of connections between eurons and the developing brain and then that what when on to it lead to the discovery of things a thrombospondence being important for snapped jesis et cetera but collestral citcentral in the brain development mechanisms to get you want collestrall around jaffer brain development in fact i think very low fat diets and very low clestral dietstring early development can really impair brain development as i understand ye it is not it is ot entirely clear why but here is what we know when you are born your syrum clesteral levels are very low children infantson children have veary low levels of clestrall they would have and i should explain one thing that is importare not milinated yet right i've ben there they a aside introp by th a milin of course that the sheathing around a a ner on neuronal ac ons it which excelleries the propagation of nerve signals and which is deficient in things multicles clarosis is esentialy fat made up of fosphelip and requires clestral for sensis but but young children are not very well miling avin the spinal court is mil right o l ais a ancs and this is of it is interesting right we would all agree that clesterall is more important to infants and children than to anybody else right it would be the most important substraiht for seanes development and yet infants and children have virtually unmeasurable levels of clesterall it really starts to take off in your tean age years rights o clesteral basically syrum clesteral levels rise basiclly monotonically throughout life im women get a big bump at manapas it really goes up for them im but what is interesting is how is it how do we reconcile the fact that infants and children have really low levels of syrum clesterall yet clearly undergo seanes maturation without any problems ind a basily comes down to to folloin what you measure in the serum is but a fraction of the total body pool of clesterall we get a little bit of a the light under noe wit is the e of the the street lamp under ddrunk under a drunk of his ran an a roteryijust because we are looking there we tend to think that that is what were seeing but im if you took the in hie circulatory pool of clestral it is about ten per cent of your total body colestral it is a tiny fraction of it it is what we measure that is what we have access to but it really represents virtually none of it i do want to say something cause you mentioned l d l i want to tie this fact to the reader rit or the listener rather apo b refers to the lipoprotine the singular lipe approtine rapped around an l d l particle if you happen to be lucky enough that your doctor measures an apo b level it is a blood test it says apo b ex number of meligram's predest leader that is measuring the concentration of that protine it is a direct measurement of the concentration of l d l and v l d l particles when you have a blood test that says l d l it usually does not say l d l it usually says l d l c or l d l clestral because l d l is not a laboratory measurement l d l cleestral is a laboratory measurement and it is just taking the total number of l d l particles breaking them apart and measuring how much colestral is in them l d l c measures the total concentration of clestral in the l d ls apo b measures the number of them and they are different but one of them is far superior at predicting risk and it is apo b the number of particles is much more predictive of risk than the amount of cleestral contained within them fascinated first time i've understood a t l l d l and these a lipo rotines in a way that make sense o thank you i'm sure others feel the same way what apo b level is your red flag cut off ri u i should have my apo be measured recently and i'm defly above the hih end i discussing this over dinner i yand wm and a just to tie this back m i hope that is a stake dinner and that should be fine given the fact that dietary collestral has no directling to apo b and lser but dietary saturated fact does ah o kasil which is not thay were notk an a mistake or i will but nonasarily one in the fatier cuts although poly will be a for me what is what is the hih end that you a hi and flag at what point you sare say ah we need to do something an they will talk about what people can do yes this is a complicated question because it depends on many factors the first factor it depends on is what is your objective and i do pose this question directly to a pation right i say lok we have got this disease thit is the number one cause of death now you can die with it or you can die from it that thoese your choices statistically speaking more people will die from it than anything else but if you live long enough we will all die wi th it to some extent if you are me and i come from a family history as i write about this in the book where basically every man in my family except one has died of athros grosis and they have all done very prematurely a my dad lost brothers in their forties and fifties a by some miracle my dat is toll alive at eighty six but that i think that is in large part because he at least had the good sense to listen to doctors and take medication to lower his cluster on blood pressure im if you are objective is to not die from hart disease and only to die with it thend you want apobe as low as possible now how low you go depends on when you start because one way to think about this is it is an area under the curve problem the longer you wait to start doing something about this the more agressively you need to do something about it im i think a better way to think about this though is to go back to what we talked about with smoking would you agree that smoking is causily related to lun ancer yes just to be clear andrew you do not think that it is just an association that smokers get more lung ancwer no i do not you ou nonders you believe that smoking causes lung ancwer then yes oh iment there a number of now n iisteps in ond yt mn i now somebody is really oney get a to your drill into the log it they could say gets not ac to the smoking its a somma a destruption of the indithelial salining that smoking triggers that that li triggers that i assumesi and i agree with you by the way i think thet date are very clem very relievey yoso but but i'm going some place very important yer because if there is one topic that does not get enough attention in medicine its causality and causality is an obsession of mine most of the day on some level i sit around thinking about causality and i think the hardest part about studying medicine with respect to human beings is how difficult it is to infer causality for most things that we do if you believe that smoking is causaly related to lung ancwer thend smoking cessation reduces the probability of ung aner that is that is a logical equivalency there can be no debate about that what if i said to you andrew this is going to be our new philosophy around smoking cessation you are youre own anoint you the czar of smo ki sussation if people pick up smoking no problem relona smoke but we are going to assess their risk for lung cant sir yusing a model that predicts when their ten year risk of lung cancer gets above a certain level we are going to recommend that they stop smoking were gong to look at their age their sexs their family history som biomarkers that might help us were gin to even do scans of their lungs and once we think they cross a threshold we are their risk of lung cancer is high enough let us just say it is twenty five per cent bum you make them stop you tell them it is time to stop is that a logical approach to treating smoking in lung cancer or would be better to say given that we know cigarettes are causily related to this how about you never start smoking and the minute you do we pull the cigarette out of your mouth and explain to you that you are doing something that is causily related of course it would be the latter not the former it would be idiotic to suggest that we indorse smoking until you cross a certain threshold well this now becomes the germain question there is no ambiguity that apo b is ausily related to atheris carosis owi can i tell you that i can tell you that looking at all of the clinical trial literature all of the epidemia epidemiologic literature and perhaps even most importantly the mandellian rantomizations all of these things tell us because by mendellion randomizations meaning genetic me humans out there that make very little apo be or it is tat very ligely exactly s we hale graties he can say if you make very little you are not goin to die as a quickly nots er life as if you make too much that is madellin ranmization is such an elegant tool where you basically let genes do the randomization and as you said there is a gradation of eldiel concentration or apo be concentration that occurs from insanely low to insanely high and this is a wildly pollygetic polly more fix set of conditions and we can look at the outcomes of those people based on the random sorting of those genes and there is no ambiguity eldiel is causily related eldiol clasteraller apo be causily related to athros crosis well if that is true and i have not seen a credible argument that it is not there are people who argue that it is not by the way but that you do not have credibility in their arguments then you have to say that what we are doing in medicine today is very backwards because we were doing medicine to day is the following we are saying i'm ci'm coming out this in a long way but your question is important that i want to answer this way we are answering your question today as follows we are saying andrew let us do a ten year risk calculation of your risk of mace may stands for major adverse cardak avent it is the metric we use in medicine major adverse cardec avent is a heart attack stroke ou know or death basically resulting from these things and we have calculators ther're pretty good at predicting your ten year event risk they will look at your colestra levels your blood pressure the will ask if you smok the will ask some family history questions and they will spit out a number now we should do yours after the fact and i do not know if we did it for a person whosis una year in year mid forties it would pprobably spit out less than five per cent risk for a major adverse cardec avent in the next ten years in fact the models do not even work if age is below forty the first time i went to do one of these tests when i was in my mid thirties could not do it the olgrtm breaks let us or a likea n does not work the the implication there is if youare aif your mace risk is less than five per cent the thinking as you do not need to treat eldealarapobe i argue that that makes absolutly no sense it is just as idiotic as the analogy i used round smoking if a risk is cazzl and it is modifiable it should be modified regardless of the risktail in duration then the question becomes to what level and again the earlier you start the less aggressive you need to be the less damage that there already frexemple we do ct angigrams on our patients if the citi angergram shows no evidence of calification no evidence of soft plack that means grosly their cornery arteries are still normal histologically thei're probably not because nobody probably makes it to our age with histologically perfect cornariarteries we might be satisfied with a person's apo b being at the fifth per centile of the population which would be about sixty melegrams per desoletor but if we have any other factors meaning were starting later in life younow or a person already has gross evidence of disease calcification soft plac family history is significand any other risk factors are present i mean we will we will treat apo be to thirty to forty melegrams perdesoleter which is in a probably the first per centile and if somebody sitting up an the sa low one thirties what where does that coun af flag does that race for you and i realize it is ighly contextral aac et cetera no know it is a hu dread flag again just because something is cauzle does not mean its your your guarantee to get it there are smokers who do not get lungcancer youre thers can be somebody listening to this who says mike my grandmothers ninety five years old she isis herker clesterall is sky high and she is alive and well and i will say absolutely there are a lot of people walking around that way just as there are a lot of smokers walking around who do not yet lung cancer yu you cannot you cannot impute these things on an individual basis you basically have to ask the question how do i make the best judgment about an individual frum heterogenious population data and based on what are cauzle and non causal inferences around risk to me if a person has very high apo b and they do not want to be treated for it thend the best we would do is say let us at least establish that there are no other risk factors present and let us at least do the most investigation we can around the existing damage and if that person has a perfect sc t engia graham i'm in a push less hard than if they have a devastating angi gram and by the ay devastating in my book is just any amount of calcification or soft plack anything that shows up grostly that you can see on a s t skan means that you have got a decade plus of really bad histology building up to it this a issou causality i think now becomes very clear as why that is cruchal and really appreciate the way you spell that out let us say somebody is apo b is eighty a hundred it say a hundred and thirty for example what sorts of things can they do to reduce that number is this always going to be prescription medication and if what are them were common forms of prescription medication that work best what ar their side of profect profiles ons o ye usually wance you want to start getting down into the thirty to sixty range youre gon to require farmicotherapy but ouknow usually we want to see how far we can get with nutrition fixing insolen resistance in an insolent resistant person will will bring this down rihtes one of the holmarks of incelen resistance as elevated trigliserides they have not we have not talked about triglisrides but they they warren't some attention because i mention it earlier but one of the other things that the lipe of protines carry is triglisrides there you are carrying fat and clesteral and if you recall apo b represents the number of particles the purpose of them is to be carrying around mostly clesterall but if you have a high amount of trigliseride you are basically using up cargo space on the ships and you need more ships if a person has elevated trigliserides and i consider anything over a hundred to be elevated even the most laboratory tests would consider normal to be up to a hundred and fifty melegram's predesoleter we would want to fix their insolent resistance bring the trigs way down ai i would want to see trig s no more than two times the h del clestralso the gratio clestrall is sixty meligram's predesileader i con sider one twenty to be through the roof high an ideally we want trigs at or below h dell clestra the intraglisterstr and a and that is thas a any loti lover datery that no actually it is most easily accomplished through carbohidrate restriction carbidr triglistrides in some ways are kind of an intergroll of carboidrate consumption a any energy restriction will get it for you a but it is most sensitive to a to restriction of o a even even under you coloric conditions carbohidrate restriction will lower tri clestrides again energy restriction would be count of first order business a but within that carbhydrate restrictionwill probly gets you there quicker you hat you sont o take the the low hanging fruit off the table and where does exercise am renerol ninimalrol for in having insolensens nonaomsory for improving a lipids in general yte but it can improvince a it can make im absoluly especially combinations of resistance training in carning lasfer yes cre once it comes down to farmer cotherapy a you basically have several classes of drug the most obvious in the one that most people are wherever called statin statin's work a both directly and indirectly on the problem directly they work by targeting an enzime a very high in the synthetic pathway of clestrall production ans one as called h m g coe reductas and think it is the second committed step i mi i can be wrong on that it is i do not think it is the first committed step but you that that endsim gets targeted con o fubiquitously throughout the body and in response to that the liver sensis are reduction in the body's pool of clestrall and the liver really tries to regulate this the liver in response to that increases its expression of eldiell receptors the liver itself has eldal receptors on its surface and as the bodi's pool of clestrall goes down the liver senses this reduction and says i want to bring more clestrall in more eldiel receptors go up and more apo b particles are coming out of circulation that is really the dominant way that they work and i fack that is kind of the dominant way that all of these drugs work another lass ob drug is called ezetemide it works bih blocking we can get as technical as you onon this it is called the nemon pick se one one transporter in the enterasite a i to explain this i borrow this explanation from tomday spring but the enterasite is a is ovosly the luminal got side cell that is responsible for absorption of clestrall memberi said earlier most the lestrile you eat you do not absorb the reason you cannot absorb it is an esterified clestral molecule cannot come in the nemon picks one one transporter it is too its physically too large but the clusterall that you senthesize which once it makes its way back to the liver gets secreted in bile down the intestan that is unesterified and readily fits into that transporter i cannot describe that guy as the ticket taker at the bar he let us everybody in as long as they fit through the door there is a check point inside the bar that basically says do we have too much clusteral if spit it out and there is another door that acts more the bouncer and he is called the eigh t pe binding cassed g five g eight and he spits excess clusterall out nd if that system's working fine everything is great but in a lot of people that eight p binding caset does not work very well and it cannot properly regulate the total body pool of clusterall there is a drug called zetamibe that simply blocks the ticket taker are there side effects to statens in at et of i e zetamibe has virtually no side effects it is a you coan think of it is a drug that is acting outside the body right it' sort of acting on a a turnstyle door in your got i have seen one patient get a stre loose stools from it that became enough of an issue that we discontinued it i would say that when zetamibe is combined with a statin which is very commonly done m it is not unheard of i do not i cannot give you in number but it could be as high as ten per cent that you see an elevation in transaminases which are endsimes that are made by the liver in response to some irritation this is where i think it is unclear what the clinical significance of that is we tend to abort the strategy in the presence of elevated transaminases a even though the literature says you do not need to our view is we have other options why would we tolerate any inflammation if you do not need to statens a do have side effects five per cent of people genuinely in legitimate legitimately get a muscle soreness a they can be debilitating it could feel count of the worst work out you have ever had thyou know the day after you have i magine you had not lifted weights and six months and then you came over and i made you do the most brutal work out of your life you you would fa i every teme i commodertate well i work o often a but every time i come over your house you put me through the most g work a ave ever through i i think you in campagns are the duwople theys sho put me through work out that get me sore for at least a two weeks after each visit that soreness that imagine you would have that persisting that five per cent of people get that response from a staten an obviously that is just non it is anon it is anon it is anon do there is a narrower subset of people that am do do do get brain fog in to experience brain frog from statens and wend we do not really understand the why there we have some theories estowhi you no maybe there maybe there getting too much of a reduction in central cluster synthesis am it get ins u subject of finding but given that we have many tools in the tool kit we do not have to tolerate side effects with these drugs any more there is a day when you now you had somebody who just had a hard attack and their basely looking down the barrel of being on a statin for the rest of their life in the were two of them and they you kow had tons of side effects and it did not matter to day while there are probably nine statins out there there are really only four that we even use and at least two of them have such a low side effect profile thougre not as potent but they have a i mean potents a it of the potents the wrongword they kdo not have the same effect am but their very potent because you are at least one of them you are taken at such a lodos am that we have got lots of statinoptions the third side effectif statins which again not common but cannot be ignored is insolent resistance it really and this is one of i think one o the benefits of at least having periodic c g m tracking is we will see this you knw weat a pation who happen to be wearing c g m in general and then we started him on weu know ten melegrams of razuva statin which is probably the worcors statin right now it is the that is generinerm for crestor am and he pings us a couple weeks laternes man my gluecose is ten points up consistently from where it has normally been con homdand hod we trouble shooted a few things after two months re lke let us just stop the crestor and a see if that fixes it and at immediately fixed it tere as ou kno we reintroduced the crestor and it happened again there is no doubt in my mind that rvlow doubt in my mind that crestor was responsible for that a and again you could say wele aybe tat's not that clinically significant but i would argue why bother i have other choices those are your two big ones am the next one it is realy the big one or arpicis canine in hipiters you kno am gosh come in up about twenty years ago maybe a woman named hellen hobbs a made a discovery ao a group of people that had a disease called familial hyperclustralemia f h or familia hyproclestrolemia is a very genetic heterogenious condition going back to that mandellian ranmizations thady tese are the people on the far end that show us how high lipid levels causathros grosis these people have very high clustral levels tipally north of three hundred melograms perdesoleader their eldeal cluster all alone is by definition at least a hundred ninety melegrams pedesoleader a very high incidents of athros grosis in this people along with other sort of injuries they accupe they 'ave much clusterall they accumulated in their tendens in their eyes buts it i it is really devastating condition if not managed correctly and she discovered this mutation in a a gene for pieci s ca nine that codes for a protene that degrades eldeal receptors these people had hiper function ing pc s canine genes their genes were just chomping down all the al dhl receptrs in the liver these people were not clearing eldiel bout five years later another subset of the population were discover that were the exact opposite these people had hypo functioning pc s canine they had virtually unmeasurable these people had eldial colestral levels of ten to twenty melograms predesolater and not surprisingly they had no heart disease that led to the development of a couple of amazing drugs that are now used i take one of these drugs i've been taken oneof these drugs for i i price certain twenty fifteene its an injectable drug take it every two weeks and it is a called a pc s canine inhibiter the drug blocks the protine and therefore gives me more eldeal receptors yanks more apobe ot a circulation interesting when we were talking outside effects i im i was thinking are there any short term benefits woegus we call this positive side effects but let us thnk of it more directly line with the underlyine biology let us say my apo be is hi mid range ta to hig we all would say a hundred a you not eighty to a hundred am and i prove my insolent resistance the matrician but we decide you knw it does not go down much an it continued a to try and knock this number down and and i take o any number of differen drugs to reduce it do i immediately start to feel better o there is no nothing s ok i think that is an important important point because of the causality issue that we are talkg about e earlier because a lot of people are walking around out there feeling fine there apobe might be a bit high they either know it or do not know it but they think ll i'm feeling fine and you gave a very rational argument earlier as to i because of the causality involved it makes far more sense to intervene yet we do not want to rely on feeling when it comes to atherus corosis just to put some prospective on this when i was in medical school we had a i i thnk i even write about this in the book we had a pythology lecture where the professor stands up there and says m what is the most common presentation of a hart attack and us keener first year med students hand shoot straight up chess pane no it is not the most common oh a shoulder pan are not radiating down the left arm note a nausia shortest af breath non we rattled this off for a few minutes negoes death the single most common presentation for a mio cardial in fuction is death more peop now i would say to day i was twenty five years ago to day it is probably not the most common because a advance cardec life support is much better but it is still strikingly common betl you could say that im the the best predictor of a hard attack is still a hard attack i well e no thing that the best underlying predictor yve it and ishally this its home when i was a postock i was living in seras is gone never forget the taking my coffee in a out on my portch in the morning this is right near the yousee us a parnasus campus n thi sguise walking on the street is pry about my age and i sait hollo and he said hollo he walked a few more steps and boone just hit the concrete died right in front of me it took i a minor to tod know that he was truly dead i'll never forget it because that is a ever frer onis atin yets it it is an event right in ther and i followed up on this and because his family the the whole thing im cause they want a report and no cocane in his system no prior history of any kind of health iss us a but he is just strolling along and his bone as if he would been hit by buss yes it is i mean again this is just one of those things were werent werness us men a lot of time talking about things that feel good and feel bad when you change them right a you take a person who is not sleeping well but who thinks their sleeping well and you asked them for a leap of faith which is hay give me a month to help you sleep really well yet you are gong to feel better you might not know it now because you do not know how bad your sleeping now you have become acclamated to this i but this is not one of those demains ou kon't exercise neutrician sleep all those things when you do those things better you feel better but i you i do not want to over promise on this yere you are not oing to feel better in the moment when you fix your lipids but you will feel better when you do not have a heart attack by all this logic everybody should get their apo be measured how early in lifeship yeople do that starting in there twentyes i in their thirties certainly if you have a family history that is of any concern i can wrett if i could live my life over again knowing if i knew everything then that i know to day i wouldhave had mind measured in my twenties i did not i did not get my apo be measured for the first time probably till i was in my forties because that is well yemaybe late thirties early forties oright im i had my first calcium scaned when i was thirty five and i had to begboro steel to get at done caus ever n was why does a thirty five yourold one do this but i something i just felt something was wrong givin my family history im and i'm glad i did i'm glat i did tbetcause i learne something that that completely change the direction my wife o can i know my ap ud be numbers and t i might be that guy who is up in the above a hundred when to get this treated a that is a promise to myself we covered im the three major ris factors which were im blood pressure i'm keeping that in check do not smoke m an apo b and we have now talked about the things to a just apo be levels we did not really talk about things to jost blood pressure i'm assuming exercise sit says one of the foro is neutristhye i wait wait management is a huge one here you now you take a erson who ise blut and and this is one of those things where we do not immediately jump on the pharmicautherabe train with bl ood pressure im because here there are side effacts sometimes im and you do have to worry about overshooting youn't really fe toworry about overshooting a person's lipids we do back off if we overshoo but it does not cause as symptom there is not a there is not a short turn immediate risk from doing that if you overshoot somebody is blood pressure medication you trade one problem for another problem they become light headed when they get up to pea at night they fall in bang their head that is a devastated consequence totally unacceptable argoal is to see how much we can lower blood pressure with out medication before we turn to medicasion and let us be clear the meds to day are much better than they used to be i get them's a day when the side effects of these medicines were miserable that is that is simply not the case to day i mean ason hibiters angutens in receptra ble ockers an in these things are very well tolerated especially te a or bees im again almost anybody can be on these things but if we could get a person to lose ten pounds and exercise every day we see great effects with zown to stuff rights cone of the low intensity cardio and your recommendation there o n talk about this in the book but were we i've thrown out numbers about a hundr and fifty to hundr ad eighty menths per week you go a bit higher ye go one eighty to two fifty to forty i to see three to four hours a wek ofs own to i'm that is an important piece and sleep is an important piece iso get get the sleep right get the exercise right if you if youre if you are over nourished let us correct that problem and if all of that does not work and by the way that works a lot of the time works most of the time if that does not work then we have got farmer cotheripy there is still a true phenomenon of essential high pretension which is in individuals for him all the fixible stuff has been fixed and they still have high blood pressure we stll have to medicate those folks by the way theres something that i want to mention here that does not get much attention but it is important which is the effect if hig blood pressure on the kidney and also the brain itself we have talked about the brain withfoct about the hart but the kidney does not get enough attenion the the kidney is a remarkable organ and i think if you are really in this game of trying to live longer right if you if you think ay maybe we will live eighty eighty five years but if we can a start doing all these other things and and really optimizing our behaviors that coan be ninety fife will you have to start thinking about the capacity the kidney and once the glamerial or filtration rat falls below a certain level you have to be very careful with how you live your life and unfortunately this is one of those things that is is another sort of mistake that is made and kind of modern medicine which is we do not pay enough attention to how to measure kidney function correctly we rely very heavily on something called 'm creatinen as suppose to looking at another by a markrecalls te staten sea which is far more accurate and we lso tolerate too low of a kidney function for a person's age we look it you do not we might look at someone who is fifty who ise kidney function is at sixty five per cent and say you are totally fine because it is true that at sixty five per cent there is no problem but you are not thinking whele if this person has to live another forty years and this continues to go down they are going to potentially be staring down the barrel of needing dialysis the last five years of their life yot begain you do not want you want to die with compromised kidney function but never from compromised kidney function in fact hazard racue of all cosemortality associated with compromise kidtey function is even greater than that of heart disease once once you cross that threshold i mean lights out once you are neading dialysis i mean you are risk of death is higher than that of some one with high blood pressure smoking even someone who has cancer youhave a higher risk of death having enstate real disease than you do have in cancer the kidney is sensitive to blood pressure this is a tiny organ that on every pump of your heart is getting twenty to twenty five per cent of your blood well just imagine how sensitive and susceptible it is to elevated blood pressur we have covered quite a few corners of avoiding the major killer arthur clarosis im tet's talk about cancer nobody wants cancer everybody seems to know somebody who has had or as died of cancr and hiv we no surprise given that it is number two on the list what are the numbers and what can people do to offset cancer i and of course cant there are huge number different types of cancer im an inside of this conversation i just wanting m you remark that might be good to have a conversation about i'll call i which we did not talk about in the in the last u'm last discussion but if alcohol is involved or is a risk factor rather for a cartyofascular disease or three rofascular disease now would probably be time to to mention it yw this has been looked at in a number of ways im and si if you if you look at sort of top line epidemeology and you you have heard of these things called the french paradox which is a comeon the eat all this fatty stuff and drink all this wine and they have aslightly lower risk of card yofve asko disease youse have to con to throw that stuff out the window cause there is many confounders there that it is kind of useless epidemeology if you really look at the data clearly and the is ectuare really elegant analysis that included some genetic studies that came out an jama about a year ago it is actually pretty clear that there is no dose of ethenal that is healthy cso there is no jacer it used to there used to be kind of this literature that said there is a ja curve associated with ethana meaning at at total abstinence there is a slightly ir risk of death then if you are drinking one drink a day and then if you go beyond one drink a day the wreth the the rate of death starts to climb the problem with that an alc is there just been a lot of consternation around that but the problem of those analysies are multiple but the most important of these are that the abstainers have a reasond for abstaining typically and those reasons cannot be extracted statistically from these analyses i'll leave it at that without imet have written many blog posts about this if people are really interested i they can thn can go and talk about that i also do talk about this a little bit in the book by the way im but the the short answer is there is no dose of eth an all that is helthy i would argue that it is not a straight line of risk but it probably goes i think from zero to one there is probably no measurable harm fom most people one per day or one per week probably one per day up to one per day it is probably very difficult to discern the harm but i man have put a cav yat on that that i'll come back to and then i think the risk starts to clime pretty steeply after that and i think it climes non linearly after that that that is my reading of the literature look et then how do you decide if you areging to have up to one drink a day and betther that is not the same as seven a week because that does not mean seven in a day riht which we know is is really detrimental right for especially for the brain riht but also the cascades that result from i destrrupted sleep not just for that one night memultiple nights yu yet that the literature i've seen on alcall enothat the most now again this is an emerging literature because i'm what you are describings exactly right that people are now some more conservative folks are trying to place it at two drinks per week total beyond which you start running into issues especially for women ind terms of rest cants or risk which as on i may we can te can circle tt have in look at my view is if you can not drink at all you are better off not drinking at all and people always say to met whell peter what is your view on this and my view is i do drink im i'll go weeks at a time without having a drink i have not had a drink i've had one drink since i saw you last couple weeks ago because i've been six or thinking well coshlike the deck is stacked against me rint now why would i do anything to stack in more im but my philosophy which is half tongue in cheek but is is true is i jus do not drink bat alcohol i i sort of my wife saw me do this you to day we opened up a bottle of wine and it was a very expensive bottleof wine and i took a sepin iwas i just dont my glass was just n't taste rites me and it taste it fine to herso i do not think it was that the ine it spoiled it was just i did not the taste of it enough to justify drinking it as lik can not eel i drinkin atgan i've fortune that there ware times in life yes certainly college and portions aregrage t schoolwhen i drank but i've never really enjoyed the ee am taste or experience abalcol i all the a'll call the planket dis appear out when even notice but i'll have one everyones in the while i'm serve of that of that mine set but am great to hear that zero is better than any am cause i think everyone agrees on that a it does not appear that i'lcall can be directly link to cardyovasular disease and srup of ascular disease although well he is indirect iffects or insolen yevs rng in tan sence that if resni antou sli i think i think the the impact of sleep on cardyovascosr torasca disease is profound and i do think that the impact of atheraon sleep is under appreciateid an and here i i think we should i'm doit i a not to mat walker the great mat walker because ten years ago if im some one had a conversation about sleep in how critical it is and hol wel not getting enough quality sleep is dangerous ef people wouldn con to shake their heads and say what is the evidence for that i think mat really deserves am most of the credit for alerting people to these issues around not getting enough sleep it is jhis remarkable what is happened in the last decade thanks to mat and and waber on that topic youknow we have the other next horseman a dat the narrd generof diseases i think those ware also heavily impacted especially on the dimenshaside i by athanal again i wont to be careful when i say this steff right i do not believe in fear mongery rokight ynowi just set a moment gall say it again i i drink alconaman kit nede in calcohol but i think that one has to make the trade offs which is if i really do love the taste of certain spanish wines i really do love the taste of certain to keelas certain mescas really do lovely the taste of certain weird eseteric belgian beers and it really does give me pleasure to consume those things in the same way it gives me pleasure to concerm suicertain foods that are quite vapid right thers no upside in consuming a browny that my kid just made except tor h fat t my kid just made it and it is fun to eat the bak browniy with them right come back to this thing about longevity is also about healhspan and part of healthspan is quality of life and you i write about this in the book that i think there is a day when my approach to this was purely an engineering approach which was we are going to optomize every mollacul of my being for this and if you if yuif you go far down that rabbit hold that the quality of your life deterior rates what is the point that is why i think for somebody you who says you could take all the a'lcolf the face the arthi would not even notice then that is a great reason not to bother drinking i would not put myself at the opposite end of that spectrum but i'm probably further to the spectrum where if you told me i could never drink alcohol again i would be fine with it but i'd be giving something up that i enjoy imbut at the same time i know if i have two drinks with dinner my sleep sucks and therefore that is that is just a threshold i rarely rarely cross i certainly have my vices i'll call just was n ato be one of them what about cancer again nobody wants cancer i we all known people ha died of cancer im or ave had cancer what can be done to reduce one's risk of cancer will you asked earlier about the numbers let us throw some numbers out there right globaly were talking about eleven twelve million deaths per year about half the number of a a s v d still a staggering number im at the individual level put it this way somewhere between one and three and one and for chance anyone listening to this or watching as getning a cancer n their lifetime but what is the probabily they will di from the ha canc tat bout one and six chanc of dying o case is it true that every male gets prostate cancer most in other words i've fromther and that every man will die with prosate cancer and some will die ferm a you and i have prosstat cancer right now thank you for informing h i hopefully we will not die of it we should not die of it prossing ancer colan cancer are cancrs that no one should evfer die from because they are easy to screen for they are easy to treat when they are in their infancy m that it is totally unacceptable that people are dying from this therearother cancers for which i cannot really say that breast cancer much more complicated pancratic cancer much more complicated gleol byst only multiformate much more complicated that is you said a second ago cancer is not a disease it is a category of diseases each it is not just that each organ is different and breast differs from pancreatic it is that within breast cancer e r p re positive or two new positive is a totally different disease from the triple negative breast cancers those with brackamutations or nonbrak commutation well even putting that aside just looking at the the hormon profile of the individual breast cancers they are totally different diseases it is not just that breast cancers different from prostate cancer it is that all breastcancers are quite different maybe i should frame the questionable differently then given the vast number of differnt types of cancers and category l o on telse yo your question is still affair when i dare not to throw that cavey out out there an now t's your question o caser what do we know it turns out that we can very comfortably speak toim several things one is the role that genes play im maybe i'll just spend one second on gen one o one thing for for ther for the viewer we want a differentiate between what are called germ line mutations and sematic immutations im your germ line and my germ line are set when we w ere born our germline mutations any mutations we have in germline genes are inherited from our parents it turn on negosh not igos yon yo you got those things question one is how much of cancer results from those types of genetic mutations and the answer is very little less than five per cent very now you mention one i moment ago braka ocates o mutations in braka aore germ line muations a woman will get a braccimutation from one of her parents and we will often have a cense of that just from the family history when mam and sister and aunt and grandmother had breast cancer you have got a bres cancer gene now it might be braka it might be another gene that is not braka but there is no ambiguity and we test for these genes mostly just for insurance purposes frankly but there is no ambiguity that that was a germ line transmission of a gene that is driving cancer but ninety five plus per cent of ancers are not arising from germline mutations they are arising from sematic mutations or acquired mutations the question then becomes what is driving sematic mutation and the to clearest inditations of drivers of symatic mutation our smoking and obecity smoking we have talked about let us put that aside for a moment i'm surprised about obecity i do not know why i'm surrisebut i've am never heard this unproligeous naive to the literature yo obecity is now the secent most prevalent inviron mental driver of cancer now i will argue and i think i argue this in the book hopefully pretty convincingly i do not think it is obecity persey i think obecity is just a masquerating proxy what is obesi obisity simply is defined by bodymass and ecks well first of all i do not think i'm o beast but i'm i'm way over weight on beami you probably our two let us just it no clenically diagnosible as obes are you o no well not cla well clei clei a he am i over thirty at i's r probably there no but if i if you bi measure my waiht by hi yeam now i be a mice pwroty twenty seven or twenty eight ocant's binlo wallsince i checked i i can i only kno by if at por say i is not thinks that sososo basically beami is a far from perfect proxy but at the population level it is what we use i wish we would get off it by the way i think it is really crap cause it does not take into account lean verses yee noti i if ye culd i think we could get better data if we looked at waste to heiht ratio that is a way better matric this is just a quick test for everybody it is i i i'm to argue your beami is less relivan to me than your i color but if you r waste circumference is more than fifty per cent of your height you should be concr ican well thene moca yet your fied by thathe aftric right that is important of your six feet tall youre waste better be under thirty six inches and if it is over i would argue that is the definition of obecity not you'r be am i being over thirty im back to this issue because we are using such a crude measurement it basically is catching a whole bunch of stuff but the question is what is driving it andi think if you really look at the physiology of cancer i do not think it is obesity i think it is two things that come with obecity insolent resistance which is two thirds to three quarters of obs individuals are insolent resistant an inflammation and i think those two things with the inflammation in the imundisfunction with the insolent resistance and the hiper basically tonic growth stimulus that is coming that is what is driving cancer again is it because a person is storing extra fat and their love handles that that is driving the risk of cancere now that that is those are just two things that are coming along for the right beyond those two things and aalong with certain weat we therealso certain environmental toxsins we absolutely know or doing this right to we understand that people who have exposure to us bestus have a much hire risk of certain types along cancer somethings that but for the most part am those are our big risks beyond that we talk about alcohol in certain cases absolutely a alcohol is a curcinigen a it is the dose part still is not clear to me do not know is one drink a day moving the needle much on cant cer risk persey it is not clear and might depend on those a geanetic predisposition yes yet if step one is do not get cancer you have no control over your genes you have control over smoking you have control over insolent sensitivity i wish i could sit here and tell you that there is a proven anti cancer diet or that if you do eximount of exercise pur we you are going to not get cancr we just do not have a fraction of the control over cancer that we have with cart ov ascular dotese we we do not understand the disease well enough we do not understand kind of the initiation process and the propagation process im and we we we have to rely much more unscreening are there good whole body screens for cancer in other words can i walk into a tube and dumb or cylinder rather and get screened for the presence of tumors any and everywhere in the body outside the bring cause the brans all harder to get toran i believe here not the brain is actually pretty easy to screen for zoa is fatty in floating in water well and also the head when you put the head into an em our iye caner there is no movement h it is the least motion art o fact is in the brain when you use something called diffusion way to imaging with background subtraction in an em or e the tecnology tht was ectuall pioneered in the brain for stroke identification am it is also really good at looking for tumors as well let me make the argument for wy screening matters cause this is again cind of and areaware i go far down a rabbit hoal in a way that i think traditional medicine would argue against my argument for screening is an argument at the individual level and it goes as follows to my knowledge there is not a single example of a cancer that is more effectively treated when the burden of cancer cells in the body as higher than when it is lower hso the two examples ife fantock about on the book are colan cancer and breast cancer when you take an individual with stage four colan cancer that means that the cancer has left the colan and is now outside of the coan it is usually in the liver at a minimum potentiallin the lungs or in the bring that person's five year survival is very low thei'r ten yoar survival is zero we will treat them with a very aggressive regiment of multiple drugs hand again you will get a five year survival of you kdo not maybe ten to twenty per cent and by ten years nobody's alive if you take a person with stage three colan cancer the colan ancer is big and it is even in the limph notes around the coalan but at least grossly you cannot see colan cancer cell you cannot see those cells in the liver microscopically of course we know they are there because if you do not treat those patients they still die of colan caner but you wack them with the same kemo regimen that you were going to give the medastatic patients eighty per cent of those people are alive in five years night and day difference in survival what is the difference in the person with medastatic cancer you are treating a person with hundreds of billions of cells in the agovent setting which is what we we call we call at agivent when you treat people who have only microscopic disease you are you are treating billions of cells the same is true with breast cancers we have the clinical trial dayto to put them side by side rule omer one is do not get cancer ruleim or two is catch cancer as early as possible if you can to get it which brings us to your question of how doyou screen for it we basically screen the first line of screening is is imaging is is is is as it sort of visualization you have cancers that occur outside the body that you can look at directly skin cancer you can look directly at the skin a sapagial gastric colan cancer are those are outside the body right mouth to anis embreologically is outsidethe body you can put a scope in and you can look directly at the cancer but for all other cancers that are inside the body i you have to rely on some sort of imaging modality a although now we are starting to look at things things called liquid biopsy blood tests that are looking for self radiant eh and the selfrediane gives us a sense af base on the epigenetic signature of what you'r looking at hey is there a cancer in the body and if what tissue is potentially coming from based on these epigentic signatures the problem with relying on any one modality is a is a problem of sensitivity in specificity optimization now with m our i scanners which ar in some way's the best way to do this because theydo not have radiation you doft wone to be incurring damage as you do this the irony of doing a whole body s t scan screet for cancer is youre in a whole body se t scan would be close to you o thirty to mit fifty milly severts of radiation staggering some a radation s i mean that people should a siro pell you off this but ai was going to ask about this anyway a avaiting going through the whole body scanner at the arport a noise lo yeyou not goingthrogh a whole body scanner at the airporter even getting a decks o scan i mean these ar trivial amounts of radiation about flying you i heare that lightly i get more a get more yas lil if you are a pilot who is flying over the north pole back and forth and back and forth you are probably getting in o five to ten milly seaverts a year the enner c suggests that nobody should get more than fifty milly severts a year a you an i both travel a fair amount a but typical travel for the busy person to let us ay a two round trip flights a a more than two hours per month and an international trip every three months a probably still less than a milly sever to year a living at sea level one milly severt a year living at a mile elevation if you live in denver you are a two milly severts a year i have to ask standing in front of the michroif i just we have got friends they the they ask and with or without testes on the counter that is an inside yoge that a unfortunately and fortunately deserves no description a and peters not referring to me a but people worry about other sources of radiation does nots i the microay isnit concern a what are the other major sources of radiation a i mean outside of cert af new clear stuff worthings go yo hdly riin near a planter there is been a yet but it it is nobey it is mostly at the hands of medical professionals right it is the s t scanner in the petscanner are hands down the big a sourceor r diation about the axerays of the dentist when they wer very itt scury behind the wall ye under th rathe lanketer they are very low i relatively speaking a fhloroscopy is very high im they tend to try to cover up all of you that frexample if yu if they were doing a fhloroscopic study of your kid me becaue youat a stone or if you were getting an injection into if they were doing aa fhloroscopic guided injection of one of your disks in your nack that would be a locally pretty high dose but there cannot cover the hell out of you elsewhere i and again if ifif y if you get one f the things is not the end of the world but why i would not want to be getting one a month and an back to the point about screening a chest abdomin pelvis c t scan is probably i mean look is probably a scanner out there now that is moving fast enough that it is much lower but i'll give an example member hoi talked about we do c t engeograms on all of our patients for corneryartery disease an off the shelf scanner for this is twenty milly cs of radiation ets o calibrate calebrate me it because forty per cent of your annual aloton oh well the medical a precasers really are the a the major culprits here tat's right what what we say is and i think most doctors are now realizing this is no know it behooves you to pay a little bit more to go to a really good place that can do that scan for two milly severts meaning they have a much faster c t scanner much better soft were and they are better engineer they have better engineering that they can do on the scanner to get that done i if some one listening to this here is my take do not get a c t scan or any imaging study without asking how much radiation mi seeing and if a person cannot tell you how many milly severts of radiation you are being exposed to than just saam ent a wait a minute until somebody can tell me that i i realize tit and keep in mind fifty if you unow if fifty is the most you should ever be exposed to in a year therere better be a damn good reason why im gon to gat twenty five an a day now there are some people who have to do this if you are cancs ar pation and they are scanning you as a part of your treatment i mean you have to pickan choose between those two those two opportunities i do not want o i doft walso do not want to crate some fear mongering witom i got if you hit fifty in a year your hose no it is just i would not want o it fifty a year every year for my whole life and i certainly would not wone to be hitting hundreds a year for any pertime i think you were to tryn to raise awarinus and and also calebrate people to what the sources are and and they make can make good choices not am to place them into his chronic state of fear or even an acute states ove here that reason we prefer m our i scaners cause there is no radiation i realize this might sound a specialized circumstance but i'll just start off i'm with my own which is yen when i was agraduetes do ni im worked with fixit inso power fror allive berfo mal l hi excuse me i'm gludor alli we know that these are mutigens they mutate selves not good a use o malicol balging lav used eana in tercolating by those little bands and jells the reason the labels caf they get between the dean a not good the fort to get into your own a deone a and that is a very specialized circumstance i'll sinjected treatyat radio ac of prowling into the animals and thinks that sort again very specialized and yet most people i think a will be exposed to pastdecides they will pit stuff on their lawn wer they will have u paint thinners and things that sort is there any sense of what the average if one can average risk is incourge in terms of a carsinag ence just through interaction with we would killers a paint thinner deturgence around the house that we know know there is major lossis en a successful against the the manufactures of these things and what is the real cancer risk a created by having those kinds of solvence and besticides and things around i do not i do not think i know truthfully i think it is very complicated to calculates such things when the when theire ubiquity is high am soto one one argument is look its kind of baked in to the baseline prevalence of cancer to day because these things are you biquit us they esbestos a incalifornia for whatever reason it seems that there is in its best us warning on preymuch every building if you look carefully enough except maybe the ones built in the last five years i only i've every work in the building where the elevator was opdated in terms of the inspection was always a ten ers back youit see it wileure in the elevator kno one seems to what worry bout those were where there was not in is bestos warning were a led warning itseems it is just kind of everywhere and and they are noting it in these little flags i do not walk round worried about i onloose sleep over it but it sounds a real rist rels the would not bother right clearly they are just trying to cover their yer mag ega massy why thenthen anything of this point of man i i do not know how much of a risk as bestas poses when it is not being agitated anothe words i do not know that the es bestis in the sealing four layers up is really a problem but if they had to come in here and rip this sealing a part i do not let it want to be in here either i was post nine eleven elow the work er sun aword trade center pits caes that is what was left i'm sadly were a developed cancer rie proudly from exposure in those kinds of well i'mean i would argue its also gen i fuel us just the unbelievable amount of pollution micropolutioner was in the air following those things mat's devastating stuffs yet those ar those are fortunately the outlier events that are that re dramatic but again my my focuss is basic wy look i could hermetically seal myself somewhere in the world maybe and maybe that would reduce my risk by one per cent but i'm in a focass my energy on what i control as that is really hard for me to control i focusing my things on wlike focs om energeonthings i can control what i can control is the atiming and frequency of my screening that is i cannot control my genes any more a theyare what they are i got whatever predisposing cancergenes i'm ging to gath a i might be lucky in this regard and that i seem to get all these horrible heart disease genes and may be not as much but it you calso argue i got there are cancerbadgenes in me that we do not really know about because everybody was dying of heart disease young im but boy am i ging to control the screening thing what source of genetic screening to you recommend to your patience cause ther're a lot of them there is you ht wenty three on eithers holdgen o seqren seem place youn available now in nvariety of format were this is ectually one of the questions our research teem is working on as we speak im were we are trying to decide who we do genetic screening for certain things apo e s a gene we want o know in everybody im for it is role in nurge gener dos e strect aspecifically in all simers disease awe are selectively using cancear screening in some patience but in our practice it is less important because we are generally aggressive anyway that it turns out to be a little bit moot we do not learn a lot in the genetic screening that is changing our screening practices becauses we are thorough in our family history and we are aggressive in everybody regardless of family history but i think there is a place for these things for example if you are looking for reemburasement on certain tests a give an example right colan cancer am historically was not covered by acoonoskype screen for con cancer was not coverdant oe you'r fifty that is been bump to forty five we still think everybody should be screened no later than forty iaven't had ones i suposession yet i mean luck i'm fifty and i've had three already again why because colan cancer is not just the third leading cause of cancor dath it is a hundred per cent preventable why because every colan cancer comes from a polop and every polop can be seen on a colonoskopy there is simply no reason do not know that and that has to be weighed against the cost of the coonoskopy both the financial cost and the risks which er very low but not zero a other's a risk that comes from electrolite abnormalidies and hypotension from the balprap there is a risk from the sedation and there is olviously a risk of bleeding or perforation that comes from the colonoskopy itself again in in a in a generally healthy person those risks are low that they are almost difficult to quantify i's evidence by a resen doing the journal medicine paper that was a very anticoal in oscopy paper which i will not get indocause it is it is it is am probbly a little bit of a tanc ont but what is interesting is despite being a very anticolonoskopy paper this paper does a better job demonstrating the safety of colonoskopy than anything else it just was a oddly designed experiment the biggest challenge with aggressive screening posture is the specificity problem which is when you stack more and more modoloties around these things you are gong to start finding things that are cancer m ar i has a very high sensitivity an english that just means if a cancer is present and m our e is very likely to see it a but has a very low specificity which means in english it will see a bunch of things and think they are cancer when they are not and it is most troubled by glangeler tissue glangeler tissue is the akhilles heel of m ar i and therefore when you use as we do whole body m ar i for cancer screening we tell our patients going in sook a twenty five per cent chancewer on to find something that is not cancer but will require us to do further investigation if youare not cool with that which is totally find we proby should not do this and again most people are okey with that but it helps to set that expectation going in that you are gong to probably be chasing your tal looking at some stupid fironodul that is absolutely nothing may i cannot tell you how many useless thiroy nodls we have had to get altrasounds on that prove to be absolute nothing and you but gift to follow them for couple of years to make sure ther nothing what is the typical cost of the whole body m ar i and for people who are not your patients how would they go about getting those because i think most people's general practitioneris not going to script thet out for them correct i do not know the short ancer because i do not know how many different places are doing it i can tell you that we use a couple of different facilities and i should disclose that i'm a founder of one of them but we use a scanner that probably we send our patiens to any anywhere they want to go but within a certain company that we am that is not a company i have an affiliation with and i'm believe they are charging about twenty five hundred dollars can you since you do not have an affiliation can you mention that cause frence its you are not my physician sadly for me and luckily for you u but i'd love to get a whole body m ar i what were can i what is this company that that company that that makes the m ar i that that we are using right now is called prenuvo i i interviewed the chief technolegy officer in the head radiologist a of that company on one of my podcasts to superinteresting technologe based out of vancouver and for a long time that was the only scanner in the world i had my first s can back in two thousand fifteen i went up to vancouver to get it done a probehad my first too up there tey've now open locations alliver the country they have got they have got one in the bariar they have probably got one here an alle imi know they have one endawas they hive got them ll of the place great im and then the company that i'm affiliated with is a different typeoc company that does all sorts of diagnostics but among them is we have a prenuvo scanter in that compary that company's called biograph in thats in the bear biograph phiography spelled as one ontas a bact yet now that is very helpful in terms of understanding the a general risk and i'm wase to offset cancer to the xtent that one can i and certainly what that what the consideration should be number three on the list of was to die shoe just title this waste to die whar we shoutitle that is how not to die a too early nourige generof disease this is an ariim i'm somewhat familiar with a not because of my own experience thankfully but i because of my relationship to the naurow science community and last time i chacked i the was told that every one experiences some age related cognent have decline we all get less a proficient hat focis memory complex context dependent task twiching all that stuff as we get older but it is th slope of that line that really can be controlled to some extent and that alheimers dimentia represents just a steep acceleration downward a acceleration of of all that that was a what i was told i'm guessing that even thugh i i've reside in th not kind of but i'm residing that community that some of that is being revised especially with respect to the underlying causes of alsimers caus ers a lot of controverse even scandal around this whole a p p a bo b am ameloid plak tangle stuff which is the stuff of tax books a medical students and nauro science tudets what is the story with naurg gener disease allhimers in particular how can we offset it and perhaps as importantly how can we all slow our own cognive decline irrespective of whether or not we get what is called alsimers timensio allhimers disease is both the most prevalent form of dimensia and the most prevalent nauro degenetive disease it occupies that unique spot a we are talking about roughly six million people in the united states have all simers disease that is one an a let us the i mean shl should per sent of the totalp pulation but that does not include those with mild cognitive empairment or pre dimensia or other forms of dimensia and of course the right metric is not what persent a a population which of course includes children in ik that it is thee function of age ysis age the major risk factor for handan alsimers ale res taywi glacoma the dizease ae much more familiar with his malam worked on it for many years the biggest rist factor or getting lalcoma is age the greatest ristfactor for are youvascular disease is age the grest respect for cancer is age am we tend to not spend a lot of time talking about that because it is not a modifiable risk we tendefolk is on modifiable risk factors what else can we tell you just to give you kind of lay of the land the second most preval and neuradegenerive disease would probable louis body dimensia followed by parkinson's disease although the rate of growth of parkinson's disease is the highest i thinkthing we proyou be most you ow we those three diseases we want ta really be paying a lot of attention to as there a lot of other narratygenet ive diseases every one of these things is devastating muncls at hultlescorosis a aalas huntington disease ese are awful awful diseases there are also other kinds of dimensia vascular dimensia is not all simers dimensa but it is it produces comparable symptoms each of these things by the very slightly different louis body is a dimension it is a dementing disease but it also has a movement component it sort of sits on a spectrum that is sort of you mean loosely half way between all simers disease and parkinson's disease we talked obviously about age being the number one risk factor cind of not that interesting cause cannot do anything about it the real goal is as we age what are we doing to reduce risk well let us start with an important gene the gene that everybody's heard of certainly a came up a lot on the limitless special where chris hamsworth was am you ave made the decision to reveal something that none of us expected when we started that whole series which was that he and hit a being homas igus for the apo e for ice of form am maybe folks understand we have two copies of every gene for gene x you have copy that you got from your moman copy that you got from your dad and the apo e gene is cut of a unique gene and that at really it has three different ice o forms that are all considered normal none of them are mutations you have the e two ice of form the e three ice of form and the e for ice of form the e four ice of form is the o g ice of form that is the one that we have historically had is as far back as we can go whic you think the e four ice of form offered a lot of advantages back in ta day it is a bit of a pro inflammatory am ice oform and at certainly offered protection against infections especially parasitic infections in the ci ans which would have been a really important thing to select four two hundred thousand years ago parasites get into the cans mea blood brain bury a thick skull i man no croma im not calling im not sea yeli the skill but tay weming it just seems parasites in other tissues o be a issue len cause about retied by hear brain disease ye an we we l i i also tt alsbut it also tht to predected the it probably offered some protection outside of the brain as well anyway the the e three ice aform i think showed up i think fifty thousand years ago and the e two ice aforms showed up very recently about ten thousand years ago now to day we realize that there is a clear stratification of risk when it comes to all simers disease that tracks with those ice aforms because you have two copies you basely have six combinations of how you can combine those genes you cou be two two two three two fou or three three three four four four am the prevalence of them is basically as follows three threes now the most common three is the most common double three is fifty five ish per cent of the population the next most common is the three four which about twenty five percend of the population and then after that most things are cund of a rounding air a two threes and two fours i would be the net most common four fours are very rare and two twos are the rarest of them all two twos are less than one per cent four fours are about one to two per cent very important point here is that the e four genes are not deterministic there highly associated wit the risk wbit her not tde terministic there are at least three deterministic genes in all simers disease a one is e alled p c and one other ones caled p c an two and anothr most called a p p those genes collectively make up about one per cent of cases of people with all simers disease there fortunately very rare genes but sadly they are deterministic meaning if you have those genes you do get all simers disease and what is perhaps most devastating about those enes is how early the onset is of the disease these are people that are usually geting all simers disease in their fifties am we do of a patient in our practice actua she spoken about this very openly am whose whose mom had one of these genes am and she got all simers disease in her early fifties was i i think she might have made it into her sixties before she died but you nov absoluty devastating consequences here why do people ot all simers di because i know about the hippocampel degeneratio n hipicampus of course being airy a the brain import for learning in memory a but is theire brainstemdygeneration do they lose breathing center is or carty bout oh ukno usually what happens is it sort of failure to thrive aspiration things that a it is usually they just stop eating a or they cannot control secretions they aspirate the get aneumonia or they really lose the ability to even sense pain in their body and therefore thou get an ulter and they do not realize it and it 'll become soluletic and ell develop a horrible infection and response to it i see saids a body vonability the resass is ever once while a news report will come out and based on a legitimate am case study where im they will do a scan on some person and discover that their missing literlly half their sorebral quartax huge shunks of brain and their functioning relatively normally and heare wore titing about a nurge ger disease of relatively it is widespread but theire few hotspots ocors in the bain thet degenerate more a profoundly than others and and the people dying that may sets it it extends to lack of preferal wareines or control and then some some acute injeryor indaction im you mentioned earlier some of the controversy right what what would we talking about here well it it it is than nig i do write about this it it at length in the chapter on all simers disease because i think this is a very important point right which is the index case for all simers disease here is always an index case right others it the init is the the quotine quotation zero im the index case was a woman who a hundred years later we realized had an a p p mutation i w these are a p p r p s and one but she had one of these deterministic genes that led to a very early onset of disease which by the way without which we may not have come up with the diagnosis because had she just got all simers disease in her seventies it would have just been referred to a sinility which is was not interesting enough to pay attention to im but i think it probably set the field on the path towards an over emphasis on ameloid bata im and it is not really clear how important ameloid is which is not to say it is not important it is important and there is no ambiguity that ameloid is responsible for the a the changes that we see in the brain but it is not crystel clear because there are lots of but autopsies that are done on people that are completely healthy and have died with no cognitive empairment and their chalk ful of ameloid what we do not fully understand is the exactly what does removing ameloid du am the other thing that complicates the story is there has been no shortage of drugs that target ameloid that have seemed unsuccessful and i ji s to clarify when you say ameloid you mean people have died with their brains examine in atopsy and see that their tons of called ameloid placks correct im different then a arterial placks of course but within the brains of that the two hall marks of alsimers a histopathologically would be placs and tangles i and at even that now is course coming under undercuestion im but for it is what we teach every nor sience se graguets soon it iswhat we teach every hundergratuates also what we each every medical student im and notjust tat stamfor everywhere a i have heard that that the link between a p p and whether not one develops i genes for erly da p p and whether not's cleaved at one side or another is us what you were describing and and risk for elsime yes it ispace sinply a quesi in it is a clevice question r ans o a p p people with the p p mutation i think i've one extraclevitge siht im that the the the they result in one extra clevage of ameloid and then it misfolds and the misfolding is is what the plac as it is being created that also been predisposes them to the narrow februlary tangles and im againd wet all his is under question right well im min this is what i was told and and when i look it sounds there were some early there ere some papers early in the chain of discovery im an the researction allsimers that im were either wrong because there were falsify intentional your ele there is on intentionally falsified paper on one particular ameloid i variant and that clearly set the field back a decade because a lot o people went down that rabbit hole based on deliberally falsified data i an what happene that gioms onoas who mis to gui but what wohatd happene that ga yas a good question im i think i wrote one piece about it when it happened i actually reached out to the person who broke the storicaus i wanted to have them on my podcast and i forget why he did not do it i forget why he he would not commit to it or something that tat thate is a little odd caus i but this would be a great way to talk about this im i do not know what came of that scandal another wards i i have not paid attention to it for probbing nine months i do not know you norea the papers probably been recalled but i do not know what disciplinary action was taken m the field is i dont know i dont wat to speak i'm in the field because i'm not i do not only be careful what i say but ii think the field is probably an in a bit of a crisis because there is therehav been many bats placed on anti ameloid therapies and ameloid bomarkers and ameloid everything and we just have not seen efficacy right contrast tht with cardiovascular disease where you now you have this apo b biomarker you you understand the path of physiology of how it works you have drugs that t harget it you have a biomarker you give somebody a drug that lowers apo b you can measure po b that is a really important and obvious thing to be able to do and then you have clenical outcomes which is oh hen you take a bunch of people in primary prevention it takes this long before you see an effect in secondary prevention it only takes this long to see an effect right different risk stratifications all these of things wedo not have any of that for all timer's disease we do use there are now syrum ameloid biomarkers that we use and we do tract these in our highest risk patiencs but only because we believe d i do not know for right by the way that lower is better and therefore if we make these changes to you and your syrum ameloid levels come down that that tells us something about what is happening your brain that is favorable but i mean i would hate to represent that we are practicing nearly the level of precision medicine there that we are in cardyovascular medi inewhen it comes to all simers disease maybe take ustep back when it comes to brain health i think they are a handful of things that seem unequivocally true and there is a lot of stuff that is signal to noise racio that is really low be unequivocally true things for brain health are sleep matters another unequivocally true thing for brain health is that lower el deel colesteral and apo b is better than hire another thing that is unequivocally true is not having type to diobedees matters havhing really being ins tat by my insolen sensin notolen e sensitive matters sleeping adequately matters having lower lipids maters those three things are clear and the fourth one that is unequivocally calear is exercise matters more exyisic form of exercise a very i iht to trie to answer this question on a recent a m a that i did cause the answer is more is always better but if you if i i tried to have one of our analysts look at it through the lends of if you could only exercise three hours a week what would be the highest use case and our interpretation the literature as if you could only spend three hours a week exercising you would be best off doing one hour of low intensity cardio one hour of strength and one hour of interval training some one said i only want the minrum effective dose you areging to get a pretty good bang for your buck doing that but i would argue if youre brain really matters to you do more one hour of interval trainings no joke no cause you are in a spread that out over probaly at least two workouts wi'm but ander those four things are basically the only thing where there is there is no ambiguity about the benefit what a not head hits do not get do not hate your head seems almost assuredl y true ina susceptible individual for sure i put that ymaymaybe we could include that as well why just mengionit one ofthe things i've been learning recently as i know you box i for a number of years when you were the younger i aboxed a little bit him i had number of times gayboarding but you knw we think about sport injuries es the major cause of had injuries but then i've got colleas oft rs an taer orm car accent by byke acciden i've got many colleas and children of colleas growing up in around campas that were hit by cars on woud side road or a mere small objects surrounded by you three was a car way three thousand pounds or something that more it' it is unbelievable that the number of head injures and then construction sides tos those ridiculous little hard haxs which do not protect against anything except inno maybe u winblown hair that they they basically predispose the whole situation predisposed people to had injuries very common on construction sitson and say nothing of military et cetera i think that i was told that the the best thing to do if you get a head injury is to nock it another one in other words if you can stop doing the activity that leads to more head injury ye had the other thing that i think is emerging and i hope it is studied rigorously is the use of hyperobaric oxygen immediately following aa tebia madramatic ber n injury reshouht to dom dagustine a a little while ago to count of cause he knows a lot about this lit to say is there anything out there that is really can a turn key convincing any said not yet they are still doing it right i would do this if i if i was in a car acident to morrow and sustained a concussion and by the ay i'm not a proponent of hyperbaric oxygen i we have an internal white paper that we wrote inside quite recently where i examined when i say i examined you do not be annalist teem examined and i pushed back and reviewed and i i came away very can of barish on hyperobaric oxygen i do not think i'm nothing it is harmful but i think all of the claims are nonsense tealammour extension is totally irrelevant thef you ectually look at the studies there the worst done studies of ever seen in my life i'm sure you have seen some of these words you put these people on hyberbery chamber and then watch them do cognetive tasks act after in theire much better well the fine print is that n't you have placebo groups here i can you imagine doing a study without a placebo group or your placebo group does not go into a sham chamber i mean one of the big cams of a the priliferation of all these pay to play journals mean jirls it will basely publish a paper wit minimalor poor pure oview because they charge in order to publish and then a offer free access yo everee acces sounds great but when it is payd to playtipe drinls the there is been a huge priliferation of papers most which you find on twitter in which the study design is is beyond tat they get lok at ninth grater who woke up late for school and was parting all we can co design a better study then most of these studies yatand there is some excellent studies out there as well of course ave presumely o and eventually on hyperbar chamber to shall not pick oun hyperbar chamber per say but the the preliveration of a truly terrible science that is published in purerevew journals is is just overwhelming i it is in sayng and all that is to say i think the replaceis where hyperbaric oxygen make sense clearly in wound healing it does it is it is a miracle a treatment for wound healing and i would absolutely you use hyperbaric oxygen if i suffered a concussion a but you do not beyond that ithing its pretty prettytough to make the case where do people go for that eming that it there clenex yateround ex you basically go to and protocalls have to be very precise rome your it is not something to cowboy at home no no no inoo youu have to go into a real chamber im i think the t b i proto call tit is most commonly used is god i want to say it is pretty intense it is five sixty menute sessions a week at two atmosphereis oon it is not it is no joka from a cost and time perspective it is enormous and in the time and cost are reasons why i think when i see people doing hyperbaric oxygen just because they think it can help them live longer a'm do what you could do with five hours a week pluss the commuting time that you put into that it is put that into exercise and i promise you you will get a bigger benefit than you are etting out of hyperbaric oxon but there is a lot of other stuff that i just think is maybe helpful there is tons of supplements that i think about when it comes to brain health what about thericuman what about magnesium with lthree and eight the transporter am what about methylated by vitamens that lower home issistin what about e p an d h and we have gone through all the literature on that stuff and many these things we still are recommending through a kund of basically the potential benefits out weigh the potential costs but the evidence is really unimpressive for most of those other interventions when you think about the big four or big five if you include not getting head injury everything else is probably a rounding air compared to those big ones maybe just for sake of of theroun ess we just list off those four again exercise exercise sleep insolent sensitivity a and lipid management well long lines of head injuries we shrige me to the next category of u ahow not to die as to avoid accidental death a how common is accidental death and what are these accidental death because we are separating this out from automotive death this people falling well liking self selfe's gone bad no what are we talking about here i'm not chuckling because tha is just oning that seems egular is an un your infinite a wastit ways to a to die accidentally a n when usei ther two is a kind of look at this i in in here i kind of merge to categories i would call it there there that overlap in the way that they are characterized by the c d se but i would sort of what w wll will talk about them separately and bring them together if you talk about true accidental deaths automotive a and falls and overdose is are the are the three that is pasically what it comes down to in our death bar analysis we kind of list all this if fiut in fect i think that is actually one of the figures in the book is i have the accidental death a figure that we have put together where we have adjusted by population and you will see a couple of things if you look at it in absolute terms it is basically a pretty constant regardless of what decade of life here and once you are above twenty accidental deths are pretty sizible number of of daths now car accidents seem to be pretty conctenthroughout life little more common if you are under sixty than over sixty but they never go away i was told that in teen age in uazin in a was not there in the early twenties alcoholl in dspate a automoti fatalities place them it it in is nastronomic risk is that just not true it is not true any more compared to overdose at bec as young people now are not getting their drivers licenses on alsoyeh well i think it is also because we are seeing such an uptick in the deaths that come from fatinal gott phetinal related deaths have basically squashed all other deaths below sixty five on the accidental front really it it it is not even close because of the number of different substances that fentin al is being lonv ininding its way in to everything a all counterfeit drugs all e lisset drugs and look most of the time you are not getting a lethal dose it is it is it is but but you are getting lethal doseis often now that well ou i did a little analysis actually the other day when i'd look dath how are deaths of despair increasing over the last five years what dad i define as a death of despair suicide alcohol related death or overdose accidental overdose that we different shit that from suicide were suicide is obviously deliberate and accidental is not if you just look at those three things accidental overdosis suicides and alcohol use or alcol related death not including driving by the way this is serosis of the liver that comes from that number is going up at almost twenty per cent per year since twenty nineteen the i could not get twenty twenty two numbers yet with the time of the time i did this analysis which is last week the t wenty twenty one numbers was about two hundred ten thousand americans goodness up from a hundreden eighty thousand in twenty twenty up from a hundred and fifty thousand twenty nineteen is this and that is driven almost entirely by fentinal use i'm trying get a sense of howlis would happen at while back there was an article in the ner times that some photographs of people that im on died of fentinal overdose they and said they they went out to buy coqane an badeand and i thought to myself is there really count of odd socio of biological phenomenoon wright because i mean here they are they are not deminizing these coqane user i mean they went out to buy coqane ratus is not i know coqane has at one narrow clentical use as a prescription drug but in general on feel by coqne there they are going al parting with it ayre using it to work longer hours or something that am the whole nature of the article was a bit strange to me but it clearly pointo the fact that people are using coqne i ket that is no surprise but people are going out buying coqane they are presumely buying vallyum they'r presuming buyn this is where it is really killing kids i mean that it is on line this is he averison im ma the reason i'm not o baffled by this is let lemme a contextalize at what would have would have said far about this question i was surprised that the times would write a paper about the tragedy of coqane users dying of fentinal and i think they did it to highlight this fentinal problem am because people been using couane for a long time an tipically those are not that members of the population that were really focas on since the middaties the call kick coqane and crackin o pedamic basically tells me that people you said elicit drugs of cokane but also what other sorts ano ot a l bin tan majority of people are dying from fentinal poisoning and i had to got on my podcast recently in anthony hippolido and if anybody's interested in this topic they really need to go listen to that h noch that the outo rear this and your podcas ar are excellence o people if you are interest in this i think everyone should be interested in if yif you havn is cild or know somebody who has a child you just got to get this podcast into their hands because it is the most important public service announcement i'll probably ever do in terms of saving more lives potentially we are the majority of this is making its way into the into the axcidental poisonings is through illicit counterfeit pills it is when kids are out there buying oxy they want oxy wut they cannot o te cannot get real oxy right cause the'n i can to go a doctor and get real oxy segan buy a through snap chat or they can a buy it through some drug dealers that ther finding on social media im they are buying sleeping pills they are buying all sorts of counterfeit stuff at er all ir any of these things are being ace with fetinel ateral absolutely well i isume fentan an again the reasons are it is insanely cheap to use synthetic fetinel and secondly and again but the effects of fentinal or nothing i now i a atter al it cokine a does not make sense for that re ingas it make sense either and yet it is still showing up in coqane again i i do not think that is the dominant place it is showing up i would i would guess that the dominant place it is showing up is in counter fit opioids any opioid barbit you at any sadida e present only tellyou what i'm telling my daughter right cause this to me ts a front line prom i a fourteen year l daughter i'm listen i do not care which friend o ours it is i do not care how much she is amazing if she tells you to try this sleeping pill because she took it the night before and it was really helpful or this ill hep you study better or this will help you do anything i'm just come to us we got a better pill for you right another wt i you cannot trust anything cause you doft know where she got it she has the best of intentions i'm sure when she is given it you and by the way she probly took ut the night before and was just fine but the people who are making these pills are not exactly up to gm pe standards you just have no idea which pill is getting what dose of fetinel one thing that anthony hipoleto told me that i simply could not believe i had to ask him six times was that some of these pills have one miligram of fentinel in them now i made the point on the podcast that a hundred miligrams of fetinel for most people is a hit they i've had fentinel before been in the hospital and the and i've had fetnel a hundred miligrams is while that is such a trip i why are people dying from one meligram intlace prespirtory in ebition you cannot breathe that shut's the brain stemof we i do not think we can higlite this enough im adultzor dyine kids or dying ad that is one is a earlier the sweet who told me her thirty five year old sundine of a eccedental fentinel overdeson im he was not at least by her description a druganict or anything in that sort of y this is this is were token about a different game now right it is these are kids that have anxiety these are kids that are r or our sort of addressing another issue with these with these pills and that is what i think this this whole concept of deaths of despairs is is is a really important one but back to your question what it would o accidental deaths primarily amount to for for the aging population again it is clear that it is fall related this is where im once you hit sixty sixty five the the risk of a fall that results either immediately in death you hit your head and die going back too srebral hemerage or it is the straw that basically leads you down the path to death with the next twelve months is astonishingly high it is high that it is sort of hard to wrap your head around but if you are oversix xty five and you fall and break youre feemer or hip you yeither crack the phemeral neck or the femer itself youre twelve month mortality the probability you will be dead in twelve months after that break if you are sixty five or older depending on the study is about fifteen to thirty per cent well well in terms of offsetting the probability of falls i'm you talked a little bit about this im before but a a you and i have talked a lotbit about this before but tand we could go a lobit deeper people's ability to jump and land seems to be highly correlated with one's ability to not fall or at least fall and control the fall in a way that a leads to no or less se yere intry yes andy gallopand talked about this on your pat hast y talked about it on my pod cast what is the hall mark of aging on the muscle it is atrophy of the type two muscle fibere that is the halmark that is twitch fast which muscle fiber if you want understand what looks different in fifty year old peter verseis eighteen year old peter it is not my type one fibers it is my type to fibrs it is my fast which fibrs is my explosive fibrs me when i was eighteen years old i coul vertical jump over thirty inches to day i'm lucky if i can vertical jump twenty four inches and in what i'm sixty why it is my goal is co be old a vertical jump sixty a twenty inches when i'm sixty and i do not a fonyale to do it i've seen some vidiosos om a eighty year old sprinters that are pretty impressive and certainly eight year old gimness thettare impressive i've not seen very many vidios a eight year olds a dunking basketmalls oneye it was not woe who are not a taller than six t five inches i'm when we lose are soso again if you just think about size strength speed we lose speed first we lose speed then strength and the last thing you loses size again size is agnostic to fibere right you you have big type one fibers and still have lots of size han i can to be that strong and there certainly not can o be fast what imet co you go through we could spend hours on this particular topic but i think the most important thing the people they do understand is you cannot age well if you are not doing the type of training that is there two strengthen and delay or minimize the hypertripheve our type two fibres everything matters right you have to be doing yoars own to you have to be doing all these other things but some component of your training needs to be stressing the type to fibers you have to be doing strength training that tackes those fibrs you have to be doing reactivity training you have to be doing explosive training an idealy some training that involves jumping and landing well jumping is a very big part of it and landing is a very big part of a nother one of what i cone o think of as my four pillars of strength training one of the pillars of strength raining is ecentric strength which is breaks am you are going to hurt yourself ten times more likely im making that number up by the way i do not nof it is ten times but experientially it seems to be you are ten times more likely to hurt yourself stepping off something than stepping on to something right stepping down vers is stepping up am because when you step up onto something you are concentrically controlling muscle when you step down you have to apply the breaks and that is where most people faulter much harder to walk down hill than up hill up hill is taxing your cardyo mascular system but if you slow down enough youre fine but a lot of people do not have the ability to slow themselves down when they are walking down hill and when an older person steps off a curb and cannot fully stop themselves and that results in a fault i doing things a broad jump broad jumps o fun little tests sat i to do every once in a while i was one to make stur ike an broad jump six feet that is cone of my arbitrary number that i've chosen and the reason is on the take off that is a very explosive movement but the landing is just as important if i cannot stick that landing it means it on't of the braks those are kind of some of the tests iwnt 'm able to o do to make sure that i'm i'm utilizing that system because i do think look i've watch i've watche my mom my mum fell ive been about four months ago just fell in a typical way that people fall a by the way it could have happened anybody it is not nmy mam walks round moves round just find but andthis particular day sho just tripped on a on a uneven stone and fell and landed and broke her hand an shu really lucky should not break our hip when i told er that noas you w roing armid seventies and i said luck if that was your femer i i'd give you a thirty per cent chance of dying in the next year iman it is just an unthos are such difficult to recover from injuries because first all your dealing with the immobility o the hospitalization and immobility that follows that and the amount of muscle loss that occurs a could easily be four five pounds of lean tissue lost that for most people that age becomes almost impossible to get back thatton says nothing about sort of the acute causes of death a fat embalism that results from a broken femer a blood clot from laying in bed those things are also catestrophic but what happens is a lot ofthese patients just never get back to the same level of mobility and now i think in many ways were con a pivoting from what kills you to what ruins your quality of life and we'e spend much time talking about what kills you but i think you might as well be dead in some ways if you cannot do the things you want to do and if playing with your grand kids or gardening or playing golf or going for a walk with your spouse or think of any of the things we all do today and take for granted if you cannot do those things i know you sort of lose the the reason to to be round and oftentimes a the inability to do those things is associate with pain thayou know which is a psychologically n ovysy physiologically distressing am you mention the four pillars of health tey be just alist those off for of lifting a thoug well the four pillars of of long havity through physicle a at oh yes si sithe exercise pieces of them yo yess o strength stability a robic efficiency and a arobic peak output it is a robic peak would bes ivo to hanmacs not in is own to that is in my analogy that is the your yours own too is the is how wide the base of your pyramid is and your view o two maxas how tall the peak of the pyramid is the best pyramid has a wide base and a high peak you could have a reasonably wide base and a shallow peak if you just its own two training you are you are now you are going to get a reasonable peak but its not ongto be tha high you have to do some of that specific training if you just focus on high intensity you might drive up that view tomax but your ect you can have a relatively wy a narrow erobic base you think about just maximizing the area of that triangle widest tallest stability and strength tability of course incompasses everything we are talking about in terms of reactivity am i i dendicate a chapter in the book to this concept because it is foreign to most people am and i then for understand wil reasons it is just it is not sexy it is not it is the hardest one to train it is the hardest one to understand but it is important because it is the thing that i think differentiates people who age well and and people who do not age well and i should m perhaps throw in there please crit me fom rum but also most of the machines that are in typical commercial jims thet allow people who are not a ver experience to star oing some resistance training do not really tap into the stability factor terribly much wele there is value to lege extensions and leke curls and jest presses and shoulder presses done with machines certainly a for a number reasons and can often be save for the freeways especialy for people are approaching in a leader time or knew the whole thing they do not really lend themselves to a real life stability walking down as you mention walking downstairs a th in the absence of a hand rail or am or movements in am a kind of a odd plains having to step aside to avoid a bicycle am at an angle as a post togous moving linearly a yet and by the way a lot of things that do not involve a machines still do not give you that right i mean doing a dead lift you have to be stable to lift a heavy weight a you would a dead left without hurting yourself that requires in unbelievable capacity to harness interobdominal pressure and to be connected it is but you you are going to lift five hundred pounds off the ground your stable but that still does not prepare you for what you just described stability is multy facited and it involves doing a lot of things you today for example ive finished my that it was a a cartiofs on two day did my cardiofs own to and i you knowhawd i extor ten minutes before i needed to can i get moving and all i did was step ups for ten minutes i just did single leg very slow step up and insanely sslow step downs off a box in a gem two second up four second down two second up for second down with andi would do them with ipsolateral loads contralateral loads all sorts of different things and basically that is just as stability game for me it is i'm building that concentric strangh ind i'm in a movement where it is easy to cheat im but can i do it without cheating this terrific and its terrific that you cover all that in the book addition to these other topics several times during our conversation to day you lluded to quality of life and one of my favorite segments in your book indeed the segment in your book that i believe could be it is own entire book of tremendous value is the section on emotional health you coun just share with us a bit of what inspired you to include that section was this of for instance im based on communication with your patience to what exstend o was based on your on life experience and then im tif we can drill i bit deeper into what is contained in those chapters and what really constitutes emotional health well may i think that that chapter of the book which is preelong chapter it is a final chapter as well im is certainly different from all of the others ind that there is no there is no confusion about expertiese right i think in the other chapters i at least try to come across as having some knowledge on the subject matter and i'm i'm writing them most often as you conqote the doctor right wers i think that last chapter it is as much more about and experiential side of my knowledge acquisition and and if for really it comes a cross more as a patien im and i think you are right i think that that is a chapter that initially was resisted by all other parties involved in the book my coauthor im my editor everybody else sort of felt this is interesting but it is a it is a separate topic if you want to writeabout this you should write another book about it but it does not really belong in this book im i disagreed for two reasons and altimately i guess my opinion prevailed a the first is i did not want o wite another book it just that not including this in this book to then wite about of another book was not something i was interested in doing but i think more importantly i do think that this book is about much more than how long you live and while we have talked about and we will talk about in the book that is how cognitive and physical health are just as germain to quality of life as they are to length of life this other piece of emotional health you knon't it is petentally the most important of them all it is also the hardest tha define but without it none of this other stuff matters right there is infinite life span if if if if youre miserable means nothing ay the worse itit is thit would be a curse right you could argue how could you punish somebody the most allow them to live for ever and be miserable s therea the other's a greet god tithonus now to thonus owhe was granted immortality ahit is a bit different he was granted immortality but without e healthspan basically he aged for ever dreadful and this would be dreadful to right and i i feel why did i need to wite about this well i think that this is probably my greatest struggle i think a you kn a way at the outside of the podguest you asked me kind of what are the obstacles to longgevity and that got us down a path of some very a black and white things but when i look at a patient i create a dashboard and the dashboard is what are all the things that are a threat to every component of your longgevity both lifespan and healthsman we talked abut a much othose thing how what is what is your risk for athorist crosis and what are we doing about it what is your risk for cancer what are we doing about it what is your risk for narr degeneration what are e doing about it what is your risk for accidental death what are we doing about it what is your risk for physical decline what are we doing about it and one of the thngs is what is your risk of emotional health or poor emotional health and what are we doing about it im when i do that exercise for me which i've i do m i i can i have that spread sheet laid out for me and i know where my factors lyine up and interestingly despite my family history being horrible for athoroscarosis it is sixth on my list because i mean basically i intervened early i have a clear understanding of the path of physiology and i'm doing everything to the maximum i'm actually very confident i will die with and not from athoroscarosis but the top thing on my list is actually emotional health that is the one that is the hardest for me to manage and it is it is the easiest to get out of balance and it creates the most pain in my life that is that is a long answer to why i felt this needed to be in here wt in the book you go into very honest detail about some of your journeys thrug and challenges with emotional health and has to overcoming thos may we will get into those a bit but before we do how should we define emotional health im this to me seems one of the most difficult areas to calibrate oneself im even just measuring emotion as tricke a languages the disection tool for im psychologist psychiatrice and indeed for all of us in a howry doing to day great or a miserable or i'm depressed i mean means such different things to different people obviously suicide being the far end of of a we presume misery there are instances of manic suicide but im depressive misery but at setting that aside ahow should we valuate think about and communicate emotional health to ourselves and to to the relevant people they coun ppetentially help us youave you right it is it is it is it is it is it is very difficult right and and much of what goes into this book is about things that are much easier to quantify it is very n i could sit here an talk for days about all the ways we quantify from the histologic to the gross of each of these diseases genetically all these other things im with emotional health it is it is far more vague and i do not i even attempt to come up with a definition right i can tell you things that make up components of it conectivity with others just seems to be an inescapable part of this the ability to maintain healthy relationships and attachments to other people having by ther tese are no particular were having a sense of purpose a being able to regulate your emotions experiencing fulfillment experiencing satisfaction im all of these things matter and i think that for many of us if we are taking and honest a prasal of ourselves we will notice that we have deficits in these areas im being present by the way that is something that may have been less of in issue a hundred years ago than it is to day i think your for certainly for me being present is very difficult it is not my default state i do not know tha it is the default state for most people truthfully im but i'm very often predisposed with thoughts about the future occasionally thoughts about the past but it is much more ofte turn thoughts about the future and planning and thinking about what i need to do and what o i want to do next and never really being satisfied with anything it is happening the moment i'm i have to work hard to cine of overcome those things and i'm sure you can appreciate this but when you are present you generally earn a much better frame of mine ye othere is a interesting study i thing is initially published by dan gilbert slab one thes long term hae happiness studies i twas publishing science magazine i'm a that pinked people for their level of happiness unhappiness presents or lack of presents multal times throughout the day this was in the early years of smart phones this is round twenty ten twenty eleven the tachknowledg was not as good as tis now but it was good enough to do this in a very large number of peoplei forget how many but is certainly more than ten thousand and nthat numberis i'm stating it intentionally low and what they found was regardless of whether not people were doing something they enjoyed or not boring to them or not the degree of presents to what they were doing was a stronger predictor of their happiness in that moment and over all than was anything else i'm and also a pretty fairly rare feature frmost people seems lie get something that we do need to work at perhaps nowadays as you point out more than i'm we perhaps that do in arn and ancestral past ati'm a little but surprise that i'm a you say that you find it hard to be present because he strike me as somebody that i'm is not just willing but has at a strong i'm almost reflax toward t you nor drilling in the observing that the contour something and then really drilling into it and and really getting to the the the gots of of most everything that that interests you you strike me as somebody whose very present and i guess t maybe this gets back to this i they are novagially exclusive riten mand i think itso for example i'll notice that sometimes if i'm playing with my kids especially my boys cause they are younger right and and playing with them is really being in their world if i'm with my daughter we can be doing things that are kind of mutually lik yu wou will do things together that i would probably do by myself for she would do myself but with my boys it is generaly doing something i would not otherwise be doing and i'm if i'm paying attention to it i'm constantly amazed an how after five minutes of searching through a been for just the right lego piece that we want to do to build this one little thing my mind will start thinking about something else o i got lik gi got to go hi did not emale that do back and i goto do this and i goto do this and i i goto do this and i gt to this and i just get into i got to do i got t do i got to do that is i do you have only been here for five minutes why do not you just find the lego piece that you need to finish building that thing over there that is this beautiful moment that you are noc kon to hafe many o but there is a very finite number of these moments you are going to have you want to savor every one of them i igan i do not think i'm alone in that i think a lot of parents for example can relate to that and that that' that that literally just one of many different things and bytherw i would not have said that that was my greatest challenge either but it is something that requires i think deliberate attention what your alluding to is a a challenge with am holding a single time perception or perception of time i one of the most re markable things to me about the the human brain as our ability to be present or think about the pasts or the future or the present in the future and we can occupy different time mins and in a recent am non recorded conversation of ours a you showed me something that ai've seen before but for some reason this time it had a profoulened in pact on me which has that you have a chart of the number of weeks that you are going to live and you mark them off one week at a time wer talk about this in the contects of a major life decisions and it illustrates the fact that we need a a chart such a chart that we cannot really move through our day being present to the the beauty of working on a lego with our kid well also paying attention the fact that while this is week number whatever six hundred in the er ex number of weeks of one's life that that am ability to i contract and dilate our time perception is is marvelous but it is also am a double tat sort cause it is it is wtwhat takes us out of what is meaning ful in the moment one have has to wonder than whether not our am challenges in being present am you not guess that the psychoanalist may we ned at at were psychatress man we dask ar apalkanti aam wo and i know in respect greatly whether not this is am subconscious a refusal of of our own mortality or something right that if we were to really contemplate our mortality on a regular basis not just when we are marking off the weeks supposeor wewe would not be able to be present because it iscantof overwhelming i i do not know i mean does not feelit the literature says that people who spend more time contemplating their own mortality are actually more at peace a kind of a little bit of the exposure therapy idea and i'm not sure it is an unhealthy thing to be aware of your mortality i suspect it is it is it is helpful inas much as you axcept at right and you and you filk you have some agency over parts of it right i i do not think i have nearly enough agenty over the length of my life i think i've got five to ten years of wiggl room that i can extract if i do if i do all of the thing s that i've written about in that book i i i bet i can stretch my life out ten to fifteen years at the maximum call it ten over what would have happened if i did not do those things iybe it is more but but yit you do not hat it depends on what were comparing it to write from being reasonable to maybe being a little bit in a hyper functioning maybe it is ten years but where i know i have a much greater agency is on is unquality and for me now a big part of that is in terms of quality of relationships i think that is a big thing and i i think for most people that is that is that is what i hope this chapter does is it it is it sort of allows more people to cund of taken a prasal of that and ask that question which is before it is too late am i living my life more for my resime virtues or for my ulogy virtues to borrow from a david brooks's work the road to character which i i i talk about as being can of one of the many ahamoments that i had during this journey now and there again thank you you recommended the road to curator to me i i do in annual solo a welderness trip and i listen to it during the drive to that trip and on that trip and it is a am it is of i would just say it is it is a truly important book for everyone to listen to taarts really quite a quite impressive what are the things that you do on a regular let us say on a daily basis to trying in force im forgive the word but in force and emotional well being in health in terms of relationships because as you point out it is not reflective for it for everybody and that does not make them bad people it i think it does have to do with this am challenge in balancing expectations of work and other things tand and for some people ar more inherent selfishness and for some people am they are not selfish enough i dii know plenty of people are running round tran to serve everybody and than their health is crashing or their mental health is crashing it can cut any which way or always what what sorts of practices do you in corporat or just even thoughts within your own mind you use charts and less i man your very regiments at about your work outs im building grip strain the ecentric umsown to center trainings own to it cetera why would not we also i'm script out the things to pay attention to each morning ind day as a list of to duse well it i i have done those things right certainly in a i at i write about in the book i've gone away a couple of times right i i two thousand seventeen i spent two weeks at a facility in kentucky in twenty twenty i spent three weeks at a facility in arizona im an on the back end of that facility three years ago when i got out i mean i had a iad a very clear list of daily things i needed to do and at that point for about six months following getting out of hatstent of rehav i mean i was i mean god the list of behaviors i was doing every single day i mean twice o day standing in front of the mirror reading my list of affirmations writing in my journal every single day i had theripy every single day i mean all of that stuff was highly regimented to day i would say there is no one single behavior that is quotonquote mandated as part of my recovery but perhaps the most important thing that does come up every day is i'm being mindful of an acting on as quickly as possible every time i a do something damaging to a relationship i'm i would say that if you compare formula one when my my favourits wore by far you compare formula one forty years ago to formula one to day the difference is not in the number of accidents that takes place the difference is in the fatality of those accidents there are just as many if not more accidents in formula one to day the difference is nobody dies in those accidents the cars are much safer their engineered first for safety second for performance used to be the reverse and that is why there was a day when every second or third week end a driver was killed it is catistrophic to imagine what took place between the mid sixties and about the medaties and formula one and similarly i would say that the frequencey with which i have an interaction with a person who matters to me that is not the best interaction at could be is only slightly less than what it was five years ago the difference is the severity of that is much lower and more importantly and most importantly the length of time between when i screw up and when i make amends is infinitely shorter right went from being i would never make amends to if i'm a dick to my wife i usually am trying to rectify it within a few minutes or at most a couple of hours and that and it is it is really in one thing i learned throughout this journey was if if you hold yourself up to this goal if i have to be perfect it to be the perfect dad have to be the perfect husband i have to be the perfect friend you gin to set yourself up for failure cause youd snock can be perfect but if instead you can say what i'm going to be perfect about is repairing damage when i cause it that is what matters the other day i'm i yelled at my son for something it is a while iy'u actually before i lost my voice ihe was just doing something and he was wrong it was lk he ho did something i told him a hundred and fifty times not to do and i yelled it him and punished im but i was way too harsh kis basically i basically the first twenty seven times he did it i did not respond and then when i finally did it is i ble a gas et right but when i realized is ye i you could say whatl may bit hurts a child to do that but i think it hurts them way las if you can immediately go and prepaire and say haybody that he was little harsh in that i'm sorry i did not meen to yell you that but which you did is wrong and you are not goin to get to go out and play right now as a result of it but i love you very much and i want us to do better i want it i want you to do better and not doing this thing and i want to do better and not yelling at you wen you do this thing something it is not it is toes not rocket cience right but i just think i used to live my life in a way where all i did was brakshit and never fix it you are living in a house where everything is broken where is now i still break things but now i clean up the mass and oh lie i'll send the house is better what is your process for when there is a need for repair but im you feel that it was not you it was somebody else's im error but or potential air you i very humbly i express how you go about repairing im you'r youre errors im but what about situations where im i loved one a co worker you feel screwed up ere wronged you right as many people do we all do from time time feel this way im do you approach them i and trying repair that the situation im caus there is a le bit less or far less control when you knon't then the situation you described and by the way the situation you describe thing is a perfect one because im i think a we all screw up and the answer to the second question sort of the answer to the first which as if everyone did what you were doing the world would be truly a far better place but not everyone is doing what you are doing if somebod if you feel wronged im assuming that wrong was it was not o associa pathicaly imotivated what is your process for going about repairing a relationship fracture that agannis assumes that this relationship that matters right in every interaction you are you are only really able to optimize around one thing and you have to decide is this one thing that i'm optimizing around the relationship or is at the outcome nere other things tooptimize around but you understand that those are different right and maybe yo could elaborate on the leba i think i get it but i tu flut rit out of if i met the if i met the market and i'm tryer f m it that i'm turn u by a new car and i'm sitting eir talking to the carsalesman a that is a relationship that is an interaction now i want to buy this car for as little as possible and he wants to sell ta car for as much as possible well in that interaction my relationship with him means nothing let us us whome i do not know this kind he is not myk best friend i'm optimizing everything around the outcome everything i do in negotiating and enteracting with him personally is based on getting the best outcome for me it is very selfish nothing wrong with that bithe whathoes he doing the tame ti was that but now for example pretend that you are the carsalesmn you are one of my closest friends and it is your dealership it is your money it is you cannot sell this thing to me at a loss i do not want you to do that because i i want you to be able to make money and similarly you care about me and you do not want me to overpay for this now we are negotiating and we are both trying to optimize for an outcome but there are relationship also matters i's a very different negotiation of that point and i think i always try to ask myself this question when i'm having some interpersonal conflict which is what am i optimizing for if if i'm having a quarrel with my wife i have to remind myself that the outcome is the objective were outcome is not necessarily the top priority you do not being wright all the time which is my default state it is just to be a bull in a china shop it is to be a thoritarian instead of authoritative and that is that does not work if the relationship matters to answer your question the first thing i'm gin to ask myself if i'm trying if i feel slighted is what is the nature of the relationship is it even worth trying to do something about this and presumably you are asking the question cause the lens is yes this is some one who you you care about more than in just a transactional way yusually what i've realized is i cannot try to approach the situation without fully understanding myself and that takes a while generally and this is where i still one to two times a week i'm still working with a therapist i have to kind of try to figer it out of my own and thnd usually bounce it off a tharapist and say well i think this is why i'm upset about this think that when this person did this or said this i've felt this first ofall am i tha am i correct ing what i felt because remember sometimes you might at least for me this was the case i would just feel anger in response to every interaction but what i did not realize was that anger was really just in nother emotsion that was superimposed on top of hurt er superimposed on top of fear er superimposed on top of shame er superimposed on top of something else but i did not know how to articulate any of those other emotions the only thing i could really articulate was anger if anger is the only thing i know and anger is the only response i see it is not very helpful it is not very inciteful that is that is a big part of it is being able to deconstruct what i'm feeling oh what i really feel is lost or what i really feel is abandonment right now and that sometimes takes a while to figure out at least for me wlike i'm still i'm only a few years into this journey and maybe other people figured these things out when they were in their twenties and ther veterans they can do this more more naturally but that' step one if i do not really understand what is going on i cannot even begin to try to approach this person to say this is how i feel i'm this is how do you feel and an an what are we optimizing for in this interaction i certainly kno you are not alone in this this sensis the process and it takes a lot of time and and on a case by case basis can take a lot of time to figure out will exactly what one is feeling i think it really goes back to the the coarseness of languageis a way to sort one's feelings it was actually or other because we meant yure paulconti who is one of your stamphered medical school 'm i class mates but a another previous guests on this pockess who is also at o one of your medical school class mates the doctor carled iceroon it psychatris by engineer a phenomenan u'm stature and doing amazing things in the world who said most of the time we have no idea how other people feel even though we think we do and most the time we do not even know how we feel i'm in our ability to really know what were really feeling is terrible and yet we recognize the the broad the broad bins ii'm pistoff i'm superhappy i'm relaxed i'm tired i mean to sthing about ou course that a that language is for that for all the new aunts and all the underlying things conscious and subconscious that cu be driving in emotional stay it is really it is really quite unbelievable beyond the veilance that your positive verses negative that was about the extent of my emotional language until in a somewhat recently well itstrikes me you come a very long way maybe you could share with us a little bit about what you learned on these what you called retreat sor e inind the bookshafter you describe deliberately going off to a a treatment centre a multibil treatment centres over time to really drill into this process of understanding oneself thatter and how one's current state of emotional processing an emotional stability or influencing relationships and tk importancs of that what was there any and of overriding am thoom for you for instance could you trace back to specific evence or themes of childhood that need a lot of it nake sense or is it far more ino new onts than that well you the firsthingi would say as i wish i could tell you that this was a very deliberate and wonderful choice that i just decided i man to go on a little you knowself heeling journey but unfortunately that was not the case in both cases en twenty seventeen and an twenty twenty i vert i was as close to having no choice in the matter as one can have a both of these experiences represented total rock bottom moments in my life the these woul have been the two lowest points in my life a for different reasons but but they were nevertheless the two absolute low points in my life and i would say in the first instance i i guess i could have chosen not to go but i would have lost everything that mattered in my life at that point and i had our good friend paulconti basically telling me that i needed to do this bhut i really need to do this and in the second situation though completely different circumstances you might think how can one person in just aspan of three years find themselves in in a situation were they almost without having any choice in the matter have to go away a to a place where your your basically locked up without a fone for three weeks and you'r doing twelve to thirteen hours of therapy a day im sotain nothing about this was was something i wanted to do nothing about this was pleasant m i would describe these is the most difficult things of ever done in my life barnon and i've done some difficult things in my life but they have always been physically difficult i love doing physically difficult things a but this was emotionally the equivalent of for me am yo climbing kate to and suming the english channel in the same month something that just i could you could not fathom with that said yes i learned a lot and i learned that people me can be overly analytical and that that hiper analytical nature cand lead you a stray when you think that youre intellect is giving you a fact based explanation for a set of circumstances and you rationalize than my way well this happened to me when i was aki id but li i get it and it is not really a problem and as a result of that it is it is it these rectary some positive things that came out oout experience and and and i think the real ahamoment in my journey which occurred on on a day that i remember very well was the day i finally dropped that i dropped that im that rationalization and i allowed myself to experience what a child would experience in that moment and then understood what the implications are for a child going through these things and i think that was here us urally the first time in my life i ever accepted emotionally something that i had intellectiolly always said i does not noy matter me it is just what is just life and those things happen and lots of worst things happene to lots of people and and that is sok i'm and i think it it is not that once i emotionally accepted this i became a victim an it was not at all it just finally allowed me to realize oh i can let that go now ii do not have to i i do not have to i do not have to be a slave to the adaptations that came from that i can i can i can surrender a si beautiful and im an inspiring to me i think that im ye ther's this i incredible ability that human brain has to script a story and to compare t other people circumstances and as you sad o you do not rationalize what or essentially emotional dramas were physical tromas im from the perspective of the adult but i'm if i know one thing for sure and make you very clear i'm not a clinition but is that the brain does not i'm discard of any circuitory we re purpose the same circuitory we used as children as as adults and the ability to go back to that and it and to pars it but as yet as you point out not from a im from an intellectual standby standpoint but from an emotional standpoint seems to be the really hard work do you do that on a regular basis no not not at all i'm it is been done at a handful of times im it is been exhausting it is it is very difficult it is it is it is i not this is the right i would almost describe it as emotionally violent im and it is it is it is not something i need to revisit often truthfully i think that the now it is i'm it is it is been done a finite number of times a and i think i've captured much much value from it that t there are lots of other things i continue to do imeni yun i i i use a system called dialectical behavior altherapy that is a regular part of the therapy that i do i'm but i do not have to go back to my childhood i do not have to go back to uncovering and an reexploring a lot of that stuff i'm i i i i've i've learned the lessons and now it is really about practicing the skills i know i know what i want now and i and i know i au now you tug about plastisy i'll share one example which i know i wrote about in the book but but just for for folks listening that you will appreciate i just one of the one of the halmarcs of my existence has always been just a a a an insane amount of anger and rage it is it is been tere as long as i've known i do not have a conscious memory of not having rage ri earliest memories of life when i'm five years old i have rage you cannot believe and it is it is a problem all my life is a tean ager if i go more than two weeks without punching a whole in the wall of our house it is a miracle i mean i am good at dry wall you cannot believe how good i am for all the stuff i have to repair around our house i'm breaking windows i'm breaking it just dosn't id just and ind n a way nd of course i rationalized how much boxing saved my life becuse i had this amazing outlet for my rage right if you i got to basically exercise six hours a day i'm hitting punching bags and people all day long and it is just a beautiful outlet that keeps me out of jail i'm and a big part of that rage was inward right it is it is not rocket science to understand that a person who has that much hatred for every one has an enormous amount for themselvs and one of the things i did not realize was happening was what my inner monologue was because it is you can appreciate you'r inner monologue is frequent and you biquitous and present that it is easy to almost forget that it is there imean that is the that is that that is the sort of a dangerous part about it right is kind of the that david foster wallase this is water thing the fish are swimming through water i the waters everywhere that even realized there in water you do not unrealize you do not realize the subconscious stream of thoughts that constantly flow but eventually i became aware of just what that self talk was and it is it was no longer the case it was the angriest the most violent self talk you can imagine i mean it was there is no mistake that i could make that was anything other than my perfect perfect standard that did not resulv in what i would call my inner bobby night going bolistic it just did not matter it' t's sound silly under it did not matter if i did not perfectly cook astake if i did not perfectly nail something i was doing if if if i did not do anything that was perfect at what i described as match grad perfect i mean i would want to beat myself to a pulp and i would scream at myself i mean it just it is i's again it is hard to describe and i i hope that most people listening to this do not understand what that feels well it became very clear that that had to change because when you were when you ere that when you hate yourself that much by definition you ere going to be an insufferable prick to everybody else cause you are you are just that is good to spill into how you interact with the world i ou n was working with a therapist who was one of the people who was sending me to this place in arizona and vasically it became clear that t the the the they hey proposed that i could shed this trait if i was willing to do certain amount of work an i was there is no chance i'm forty seven years old this is the only way i've ever interact ith myself how in the world could this be undone it wuld take another forty years to undo this and the're nonno here is this exercise you are going to do the exercise was every single time i did some thing where i would have that self talk i would have to immediately stop myself and pretend that it was not me that just did that but it was one of my closest friends and instead i would audibly speak to that person there is nobody else there but speak to that person as though they are the one that made the mistake and i were i was to record that on my phone i'm out there shout my bow and arrow and i do not get a bull's eye instead of screaming it myself i have to say oh imagine it is my body ja are who just missed that shot what would i say to him pick up the phone yur poetophone and say of course something different and of course what i would say in that situation was much kinder an infinitely kinder s from saying it to my closest friend i'm say it in a very kind way and i had to take a a copy of that audio and text it to my therapist oh well talk about win you na i was all on board this practice until you mention that at whach on andand i trust my therapis i unto very deep level but a t well that that is a that is a mountain well thi's in i tis poor person got a lot of tax messages a lot of lot of audiopiles but here is the part that just blows my mind it only took i do not know i i cannot remember exactly i hve to go back to look at my journals en took about four months to get rid of bobby night li ou now agan t t we we had kind of a mental model for what this lookd which was bobby night was the chairman of the board he sat in the board room and nobody else got to talk and for those that on't a bobby night had a terrible temper the worst right this the guid it was throwin chairs across the basketball level eleven yet out of ten and and all of a sudden we got to the point where bobby night is not even in the board room any more in fact i as i say this to day i do not really remember what he sounded it is it is amazing to me and and i've had some really amazing opportunities to bring him back it is not i'm making fewer mistakes right it is not i'e better today than i was three years ago at all the things that i do i'm not i'm ectually probably worse tan many regards i but the difference is ye i can communicate with myself ii think i can say this i think i can say lovingly right and and may be not as lovingly as some people can i still think i'm probably a me just a little higher standard with myself than maybe i need to be at times but but i'm just not beating myself up i used to and i think by extension i'm beating other people up a at lass well i do not know the extent to which you are internal narrative reflects the o narrative that others have about you but for i want to thank you for sharing i'm what you just shared i think as a practical stap it it i' first walts one i've never heard of before i'm but certainly represents thes incredible phenomenon of noroplas to see because four months sounds a bit of time and yet ius you were forty seven or selv that is forty seven years of accumulated i'm just absolutely berating self talk is what it sounds i'm it is something that people can can think about for their own for their own purposes i'm in their own challenges also youi've read the book twice now and and lov it at as as i put it in my 'm endorsement of it i'm i think it is not just informative but it is indeed important because it centers on many of that he actionable items related to vi helspan and life span vitality lonchevity whatever people want to call these things that are essential but also this the section on emotional health is was 'm absolutely profound for me it inspired a huge number of changes i'm and the book as a whole represents it a very important contribution to everybody thet ther numerous points in i would say every chapter is applicable to everybody and theire very few books out there that i'm wone to thank you for that and especially for including the section on emotional health and especially for sharing what you did to day because i think it does not just take a a bit of ulnerability but at a tonof ulnerability and humility to be able to share what you just shared and my only request your wish is that you also houly internalized it the tremendous gift that you are giving everybody through coming on podcast this doing your own pod casts writing the book i look out on the landscape of im front facing public facing i health out there and you sit i not alone but in a unique stance as that the medical doctor that i do believe that i'm people trust the very most because of the fact that you have that intense rigour youre i would evn't say you'r desire your i'm absolute obsession with measurement and and precision i many of the things i a moment ago your pointing to as as potentially in a hazards for your emotional life but that is sir all of us the general public i' preciously and se with it just incalculable value i hope that internalizes as well maybe i it will even weven to yourself thogt maybe i need to send you a script every day but in all seriousas i'lso one to thank you for taking the time to day and i'm even tough it is a personal thing i i really want to thank you for your i'm being a amazing colleague to me in the podcass pase in the in the health and medicine space whatever that is and also 'm just in it an incredible friend you have been a tremendous source of support and guidance in every one of the domains that we talked about to day and many more and

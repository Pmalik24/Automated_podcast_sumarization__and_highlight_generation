right now the united states experiencing the biggest border crisis in american history and i'm looking at the front pages of the biggest newspapers in the united states rah now and none of them are even covering it the top head lines over at the washington post are all about a ou en cort which is entirely irrelevant ordering israel to do mord print harm in the gozas strip or an alibama man being put to death with nitrogen gas nothing about the giant wave fthe legal megration on a border that is now spurring a constitutional show down between the state of texas and by he way twenty four other states and the federal government same thing over at the yor times nothing at the top of the home page nothing on what is going on at the border why because when it comes to the democratic party and theire lackeys in the press they must cover up what is going on at the southern border because if americans understand what is going on at the southern border jobidon will not be reelected it is that simple what is going on at the southern border is a travesty as i mentioned to you if mentioning toou for a few weeks here near the begining of january we asshue went down to the southern border in arizona and it is absollutely stunning what is going on at the southern border not merely the numbers of people or showing up at ports of entry and then being caught and released tcatchin releaseis where you claim asylum they bring you in the process you there are no beds for detention facilities and thy're not goingto detain you anyway to coming with the kid for very long instead they just release you into the interior with a come back later date which nobody ever does is not just that is that the drug cartels are in complete control of the southern border thetve a documentary that is now available at daily wire pluss that shows you everything that we saw at the southern border we took a giant tour about twenty five miles of the southern border in arizona with brand and jud who is in fact the head of the border patrol officers union and it is astonishing because again not only is the southern border largely undefended it is made by this administration this administration has decided that what they are going to do is turn c b p into a bossing and processing service there effectively the d m b on the southern border for elegaliigrants what yu'e in a c in thes documentry when y ugover to dailywire pluss one o the things tht youare going to s is a sin that is at the southern boarder that literally says two e legalimigrans in spanish push this button for boarder patrol help this is over at the sand magel gate in arizona which is actually on a native american reservation right at the border there is no boarder wall over there because the native american reservation is not want a border wall over this can literally just step over the border walk in a mexico walk back across the border into the united states people are arriving on mass dropped off by drug cartells drug cartells are literally taking trucks filled with the legalimigrans and theyare driving them yards from the border dropping them off havin'g people walk across because of jobidons asylum policies wich are different than donal trumps asylum policies people are throwing up their hands surrendering to border patrol bor patrol is then letting them into the country that is what catch and release is and we are talking about millions of people every year some estimates low end estimates say six million y legalemigrantshave entured the united states since jobidon took office high and estimates put that number all wa up at an million illegal migrants and i's not just that because the drug car tells know exactly what yo bidon has done they have essentially decided to use this asylum process not only to smuggle more people across the border because does not require very much literally just drop somebody off at the border that tey ment i would drop ma hids off at school they do not just do that they flood these particular areas of the border border patrol than has a legal duty to help process all of these people and as we show in the documentory this means large swaves of theborder than un protected we drove for twenty five miles long america southern border in narizona not a single border patrol agent not one zerol borer patrolagents why they wre ll over the tention facility oin processing wor where they take basic in formation about your life eillegal emigrans our coming across the border with phone numbers of people in various cities they wish to visit we literally have on tape sheets of paper with fphone numbers of people in denver in atlanta in huston they the entire desert is covered in trash over there trash left by illegal emigrants or crossing that dueser to get in and again it is not just that the drug cartells are geting paid for the illegal emigrants that they smuggle in at the border it is the drug cartells our trying to gather border patrol agents to the processing facilities and away from guarding the border that the really dangerous people not just the illegal imigrans want to come here and who want a work some one beun well for were tungue about the people who are actively dangerous people with criminal records people who are terrorists people who want to smuggle drugs into the country when the borderis un protected that is when these people cross the border with the help of the mexican drug cartells how much technical superiority do the borb did do the drugcartells have at america southern border when we are down there as we showon our documentary it is the first uppserd of new series were puting out called the divided states biden we should go checkei out right now at daily wiredock com one incident that we observed we are sitting down there at the border and it is the night were watins to it happens and suddenly i here a buzzing in the sky ani look back and it is drone and i turn to the borer patrol agent with whom we are siding and i say i assume that that is in american drone to moniter the border is not we rn't have druns in this area that is a mexican drug cartell drone flying over american territory by way is an american territory flying over american territory and hovering near the car we are sitting why are they hovering near our car because the drug cartells no with such precision which border patrol agents our where that they recognized that this car did not belong ats the are hovering to trying establish what exactly that car was i ask the borer patrol agent and see this almedocumentary ask the border patrol agent why do not we shoot it down right men that that is eight that is a foreing aerial survalans vehicle from mexican drug catels from a criminal cartell and he says you have to elevate that all the way to the secretary of homelan secury to get permission shiit tat down that is what jobiton has done on our bord he has turned our border patrol agents into either sitting ducks or facilitation agents for illegal emigragent and that is why f the state of texas is now saying to no we are going to en force the border eget to more on this in just one second first if you are me it

ith the company you can be proud to spend your money with again that is pure talk dot com slash shipuro pure talk dot coma slash a pra to get started now here is the problem the state of texas can only do much far meaning that the state of texas can put up race are wirer the state of texas can put physical im petiments on the boarder to stop people from crossing over the american boarder one of the probis of the trum border wall which again is a great thing the borderwall is very useful except you actually have to have people to guard the boarder wall that elegalimigrans and drug car tamembers do not actually just soter directly through the the boarder patrol wall e get you saw evidence of this gen in that ocumentry you will see sections of the wall thet 've ben completely cut through cut through by the drug cartells iso but one of the things that tat is amazing truly amazing is again that not only would texas have to build more im petiments there texas would somehow have to come up with a mechanism for expelling people back south of the boarder and that something the texas has not done yet not only that even if texas were to do that because of jo bitons asylum policy all that would do its then focas all the rest of the legalimigration at ports of entry were people would still clam asylum toy'd be better than occurrently is where here is crossing the southern border anywhere and throwng up their hands and the drugcar tells our literally using them as distraction techniqus than get fentinal across the boarder and purus across the boarder iou'l be better but the federal government is to blame for all of this the federal government has purposeully left the southern boarder not only undefended but in the control of criminal drug cartells this is not merely pople wo are straggling across the boarder one by one trying to get to a etter life this is being facilitated it 's being created by the mexican drug car tells in fact whele we were down at the sammael geight in telvis happening why tbecause the day that we are down of the sanmagell gate which was again early january there was not a lot of eelegal imigration that day why because the drug car tells were busy having a fire fight on the other side of the border with one another they are too busy killing each other to actually bring people up to the boarder that day the drugcar tlls are cin complete control down there te'e in complete control and i'm not the only one saying this this is aight this t jo bidon policy this did not exist on er donal tromptonal trump had a couple of policies that made it significantly harder for legal emigrans to cross this way one remaina mexico remain a mexico is the single most important policy that jobidon dumped and dumped it da one an officeand you could reinstated to day again it is illegal to do what yobidn is doing on the border the law specifies that illegal emigrant must be detained not that they can be detained they must be detained until they have and asylum hearing remain a mexico change the law the executive border and executive ageement with the state mexico that remain a mexical policy sad that effectively speaking if you came to the border and claimed asylum you had to weight south of the border before you could get your court date will that radically cut down on the number of people who arearriving n the border and claiming asylum becaus e you claim asylum and you are immediately released into the united states ithin sevento seventy two hours which is what is happening right now that is a very different story thn you arrive at the border you claim asylum we tell you weight mexico you shop for a court date youn' have a claim for asylum and go back to mexico at's a very difren oucom its it one hundred per cent if now come hipbit the fact is jobinnesie did not the outcome with lassyleglimigration heis facilitating all this and is really really dangerous is a letter that went out that a week and a half ago for from a couple of former members of the f b i and the c i a than inchris swecker is assistant director of the criminal investigated vision of the f b i retired and ceaven broch whose an assistant director of thdirectord of intelligence at the f b i at the natioenal counterterrism centere also retired an what they point out and they are totally right is that this is a massive national security threat they say has former senior executives of the f b i with deep experience combating dangerous to the nation we right to express our concern about a current specific threat that may be one of the most pernicious ever to menace the united states the danger arises from the nature of the threat itself wars ant expionotion bommington riots are sadly familiar delivery systems of instability intomidation and insecurity the country has face these and more throughout its sister and is held together the not without struggle that throut we call out today is new and un familiar and it is modern history the united states is never suffer and invasion of the home lend and yet one is nfolding right now military aged men from across the globe ut many from regions or countries not friendly to the united states are landing in waves on our soil by the thousands you' be difficult to overstate the danger represented by the presen s inside our boarders of what is a comparatively multid visen army of single young dult mails from hostile nations and regions whose background intend or allegiance is completely unknown in twenty twenty one they say the demographics of those crossing the porus southern border started to shift young men from around the world travelling alone and holding questionable motivations dramatically increased in number to become the most common profile of those bregiong the nations o borders this happens to be true by the way we are told by border patrol agent who shall remain nameless that the number of terrors wo are being captured at the border is completely unspecified they have no idea even when somebody has caught on the terror watchlist that does not ecessarily mean that the person is a terrorist because the terr watchless is really really vay it is the unknown unknowns that are truly dangerous whenever we look at the stats on the southern bordery hive to recognize that it is a few different things that are being aggregated together one is border apprehensions to border apprehension by the way tdoes not mean the person is kick back to mexico a border apprehension or a border in counter means the person it is taken by c b p and then process which means they end up in the country the vasmajority of the time under jobidon if they know the magic words if they say open sessame i want asylum i fear to go back to my country they are

known godaways there is largely camera coverage of the entire southern border if it camerage coverage is is very comprehenciv but you need to have actual agents wore watching twenty four hours to day the camera coverage to see what they can see now a bunch of those people do not get captured they get seen on the cameras and they escape into the interor weave no idea who they are that number it is at least six hundred thousand last year at least six hundred thousand known godaways just last year how but the unknown godaways how the helle should c b peno they have no idea aet mamuel gives som estimats but they literally have no idea mean that that that is an unknown unknown s they do not know how many o thers t but what we do know is that if those people wante to just be released in the united states and for theyou us government to know who they were and what they were about if that is what they wanted if they just wantd to come here and the one to worky legalle and then hope for amnesty et some poin them on to come her o get married to plit for green card hey wn to come here beyond wellfare in in california warever if they wanted all of that the easiest way to do that is dou throw up your hands and surrender to c b p the people who are crossing as unknown godaways oure people who should not be in the country under any circumstances not just because they'e are leglimigrans but because they probably have criminal records o drug connections at a minnimum and many of them probably have terror connections as well because that is why you are avoiding c b p it is one thing back in the olden days when c b p was actually trying to stop everyone from crossing the border to say that many of the people are crossing the border between ports of entry and trying to evade border r patrol those people are are not criminals in in the sense of anything except fore the illegal mogration thand many of those people are you now the people who proverbrially work in the fields or do the cleaning or whatever the left wants to say their important for becaue the left is very racus with rehardtolout of thse people but with that sad now that it is very obvious that you can surrender to border patrol and then move to huston or good wood lantop or go to colorado or whatever the only people attempting to evade the border patrol are people who are presumably dangerous and that amounts to millions of people every single year because of what they are doing by he way the drugcar tells nothis the drugcar tells no this someof the most shocking footage from the documentary that we just put out at daily wireploss and gany should go check it out bies really is shocking stuff s b p told us that some of the stuff that the drugcar tells do for example is they literally if they are being chase by sb p and they are travelling with children they will literally discard the children were tong about babies come out babies the toblers or smaller discard the children hoping that s b p well go and care for the children as they are morally duty balnd to do they can evade a rest stoll literally take human babies and throw them to the side of the road in an attempt to distract seby piece that can escape into the inter of the country thy've no regard for human life the drugare tells none and this being again facilitated by the federal government as these former aftbii ageant say all of this is particularly alarming and light of th commoss teror attack on is rea last october seven those whase who have fought terrors whom know that historically successful terrattax in vite mimicry we know as well thet terror leaders intentionally cultivate the longs of young men possessing a certain easily manipulated personality type to carry out atrocities in te stark to say but having a large number of young mails now within our borders who could begin attack and gathering som unarmed citizens and imitation of ten seven must be considered instinct possibility that of course makes perfecents and what we are watching wright now is absolutely unprecedented on our southrn border and the media have nothing to say about it the only thing media can do is yell a republicans jo bidon has the legal power to close the border to day no further legislation is necessary jobidon can do exactly what donal trumpted jo bidon can reinterpret the asylum laws to require tht you make a colorable showing that you will in fact receive asylum before your releasiin of the country jobidon can detain people and should detain people when the cross the word jobidon can renegotiate remain in mexico and do that again apparently sage do not won to that is thir afraid total hand trump victory shey w literlly rather keep the border open rather than handle hand donal trumpet victory all of this is leading the states at the southern boarder led by texas to actually trying do something bot mi say the tates o the souther worder i really only mean texas new mexico is democrat govern tey do not care about an open border arizona is governed by katy hobs she is deployed the national guard back an december a little bit but i can tell you the border is wide open cause i was there it is katy hobs has said nothing virtually nothing about the bid dadministrations moufeasants here grag abbot for his part is trying to set up physical barr ers along the southern border that is t that razor wire is that is why they put barriers in the iddle of the reo grond because they have not come up with a process yet whereby texas will actually expel people backs out f the board which is what you hud actually needs to you if you were going to repell wavey legal migration that is currently happening pus you need way more personal down at the border is not just enough to have razor wie you would actually have to have people who could theoretically a rest people and then come up with some mechanism for to porting them back to mexico because if they get to the razor wir andthe get through the razor wire then the same laws that applyed to bord a patrol still apply presumably there is no mechanism in the state of texas fresualy expelling people once they cross legally they would hand im over the federal government presume libit the federal government we will then presumably release these people af tor processing them in any case here is governor abbot explaining tht he is doing the best that he can over here what quick pont tirecation tha o something bill you just sad an everybody saying n that is tat the fren cory you sai the frink were sad wen texas cannot ee if you look it with a

to either sue the state of ctaxas for trying to enforce the border and try and force them to open up the razor wire just actively sue not it not to allow taxas to a low board patrol agents to cut the razwire but tou stop tack is from reinforcing the border to actually side with vast swathes e leglimegration they are goin to have to sho ord then gn o have to acquiesse that is the there true the right now thar choosing a thord path which is to try to blame republicans politically i do not think that is going to work republican governors all over the united states our backing gregg abbot's play as whell they should there is twenty seven republican governors in the united states at this point one of them is a governor abbot of course and then every other republican govrnor in the country has backd gregg abbot's play if you lookgin a map it is every red state basiclly they are few sort of exceptions that a red states of blue govrnors in the blue governors refuse to back greg abbot's play and as you will see arizona in mexical our couple of the statesmen ore not doing what gregg abbot is doing here but many of these govrnors came out early they said were sending national gour troops down to help do what texas needs to do here here is govrnor odisants o florta making that case bydin is going after texas saying that they must re move fortifications from their borter they put wyr they put thins to keep people out a bdin saing y get a take that down te lat people come in illygally which is just crazy and i remark that if the constitution was originally understood to mean that a sey could not protect itself against an invasion that the federal government could force te state to allow an invasion the constitution would have never been ratified in the first place texas would have never joined the iuniin when itin i nd if you lek at federal ats forty sex we cha i danial hor it is pointed out a james madison talks about a situations were federalin cruts men can be mittigatin a by by state action say you have texas here a thit is holding it is grown they have every ri the forti fy the border thes of the in invasion an that is artical one sexion tan of the constitution a theyare in the right e the sansis of course is correct here wois an a governor jeff landrey he also express his support for gregg abbot we supported you not i you e migration we support secure in safe borders not open bordor policies telo coos human drafic king and drogs to portinto this country we stay we governorabment an texas in remining the federal government that under our consticution states o still sovereign and we ave the right the protect our citizens meanwhile both republican candidates still technically in the resnicky hailey is still technically in the race and of course dontale trump is the leader in the republican nominationis nicky haley ashu put ot a statement befor trunted there is nicky haley's statement yesterday about what is going on at the border she said governor abbot is right the state of tecxas has every right to defend itself and its borders it is absoluty ridiculous that jo bidonis trying to stop governors from doing everythig they can to protect their citizens it' also nothng new ban was par of theadministration that suitd me when i passed one of the tofhas t anti legalongration laws in the country as governor u south carolina and the reason i point this out is becausewhen it comes to the twenty twenty fourt geopy nominationrises let us be clear about this there are no open boarders cits in the race and the're really have not been throughout this entire republican nomination race donald trum did come out late yesterday with a couple of statements ontruth totial he said when i was president we ave the most secureboarder in history tjobiton has surrendered our border and is aiding in abetting a mass of invasion of millions of e legal migrants into the united states instead of fighting to protect our country from this onslaught bidon is un believably fighting to tie the hands of governor abbot and the state of texas s that the invasion continues unchecked in the face of this national security public safety in public health catastrophe texas has rightly invoked the invasion claus of the constitution and must be given full support to repel the invasion we ncourage all willing states to employ their guardest to texas to prevent the illegal the entry of illegals and's remove them back across the boarder now gain that is an extension beyond even at texas is doing right now texas not actively removing people back across the boarder once they get in ther presmably being turned over to border patroll but that is what texas will have to do or we will have to beat what wi'll have to make that case to the supreme cort the da cando all americans should support the commonsense measures by texas authorities to protect the safety security in sovereignty of texas and of the american people says trum when i am president on da one instead of fighting texas a work hand in hand with governor abbot and other bor states to stop the invasion seal the border and rapidly begin the largest domestic typortation operation in history those biton has let in should not get comfortable because they wil be going home 's a firs ofalt great statement obvious trumpton rite it may they added some some weird capitalization tri make itom our up but does not matter again here is a thing about trump trump trom one and presumly a prospective trump trum to the people who make policy in the trump administration are going to do a pretty good job and that is true when it comes to legal emigration above all other matters again having spokento board patrol agents and can see us talk about it again at the d plus tocumentary that we just made about this the should go check outright now become subscriber n you can see all of it the policy ratically shifted frum donald trump to jobit jobin came in got rid of all

democrats have shifting their own positions on the border overtime it really is truly an incredible thing here is jobidn back in two thousand seven talking about sanctuary cities again thit whent when people talk about by partisan polarization the united states something that is worth knowning here the republican party has not actually got more right wing on anything my entire life in fact they have gotten more left wing on wide vriety of issues ranging from say game marriage two things federal spending the only area where they seems to ve even held the line is on emigration democrasts are the one who have had an asymetric polarisation them cn radically the left on every issue here is a person you might recall from when he was sentiens jobiden talking in two thousand seven fout sanctuary cities would you alow these citye to ignore the federal law regarding the reporting of illegal emigrants and in fact provide sanctuary to these emigrants the reason the cities ignore the federal law is the fact that there is no funding an the federal level to provide for the kind of enforcement of the federal level you need pick up the new york times aday there is a city not far across the river fror my state that impose tha similar sanctions and what they found out is as a consequents of that their city wen the dumps in the dumster store started closing everything started tohappenand they change the policy part of the problem is you have to have a federal government that can nforce laws this administrations enfundamentally derlic in not funding any of the requirements are nety even enforce the existen tenter bi yessing out which you allow the cities to ignore the federal law no o get that is jobidan back when again he is a sentien person by way the a amazing contrast between jobidan speaking in two thousand seven not just one policy and jobidensping in two thousand twenty forts astonishing you watch that back to back with jobidan speaking now this is not even remotely the same human being a truly's an amazing thon will get to jobidon an the fact that he is breaking down in real time in a little bit here but that is how far the democratic party has moved they have moved just that far it is truly amazing much that h top ice official nan patrick lightner actually had his chief of staff meat with a boblish border's actvess andthn had to defend that the other day here we go i'm wondering why the ishet of sa tat withan abolished borter is actof tis earliar this week could you explain what is that counter ices missan o thats is verwer o ot all yao staf ire re ary ye mee wit ma ar a you sa a ye eral stens were mis fos and r inino aai tat not a oe wi vary foriation er wore aa res oreritin woe leeor ry is atedo he rearbyal r that is ridiculous i'm sorry abolish borts actives do not need be meeting with ice they do not need me me with their partnefhom tat's carry the'r literally their goal is to ignore the law and evicerate the law again one of things we saw down at the border when we are in in arizona signs of called humanitarian groups literally directing illegal imigrants awave from law enforsement people leaving in the dasart bottles of water by the way not by the ports of entry not by the places where only the sort of civillion illegal imigrants are going a criminal place work criminally elegalimigrants are the most likely to be actually getting those bottles of water as they run into the country again nobody wants people to suffer nobody is suggesting anything remotely that but if you want a facilitate human suffering let the drug crar tells continue to do what they are doing the earning tens of billions of dollars every single year the illegal imigration and drug smuggling at these borders it is a democrats have now been left with a final attempto move here before they have to cave on this thing and that is they are going to try to pretend that they are willing to compromise on the border when they really are not and there some republicans wo are willing to help them out in this mit romny being the most prominent among them here is coma harris making this case she says that here is a congressional negotiation going on it is ben going on fromonts of this point it is a congressional negotiation over one hundred five billien dollar bill that will provide sixty billion dollars in aids yu crane military adsu crane some fourteen billion dollars in military aid to israel little but military aid to tiwan and some border money the problim is that all of the provisions on the border are really really soft as animac carthy has pointed out the republicans in the senate have negotiated a truly bad piece of legislation according to mac carthy's back in desember he says what is reportedly being discusse is a triggering mechanism that wuld empower government agents to close the border to illegal imigrants now su prisingly democrats do not want border closes are triggerd until five thousand aliens have cross thits that is on average day five thousand new leglimigrans a day that is what democrats were looking for in this negotiation republicans have signal tey would agree to three thousand border crossings a day hem yue to point out of this point three thousand border crossing to daywould be one point one million people crossing the border over the course of a year that republicans were seeking to do as they compromise with democrats now again jobine does not need thes sionall authorityy of this gorbitn ould do it to day gerbion could simply declare that he is going to pursue it remain in mexical policy that everyone across o the border will be detained until they actually have a dait in cort no matter how long that takes he can do all those things he is not doing any of those things an these that these republicans have not pursuit that the stuff the democrats ar unwilling to sign off on include for example a provision that requires that if somebody shows up at the border and claims sylum they have to show by a proponderancs of the evidence that they actually will get asylum otherwise they will be immediately deported now it seems perfectly reas sintable to me you are making acquaint for asylum it should not be enough for you just to say i claim asylum woo michaold scott walking into the middle of the officin toe clearing bankruptsy yets to show some actual evidence that you require asylum and by the way should be point ted out of this point there is no cortin wuat right to asylum that is not e thing the federal government has the power to declare who can get asylum in who cannot get asylum there is no unspecified right that attaches to foreign citizens of other countries we simply declare things without any evidence in anycase youre as comla herris pretending that because republicans are not caving on this border deal it is republicans fal that the border is open jobidon could close it to day the first bill that we offered was a bill to fix the emigration sistem and that is why an't cantrall bout howlies and congress did not take it up and i will tell you that this is first of al on in inlistion but but sadly it has become deeply partisen and the subject of then political gamesmensiip when in fact the solutions are at hand and we are for to solution early on and invited by partisan work let us work on it to fix this and in fact we have right now a proposal for fourteen million dollars that we can put more resources to address thi very situation and on we hopin and and and are really trying to compel in particular some of the republicans and congress to participate an the solution but sadly iyou know we want o fix it they want o run on it no you you do not want fix you want to open the spiget wide they want more funding for the border what they mean by that they want more administrative law judges to allow people into the country more easily and more resources at the border patrol stations for detention processing that is what they want they do not want more resources along the southern border we can actul guard the southern border for example it is not wha they want but naturallyou have people maramni who are doing the biding of democrats on the sort of stuff heres maramni who has not yet actually left the senate he neds to go now enough saying that it is really because donal trump is lawbeing against the bill that the bill is doing if the bill were good they would be one thing but th bill is not good i be in favor of some sort of grabbing as much of the waw as you can right now regardless of the election becauseyou got a grably can grabbling grabbit he is just do not know how the elections can go but the bill that is being proposed right now at least the details that ben looked out are bad but here is met ramny trying to i guess jump on the democratic bandwagon captain in flation reduction act over here jumping on the democratic bndwagon as for our usual arrangement

daily wire plos the southern border as we have been saying is totally wide open the blame is on joe bidin and jobidon only he could stop this tomorrow join me on the ground as i bring you the real world consequences of on ofthe most destructive presidencies an american history watch invasion on the southern border streaming right now over a daily wire plos meanwhile agan the medior trying to drive a sentiment that its reually republicans here standing in the way of the border issue jobidn is the president jobidon is the guyd who is in charge of the border it is jobidon wh's going to war with the state of texas to keep t that border open meanwhile the senate negotiations at continue according to politico the white house is not backing away from negotiations over border deal even as don al trump moves to scuttle those talks n again it is not dinal trumps political interest for jobidon to be put on the dofensive this is not unusual in politics it is not donal trump we would for jobidnd after run on his border record and he is not wrong jobidon has the legal authority to dall say this a thousand himes could is true has the legal authority to day to close the borde an he is not doing any of that you do not need any more negotiations you do not need more border lie do not need any of that stuff jobidon could close it to day he is not doing it it is on him buthe'r rying to blame trump for no more border negotiation or something that the white house is still hopefully deal could be struck on the hele negotiators spent the frantic day trying to salthage talks after it was reported on late wednesday that senate minority leadermat's mc conall was balin trumps desires tot is all the bordeal the following day mc conall clarified he still supports pursuing bor security link tu crane funding tough he an other top republicans were not able to entirely as swish murmurs that it deal is on its death bed democrats were quick to acuse trump of tryings perpetuated crisis at th word for political gain the democratic senat campain comitthe said sent re publicans are quo tanking a borteal for political reasons but the white house did not join the chorus they felt it was imprudence to join the fragwhel it is imprudent to join the frabecs everlance just can a point out what i did which is he do not need a border deal tho close the border yoe got all the laws on the booksy already need the other thing here is that again if jo bin yous caped ter if he scape he would get as you crane funding which supposedly he wants mc conall for his part there is suggestion that he had basically killed the deal himself because he sees there is not enough support in the house tastually pass di deal but apparently on thursday he said he still supports o bor security teal linku craneaid at at tale end of the senatho pie's last meaning of the week mc conall removed outs he said he is still forcefully pushing a deal tht would par new border an migration restruction with money fort ou crane but that is not actually in a solveof the problem becaue still hase to pass in te house it is not goon happen to day a bit we bernho nothice borde compromise even looks at this point before wecan make a judgment as to whether republicans should sign on to it in the house in senate we have to find out what looks and e boto line is that even if the sin on to the ore compromise jobin is still responsible for it goes on the borks again he already has all the legal authority all legal authority ok kaeso on to the twenty twenty four race itself the republican side of the allezardy decided it is it is it is over but bad look for the aran c the aren c yesterday declared that ther were basically going to ut that there is a draft arins he resolution to declare him thae presumpted did d declared trump the presumptive nominy that is stupid what is the point of that an all of this can hubbub and maylay over nicky heler mang therace is dumb it is really dumb just ignore her if your trump she is not going to win the more attention you paid her r themoe immediates gan a pa tention to her and nickey hayley is bangin on trump and here is nickey haly yesterday mocking donal trumps gafts suggesting he is lost to stup and then donald trump got out there and just through a temper tanter he pitge to fit he was he was in sulthing he was doing what he does but i know that is what he does when he din secure i know that is what he does when he i's threatened and he should feal threatened without a dow you knowi tin tor think bic o the few days ago he was going on and on about me i mean for a while on and on about why i didn sendin security to the capital on january thick he said it over and over and over and over again i mean sombody's got a tell him i was not there on january thic a never den at the capital working in a job that that i think he vis a dt confused and well let that has again town trumpsu just ignoran to galit i meant the more he pays tention nicky hailing the more the irn see tries to preemptively declare the rac sover which cast attention and it he haily the worse it is for donal trump whech trumpet he knows which is why he told the arrenty to stick it he is lestn'nt i' need you to pass resolution here guis they iready know that i have this wrapped up do not need you to preemptively crown me king chiproy of course who is right on must thes issues chip re publican congress men from texas he says it is stupid that the arans he is attempting to this just go and earn it if trump trumisgon with the nomination anyway why are we doing this well pirst letme say that i think they he witl ou torspect to hat a represents that oll gart of the republican party that i just for scat a land bassting that ispik spending an all tepense and endless wars i think we need to move a diffr direction i they present trup represented in twenty sixteen that challenge to the establishment a challenge to draing the swap but i do not think we should be coronating somebody i went out an campaign and iwa we do not corineight people you do not wed ont just choose somebody and yer you get anointed i go through the process go earn it i because it makes you sharper in the generallection ye know if he does not think that he has not ing to worry about the to wory about it go campaign and go win he should be able to wet in south carolina i base thag i think the elect tor in south carolana we should proceed with the elect electoral process and if he is ultimate lye the dominy by votes then he should be supported as the dominy for the republican party but you got to go earn it you do not just get coronated a he is obviously right about all of that meanwhile jobidon continues to be on the campaign trail but when i sayk he is on the campaign trell i mean thy've let the prey much wheeled out his prone body and it is just making noises now he is very weird here he was just sluring his way through a rally yesterday aa as jo ame can let you wa non't mass with the resion e n i we also have some screaming jobidon and' more gaffing jobidn but its endless i meanits an endless source of a consternation i think it should be to americans it is it is pretty incredible that disguise the president a an a to ma tan ba to ma beer bre here welst fom tet ise make twro beard an wos ra a sould rema an under my professor we go ters ole my preisess i ga people keep pretending that he is not in te cline and i play to clipp earlier of him talkinmat the border forget about the content to what he saying i sorn't play that again for you because the contrast between jobidand twenty twenty four and toinete dosn't seven is printystrong for people who do not believe in not decline in elderly age for im for jobidon and here is jobidon this ag an seventeen years ago and this s not the same du the reason the cities ignore the federal law is the fact that there is no funding in te federal level to provide for the kind of in forcemen of te federal lever you neet pick up the new yark times o day is a city not far coss e river for lie state that impose ta similar sanctions and what they found out is as a consequence of that the city wen n the dumps in the dumps tor stor started closing everything started to happen and they change the policy that is not the same du right there one of the reasons that he is unpopular it feels no one us in control that sort of feels but a coron comwell harrisos because they have not take an adequate credit this is one my favorite political lines and there there certain political line to heralolic when somebodywho retires from office for a scandal they say the one spend ore time with their family s thing no you do not you are a tiring becauseyou are bangin ahucker and and one o the other favorite political lines is the reason were un popular is because people just do not understand what were doing enough an ouve only we explained at better of can explain his wus comela you are right we have a lot of accomplishments and i think what the american people wat most in their leaders is that we actually get things dot and we an dot it we have not taken atequat credit for it frankly and we got in to the matter top of getting the word out about what we have a complishe and who did it and who in yet that is that is your a prominse people do not understand you well enough i think people understand you they just on' it very much meanwhile the democrats a rolling out the big guns in preparation for twenty twenty four the roling out in fact a very biggest gun john stewart is back now you may be saying yourself is not john stort really old and you would be crracton start is now sixty one years old john stewart is six years younger than my father john stewart is he decade older than nicky haily and two decades older than rondosantis john stewart is in fact a senior citizen and that guie the rolling him back out as though he is the voice of a generation over at the daily show becuse the daily shows been a crapshow ever since john stuart left now there is something to points out here one the rolling john stert out as though he is a trustworthy sorce he is had a show an apple tov for last year n it is literally one of the worst things it is it is just an awful awful show and one o the reason o really awful shows cause he does not have his good comedy writers first of all commedy central was a comedy it was a comedy central right it was it was a commedy nutwork and becase irwas a comedy nutwork that meant that he had joke writers but his new show is not his old show an apple tev he actually tries to understandi shes n t does not go well for him because he he just does not nderstand issues he is not somebody who spent his life in politics jhn stewarts in tire routine for literally's entire creer has been what we used to call clown knows ohn clown knows off and that was when you cretikue his politics you put on the clown is i'm just a comedian you expect a commdionto know anything i'm just a commedian i do not know anything look at these idiot politicians expecting medinu i'm a commedian and then the minute tht hofd question somebody would be clomned us off i've a very serious question for you is it not not a commeteaquhat a very serious cl stion for you nd was really obnoxious and really ugly but i want to clibettemi john steart as a singular media figure did more over the course of the first deckade of the twenty first centry two destroy actual political media in this country more than anyone else more than any one else there used to be a time in this country is funny earlier this week lexfreetman his wonerful guy released a debate that i did with a streamer call destiny i tolks man on show little but earlier seve benell seeven t e perfectly nice fellow i's on the left that ar really good interesting discussion flike two and a half hours an just tus going back and forth on the issues realy sticking to the issues and it was conciliatory in in mood but but very different in terms aur politics obviously and most of the comments on line were things it is just great th people can have a discussion any more you want knowho ended the discusion it was john stewart it really was ow no who recalls this because now an entire generation has passed this kennistuff makes me feel old an remember when it happened wive as twenty when it happened and up john stuart an two thousand fors during the two thousand forace between george shobebish and john carry and john steart wont on a show that was kown as cross fire for those you do not remember at a media histery cross fire was a show on sianen that' star tucker carlson in a much earlier iteration of tucker carlson tis botie tucker carlson firs as polbagala who is a democratic consultant originally for bilclintn and they woud basiclly get on the air and the were debate issues everyday and john steart who was a commedian playing the clownnos on clown nos offertine he goes on sianen and he then proceeds to say that these two are ruining the country for having what was effectively a civil debate about the issues they were ruining the country and here was john steart recking cross fire again that was a place where people to added discussion from different sides the out uni you cant se a sho this any more an usedto be lots to shows this here is a shon fox yus to be call hanidy and comes a generation ago allan colms droffed off nows just strohn hannidy at there used to be shows on the eir all the time in which you would have a member o the right member of the left they were debate and believe the're not when jo scarborogh's morning jo scarted jo scarborogh was more of republican and meka brushinsky was morgedemocrat used o be more that tht has completely disappeared the modern media landscape wi it is because of what john stuart did here what he did is he lied he said that a partisan disagreement is inherently bad and thtit makes the country worse that when people eir there disagreements in public with one another and they argue back and forth that this rips opart the country it is precisely the opposite it is when jack assis john stuart mug for the camera tafter showing a clip out of contect that the country gets worse insteadof after hving to know anything the entire game becomes show oclip of somebody doing dum thing then go that was john stuart's entire stick for twenty years and that substituted for actual political conversation it is substituted for actual political dbate nobody got smarter watching john steart in fact's got significantly dumber watching john steart show because he is entire stick was baselly a twitterdunk heu hose twitter dunks before twore dunks worth thing here is john steward going after tocker carlson in polbigalla and basecally because of this again the notion of e civil debate between competing sides o the out which was allway back to shows firing line in the late sixties early seventies wou be debates with people between william f buckley and john kenneth galbrays are you used to be people showing up on the show to debate each other and it would be people malcolm mugrage and bob woodward or nom chomsky would show up and he would be to bating somebody henry kissenger made that that kind of stuff happened on tevia used to actualy be an intelligent country the country and then john steward came along and again it is not as though we are at the peak of tolivision politics firing line was significantly better show than and cross fire because william f buckley was frankly much more intelligent than any one in politics for a very long time but john steward ripping down cross fire was in fact one of the signal medium moments in american history here was i made a special ever to come on the showtay because i have a privately amongs my friends and also and occasional ispavrtion telisionsi mentioned this show as being a a bad and not us and and i wanted to i felt that that was not fair an i should come here and and tell you that i do not it is not much that it is bad as it is hurting america si wanted a on o i day wony and saywa wen i ha nothin e wer car ares just want what i wanted to tell you ges ye is tostop o top stop stop hurdin meri o ou and and come wor for us but i we ask the people hat you pa the people not not wele i wha you can sleep at night see the thing is winging der your hell you are right now you are helping the politicians and the the the corporatas and we are left out there be om a wor i wer too rough on he wen ma tis ta on o no ou not too rough on them you are part of there stratages you are partisan a what he call hacks you are doing theatr when you should be doing debate which would be great noi i onest why don de wi no ones what you do is for e hartisan hackery gay again he is one being dishonest and how do you say and you sould help the country ramin he is this is a deman godjec argument in the disguise of comedy which is what john steward to better than litteral anowin very talented at it now come pres eny's on towns tat he was whou supertawlented at it but what he is doing in that particular cleb is really dishonest what he is saying is tat you gots you are you are just you are helping the politicians because instead of just having a debate you are actually helping the politicions by being partisan haks well what you are basically saying is that one side deserves defense and the other side is hers mockery which was acually john stewart's model john stewards mand then when ye called the pines to omtis to commedian i'm just commits now ther bringing him back from the dead and they are going to have him on i gess once a week on mondays to talk about the election and make the country worse again but i think it is worth while to point out that nearly all political commentary on cable tvhe has now become john stuart john sto returned everybody into john stuart richally every main stream political commentator on t v now does this model of what it looks much if you if you pick up a chelencian then a masenbusy or even fox news right now if you watch those shoes your very unlikely to see indept political commentary what you are much more likely to see is somebody doing a quasic commetic monowogue with a pickan pick weresmebody makes a face that every one turn to johnstord because of john stoart to par or poticscep batter or worse it turns out that mockery is really bad for politics sometimes mockerys deserved and mockery is funny and we do some of it on the shell well we also try to do is ac shoul go through the issues in dat johnsteren never tried to do that but he is really successful in not doing that fo ignorance it turns out is really a successful it is a successful strategy being in ignoramus for pay is a great stratgy in th modern media all you dosit i do not even know wit is going on man ou what is going on all i know is that nows john storts entire model and what it became all of politics and that was not good for american politics joining some e line is spencer at linquistis o fields reportof fort the alware and he 's curnelly down at tas mexica border right now spencer thnks much for joining us very much rathemi less talk about what you are seeing to day down at the southerbordr where are youe at the border some right here a shall be part this is an eagle past taxas this rind me ar here this is the international bridge leading in the maxico and this park has been the ap thecenter of this fed between the state of taxas gover abbit and t the federal government of course we have this supreme court ruling just this week n have this on going struggle over whether not the state of taxas can put up razor wire to the tur migris coming in the state of taxas can in fact thathey have not ben ordered not to take the razewire and put it there is just that they cannot stop the federal government from dismancelling the razor wire if porter patrol wants to go in dismantal the razor wire than the state of taxas according t the spreme court has to let them go and do that this all seems to be coming to a head because of course governor abbot has now suggested that he is going to not only continue to erect razor wire but also may be take other measures the reality is of course until texas comes up i the mechanism for expelling people back to mexico that razor wire can only stop people theeretically from crossing the boarder where is the razor wire is it actually in american territories it right on the border what are you seeing over there trusing two different taxs of wire ther they are using her the borer and this is right on the banks of the real grand la adding the entire lag for this park they have got shipping containers non top those shippinyetanas they have actual full fleg razor wire and on the ground thate gotsomlin called tripple stran concerteno wire which is similar but little bit different tht all this is to serve at the determin and of course with the supreme cradasruled as you stated is that fort patrol or can through this wire they are lo to do that but the cach is that the taxof fatal guarden taxity yes are not allowing for te patrol into this park the park is sealed off all the acens i it is very tirely control ol and realy its just etats authorities and certainmember omedia t ar being bytit but beyond thact this entered all these entrances are very much sealed bybort by texs national guard and a department of public safety se what are you hearing from members of bordar patrol or any one else over there about that staned off which really does not seem to be at the at the razor wirerself seems to be at the entry to the part has there been any arguing what exactly's happening thes been lokin a confusion because we actually ave seen some port of patrol vehicles entering the part and something intereting here is that there is a botgram they are allowing limited acts os to bort of patrols a they can use this botgramd but beyond that i really have not seen any interaction between members of bort of patrol and members of these tacts authorities the conflict really does seen relegated to of course the media and the courts and the swater political struggle but here on the ground there really is not too much tension between these two groups and we know to day that there was an ultimata at a dead line really that was set saying that borbetral must be given aces the part ifrom what i've seem on the ground here there does not seem to be much confidence at the federal government is actuo can be taking much in the way of action if that dead line is not that se have you seen a line of i llegalimigrans at the actual border itself is what wats the standiss of the the actual mon what aeyou seen there it certainly seems that these fortifications have worked i came here in may i twenty twenty three and whos a wildly different seen we saw i realbely this was publicly accessible and you could go really almost all the way up to the border and you did see people coming in thrs ventews at ascerculanded of ta dozens even hundreds of people coming iin through this crossing but right now were not seeng very much the way of acrossings there was recently just at damn that letmore water flow down the rear grand this increased water is increased rising water level this suppressing some of that turned out from the migrants but at the same time we do know that the actions from deep piaz in the national guard are cutting back on the number of crossing at ther seeing i just last night actually obtained of vidio were taxes upon of public safety and national guard were togetr ther to apprehend some political migrans and actually arectisit an imprison those two who came here that they charged them was traspassing a we do know that these these tactics have been effectal these tactics have been effective presumably the yo you mention theyave been charged with trasspassing thats a domestic american crime presumably they would be if con victed helden in domestic american prisen or turned over to the federal government if emigration stus was chactor cise whom it will be there not here legally and the he question then is what the federal govrnment does with them o you have any status or was the plan with those particular people that is one of thes tickan points right now leke you said these people theye are being taken to he local domestic jails demestic prisons a we do not know exactly where these people gon to and oup but we do know that theyare going out of their way the texs authorities that is to to not just hand is eople over order patrol because they know that if they do havd them over toe port o patrol what were likewe have s they will be procasked et may be handed off to an engio that will iallow them to fly throughout the rests of the coentry they are ard specific actions at ar being taken by texas authorities to make sure that these people do not be handed over toboarder patrol for that reason for the fear that they wolvsbe process in alowding of the interior he to obviously that this thi situation continues to be very fluid on the ground were going to have to come back to you for updates as you gain any more information what what are you hearing from tat the various sides of this debate on the gound you said that there eems to be mostly confusion on the ground what ae you hearing from and texas state authorities as well as that the border patrol nthe federal authorities well it certainly seems that texas d pes and national guard or u set on that maintain their fortifications here just last night i saw engineers with the national guard putting up more razor wires they certainly have no intention of backing down dontention of taking down this razor water and it does not seem tha they have noty intention of letting port of patrol take control the park ark either it seems that taxas is daking in their heels and it certainl certainly entobe intrting to watch how this situation grasses in the coming days id spentur linguest reporting from the borer spent to really appreciate your time and thanks for ot you are inside on

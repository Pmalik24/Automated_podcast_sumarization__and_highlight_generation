a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in to day's epie sode of the sho if you prefer a beapversion you can find that at our web siht this american life dota work i case o it is begin to day spoken with the story by a twenty five year old reporter namely me at twenty five this cud that about whay you was on an empiar program called wet's hear it ithough ha say i think that twenty fivef your owed me would find this in true that i'm doing right now to the story to be kind of a mumbly and understated here is how twenty five year old made kicked off his story and now true to li id beentures stories ye i had fire that is how i talke abouk then on the radio to day's adventures story began this way i was sitting outside the office of betty bird she is one of the producers of this radio program and she is blind i g undisn' sup the taper there i have much to say about this but of discon to let this play for a minatort first stay with me here o ga a'm outside betty bird's office and i over heard her tell this story she was walking down the street she was with a friend and some woman a complete stranger walks up to the to wit am catches up to the two of them and the stranger says to bety well how did you luse youre sight an a it te i do not usually share that with anybody except frins and she said wel i just want to know i just i just want an u whendy you lis your side and how did to happen an i we i a really care to discuss thatwth strangers and e she is a well i don' know why you certanly do not have a very christian attitude you should be grateful i've given money to the blind you should be grateful i sid e you have never given any money to me lody and cross the street to get away from her now when i heard this story i got really excited and that is because the woman who i've been involved with for the past three years her name is carry wa shene has these sorts of experiences with strangers on the street sorry i i just cannot hell myself i hav tcustis again could there be a more awkward way to say my girl friend then the woman i've been involved with for the past three years anyway my girfrin carry whe is not blind by the way she is only got one full arm her left arm stops at the elbow and complete strangers have rapproached her on the street to ask her what happened to her arm i did not say anything about carry to betty at the time i was just evesdropping but i did go home and tell carry about betty story and her response was shock and excitement of recognition i been pretty isolated from other people who are te sable fer a number of complicated reasons but i just had never been in a position to really trade those stories with anybody or to hear that other people had the same experience that i did i decided to try to capture stories this true to life ad ventures with strangers approaching disable people on the street for other to say would people and for able body people to hear i talked to five people including carryan betty here is don ovino then thi's fin is to series of personal stories a'l av i hads say pretty good til by great funny talkers me a jumping in now and thn with narration to point out some bigger lessons that was spus to draw from the stories playing this for my girl frin the sweet excuse me playing this for the woman i've ben involved with for the last year and a half she had this reaction which was it is quere weure you trying to make and know you want to be but ou not doing it right and i think is soing a good way to put it i was vaguely stumbling on my way to making the radio that youre listn to write a second where people you do not come on and tell personal stories but that twenty five all the moves i make are really tunkey i'm trying hard near the end of the story when i try to point out some bigger i dea from the story it could not be more didactid now if you are an able bodied person listening to this i do not want to leave you now with fear somehow or wif you scared that you will say the wrong thing to some disabled person here are three general rules that you can follow number one you should not offer help to some one unless they actually look they need help and in that case you should go up to them and you should ask them first if they want your help it is really crazy that i thought it would be necessary to say this after at that point eleven minutes of stories were non dis able d people walk up to people with dhis abilities and make complete jackasses of themselves tho i had to day i was surprised o listening back to this reorting how good the enterviews are that part of it i had down and also by my sheer desire to etertain this a story was to kick off to a series of stories about awkward encounters between people with disabilities and non di saple people and in my sen ough to the story you can hear a ludibit of how i sound to day yes but also a little bit of the tean aged magician that i had been not that long before this this is iur glass i'll be back next week with more true to life adventure stories music my strull next week we hear true to life adventure stories from dinner parties people cank you occanen is a clip fom next week story ab and thend tales ith embarrassment and in appropriate behavior by able body people next wee on this public radio programm this version of the story roun a month before my twenty fifth birthday and then another version miness the organ music ran on all things considered a month after that birthday at that point i was not a beginner in radia i bee doing readier for six years and at the time i really wondered if i ever was going to get it i was a freelancer and i was slow at making radio stories than to earn money i also workd is attempt secretary and i would hear the empure reporters that i admired the most pranking out these perfect little gems of stories in a day or two and it was they had some how some superpower that was somehow unavailable to me no matter how hard i tried i twenty five i was still figuring a lot of things out and i bring us up to day because this fall marks the twenty fifth anniversary of hor programm this mary life and rathean spend an hour looking back it seem more interesting to do a show about what it means to be twenty five i not what meas for a radio shuld be twenty five cas who cares wohat means for a person to be twenty five it is such a particular age you ing a dont but you knew enough to it that it is still can feel hit you have a long way to go to turn yourself into the person you want tof be to day n o show we have cllected a bunch of stores about all kinds of twenty five your olds some of them struggling some of them focused and accomplished and not struggling at all and then a couple who are in o somewere in between from do you be easy chicago is this american life on mour glass stay with us at one twenty nine for is nineteen our first story n to days a programm is reported by one of the youngest people in our staff nor gale who was twenty five when she applied for her job here she is now twenty six hi nor hire noer before you get to the person here during your story about i just take as icond ever mind ordere people what it is to be the young least experienced person in some wark place i think it is it is scary because you are trying to prove to people that you are not at idiate but then you think you are in idiet tas sel truit is just it is hird you worry about the smallest things stupid things how i would send it e mol or how i sittin in my chair i think you worry about how your co workers are gain to see you and then you start o realize that no one even cares i've dephanly shown ut blee and it made no difference nobody was paying attention at all every one else is busy no one pays attention but that is a good thing once i realize that i did not feel astrassed about every little thing a is on the story to put together the people wturn out is about somebody whose twenty five and the stame conposition that you are in except in a job were the stakes are harder right ye wait hire ih wel tink of him here i came across a profile tha yowar times this summer about a twenty five year old who had a job that seemed very consequential waymore consequential than any i've had she was a scientist working at the biota company were generan part of the team racing to find a treatment for covit were actual people's lives are on the line and i remember thinking she is only twenty five how' che even get that job her name is stephane jear dano i was not the only person who saw the article and reached out yi was shecurs from high school secus rom collage everysing one of my expicrends malms taion why do you think er the boy friends malms not to grag in no i one best to bring hom to mome ad nigh school sai category that was is imparelative an my your but it a mam's love mi but li o i'm plik stephani's nice to talk to she laughs a lot and she is funny she has some pink in her hair working on her project this was not some huge gol she would set out for herself she love science but she loves a lot of other stuff to back in january she was living in new york city with her room mate an communing to the suburbs for work at rgenerons head quarters and it was then that coved first became a part of her life much earlier than for most of us in the ewesk and long before there ware many con form cases or anything closhes down she first heard about it at work and did not think too much of it i guess in his early man january when li a becane a topic a conversation linkin the lab not really in lik me she pears elak with any one out a the blod it was tik honestly the beginnig of i i certelik shating it was a tat just keep in on on it and see how its breads it was i really a just lik a sin i e at the time and then got really in gends were generone has thousands of employes working on all sorts of things stephany happened to sit ripe between the two people in her department who ere spare heading the covid project christon the lead sat next to her and i right behind me was bin gends ob who is also on the rate respats to you the rapid response teem was not working on a back scene they were making a drug to treat people who got covit and help them recover the idea was to make a cocktail of different anty bodies to neutralized the viris christen and vinchenzo were talking about the planned constantly across stephany's desk and stephane could not help but over her but she was busy with her own assignments an till one night this was still back in january early in the outbreak when she was getting ready to take tho five thirty shuttle bus to her train back to the city she saw christan in vinchenza were in for another late night nd offered to stay back in help i saw lik if another set of hands were there and then that thinking o home a ti ei ganinc a li nine thirty a at that wad li at one day couple be a lot longer one day of taking the lader settle raising her hand to be the one who ses late this is something we know how to do at twenty five i'm very familiar with this move within a few days stephany had dropped all her other projects and was working full time on the covet treatment her team's project was to come over the way to quickly screen which anty bodies actually worked against the virus as part of that project stephnie's assignment was to make which she calls a virus particle a fake version of the crone of iris that could infect cells thit came down to testing hundreds of different recipes getting the conditions exactly rike she was working long hours lots of weekends as the team rushd to get the project in place her job was slowly becoming her entire life at some point in february months before any one was wearing mass before covid was even officially a pandemic she started get nervous writing the pack train every day to work on march she moved from our apartment in menhine to temporary place nearer generon's head quarters id threw herself fully into the project i was excited ga was it it was just i a pretty you to undertaking it was a me was ulsad oh i felt really werd laving the city i felt wered i i could not see any one i did not see my boik fi for almost too monch it felt really ot i felt really hard prayer i ties what at the time ju just my job a just i putting my job before a lot of things tat i normally piarties but i just knew that in my heart that this was going to be something much more important after that every day she would wake up in her empty air bean be drive the seven minutes it took to get to the lab spend hours each day alone in that lab that had to be kept dark staring into a microscope she stay there until around ten or later only to drive back and do it all over again its just really lonely ive never i a never lived alone without any rema wore that was real we is really quiet was there a day or a week that it was just lonely that you thought maybe you could not do do this any more i just remember being up at one thirty in the morning and the te bein the bed room i did not really know how hus ter o they never really watched it and

of stephanie's arbein bein the lab things were turning for the worst hospitals in new york worried about having enough p p the schools restaurants and bars started shutting down there was one moment during those first few intents months of work that stood out to stephany it was when she finally got one of the first key steps in the experiment to work she was testing to see if her virus particle s the fake firuses were infecting cells in acting the real thing dto dodo this she designed in experiment that would cause sells to glow green if they were infected she spent days trying to get the conditions right and then one day o my god i was on that unlike the ti sice one ofbour macroscopes here and you can scan the whole plate it is three thousand images and it is remember lik it hit

corinthians when clorissa was a kid she had the dreams of a kid she told me when she was sixteen that she wanted to have ten children by the age of twenty six not factoring in the difficult mouth of that or how ten pregnancies might affect her box ind career she laughs about that now but the spirit of that dream has stayed with her surrounding herself the family being a protector and slowly the details became more realistic she thought wening the gold metals would lead to a bunch of endorsement deals and that she could buy a house not just for herself but for her mam preferably somewhere other than flint which can be pretty rough but the endorsements did not materialize she made the transition from the amateurs to the prose started earning a steady living as a boxer and she thought she could at least convinces her family to move away with her which is why was surprising to me that she wound up on the house in flint i remember the go all that you had was to get out of flint that

moment the life she has now with the house in flint som she imagines but it fits all her needs and desires it is what boxers do they respond to what is thrown at them and they just but she says this

the ways my parents for responsible for directing my life mamma interrupted a workzou meeting to tell me to make my bed and whatded meshan a lett at to be hedhim as bette which means please for the sake of god clean this thumpster we also agetin to screaming matches about how i do not pray enough which is a funny thing to scream about and always we figd about the fact that i and not yet me i'd

you are stil young of course i'm sol young to which shall respond i goud dicand hom ou that which means other girls your age has many kids it is unaccountable the thing is the act i do not want to get married but i do i want to find some one in fact i always imagined i'd be married by now i just did not when it doit doin my parents expected a traditional arranged marriage i thought it would happen naturally it hasnt i even almost got married when i was nineteen but that was a disaster since then i've tried my way i've da did not callege i've also use tender bumble minder which is the most limtender and must match and unfortunately named e most lemdating ap it has not worked wen guy really understood the arabside of me but could not speak english another was funny but look down on woman who swore the guy i was engaged to was charming but controlling that he was adamatly opposed to me interviewing men which is hard when you are journalist after all that i was stole alone a few weeks before my twenty fifth birthday whend mamma got a call seemingly out of the blue about an algible boy i did something i'd never done before i said o gay i'll meet him partly to please her and get her off my back and partly because i realized if i was bad it choosing for myself us to say my parents coun do better i agree to a traditional set up our motheris arranged for our first date with both sets of parents in my family's living room mamma help me get ready as i was getting dressed she reminded me of all the things i could not do do not you dare tell him that you half piecio west that is polly sistoc go very ancendral it could make him worried you cannot have kids do not bring up that you have taking antito pressens have anxiety or that you go to therapy or that you were married it was technically just an engagement or that you have ever dated before if he asks about any of this changed the subject my date arrived he was actually kind of cute in person but it was awkward i mean our parents were on a date with us thou it became a rare glimpse into what my parents are on dates mamma turns out is an over harrer and baba is super jo on these living room dates i should not be the one asking the questions because it is considered the man's job toina sha all conversation but the guy is in saying anything baba jumped in acting my standon he knows what on't looking for in a guy all his questions were secretly related to my deal breakers mike i want to be with some one who speaks arabit maba started grilling him how good is your arabic can you read and wright his mamma answered for him of course he can suddenly the two parents were badoling et out baba said can you brecite put on his mother jumped in yes and his voice is beautiful the guy interrupted her actually i cant i burst out laughing i was on the fence this man would not even make i contact with me o case he is a shy guy that means i'd have to drastically ton myself down but then when he told baba that for his job he can live in work anywhere i got excititd other guies had always expected me to give up my career and follow theirs but this guy i could keep my jop and he coudtag along what if we have nothing else in common but then his momstarted talking to me i was telling her about my life and dece blauba bla when she caught me oftan said ye i saw that in the add my mind just completely stopped the add i try not to showeer that i was clearly surprise but in my head i was with the fock is this woman talking about what ad i thought some one just happened to suggest to our mothers that we meet but there was an add mamma who clearly heard this too acted she did 't they changed the subject but by the time we got to coffee it was all i could think about as soon as they left mama explained it was not her who but the ad out it was a friend but mamma left it up and kept it from me because she thought i'd hate it i found the ad i hate it it starts were the lying of pink an moge flowers and emogie i would never use by the way then it reads twenty five year old palistinian born in jordan living in the uest since two thousand and twelve studied here beautiful fair skin blue eyes eiles beautiful about camadacle with a elabea bless be the most gracious there is no power except an oulaw she got married without sextual relations that is referring to the engagement i broke off her request is a highly educated young man contact me for the mother's number serious inquiries only everything about it makes me crinc the fact it exists the details it includes my eyes are not even blue i do not with their selling my white skin my lack of sexual relations it does not include anything about me that i'm proud ofe or anything that actually mattered the add lays out plainly the enormous cap between who i am and who i would need to be to match with some one in my community the description of this lena is far from me bkind of hurts to read looking at the add i realized i'm probably not going to find the partner i want some one who is in between two girls in the way as i am in the ways i want to keep being it feels final i am twenty five and there is no one for me but for what it is worth if i were to rewrite the add here is what it would say lena twenty five once to become a foreign correspondent lots finding and making stories she is religious in her own way she fasts but does

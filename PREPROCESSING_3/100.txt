congress ofverts a government shut down at the very last minute representative gemal bomen pulls a fire alarm to delay the vote and representative matgates thretens keven mccarthy's speakership i'm benchfer this is the benchvirosho the benshvir shos gontor baexpressvpien pretect your oline privacy today express vepiandicoms lash men areaty it looked as though there was going to be a government shut down over the weekend it was averted at the very lass minute mainly because ceven mocarthy decided tha who ise gon to move forward with what we call a clean continuing resolution ticks about forty five days tinto the future takes us into november tit s dis not include funding for the crane war the senate then quickly pass that and then it was signed by president bidness happen bout three hours before a shut down was set to take effect the democrats obviously did not want to have some sort of deep abiding fight over you crane funding in the continuing resolution they did not want to go tote american people and say the reason for having the government shut down right now is because we meed exbillion dollars mor for the crane war again the sentiments against the american funding of the crane war is growing and growing mainly because the united states has never presented a plan for any sort of offramp tif you actually want the american people to backa plan wou have to have a plan but te by demenstration hass no plan democrats in one to have the dobay publicly now the reason that this deal ended up getting done in the way tht got don is because there was a wing oh the republican party that actually scuttled a significantly better do just a couple of weeks ago it looked as though the republicans were going to pass a house resolution that would provided for continuing funding for the government that would have amounted to an eight per cent cut in discretionary spending over the course of the next ext number of months and not only would includin eht per cent cut to ould also inclue bore security measures and for some reason that no one can discern matgates and company on the right wing of the republican caucas decided that they were going to not vote for that they wanted more they wanted no spending whatsoever they will not going to explain exactly what it was that they did want or what they thought could pass the senate instead theye were just going to stand there and shout no at ceven mc carthy and a lot of people i wenn't understand wir shouting at him what what do you think he can do hes a democratic senate and a democratic presidente he already one one government shut down to bate with jobiden because jobidon a fool came out and seggested that wh was not on a negotiate whatsoever overspending andthen he anded up caving and mcarthy got some funding cuts around the edges whel the same thing was going to happen here mc carthy was goin to pass a bilt that including eight per cent discretionary funding cut and bor security measures thwase then gen to go to the senate tand democrats were going to be forced to argue that they would rather the entire government shut down than that these cuts be allowed or that bore security be alowed again wrong footing democrats is what you have to do to win future house elections instead the right wing of the caucas again all it takes is a couple of votes for the republicans to lose their majority on any vote becase the only have two hundred and twenty one votes in the actual house of representatives of the united states they can only if fore to lose about four votes and still pass a piece of legislation by majority vote and that got scuttled and instead a worst eal got ton and then that worsteal is being used is we will see in second by magates to suggest that keven mc carthy ought to be ousted from the speakership as basically a catch twenty two the gaites was setting up for mac carthy he was not going to pass a better version of the bill for some unspecified reason because mc carthy was a sell out and then when worse version of the bill gets pass than its because mac carthy is a sell out in any case according tothe walster turnal the house voted three thirty five to ninety one for the measure exceeding the two thirds majority needed to clear the bill which was considered under special precedures requiring a super majority o votes all but one democrat voted in favor of the measure while nearly half of republicans voted against it several hours later the senat voted eighty eighty eight to nine to pass the legislation and then jobidons signed the measure this prises break through up ended expectations congress was two divided s pass anything in time to keep the government from partially shutting down at twelve one am on sunday howse democrats initially were suspicious of the proposal and stalled for tin as well talk boun just the second on of the precedures for stalling for time involved actively pulling a fire alarm in order to create some sort of emergency protocal response to delay the vote on the senate side anger over the move to pull u cran a led to a nerve racking dinner time at delay the measure include sixteen billion dollars in disasterelief it o mits assistance for u crane it excludes bord security measures sought by republicans and a renews the expiring fooding churs program through november seventeenth and reauthorizes the federal aviation administration through the end of december keive for its own part is in u crane theire down playing a lack of u crane aid in the new spending bill ou crane's ambassador to the united states ocsona marcova marcova marcorova she said there are funs the goverment will work there is no threat to the supply of reviously proved weapons and equipmen sai there is time that thereare re sources more importantly there 's by partizin an by camera by cameral support for u crane and that may well be troupe they yu might be able to pass some sort of stand alone u crane aid provision but thas not can be true for very long in th ost congress an otherwords they are better be an exit plan as we say before jobidon for his part he came out and he praised the congrers for avoiding the shut om of then blasted extreme house republicans for a manufacture crisis pat our statements and quote to night by parson majorities in the house and sendat voted to keep the government open preventing a necessary crisis that wouldhve inflicted needless pain on millions of hard working americans this pillin sures that active o new troops will continue to get paid travellers will be spared air port delays millions of women and children will continued bav acis to vital netretion assistance and much more this good news for the american people but i want to be clear we never shuld have been i this position in the first place just a few months ago speaker mac carthy and i reached abutched agreement to avoid e precisely this type of manufactured crisis for weeks extreme house republicans tried to walk away from that deall by de manding trastic cout to tha wouldhave ben devastating for millions of americans they failed now the reason they fail by theway is not pease of democrats the reason that they failed is because maceightes and company decided that they were going to fight back against that particular provision for again for for a reason that no one can discern it is not conservative to walk away from bigger spending cuts simply out of personal eier apparently at caven mc carthy bidin continued wile the speakeran the overwhelming majority of congres have been steadfast in their support for your crane there is no new funding in this ageement to continue that support we cannot under any circumstances allow american support for your cran to be interrupted i fully expect the speaker will keep this commandment to the people of your crandmnts cure passager of the support needed telp crane at this critical moments o he is throwing it back on mac carthy and saying that we definitely need more aid iv you that' t battle that is going to be a pretty significans as to how much more eid mac carfy is willing to pass or how much eight republicans are willing to put forward by and then followed up with that he said i hope the mac carfhy is now had a personal revelation with regard to the extremism of his own caukas or at least that is what bidan is trying to say his face hold usn't work any more we jes mad one abo cra soill find ou iio tis experiec tr speaker as been on o a personal revolation mot be pecition io anywary tan an honest to

democrats were taken up short by mac carthy moving ford on a clean c ar without the ucrane funding and they were pist tbecause they want ed the ucrne funding in the continuan resolution andthey want a continue to poor money into ou crane insthey were manded the tried a bunch of tactics to to delay the vote trying to come up with some other sort of solution without having to vote for it i kum jeffreys basidaly tried to fillabustor the thing but gemal boman the more onich congress men from new york and and there is no other way to put he is a morarm i een because either he is a more in because he thinks what he was going to do was goin to work or he is a morungs he does not o ho fire alarms work let me explain as this vote was about to take place he apparently pulled a fire alarm in a capital office building on saturday we do not ey lay what apparently a security grat vidio was distributed to offers they could fined the person who pulled the evidi alarm see if you can spot whoth says y that is that is jal malman standing directly behind a time that says emergency exit only he a instead of walking through the tunnels or tunnels that connects at the various office buildings on on the hell instead of walking through the tunnels he he walks over to a fire alarm and he pulls the fire alarm represent im gemal boman plle the fire alarm in cannon this morning an count control by republicans on the committee it ise an investigation is why he pulled it is under way there was om there is a resolution that is now circulating to expel boman from the house over the incident wi thet the idea of pulling the fire alarm erers to delay a vote is insane today at twelve or five p ma firealarm as activated on the second floor of the cannon office building a capital police bokes person said the bilding was evacuated while u s c p officers check the building the bilding was reopened after was determinedthere wis not a thread investigation into what happened and why continues democrats were trying to delay starting the vote they been given very little motice about the bot many complained republicans were trying devote before democrats a time to read the bill ho keem jeffreys delivered a fifty two minutes speech in attempt to have everybodys sort of come up with some strategy to thwart at mc carthy ultimately the bote began a two and a half hours after it was schedual to start democrats over whalmingly than voted in favor of the bill because they would beed essentially out played by mc carthy on the craneade and tey're getting pretty much everything alf tat they wanted in this particular buill though big question is why is gemaul boman puling firelam nd the answer is she is obviously attempting to delay the workings of congress now i'm old enough to remember when attempting to delay the workings of congress in the official duties that they were attempting to to effectuate was considered a criminal violation punishable with years in prison if you adtempt to stop the business of congress that is an actual criminal charge and if youare a congress person who pulls a fire alarm in an attempt you stop the business of congress or to lay the busiess of congress it is similarly criminal jumall bowman for his part he am he apparently is suggesting that he does not know how fire alarms work which is weird since we all nthehofhir hav youever pulled the fire alarm thinking it wis going to open a door is that a thing you have everdon no becaus you can read and because you ave a functioning brain you hve two choiceof your gemau loman either your two stupid to under stand what a fire alarm does or you are trying to delay votin congrss which scrimnals either a criminally stupid or just criminal one of the two and that those are theonly two choices there is no third choice yov ther you are a moron who does not understand thaif you ull a fire alarm the firealarm is going to go off or you are actively attempting to stop af vote in congress from taking place which is a violation of law here is his statement quote i want to personally clear op confusion surrounding to isvents to day as i was rushing to make a vote i came to a dord that is usually open for votes but to day would not open i'm embarrase o im that i activated the firealarm mistakingly thinking you would open the door i regret the sin sincerely apologis for any confusion this caus to be very clear this was not me in any way trying to lay the bot itwas the exact opposite i've trying urgently to get to a vote which i ultimately did an join my collegin by partisan efforts keep our government open i'lso met after the vote with the sargean an arms an the capital police at their requests an explain what it happen mi hope is no one will ake more of this than what it was i'm working hard every day including to day to do my job to do a well and deliver for my constituents piece and love ah you'r lyine i'mean you are notres lyingyour lying with a rug obviously

right now and gay it is not just that gemal bowman is lying you still at in the slake e stupid lie according to bright part represent of gemal boman ripped down two signs warning a second for a door in the cannon house office building wats for mergencey use only ybofore pulling the fire alarm and running out through a different door on anto frent floor briht our nes has learned exclusively multiple sorce is familiar with the investigation into bowman pulling the fire alarm in the house which trigger to full skelarn forsemen and emergency services response leaving to the full evaccuation the building told ripe our news exclusively that bowman ripped two signs down and threw them on the ground first the source of familiar with the investigation provided bright barnews the photographs of thescane of the elleged crime later after the emergency doore had been restored after the bowm after the damage bowman did to it here is what the doore and the sign look right afterward you can see first of all even in the phodingsy if there is the giant signats is emergency actet only even in the photo of bowman that tige is right there emergency actet only tow on about you but i can read and i expect my congressmen to be able to read a i know these are really really big these are hard things to do expecting a congrss person be able to read the language of english emergency exit only typically means you can only exit in an emergency i knows is i knowt listan i know congress is filled with absolute abject rejects from the community of people with sentian function i understand this you rait now if you look at our congress we have john fedderman and pennsylvania who does not have a functionin brain if you we have lorn bober whose fondling people during beadle juice ave jumaul bowman who is pulling emergency amy we are not sending our bast i got o be honest it you i we have a lot of bolts who are occupying the heats in congress but this is pretty next level the fire alarm that was pulled ii knowish enouh to describe a fire alarm to you because it looks a fire alarm but it has a gi ordonsis fire push in pull down in the fotoes of the double dors of glass windows they are clearly two giant red signs on the dor they boat sy emergency acit only push unti alarm sounds three seconds door will anlock in thirty seconds my favorite part about this whole story is the media tempting to cover for for bowman mat bruning who is a a self describe socialist he a he tweatit out bowman was trying to walk from the cannon building to the capital building' vote unusually the cannonecit he went to would not open and have this confusing sign on it he thought it was saying you had to press the alarm to get out this all make sents what am mi missing ah the part wore its has emergency exit only that is the park that you are missing there arl this is ridiculous if any republican claimed that they pull the fire alarm and than they did by accident not thinking was can open a door hat 's less igan when is last i'm you pull they fire alarm thinking you would open the door firelarms are all about us in society every time you go to your kit school every time you go to an auditorium every time you go to a post offic there firealarms everywhere and one of the things that no one i know or ve ever heard of is ever done pup thy fire alarm to actually open a door again his poks person says congresmen bowman's not realize who trigger a building alarm as whois rushing to make an ergent vote the congress men regrets any confusion what do you think happens when you pullifit sote as they siybifore they are only she choices eithere he is a more on who does not a ho how english works or he is attempting to delay the vote ao see for her part and another more on again we are we are only sending people with icues below seventy as members of congressthis apparently is the new rule here is a aos defending gimal bomanstonts there is a pulling the firealarm he says it was an accident he thought pulling the alarm would open a door a based on the fact that the doors to his right there were locked and there was a sign that he said he was i think some one said it was confusing i'll be honest the does not really make sens to me his explanation have you talk to him wwhutwhart's going on i mean w tan i think if you actually tink think from the fotes of the fineth i think there is there is something to be fad about the government about to fet down there is a vo clock thet's going down e ikit that are normally open and thatbiltan were suddenly clothed thiwill the fira ar thou i im what i am here to fay is that how is administration and let capital police and jamal boman are an active and thing for fully participating a fainter with in e fenderstine not only shes stu beshetins your stupid i just id's incredible in credible stoff meanwhile com mc carthy when off on boman he says lisn i noticed again that when you tryd to delay the workings of congress then you go to jail for ever if you are a if youare republican who backstrum and if you are a congress person who does this sort of thing and then we all pretend that yu do not ko how to read the language of english i think efi should look at this but this is serious when you thank ofhow other people are treated when they wanted to come in an change the course what was happening in this building and to did he deny he did it when it is on tape and i'm going to have a discussion om but the democratic leader about it but this should not go without punishment y om yow then an an there is talk is to what that punishment will be will he be fully expelled from the house very doubtful well he be stripped of committe assignments almost certainly because again this sort of activity not sure how ofd be appropriate from any congres pessent president trump then of course t jumpd into the fray as well he prawes hames ime will congressmen small boman be prosecuted in im prison for very dangerously plying in settingoff the main firealarm system in order to stop a congressional vote that was going on in dec hi's agreegious act is covern on tate a horrible display of nervin criminality it was very dangerous obstruction of an official proceeding the same is used against our chas six prisoners actually his act may have been worse he must suffer there same fate when will his trial begin no agan not not not wrong i mean the fact is that that jemal boman participating in attempting to stop the workings of congress if you think it serious on one side whits good for the goose is good for the ander or it should be and just sannall get tou stupidity on the other side of the allis macgates seems to believe that running directly headlong into a wall over and over is genius congressional

gan meanwhile matgates is a attempting to under cot ke mac carthy he has been since mac carthy one the speakership remember ther fifteen rounds of voting and gates was the lead hold out in the i'm not con vote for mac arthy caucus now what was weird about that whole situations i explanded time as there is no one to back hamut beaning there is no other option o mac arthy at a hundred nined your publicans ou'ld already pledge to mac carthy at twenty twenty five would not most of them were oket with going with mac carthy as long as they got a few consessions that inclue people representive shiproy of texas anaganshiproy is a consermative with a plan macgateseems to be adue without a plan very often and tom and we en ther fifteen votes mac carthans winning the speakership and since then matgates because he recognize zolitakes is peeling off five votes in order to basically thwart mac carthy being able to do anything with a pure republican house majority he is been attempting to bring mac carthy down in't know if that is a personal animius thing i do not know whether he things that this is going to just simply elevate him in t in the minds of the american public i don' know what it is but according to the wallstr gornal mac carthy's most vocal political antagonis represento matgates has repeatedly th rettin to try to austomhi speaker if the calfon your publican sceduwal vote on thi continue resolution shortly after the house vote gates shouted mister speaker to get theattention of represent of see vomac woas charing the proceedings womac did not acknowledge gates and trout and gable the session to a close total capitulations haid represent of bob good republican of virginia whose indicateng could be open to supporting an affort to ausemac carthya speaker his faild to do anything that he has promise to do now again the provimis tha you have not made actual demands ther that he is capable of achieving if you actually wish to pry consessions at a ke mac arthy as i say representiveshiproy has done that repeatedly but if your version of mac carthy needs to go is he is not governing is small government conservatives o he has to go i urge you to look at the constituency of the senate of the united states which his democrat thanks to the personal intervention of donald trump in the georgia sentat racas and the presidency which is run by trobidin because donal trump lost to him those would be the places to look if you are thinking about how far can you cut the government successfully and the answeris not particularly vars since you do not run the senate andyu also a roun the presidency and also i seem not to remembermacgates being paticularly vocal about cutting spending when donal trum was the president and the republicans controlle the senate i remember him a tempting to shot down the government over spending protocal when it was an entirely republican congress and republican president of the united states w o blew out the bug to the two seventrollian dollars i remember that at all do you maybe ham just forgetful or maybe this i just politics i've tried for eight months mac carthy then told or pors i tried yesterday with the most conservative stop cap funding you could find i could not get two hundred eighteen re publicans and that is correct he tried to gettin eight per cent budgit cut ion the distrestionary side and gates in company voted against it mut here is mac carthy yesterday blasting the republicans who held out is you held out in s i had to cut a worse teal thank you for that that would secure our border cut wastple spending yes i did but i had some members in our own conference that would not vote for that if you have members in your conference there will not let you vote for appropriation buills does not want an omnibus and will not vote for a scop stop gap measure the only answer is to shut down and not pay our troops i do not want to be a part of that tam i want to be a part of a conservative group that wants to get things done it wl mangates clearly to nne n there is certain things to mancates is one that ilect this is certainly not one of them and his personal grudge match against mc carthy seems to be one of the dumbest things going on in congress and again congrss is filled with dumb things these days gate says he is down in a file y motion to vacate the speakership and again all it requires basically is peal off ive republicans and mc carthy has to go to another speakership battle again what consessions is to get a pratomc he will not say what is he want fom c carthy he will not say who ise his back up to mc carthy who is he going to put in the speakership position to take over from mc carthy he will not say and neither will any one else steeves coleise does not want it jim jordan does not want it in fact one of the worst positions in american polityc to speaker of the house and i got be askthy mc carthy far his handled it pretty well considering the slim majority that he actually has and a democratic send and h democratic president but here is mangate thingis ging a file motion to vacate the chair are you going to make a motion to vacate speaker mc carthy made an agreement with house conservatives in january and since then he is ben in brazin repeated material breach of that agreement this agreement that he made with democrats to really blow pass a lot of the spending gard rails we would set up is a lass straw n then overnight i learned that caven mc carthy had a secret deal with democrats on you crane as he was bating republicans to vote for a continuing resolution without you crane money saying that we were going t jam the senate on you crane he then turns around and makes a secret deal now i know you and i probably have different views on you as involvein a nou crane but however you think about that question it should be subject to open review analysis and not some backroom deal i vot a ecate to morrow i do intend to file a motion o vacate against speaker mc carthy this week i think we need to as rip off the bandade i think we need to move on with new leadership he what is that leadership he will not say he is asked who be the speaker if if you get rid mc carthy who takes over for him an magetes s rhom if you somehow succeed after multible trassity who would be the speaker i we have a lot it look we have a lot of tounts of people on our conference obviously it is it is a it is an awkward discussion while our number two steev scoleesas in treatment for blood cancer sots i'm not gon to pass somebody over because they are gettng a medical treatment i want tod i want to see how steev scolees comes out of that steevescleys is not going to be de gui he already does not want to be the gui he his said that repeatedly gate says this is in personal by the way this all based one principle which i find hard to believe considering tit he voted with down on from is position in one hundred sentin congress one hundred percent of the tine literal ly one hundred present which includes tpresumably all of done from big but yeur blow out an wa hers matgates talking about how this is in personal about maccarthy well it matter of fact just coup la weeks ago government cart the appointed me to the national defense conference committee on the nd e eh and we spoke about some of our a line to defense priorities this is not personal some people make policy disagreements personal because their own policy failures are personally embarrassing to them i hold no personal animis to any with any of my republican colleagues bother including my re publican colleguere about to have on next whos hat's a pretty turse words for me but at the end of the day this is about spending this is about the deal ceaven made in january again it it really is not it really is not ye then gates says since the nineteen ninetyes to toll about it it is bee about that it is it is been really about that here since the mid mineties this government has been ruled by continuing resolution or omnibous bill that is why we are thirty three shilling in debt my plan to go on to single subjects spending bills but actually allow us to put that downward pressure and bi'm acknowledge that in divided government you have to work with senae democrats you have to work with the white house but i do not thing you should work with them ought a continuing resolution or an omnibous bill you should make those senate democrats have to take up our defence bill to give troops arays take up our homeland security bill to make changes at the border take up our veterans bill and if they did those things peopleoldhave to vote on specific programs rather than just sing a well i voted for the government finding bill and sure there' some stuff of the department of education i do not but i had to be there for the vessel when is not i'd love all that stuff too it is also not going to happen and the reason is not going to happen he is because every time one of those bills gets brought up democrats rejacten and mc carthy does not have a durable enough majwarty in the house to actually get the stuff done in the firstlys now to be fair to macgates when it comes to spending matgates has voted agains prety much every butcher bill that is ever been presented to him as congress person madgates is voting record when it comes to spending its significantly better than his verbal record when it comes spending he seems be come very vocal the menutes down from is not an office whn it came to spending whell down from was an office he voted frankly how i would vote on ly these mut your bills now but he did not talk alot about it because that would put him at direct to odd with presideent trumk gen he is don wrong on the spending but this is part of the great li of of howconsider poltic's works these days he gad a get what you can get the notion he can always get the moon is silly i know that there is a whole group of people out there who believe that if you just shout loud enough the magically things manifest that is not how this works when ted cruise desided to shut down the government over obomac her in the vain hope that brocchamon would repeal bomicer whos never going to happen hofs never goingto had when macgates he is doing this routine in the vain hope that he is gin to get republicans to cut tabouch about fifty per sent democrats in the senate and jobin 'll go along with it that obviously's not going to happen kepmac carthy for his part he says he do not bring it on you ont you on a do this thing again let us do it matgates he says he is going too itake a motion to day kate he is cen try to out to you a speaker ut the house that is nothing new he is tried to do that from the moment i ran for office but all this time he says he is goin to keep going he may not that that before the fifteenth ballat but it took fifteen for capan mc carth u says he is coming for you can you surpave yes 'll survive ou know this is personal with mat mad voted against the most conservative ability to a protect our border secure a border he is more interested and securing tevy interviews than doing somethink he wanted to pushes into a shut down even threatening his on district with all the military people there who would not be paid only because he wants to take this motion beit bring it on lets get over with it and less start governing again mc card i's not wrong about this one ofthe big promins here is he gan macate's not the only member of congress and the republican party thei'r bunch of congress members were in purple districts doyou want them to lose their seets mackates parently does not care because here is the thing macgates can vote against these muchbills s much he wants hes not losing his eaties a very red district but if you are for example represented mac waller from nw york o seventeen you rud easily lose your seat which means the house majority is gone and when the house mantority is gone what exactly's the check on democrats oin whatever the held that they want here is ma long or talking about this if they vote with madgates an gates only needs to have a handful of of republicans and anhy can remove i a speaker capain mc carthy what what sur message to democrats about whether not to go along with that but ultimately democrats a gnto make a decision a for themselves i think it is destructive to the country i to a put forth this motian a ba cate we have a lot of work to do the american people elected a house republican macharity to serve as a check an balance on the biting a janda and the administrations reckless spending the only way to do that is to complete our appropriations work he is not wrong about this because again id the easy tactical decisue for people who ir very ready areas is always take the hard line and then there is the overall job of keve mc carthy to make sure that he retains his majority and does most conservative thing he can and losn't ontint mc carthy walks on water and the mc carthhy makes mistakes i think that he is done things that i would not do sometimes do i think thand what macates tater makes any sense it is because o madgates that the original better bill that the republicans were going to pass gotsgundled meanwhile the twenty twenty four presidential race is heing up gets that momentarily first we got a wonderful lady works over here name fabby fabby does ma make up every morning she is a delight we love fabby also where all little scared if fabby fabby is the kind of person who if you cross her might commit in actual killing and and here is the thing there might come a point it is not to day it is not to morrow where we feel threatened by fabby i mean physically threatened by fabby thet we have to look to ziprocruter in order to replace that the will be a very sad day but zippri are also makes sure the fabby stays in line and does not actually murder and of the myriad people who

him out right now also back in march my good friend launch the highly successful jermyes chocolate bars holariously labeled he him and she her only one of which has nots which you youd know obviously the campaign was a huge et tit told out i matter of days he will kept trying to ord them we grow our inventory we also sold those out while now just in time for holoween we are proud to announce the alli mikro gression size chocolate bars because the truth is even sweeter one share fight back against the wole corporations who think where wolves can be mummies thu t jeremy's chocolate dot tom orr your chocolate to day o can meanwhile the twenty twenty four race continues to be fascinating in a wide variety of waigs on the democrat side of the isle gobidn continues to be incredibly weak hisnen tire campagn pitch is not can be the economic sie becaus americans hate is he cononic plans cannot be emigration meri can tate is emigration plans cannot be crime mericans on't that canrally be forein policy since americans non't that all that much it is going to be you gess it dumocersis dlike m in anyth this is jobidon's entire campaignpitch he is i got every time i see him it does not matter each individual clip on the show he looks marketly older between the clipse the aging process he is aging that dude at the end of indian a jones and the last crusade ike he drank the wrong cup he tros po here is a here is jobidon talking about democracy dying that is why think thi i wa them c increase te foe im a fundamentals here that the mocracy liteear democracy his stake and and is pin auderin t institutional tructures to protect it and i think tha ther a grin real trouble i'm well that that again is only going to valie if donal trump number one is the nominy number two if he makes that the centripies of his campaign now both of those things could very well happen in fact i tars they can eighty per cent chot that both of those things happen that trump is de nominy and that asthenomeny the centerpiece of his campagn his trump because trump cannot avoid talking about trump however there is now another confound our f cae junior is now talking about running is an independent which of course he is because why would not he he is not can o get the time of day in the democratic crimaries tey're not going to allow him to run in in a broad majority of democratic crimaries he is not going to actively be on the ballat in many of these places and ta and now apparently he is going to drop his bid to challenge biden fr the democratic presidential omination and instadmounts a third party campaign for the presidency this is according to a report from mediite a cam a kenny campaigninsider says boby feels the deanc he is changing the rules to exclude his candidaeeas when intopen an run is the only way to go how much in the vot will he draw this is an open question his currently polling about fifteen per cent in the national surveyes there 's no actual good pole that shows trump bidin kendedy as a three person race however what the poles do show is the republicans view ckennedy more warmly than democrats to there is a pole from quinipiac university for example it chowse the republicans kennedy forty eight to eighteen eighteen per sent un favorable forty eight per cent favorable meanwhile for democrats the quinibiac pole shows fourteen per cent favorable fifty seven per cent unfavorable the either can be a lot of republican voters who actually shift a way from the republican to get and vote for kennedy is a third party option or more democrats likely to do now tyou can make the case either way i actually think that he is prublyc likely in the end to draw more democrat votes why beause many of the same people who kennedy in the republican party really donal trump sthere not it is not the antie trump republican to ar of ca junior there is virtually no cross over in that comalaheris special than diagram and that ven diagram does not include a lotnmetal the people who hate donal trump love are f ca junior very very small group inside the republican party however the group of people that really do not jobiden in the democratic party and th people who ar ofa junior and the democratic party that actually is a pretty sizable groups o is can draw more from republicans more from democrats my gues is in the end he will draw more from democrats than enough to put donall trump over the top theoretically it could be this is whyes he much fear on democratic csided the isle over a no labels run or cornell west or something they are afraid that cornall west might drog just enough of the black vote to hurt jobidon what about a five candidate race in which you have a no label's candidate say a jomansion and you have a a cornell west candidacy which is specificaly targeting the black community in som woke wites and then you have an ar of ca junior candidacy which is basically the burning sanders bot what what what then well all of this could chip away at jobidons lead that is presume aly one f the reasons why republicans are petty positev about our of ca junior they think that maybe he is gon a thwart jobides realect efforts that as sort of a fascinating dynamic to throw into the middle of the campaign meanwhile on the republican side of the isle the two main stream candidates who or opposing trump becaue all theother candidates on the stage are there for bleepsin giggles basically the vacromasuamias have said before is running for a senate in ohio or his running for a position an froms cabinete or he is running for podgast timscot is there no one knows why dug burgham no one knows why cris criste because he hates life miht pens because he wants to shorp is legacy but the only other two candidates there who are are serious candidates are nickee haly and rondisantis both of them had interesting weak ends over the weak end rondo santis when on bomars sho and he actually did wht e shouldhave done three months ago it is an interview where he was actually able to p ush back against left his tropes you will have a few vital moments he is aske by bilmar you on the last elections i cl you back to munchi candidates who denyd that you will bide one last election why did you do that and here is a thesancy's excellent answer but you campaigns for for election denyers in twenty twenty to this i do not forgive well lok wot the godfather harry lake who said bydnes ileginment president trumptod now she is attacking me maybe i did make a mistake there cause a she is out their saying shes ses you min to say that we mandated vacs ind florida we did the opposite we protected people even from private mandate sos tathat may have been trump lost the election ad that y why did you campaign for people because i wanted to see republicans win he racees at i gest him that er not at on youl breaker issue for you that' son democer o yol ca ble let us go back to twenty sixteen u your friends in hollywood were cutting hads telling the electoral college to to vote against tronk in in the electoro college because it was stolen they said rusha stole the election for years they said that do not act this is e ne thing in modern history of the converse and he is right about that and by e he is gtting applause from bilmar's crowd which is a typically more to the left crowd that thot's good moment for him also mar he is been clear at this a seit to bill's credit agand i know bill and friendly with bill i him he he said to an dosancas you did handle coll hi better than pre much anybody you keep wantid to get back to that and i do not blame it cause you are right we are on the sand page there and i think it is it is unfare what they did to you because you did handle it better you did handle better you were right you were let us target the people protect the people who are most vonorable and everybody else can go on with their lives a little better you open schools sooner and a lot of the stuff that is commin the information we have after now we have had a few years to look at it you were more right and they will not give the credit that wit the o your ou hitet from medo they are setting us up if this ar happened again they would repeat the same play book all over again and if we do not have accountabilyuts what is can happen i'll bring ac countability it never happened ot our country again gagan this is the stuff that de tend to shou don monsgo maybe it is solat me dis not his sad sansis is a is starting to you actually i think turn it on a little bit yin the late steages the campaign he did speeching californian whichy went directly a trump we he should have all long he ispein a the californ ia heop he can mention and he said listen down from il wa choh i turning flor to red and its true i just wish that he hadn done some of the other stuff turn other sates blue one of my residents wit her earlier saying that he turne florida red i will say is a ronald rag and made the point there is no limit to what you can do when you do not care who gets the credit ah i just wish if he was the one that turnd florido rad that he would not of torn georgia eery going up oyd be get that not in good for a at a he is exactly right about this in the case that that disnansis shuld men making all long is donald trump one nelection in tweny sixteen and he as done nothing but lose since then he is lost georgea senate rases he is lost a presidential letchon to jobiton a guss what winning is winnig and losing his losing and h's lossowat his sit his ansis seems to at least be finding som sea legs in this campaign even though we are now in the later stages of the campaign meanwhile nicky haley is also saringe get some traction first ofall houwoud be of great benefit if if the rece would par down to these threes but pear down to thoe three could get him actual datot be cana interesting right now ther are too many other candidates drawing four five two per cent for sticking around and sucking up money in attention for no apparent reason over the we kgan donall trump decided that he was going to go after nickey haley by calling her a bird brain ant he an't he has these nicnames for may i've never bee a fan of this of this stuff in i get first fvall tof very very limited group of nicknames is nowni he has tons of them the'r not super creative in fact that they are non creetive that he is now calling jobidin crooked joe after crooked hillery a now shou'd beit of aerage n ot cun ga she is wea a job adn bagger the jo an a cilen jo gricked jo i i i oki well now heis calling nicky haley bird brain quote mago or i will never go for bird brain nickey haley no loyalty plenty of lies look at this loyalty nothing drives me crazier then the absolute stupidity of a man who is unbelievably disloyal to extraordinary numbers of people including by the way genuor six protestors wart in jail because of himy not pay their legal bills he is not intervene anyway those are his biggest fans and donal trump suggesting loyalty when he has crapped on pretty much everybody who is ever work for him as his great test makes me a little a little annoyed a little annoyd just because it is ridiculous ook ate youon youon to say then nicky haley shuldn't runkish the bag handat shore youn't say that nicky haley has no busines runnin co shos in your administration in your running and and the fact is that if shos willingtissr of y an that administration and thoght is god administrationwhat she do in there o ka i get but loyalty loyalty donal trump donl trumk calling on people for loyalty is just beyond ii do not understand in anycase he treats mago or i will never go for bir brin nickey haly no loyalty plenty of lies he says for word mean nothing she even came to moro laga with her family anyway haley does not have the talent or temperaments to do the jobb y and he is going to made hrwith you an ambassadors tere's that an gevery cabinet level status i'm well then his campaign sent and this is typical of the way that the trump campaign works in other words amusing but infridibly ridiculous an an purile he is sent e bird cage tu nicky haley's doore in to moin iowa it says frum trum campaigns to bird cage wit ome birdsey because he called for bird brain at nickey haleys first of all if we are to in te test puracuse nicky verses trump i just got tell yo i do not think trump winds that i re e do not may downn from has the lot of flattering ideas about his own intelligence he is great at a great many things and a pure acutes as that two score two standard deviations above the american average i dun know ancase he his campaign sends her a bircage becuse this is the way that we campaign an american alecs fifth great school children theres been true since twenty fifteen and it really is i gan an points of annoyince rass i know some people find this endlessly entertaining i know and i know that the'l find an endlessly entertaining when donall trumpet's candidates since a wheel chair to jobidon's front door nd i'll be really funny and a'll age too an an't got when many ettisionall out in anyway he send that to nickey haly and and the way the trum campaign works is that that nicky haley then tweats that out is the afferadaof campagning this is the message waiting for me outside my hotel room hashtak pretty pathetic try again hashag you just made my case for me and tum and then the all the replies are all the replies from the trump crowd are this is justy smallet this is this is fake it is not real it is not true it goud it did not happen this way what is this nonsense it is all blofok get there is only one problem wit that ther's any one proble ith that trum's campaign literally sent the picture to mark capooto to twed out it wen from as with every trum narrative it wen from she definitely did not do that too a menit how dare you you are making that too he did do it an who as a jok pretty funny ha ha that'get guy's pick one she is it pic guing the gaslating is strong an i gat that it is all prank store bull grap and toll memari an all the rest of this but i get a certain pointion and shuldn't from congress to the presidency should never e grow up a little bit but sta little i grow the grow the fup a little bit come on y i'm nofm much timge out trump and togue out bidin who askic a child i'm talking about lorn bulbert at beetle juice i'm talking about matgates challenging cave mcarthy on the basis of what scubtling a a better deald for conservatives i'm talking about jamal bulman pulling the fire alarm or ao se toin insta grahams of herself puting her face in ice water while she jabbersabout democratic socialismly why is our class of politicois a group of five year old i do not understand i do not what maybe i do in the and i guess is the boters fault my iri today run strong my kid's got me up at five forty five in the morning and annoyed me and they are less annoying then our political class gay an other news dian fine steine died over the week end a dian finestein was of course incredibly elderly a she she died at the at a ripe old age having served in congress for several years longer than then she was fully centiens she is at nineto years old im and tim she was given the the traditional send off of the medio which was pathological worship of her record the the trumed her a centrest which is very weard since she had basically one hundred per cent voting record with jobid i've i struggle to see what exactly about her record with centeress in anyway she as a she as a far left liberal person she is in my book good fit in terms of politics she did one good thing and that t was this amazing clip of dian fine sign it is it still on my favoridepolitical clipsibale time a bunch of environments was children arrive at her office to tried her about her nvironmental record anti and she is your children get out i i a you di o yes on ta greenin i oh ye i'll tell you what we have our own greeni i ae won youo turn it arou well it' o a re turned round an year marrin can do in at te pater tef the people whor in a be living wit be wenpeople i people an o no ach interesting about this ru isi been doing i er year i know what i'm doing you come in here and you say it has to be my way or the highway i do not respond to that i got ana lected i just ran i was elected by almost a million o coraini and i know what i'm doing wrec the children joit yes lof it at is at that is bed as ousemn i i'm yet fon ferewell to dian find sign on that score aagain best wishes to her family to segreve thouron everything politically but she did dedicate three deti deckutes of her to serving the united states and nancy pblows she says she left on her own terms again that is that that is a weird way to say that she should have left the senent several years ago when she was no longer mentally functional which is obviously true thet it is heri heris nancy pluzy is yesterday you a company senator dian fine stine on her final journey home to san forlet us go aboard the miletorypline it must have been a difficult journey what was going through your mind during the flight well i was with her daughter and se wit the dian it is obviously official it is political and it is very personal this is the a woman who she left on her own terms o saw hou he answerd laricra but she did that any number of cons when collegues ar others try to whena lie her standing on an issue can i were not always on the same place from the spectrum of politics but we all cared about or country again when nancy bloshes tis stuf tad astar tobominalle bit the gilian when when we all cared about ar contrinantic plocy is as far left as its possible to be her behavior an office has been engregious on multiplications bu again went wen somebody passed away and the done alot public service than they deserve some respect for that now ons the next controversy which is gavenueson to gavenueson has to fill her seat this means that dis the second senency did he his headto fill the first one was come all a heris when she was for no reason at all exsept that she is lack woman appointed bys president of the united states by trobine im anta sheas then replaced by alec pedia who know one h never heard of and now after nine finstin has died governor gavenusom was etting pressur to fill that is eat with a black woman because obviously if comell harris was replaced by a letino man this means that the next seat has to be replaced by a black woman this is how we do staffing in democratic administrations now there is a problem he does not barbara les o barbara lee who is the prominent black a congress person running foard the seat she obviously wanted to baseleachd th inherit the seat and gavenusom did not want to intervene in that because he has had ham ship rnnig for that office nancy blowse want t atamshif in that office their bunch reather candat tor running instead he is decided to choose off the board he is long off the board and selecting a person named lafonza butler to the seat now who the hell is lafonto butler lafonsa butler is a lesbe in democratic stratigist and adviser to comala heris 's twenty twenty presidential campaign in which she was wildly successful by the way comela heris was she must havebeen such an amazing campagn adviser the comela heris had to drop out before californias who such good campaignadviser she is at the only black woman serving in the a senate according to the a p and the first openly ell g b t cu persons represent california in the chamber she leads emilee's list all she does is abortion he is also from er labor leader with esi au twenty fifteen saw iman her wild left when crenentials are well in order she is a lesbian black woman who leads in organization devoted to abortion and is a former labor leader with esyayu she also happens to notpby from california s there is that in her biography on the emileslest webs sadu sat she is from maryland shows a residente in maryland she is from maryland congratulations to maryland on getting a third senator i suppose the reasn't gavenusom did this obviously he he checks the box that says black woman he lso does not indorse barbara lees who does't have to piss off adamship in his crowd clever picke by gavenusam who definitely is not running in twenty twenty four guise he is definitely not running or hoping that jobine will simply keel over and open things up a again clever political move by by gavenusom but demonstrative once again of the fact at the way to get ahead inside the democratic partiest have some pretty excellent intersectional crenentials o kate time for some things that i and then some things that i hate things that i to day i have to say that it is musing to watchd democrats effaround and find out when it comes to emigration cathy hocal governor of new york the states being inindated with elegal emogrands for being shipd from the southern boardr because turns out lod people ross on board woitd to go to new york sheis well what might be a solution be t restrict migration oh you do not say cafy here ego it can be done this canbe done in a by pirison way comprehensive emigration formwa that spevelys wongres heopl can commit well we want them to have a limit on who can come across the border it is too open right now how people coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply thay may meet asylum and the majority of them seen banding up an the strengts of new york and that is a real problem for new york city one hundred and twenty five thousand nilly arrived in invintals and we are being tact that we are always proud of th fact that new york has the thac of liberty in our hombor harbor we we are hy of the most doverse places on earth because of our welcoming nature and ar it is at our dainada welcome imocrads but there has to be some limits than plays and congress has to put more controls at the border and not in this buge threat shut own threat talk but elimitating positions for bordor patrol while we actionly to doubleer quadruple those nubers gept back to work and do er jobs yet there is great irony to all the democrats were claiming what woa its tand thestatch of liberty look at the statch of liberty what oes it say well it is in new york and apparently gi's carried that is exciting news the york times has an entire peace today totled why we cannot why cannot we stop unauthorize migration because it works apparently it is amazing according to the newyork times responding t the sense of crisis in new york and round the nation the epartment of homeland security recently announced to d grant temporary protected status to about four hundrd seveny to thousand men is waylands allowing them eighteen months to liv in work in the united states this measure may help new york because many of the migrants there have travelled to the state from men is walup but as the orc adams point it out on the upper west side new york now also shelters magrant from all over the globe including eclador eastern europe in west africa the byd administrations decision on temporary protected status is it best a partial and fleeting solution the variations and polisy betwen administrations have had almost no effect on the number of magrants trying to enter the united states through the southern border why exactly is thits happening whele because says the neur times to everybody is very mobil also our labor markets re quir low cost labor an american consumers benefit from the low cost labor which by he way if the near times thogh about this for two seconds they might think hay may be the unions that were constantly backing are actually a problem for the cost of labor in the united states legal emigration to day is close to impossible for most people lot of people are trying to get through through the southern border and that is why ay well number one that does not answer why exactly we should not shut the border on a moral level but also it does raise the question if what you are saying is that the reasoning legal emigration is manitories because we ned lower labor costs maybe should stop acking in flationary public policy the jacks up labor cost from union policy to monitarian pysical policy to welfare programs that allow for low pay in the private secr but the nerse then subsidized by the tax payer maybe be maybe those things no nothing bueler e i guess the nurust can have to deal wat the fall up aurdigas the rest of te show continues at right nawryn noc conornimis ho

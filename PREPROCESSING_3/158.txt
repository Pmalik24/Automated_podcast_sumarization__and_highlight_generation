from dob you be easy chicago it is this american life and do mitdy won me in for iroglass my onger cousin cmill is not really a dog person but there is one dog she adored and ame was foxy because she looked exactly a fox except she was black she was the neighbors dog but she incamill seem to have a real kinship maybe because they both worn't very far from the ground camill was around four or five years old back then she had a little lisp foxy came out as foshy i thought was one of the cutest things id ever heard the way camill remembers foxy it is almost a movy her memories feel endless summer hazy and perfect a sceene shot on crackly film i just remembered the feing o be excit for going se foxy i have evag you la head of coming to the house and i can see foxy was outside i can see foxy dre the dor that leavs to the garden there is a story about camill and foxy that i think about fairly ofken i talked about it with my sister for years but never with camille and it is this once when they were playing foxy nipped t back camill nothing serious just an excited kid playing with an excited dog one minute they were playing half under the coffee table in the middle of the room and the next they wont therewas no need to go to the hospital or anything but it was enough to startle camill and to make her cry but it is what happened after that i think about the most the day after foxy nipped her camill went right back to playing with the dog but she would not go back to the place where the nip happened if her feet unthinkingly moved her towards the coffee table she would redirect she would swerve her little body around it instead of avoiding the dog she steered clear of the place when i brought this up to camil she had no memory of doing it did anybody try did he test me yead he to she in that area and egus would not ge there i me yoe e too you ooyou youre the dohe i did any one se me dow talked aby that all camill when anyy go that corner i do not know that that suggests that we were mature enough to to try and help you solve the problem i think we shouned it funny that you avoided tthe area i think we were all kind of lite watch this way it is and then we trying get ou to come around and thet we would laugh when you would not which is very cruel in hindsight i'm sorry and even more curious camill still seems to have a hard time fathoming this that foxy her beloved friend could even unwittingly hurt her twenty year she eas later she still will not let herself go there e five as you no av e can felrets ye li think ovr tat you at she fogly just ley i lok she did liy e definitely niffe yo but i love hee you doing it agat you recasting the past you no or did she she dir cause ite is we i do not remember it yofll be different iffen avoid ance with a surprisingly common reaction to information that might knock us off killed her shying away from the things we cannot wrap our minds around it self preservation the world is full of dangerous things things that might hurt us if we look too closely at them we avoid we sircumvent we choose not to go there that is i'll show to day in three acts people finding this one place in their lives they simply can access for reasons that sometimes even they do not fully understand ther just a mental keep out sign on the doog do not look do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollars stay with us we acked one could hav grown big in japan at's go cat'sga is a comedian and she is incredibly closes with her grandma being she they tolk several times a day thet together every week an and that is go makes these incredible vidios of herself dancing while her grandmother plays incidental hipe woman her grandma raised her but for a while now that is gotrik on stage that her grandmother stole her from her dad when she was little ad brought her and her mother from trapan to live in the ou es from outside she looks such a sweet on a man old asia woman u kno but she is a liar she aliar when i was a a she told me we were coming to the stage for a two months vactation i pack likely and then we never left you noya srue story yat yah and till the stay were still dealing with the kidnapping a ar ways but the truth is tat's go on we has the sketchiest idea of what really happened se does not really know how she ended up in america a family does not discuss it talking about it has been a no gosin for her in her family but recently that is g decided to find out because my family does not talk about this as a kid all i new was i was living in japan and suddenly i was not i was separated from my dad and my friends i was forced to go to school in america and learn english and start a new life i went by stacy for two months it was dawing and confusing and i blame my dad for giving up on us and leaving us in america then a'snan adult that shifted i decided my grandma was the bad gy shes stole me away fror my dad and he was the victim but i never asked anybody the hard questions to find out the actual truth it was way easier to just talk about it on stage when nobody could fight you on whether it is real or not that is why i love stand up nobody talks back to you it is good for people who do not want across his feelings and then my dad had a stroke he survived it and is recovering but it was kind of e wace up call and mi really done i never ask what happened with my move to the united states me it was the biggest even in my life it completely changed everything time to get answers whas i kidnap what really happen a in orting as as i oh grandma o i started with my grandmathe perpetrater and confronted her face to face she and my mam lived just twenty minutes away did you kidnap me did you kidnap me that is what i tell audiences when i perform i say ya my grandma pretty much kidnap me bon jahl it is only wes sota was tofance youn in that she is saing and mander an there is no such thing i did not kidnapyou yofll do in ban yat ye couldan tao na yel go long tat those out kin when people kidnap a child they demand money ransom to re turn the child but we did not asked for that it does not count as kidnaping that is on y me te it was somethan y o i she dn't aske for ransom she is still a kidnaper she is just bad at it she took a id to raise for free can youou imagine trunnin neg otiate with the kidnepper and you are please how much money do you want i just want my kid back and te lik oh kno it is all me free in fact i'll take her to elay for you i think she is going to be a star i'm glad my grandma and i can joke about these things to day we sat on my couch in her living rooms we i told her i think our family has a habit of not speaking about difficult things woman the casi good i think see you eda she gas o wid jon tuli do not she as we talk my mamma interrupts us from the top of the stairs my mamm is with her o ca mashe is asking my grandmother to please not talk about these sad things it will effect how i see my life bles e wa wan a it will not i asked her i yelled mdo not sant she says try not to talk about anyething too sad e ary it is good to talk about the past my mamm goes back to her room a big reason why we do not talk about things is because of my mam she has paronoid skits aphrania and talking bout sad things can trigger bad memories and the voices in her head any time we want ta talk about the past we have to tiptoe round her we whisper were just avoid it completely and that is how our family has always done things we did not even talk about how my mamm has kets o phrania as a kid my grandma would just say oh your mamm just has little blood sugar she is hungry when she was clearly wilding out throwing plates at grandma it is a she needs professional help not bread n i was eager to hear my dad side of this for starters when they divorced did he have custody of me because if he did this seems o way more a real kidnapping and did he even know that my grandma was taking me to the uest we talk once a month we re connected when i was fifteen i fluted japan to see him we just came from my dads house now we are a my elementary school thisis where we meme woe stool whe my dad and i see each other we try to do as much as we can he is up for anything getting on a big pink dog seasaw with me at the playground to shoot a little tidio we leta e thinwe never eeter ery a fa a ha ha h hha i have all these memories of what it was to live with my dad i'd stay up and welcome him home from work he would make insent japanese curry out of a bag for me then he would lay on his side on the floor and watched an us before bed time i would lay beside him copping his pose i wanted to be him we walk across the street fror my old elementary school to an old apartment building if i there is a period i lived here in japan with my mamma and grandma separated from my dat me my mamma grandma li li ther tif you knew was ours in fact i's crazy a a a a bo o a a a a e too o o yo hungry really sometimes he wu get trun in jis roug of a hundred o o o a i did't know tha o because e ne me why he mo yo you ta that a a a o a i mes yo all the time my lovey a s omuch di mos o we had across the street full of sad stories but i guess i have to fee a drank ori after i came to the uess there were seven years when my dad and i did not see each other he wrote me letters but after a while i could not read them any more because my japanese had gotten bad it made me too sad to know we could not really communicate any more i stopped writing him back then when i was fifteen i asked him to come visit and we been talking ever since but it is never been the same as when i used to lay next to him on the floor now i set him down to do an interview in my hotel groom in telka yo goi had not interpreter helpless sore conversation my sound more formal than usual we are very japanese and a stranger will do that to us but it also helped us not cry as much which is really cool and also very japanese when you and mam separated what was the arrangement for how mucge you would see me what was the custody situation i'm curious about that she guly mal us your i hav costody to eande who whoa oe togou no mody n japan when a husband ban wich siperage but matha o mody get cstody but when we separated you mamm had a mental ilness i thought we mam be able to take kilb o ka to gil de gi te she by ga te be itso because i was worried alike that was i elybritly got costody ofyou at's omue gi toye mus which means i was kinnpt it is a kinnaping i told you i was but why did my grandma kitn at me and why did not he stop it before i get to his answer i should probably explain a little about his relationship with my mam and how unusual it is this is the part of the story i knew before i fludet japan my mamma dad met through the speed dating event in japan that my grandma sign my mamma up for she worried my mamm was getting older and decided she was going have to step in if my mamm was ever gon a find someone she and my mamm were an ti wants they fluted toket for the event yat both of them my grandma has to tage long to everything that way she can make sure everything's perfect that is where my parents met after just a few days they got married and it was great for a bit or my dad has told me i'm fortunately for me my parents both say there connection had a lot to do with lust we jus cool i think every one should experienced that in their lives and homestly talking about sexes the only time i've ever see my mamrearly liht up it is conno sweet actually she told me did go to poren theatres together and would make love listening to elves and when they would get into fights my mam would accuse my dad of only wanting her for her body gross i know and then theyd do it even more i'm surprise i do not have siblings i mean i do but there for my dad's previous marriage and that is who my mam moved in with she became a set mamm to a boy in a girl and i got pretty bad i mean my mamm did not know anybody in japan she had no friends she did not speak the language she never even dated any one before my dad then to have to suddenly move in with a family and try to fit in it was too much my mam would get jealous whenever my dad paid a tention to my haf siblings over her my dad told me she would throw things at them and get wildly abusive one time on my sister's birthday when she had her friends over my mamm came home and lost it at the side of the party she threw my sisters take across the room kicke all her friends out and then started pulling my sister's hair until my dad stopped

something will work out it has to for years she supported her kits by teaching english and time wan wi thought really speaking english it was just another one of the scamp she pulled with a smile on

thet that is in a minute from chicago public radia when our programm continues it is this american life i'm been mading won meen sitting ng for iroglas to day's programe the one place i cannot go all about the mental road blocks that people set up to keep them from engaging with gorny ishes we have arrived at ac to or a sho at to killing me softly my colleaguin my orgegi he has a tale about something he avoid at all costs even though it seems to follow him everywhere he goes it is been this for years here is im manuel what i am about to tell you is not some funny story i tell at parties in fact i do not really talk about it at all then i do not talk about is a song i do not talk about it because for over ten years any time i listened to sing hum or even think about it it get stuck in my head and when that happens bad things happened to me often immediately i lost keys wallet mi as security card after listen to this song i lost a relationship once got dumped after it played in a coffee shop i was in i not a superstitious person but i truly believe it is the ultimate bad luck for me i right before i sat down to write this no joke i m in sure to renew my wrenter's assurance just in case i plants how seriously i take the song the first time i heard it i was a freshman in college you do suggested it to me during a morning study session for a midturm i had lay in that day i menber listeng to it and feeling happy i was having a great day and the song was my sound track i member f that feeling staying with me for hours hearing the song in my head as i took the midter it was still playing in my head a few days later when i got results back and saw that i failed ind the time i did not blame the song i was toslike well that is why i get for taking a class about black holes i moved on in fact i added the song to a long playlist i had a few weeks later when i was listeing to music in middleof the day after some classes the song played and i fell asleep while listening slet through a workshift i had and got fired for the firstan only time in my life i just need more sleep i told myself it is a coincidence but then months later the next time the song came on i found myself feeling readly on edge i fought about skipping it but just as quickly i also for that is ridiculous i kept the song plain later that day after a concert band rehearsal i put my back back down to help a friend mooson chairs and somebody stole it presumably for the lap top inside i went the rest of the surmester without personal computer i w'll shreeked out how in horemoovis theres always that moment where the happy couple finally realized they might not have booked a great week an get away at a cabin after all and tat thevibes are most definitely off that is what it felt after that even tnough i knew it was not rational i tried to avoid the song but it did not work the only bike accident i've ever been in happened after i heard it being played by a passing car one time it came on during a long road trip and the next time i stopped i noticed a nail in one of my tires when i was preparing to run my first maraphon i was putting together a plailess and my phown played a bit of the song before i could turn it off few hours later my sister called me and told me e manual our parents are getting divorsed the next morning i forgot to bring my head fons to the race and for the nearly five hours it took me to run tamaraphon all i could think about when my parents their marriage and that song which happens to be a sappy love song endlessly leeping in my head tooi know all of thi sounds illusion on a couple of years ago i tried to convince myself once and for ll that the song was just a song but it back fires spectacularly i decided to play every day for a month i wake up play the song and then walk around the rest of the day telling myself not to worry when nothing bad happened for three days i felt relieved i then on the fourth day i suffered a freek rist injury which plagued me for nine months to make matters worse because i'd played it much spot if i kept pushing me the song i ther months after te accident because it for i wanted to hear it that year was by far the worse your of my twenties my hair which until that point was decently robur started falling out aggressively mi long time fimelly cat thiad i went for a massiv break up my professional life was unmers i got covid write before christmas i spent my first ever christmas completely alone and it pushd me to do something i should have done years earlier i added for group that sings tha song to my do not play list on spodify which is a shame because i really the song it is good with a capital j it is one of those aranby disgobaters from the seven ies that is ridiculously happy positive it makes you wonder if the seventes were the most optimistic amorcas hav ever been or if things were actually soblaku artis had to make songs this ong t a know i will not be playing with the song or naming it is poison to me a skeptical friend of mine pointed out that yes bad things happen when i hear the song but do not bad things happened to all of us all the time maybe i just noticed them when the song plays he suggested i tried to keep track of every unfortunate event i encounter without the song i could see once and for all fells nothing to this dso i did it i listed every tiny thing over a course of a couple of weeks and i wam surprised by how many there were even if they were small i cut myself on a metal can accidentally got bleach or one of my favourite teashets got into a never ending back and forth ith my health insurance over almost twenty claims for did not want to pay i spent half of the family wedding in that yare because a guest passt our of at reception i know i am supposed to look at that list and feel freed he will finally able to listen to that song whenever i wonth but an do not judge me all it did was convinced me that lowsy stuff happens to me a loth why would i resplaying this song and making it worse i have nothing else this in my life i do not believe in astrology i do not believe in luck i do not believe that misfortune is got punishing you for your bad to you i know it is entirely possibly abat when i hear that june i freek out in a way that causes unpleasant things to happened n but this i believe i have to stay away from the song mine

bags and she is constantly saying things bouts what she said i most queer books thi's barely any sax or romance wore making out the words gay las being queer and ever even show up people are queer but it is more ther personalities ther humor it is just understood and a'll just say i'm sure these books are not for everyone but i love them ireare the first book one summer a few years ago i was on vacation with a few friends and we all got poldins who had th sane time and was we all just fell into this kind of imaginary space that tenson had created kind of youthful and very gay in a fun rather thn a pressive way whit tenson says as exactly what she would hoped for semson says she wrote this book for her seventeen yoarld self he really coul have yused books som worlds this pack thad just ways to bea queer that would inherently sad the very man stream ill ubecut stuff it was miserable and i was already miserable because if i wanted to read gay letrita at the time it was always my sad coming out som and yet ii did not want to read my said coming out somme for the inteont time id ridted it was good a fist fifty times what i really wanted was a big sit piece sight i wa tid e to read about girls doing big sit piece fights i mean that was the ear of the matrics and itll it is golden superige honcon congfosinima and oll i did was imagine big confuflets you might tamson ende t dropping out of high school sjus as she was not a good student she been put in the class for the quot stupid kids she said shes spent most of high school dying her hair shaving it ways nobody sitting in the back of the class her eyes clazed over say dreaming about big marshal arts fights she came out an high school in a small conservative new zealand suburb a different era and one of my bistranes tu talking to me immediately and you i do not even blame her i think a lot of people forget how dangerous and grotaste to being gay was presainted back at the time she is bullied beaten up in to escape she ot stories but shes not such a surprise given where she was hanging out on line it' the place shes stumbled o when she was about eleven mi dat had been openit was that connected with old school in to da and the instant of nineteen ninety six was just a wiold fronter that was cawboy charactery anything was happeniy and i tosen ten o icis alof seemoon oh go en i sy tu and tok about and wolso gog oils and i found fanfiction and i did not tat fanfiction a whole world of people epqually obsessd with stories and sipi to the point they were going on mine to write their own versions of the stories they lovet axfiles sort of the rangs they fix the things thi feel the author got wrong there is tims of shipping that is people deciding which characters should have ended up together and rewriting it that they do none of this is for money for the most part its just for fun tamson was jus akid but she starts publishing stories there seff she never wouldhave taken to school it is the first place se ever published anything the first place she ever really showed any one her work an i think one of the reasons i go into it initially was because it felt a legal and faintly noughty fanfiction sficially bak thing was the dockwib for neds you read a story and the oathas note immediately says please do not me it is pnk for dolks punk for dorks in other words her people a loof people think of fanfic as low brow embarrassing a lot o big siphi fanasy writers slam it tgeorge ar martin who wrote gamathrones as said it is copy witin frenchman a violation of in ellectual property and wrice who wrote interview with the vampire has famously oejected people writing fic about her stories because who would not want a ship rad pit and tom crus there are some writers who tamson write fick before going main stream bonce they make gat main stream they might to leat their accounts to leat all the things they wrote premain stream days not tamson tamson still loves these worlds en the first book in the series came out getty in the night it was a big deal nominade for the bickessi file words arview in the new york times called it maticulous and moody ponted bi difficult and complex feelings in a wasted universe and at all this excitementabout the book tamson heard about some buzs from the place where she would always felt comfortable one of the main fanfiction sights io three or arkive of our own one day she saw something she would never seen before keople as sart writing fanfic about her work and i think i they were eight fan fix and i wasli oh oh i've on feeling little different emotions and i have to run away wrihte now i cannot look at even whath these titles o why inherently stauting out ain fanfiction that you ill not allow to read it if it is for your own cration what are the reasons i think one of the man things is tat you worry if you read fanfiction and in you write anything that maymac anything that somebody is written about your property you jiscommitted a huge codleson against your in fandom you just stole candy from the world's mistemportant baby ripped off your own fans you al scom even if you had not mea to there is no way that you can prove that you did not nickelf sobody else's ideas tamsons as the writers in general are told pretty firmly to not read fanfic about their work there needs to be no question of where their ideas come from liy earlier this year a famfic writers the tolkin estate and amason studios for two hundred fifty million dollars a lodging made ripped off his story line for the lord of the ringsprigwl the told can trast counter suit for copy wright in frenchment if you look up tamson's work on the big fixsites to day there are thousands of enturies people writing and eracting playing around in the world of the loc tone tamson cannot participate in any of it nand it kills her because again is are her people and now that it is about her own books even more her peoplet not only do they the same books but they are devoted to her characters her humor the entire fantastical syfe by universe that lives in her head the people who loved it ot a custom made group of people who could not possibly have interests more tailor to tamson's own brain all melling around in one spotd you have questions about wite's going on and o many i want to know everything nno i i want you nokas hos fandom is deeply about shipting you knowhose faces you waunt to make mush to give that i a sitting reading bok wood be who wuldyou want to make mush come on who you make in kiss i when i figoure it out and in

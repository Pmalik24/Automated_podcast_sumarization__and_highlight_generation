a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the shou if you prefer a beepe version you can find that at our websight this american life dotowork this dis storing my mam us to to tell myos ister randy was eight or when this happened it' thin hame a bit do school that randy did not understand and she came home and she asked my mam where do babies come from and my mam just felt greatnes as great she is bring this up on her own i dn't hove to sit her down in some awkward birds and bees conversation some day we can get this at of the way now when she is young and she is really excited to tell her the stuffin she explains the whole thing right where babies come from what sex is and the way my mammois es tell the story she shaid tat she felt i am doing such a good job here i am such a good mam to day lhad a the end of it she asked randy okas that is everything you have any questions and then randy pauses for a long moment an she ask co birds areally fy and my mamoryalizes of course oh she was not ready she absorbed nothing ian sure enough a year passes and randy comes back to her i do not remember why and asked her again where do babies come from and it is the first time never happened she remember none of it and i think of that story sometimes when therre debates over what is suitable for children i thnk there is a whole category of things that kids protect themselves from they jus do not won or en gage o that stuff at dolts do not need to keep them from it bu then there is other stuff stuff that doese seep into the world that they take to hart and they mull about and they make part of themselves and the thinkg i's difficult is that it can be really hard to predict what those thing you gang t be what a day in our programme things that kids here things they see things that happened to them that affact them in ways that they only understand later as dolts friend sends what it means to give little black kids toys that celebrate the confederacy what a drag tean age boys into the desert to watch tomic bombs go off what a bring your kide to work when your work in vaves breaking the law id even quantify exactly what that does to a person what a day we tri to figure that out deveryudy easy chicago is this american life i mare a glass they with us tat one stars and bars and bars we got the idea for this week show from this thing hat happenedto one of our producers near drumming av realization that he came to in a delthood about a tvshow that he watched is a kid here is now the hithievos show the dukes of hazard ran from nineteen seventy nine to nineteen eighty five it star john snider and tom boll pat this boan look duke to rakis good old boys tron to stay n the right side of the law and rorald georgia but if you ask any man my age who was a fan of the show the dukop hazards true star was a bright orange nineteen sixty nine dodge charger nicnamed the generally every week on se bes the generally would roar through country back roads leaping over virtually everything the fine laws of physics and blowing little boys mines across america ad generally in what i match boxoo at a straight up the plassic geroka a big size tha big silo what eve go ar traveling a dan to is foot get angry i that is that that is this is one of my favorite rappers breate bruin kes from the bronc me he watchd the dukes of hazard faithfully as a boy we both had dukes of hazard once boxes and we were both proud on ers of maniature versions o the generally back then it was probly one of the most coveted toys any kid in either of our neighborhoods could possess i remembere a bully of the neighbohood stole mine tro to pretendy was his i er a is min ri i noentli tha the generally was remarkable not just because it was both fast and furious before that was a thing but because this roof top was em blazon with the confederate flag as kids black kids pushing our many american muscle along the carpets an concrete of new york city heither breeze nor i saw anything bothers him about that bold symbol up top in fact for us at the time the rubal flag was just part of what made the car damp cool there was a kid in my neighborhood irish kid i he had i orange dodge challenge of full forty no flag on the top imember lot of as tham e but he need a thought a flag as a wat a real coas a to no ye drok i you heard im comeit out obliges lik tat cal would be dough a call be do if he had that flag on that batp i got the idea of talk to breeze about this because in two thousand in one as part of his group the jugonats he wrote and released tha song called generally e spell the adverb but a play on the name of the duke's prized racor doft remember exactly when i heard the son but by than had been over fifteen years since the duces of hasar on up the air i hadnt though about the show where the car and age ei a wasingut old poys a me wiso a pretty sure that when i was in my twenties and heard generally but that was the first time i put toento together and realized await one my favourite torys groing up actually borne on abastion of frunt to my humanity and freedom the flag on the roof i he helded i m is that listening to the song again recently i thought maybe was about breeze himself coming to that same realization we are the same age after all but one he and i meant to talk about it breet said he would recognized the inherent put down in the generalles paint job by the time he was in high school he was actually inspirdor i generally a few years later after he had kids of his own one day he took them on a shopping trip i was literally intoys of us probably on gunhil road ner coobsity oll the an a yonkers or send you lave and kids losan ish looking for soys and me questionin was up with these toys and then i see the generally the iconic roadster was back fon the shelves being pushed on a new generation to promote some teevy movy relauch doyou remember what the sontye you defn he tan me through it you will not bos yeo manis tog forty three he do me that he that hy survoven be seeming slimmin screaming women o the sound be mor noyin the thing i love about breeze is that he writes these dense clever impressionistic grimes that sound words tumbling downstairs in this first verse he is telling the story of that trip to twis a ras building the scene of a frustrated parent overwhelmed by toys and demanding children baging oll hes wak toys chon a lack nois peeceand quiet seece o riet constructively then what i see the generally and i said what i i needto explore this idea why did they think that was o kat why did he think that that they could show this image an and and make us champion that image why is it od kay to make i will pan this pop i ca whi was it o kake i just wanted to attacki

bird died when his head and arm were severed from his body the white's e premisis who sported various not seeing confederate symbols dumped bird's mutilated body near a black church this atrocity was

generally not much for the thing itself before what it represents for me a time before i could possibly recognize the insidiousness of its design before i really understood its origons or held that history is shape in the people i care about tact woun all i really had to worry about was who hav the choolest or in the block nea domi these days you work sat our sister company serial making podcast

for whites tudents to go to avoid integration htown gave it the name robert eleas away to give the finger to the civi rits movement school prided itself on having this mass of confederate flag ut legely the second largest confederate flag in the world took twenty people to carry it then i the nineteen seventies the court sorded the town to intigrate the high school these days sixty percent of the school was black and witeno them entier it is still referred to is the white high school when the nouce e name of the school at the beginning of games gerl and says she jus kind of blockset out

stature robert yl was removed just this week an richmon but for all this omemoration of white experience of life in the south before and during the civil war i's actually not that much out their memorializing the black experience one o the few boices is in baltimore ive to say i was surprised to honor was there i grew up in baltimore and oca this came into e distance after i mifdway but i'm back in baltimore regularly to se family theugh never heard of it to b a parker who was a producer at our programme and who also grew up baltimore not far from wore i grew ub tell me about it here she his every black get in baltimore knows this place most was went there on field trips when we were in school owere taken there by an earnest parent its call the national great black in lacx museum that is great black and they are rendered in wack it is the first black history wack museum in the country i first went there on a field trip in the third grat it for better worse it is men stuck in my memory ever since to be honest i scared the shid at amy it is violent and graphic and unlike any other museum i've ever been to and as mainclien tell was children even to day i can talk to anybody who grow at black and in baltimore and if you bring up the black and lack wull be ye that was mess at bright tectin with friends an family about this last weet i got messages i had nightmares and i started to teer up and i can still see to my head i want to go back to the museum the seefools as bad as i remember there is the crowd o people from las coming in there is a cuplic kits it is allwon back there recently with my colleague shon cour the museum itself is an old fire station and three row houses fused into one building in the lobby the wlax figures of to boys and cottagy woidson are there to greet yeu next to the taket booth is the figure of the great military general hannibl writing a massive elephant and up overhead i's the first black female pilot tat sy cornal iadiny incis as a erplane above us there i in abat as a cool chickin it with e shades on ha she 's taken no one's mess the lobby's all inspiring in stuff ithen you by a ticket and actually into the museum the everything changes a quick warning i's a lot of violence of all sorts in what follows it might not be for every one when he sev inside the museum it is dark immediately to the right there is a wacx figure of a slate he is on his knees this teeth knocked out and he is being held down by two white slavers who polishid bacth they have shoved a long funnel into his mouth and our porn gruel through it forse feeding it brown rle spills out of his mouth is nact of rebellion some slaves would not eat the slave is made them this is the very first thing you see and then to the left is one of the museum signature attractians i said he wonto go into the slaveship they' built the fact somiay of a slaveship and to the museum it is not that bit bout the side of a large trailer but when i was eight it seemed enormous back then walking down to the hold below was walking onton amusement parkride one of the opposite of fun at the entrance there wre two white wax slave merchans both compackably dresse one saids behind to des it used to be that when you stepped on to the stairs of recorting with play one of the merchant announcing new load a slaves com n aboard now at eight i understood they ment me i was i to be an yeu slave i burst into tearsd at first i refuse to go all the way down ito the ship but the other kids did it itso i did it too and what i saw when i got to the botom of the steps as what i was seen now another vicious looking white man and he is branding a slave woman who has a chain around her neck and placing the brain on her shoulder as she is fully newed and covered and blid cheise its pure agonies on her face and he looks keys full of hate and anger and is just ready to tortuut somewone not of this is chased those collections on shelves ofs portbodies body by rats that should be noted this one under below that is this emembered in being eaten by rats the museum goes for an intense realism it does not leave anything out it is over the top and away that is almost campy this probly because the wax figures all th wre main in the nineteen seventies the slaves have mutton chots the feew of the slaves looking white there from good times an from routs but the scenes are always based on doccumented atrocities at a certain point in the slaveship i turnd around and i see the entire wall behind me is one huge mirror it did i see the chained up slaves and i'm forced to look at myself and it comes home to me in an instantthat these people on my ancestors bithout the torture without the sorrow without the misery that the endur during the middle passage there would be no nee what he remember from when you were kid a seen this i remember being confused i an being scared the fact that it is someone whose my my skin my you do not have the language for it but it is a a paus in reflect and yo eyes grow wide ye turning to understand whet it means omsie is got distracted by them trying to shove the guy anot ands what what no bes on tegroundrailroad i's a fakofin o tire was not exhibit behind shon of a white man helping is runaway slave escaped through an oven with a door in the back allowing him the slipped through from one house to another and another as i kid it was not i was un familiar with black history bt he third grate id already been to the plantation in woth carolina where my ancestors were sold i subsessed with thergod marshal i wanted to beat him i wanted to marry him everything and may elementary school me such a bi deal abon martluther king every year at it once got to play one o coediscot king's bride's maids an an assembly but it was exactly that the elementary school version of black hes ruw doctor ame nilson mandella rose pari the colloring book of greatesfets not the brutal reality but none of this compairs what you see in the museums baseman the baseman is intense that the museum has posed to design outside of it woring that you should not go into it until you re ad least twelve under sixteen neata shaperon we hi it there passe henry box brown the sleeve who mailed himself to freedom in a box hen i was a kid et bop out in wave but his startled too many kids and they do not do that any more we walked past henry to the top of the basement stairs a sal wer ong to go downstairs to im the the lunching exhibit i did not see the luncheon exhibit when i was eight i sauht on a second field trip when i was a freshmen in high school i son thick i was ready o thick i was ready now he start off wen youare still walking down the stairs with a storical photos and newspaper clippings of actual lunchings as recent as nineteen ninety eight black people hanging from trees sett on fire dragged by trucks follows of the ded surrounded by crowds of white spectators all decked out in their sunday best smiling little girls with h ribbons in their hair looking at the camera some with pride a man haning from a tree behind them then at the bottom of the stairs as soon as you round the corner a ye an you men on sling god go men to describe what is happening here in front of us was a husband and wife named hayes and marry turner they lived in georgia back in nineteen eighteen a local black man had killed the plantation owner i when the sheriff's office went haunting for the killer they an a mob lunched practically every other black man in their path hays turner was one of the casualties in that massacre a warning the kits especially grafic just as i was about to describe what happend next to shine the museums educator amonnie haines walked in and i was grateful she did because she took over he had nothing to do with the situation and unfortunately he was lynched afterwards he was casrated what your theng in this scheme in m exhibit is turner n lynched om he is wearing overalls and we have his overalled opened up in is private regon blood dripping down next to haze is his wife marry after he was lynched mary bravely went seeking justice for her husband she was eight much pragnet at the time they lunched her to in the museum exhibit she is hanging from the neck but in real life they actually hanged her by her feet settle on fire slached her stomac open and pulled out her baby which was still alive that is whats depicted in wax then they stoppe but it is hid the sat on the wall adds to the story that haunted me it is all slowly part that historians cannot fully verifive it reads walter wife describing the lunching of marry turner and her husband hayes turner depicted in the sene said that it was too harrible to describe the mab taking the time to sow two cats an missus turner's stomach in making bets as to which one would climb out first till left of the turner's bodies is a mantel piece with souvenir jars sometimes the lunches would keep pieces of their victims in these jars ar were supposed to be the ears locks of hair and genitalia of black people all next to kids base ball trophy i'm not shure why that tair except to underscore the point that these body parttured trophies too is it diffic ull room to process when i saw this at fourteen some my class mates to even know how to react a few of om stoic others ockuilly toflacting with yo i member feeling angry because you couldn' escape it they rsigns round the room that anticipate your distress they say i dentify with the victims and martyrs and never forget them but do not o biter or despondent over what they endured tdoctor joann martin found at the museum with her husband elmer and nineteeneighty three and when i told her all the kids an my thery greeed were crying and freeking out and holdin hands ishe was fully aware that happens in fact its intentional for me that is that is the pont when they leave shaken when they leave crying and tha's often on the the reaction i have no proglem with those teares and it is what people ar going to talk about on years later is going to be our slaveship and ted one to say i never forget your linching exhibit oh and everything else it sems a movy if you do not if you do not haver sense of exactly what people wore fighting agancs if youthing that rolls a parks the what she did had something to do with the seed on the bus and you do not understand that that et was i i'm going to get her jald but it could ave got in her mitch is well when joanne and her husband found at the museum they self to create something they wished existed in the world a museum that celebrated and preserved black history created by black people four black people an a majority black city they were a professors at istorcly black universities in baltimore elmor at morgan state an joannat copin but they wanted to reach more than just the academic class when they visited a wax museum an saint augustine florda they thought yah wax fingers that is the way to go they had money save for a house but instaid wat towards blacx figures it still was not enough wax figures are absurdly expensive forty five hundred dollars then but tens of thousands of dollars now meaved up with their first four black history figures frargi douglas john brown nat turner in maymac lad butoon elmor and joanne would tore round with their qarts at lac figures at different schools an churches and expos we just would take e figures om set tem u as exhibits throf the min to back porniet take them back home to our too bid room apartment and if you looke into the gest bed room abo or too bed room abartmet you would a an marrymac tat with them say it on the dress er in i every that wit is part sogr in ther corner an ted to for and i just gave in in o te mad am marrymac ta with the has gat to go you getar ther place for mery mcclav with them doctor martin told me they are thinkeing of expanding the museum and making it more child friendly toing down the violence which surprise me it does not see hermission at all they were only make sense if our history were a little more child friendly which definally is not the four little girls kill of the nineteen sixty three church bommbing an alabama they were all fourteen an younger the kids who marchd on bremmingham children's crusade were beaten in a dogstit on them they were as young is twelve an nem it till was fourteen he as

a large lod of mariwuina and headed north i had heard the stories you some of the tactics of smuggling by this point but it did not make the connextion that mam and i were driving ahead of dad to make sure the custom station was closed and if it happened to be yopen we were supposed to turn back and warn him this was back at the nineteen eighties wefore the patriotact and there were two you was customs check points blocking the migration of drugs fruit people reptiles and parrots on the roads between the united states and mexico both about one hundred miles north of the mexican border at highway choke points the station on highway seventy seven and sereda was the busier and the better financs the check point in hebronvilleeu was an urse treame trailer with an attached carport to protect the agents from the sun and it would often close from breakfast for lunch we were headed towards that one this morning going north on highway to what he won driving through the scenery of asmatic plants and stunto trees the car is hot nowhere conditionn my mamm and i are saying nothing to one another we have each decided that the other is unworthy of conversation we stare at the windows and think very different things mam is thinking about the hundred dollars she and dad at spet before six ofclock that morning one hundred dollars that would help them make twoth asa nolege if things went right bhecause her first stop on the fill in the excursion was to dad's gudondetta whom we knew as lasignota dats personal whitch doctor for an emergency session they were let right through at five in the morning and they had only one burning question will the check point be open after years of sitting through dhecessions with my grandmother i did not have to be there to know exactly how it went in the gudandetta's office a signona is older matronly dresses in the thin frock with her hair pulled back in a bun she has my parents sit across from her desk in a black leather love seat with crome handles a panoranma phodos hang around her office some wallet us eze others larger and in portrait a pencil sketch of a camaro by one of her grandsons hangs nexts to a window she listens closely to their question nodding sleepily at the preoccupation sympathizing understanding they have reached a decision and the cannot turn back they tell her they knew to do it no other choice any more she stands up abruptly and walks behind her desk which has clutter wich heets of nope of paper crawling with ink illegible notes names the people sets of criptic numbers home addresses of saints she closes her eyes and scribbles something on her yellow legal pack nonsense to any one else reading it on her desk are two cheap leaded crystal bottles each filled herh the clear liquid she gently reaches for her matching shoklass and lifts it to the light making it sparkle she places the glass on the surface before her and pors from one botter then the other when the two clear liquids mix they turn a deep crimson and thickene plasma she nods her head as if her suspicions have been confirmed she produces a glass orb filled with water sitting on a black plastic ring she sits up straight closes her eyes and regulacs her breathing into a loud rithmic inholation exholation that unconsciously forces mam and dad to do the same after a few seconds she opens her eyes suddenly and strikes the glass orb with a metal wand making it ring in the clear morning air then she lifts the orb be tween her two pudgy hands and stares deeply into the inverted image of the room around it sitting opposite this chicanery and watching everything she does youre drawn to the rita and you cannot help u try to figur it out too no she says with certainty the checkar er not be open this morninggo in peace god me with you when mom and i reach a check point at eleven forty five that morning it is very much open for business a line of cars five deep stretches back from the underbudgeded airstreame trailer our job now is to go through and then turnd back around and reported dad that is doom was indeed imminent mam is visibly shaken she turns off the radio with a hard click and considers this considers her options from the car we can see a skinny middle aged white guy ind green border patrol garb sitting on a reclining chair and the open doorway of the air streme trailer he s facing the cars as they pass under the tin roof it must have been a hundred ten degrees inside the trailer a hundred in the shade from his position never bothering to get up the agent sits founding himself with the newspaper and sleepily peers into the cars asking if every one is in american citizen waiting for an accented answer smiling and then waving them through a sympathetic priest granching absolution hi we all going to today asks the skinny little man mam's window is now only half way open and in her nervousness she rolls it all the way up hi sorry i mean sanantonio as she opens the window yall american citizens yes she says and she leans back he counld get a clear look at me nodding my head i do not say anything except the quiet yet when i nodd but he has not heard me there is an uncomfortable pause i think because there supposed to hear your accent there is an anxious beet and he still has not let us go when i say yes i am a bit too enthusiastically mam laughs nervously she had been hoping our light skin would exonerate us without a problem you will have a nice day he says he has not noticed anything owkward we drive through and i feel her seethed for the next few miles that was about noon somewhore behind us at a road side rest stop dad and my older brother dad are waiting in dad's tract or trailer which is attached to the trailer with the marjana the two center ibiams that ren the length of the trailer make perfect housing once he welle metal plates all along the underside and at the tale end it creates a long rictangular box sealed at the rear end with the axcel of the rig where twenty forty pound blocks of marjuana can be hidden this is went down and down or cang o i wondered dimly if dan his figured out what heis doing out here on the road north when you should be in high school but dan has always been more street pises much savier than me i figure that if i figured it out heed a figured doutmon mom and i drive on to abenville i'm de highdrated i want to stop at a store we cannot she says to me we have to turn back i think whe're behind still i'm hungry and really thirsty i persest certainly we have time to get tor convenient store the cannot have scedul disting to hinge on a few minutes certainly they have devised this more cleverly than that please i plead just stop at the seven eleven grudgingly she polotes the noisy car around the small town and finds a convenient store i get out with he couple of dollars and come up short when i try paying for some donuts an a chocolate milk i returned to the car for more money just get in she ells and i do leaving the food of the counter maom wips the car around and un intriling wuse to it by na we travel that for a few minutes and when the check point is back in sight we hold our breath the guy will not see us and right then we see dad and dad and the trailor heading right for the check point dad had become nervous or may be brave or maybe he was blinded by his hundred dollar faith in uts goud ondetta and ha charged forth without waiting for monser poirt oh god my mother says and all the blood drains from my face from just ta tone in her poice i had never heard her voice charged with fear oh god she says again with her left hand she grabs the knob the controls he headlights and flashes at dad whoas only a few hundred feet from the check point she flashis for times and clear view of any one who is paying attention i wonder if that is her signal that the check what is open ut question the wisdom of doing it while he is next in line in full view of the guy a the check point were he to look over his shoulder and see the noisy southbone car that just drove through not thirty minutes before she slows down sos terrifically down going less than twenty miles per hour on the highway and for a moment i can see dad his triving i can see that the blood his drain from his face too making his eyebrows stand out a rich black on his pallid deathly white forehead a mask of some one pre tending desperately that everything is a o kay but doing it herrifically badly i see dan in the passenger seat holding onde the hand rail above the door as hit means to steady himself to this crazines through the stupid unnecessary risk and he looks calm collected uncarring he is not there there are no cars ahead of them now the trailer is next in line it is lose to a crawl and i cound see dad desperately trying to ignore the crazy flashing noisy boniville rattling through the south bound lane keeping his eyes fixed to the road pretending he is not smuggling anything in the empty trailer behind him this empty useless trailer with the eyebeams all sealed up with the two mexican men driving it with no obvious destination no paper work no affiliation with any hauling or trucking company no sir not trafficing andrugs just driving through to huston probably looking for work oh yes we are american citizens that is not what we are nervous we coand prove that that is nothing we are nervous because of the pot we are hiding and because we are only getting two thousand dollars for risking upwards of ten years in prison is not that funny is not that just hysterical but the skinny whike eye is having lunch an campy vathered and one of the weirder moments of this hold o bocle the bondeville the air stream and dad's tractor rline dutlike some cosmanen vent and we see the skinny border patrolagiont with an white napkin to under his chin and dad's bloodless face up in the trailer through the window of the air stream as the agent waves thim through with a fork tlike his conducting an orchestra go on through go n through macletoon is driving south stune by what has just happened and i am careful not to say a word we almost reach raymonville and stopp at a waterburger to get a quick wordress lunch and spend some time sitting in he parking lot waiting when she feels it is safe to return she turns a car around and heads back north back through the same check point are you sure this is safe i asked she does not answer when we pull up again to the check point and it back to hebenville round three ofclock there is a different boarder patrolationt at the air stream he is a small clean cut militant mexican with the southern drawl you all american citizens he demands instantly leaning into the car through the windowe clearly smelling for mariwana smoke oh yes says my mother who is probably quite relieve the hard part is over and it looks we are getting away with it haw bought you son you american citizen he gives me a direct glare through reflective sunglasses there is nothing more potentially hostile then the indigents ego interpreting the loss of his concuer upon his own people yes sir i say careful not to move or fidget or look away i've learned he looks back at my mother then at me he smells the nervousness of earlier something tugs at his intuition wereyoe all headed the sunglasses finally asked this catches mamoff guard her subtrfuse had ended when dad had driven through the check point she left all her answers back in raymonville we are going to hevrenville she says unconvincingly had he asked one more question had he pressed it we would have been in some sort of trouble but he does not and he backs off in motions us through mom drives the noisy car through habrenville and we are got to get the open highway again when you noticed tad's trailer in the parkinlot of a cheeve hotel by the side of the road my brother is lodged between the ermost tires working on th break likes that ri diculously ourt working mom is his alarm to find them there as i am this confirms my suspicion that there had been no planing beyond the consultation at the crrondetos this hold te bockle had been baced on nothing more than a hundred dollars worth of face momples op next of the trailer and i think she expects the vic torious reunion when he sees her dat suddenly looks his about to punch her t stupid fucking woman heels at her in spanish mom stops cold wit the fuck were you thinking if they would have just turned around for a moment it would all be over and itwoul all be yer fault he spits at her in spnish we realize what he is upset about the flashing headlights this words continued to snap in his surround her bullets in a fire fight that she follows him forward to the cab of the truck cowtowing to her punishment lucky for us lessinot i was right dead sas walking back with mom now excited and seemingly over his anger she made them blind and we were let through they were closed when we left them later that evening dand was doing the driver they plled out of the barkin lot an haded off to huston and ther pay off the break likes temporarily fixed on doups of block electrical tape o watch is a truck disappears it looks every other piece of now broken down equipment we have ever owned rusting miserable and totally criminal mom and ig turned south backtor brownsvill mom as her usual quietself except this time she plays the radia louder this mean tus think ing thit is getting dark and om sleepy i sleep she will get us home she knows the way for that i coul trusther the

there he read this account back in the first year of the trumpedministration if you remember when north creeter was doing test launches of intercontinental missiles and present a tromp was threatening retaliation demanding to stop am ma paus account was red for us by an actor john conway i'd paid attention i'd seen the news reals o her ashe im up but just watching a tomac bombs go off i thought it was going to be kind of cool thought the story be awaita interest girls they did not tell us anything about what was going to happen no initiation no training in the first time i had no idea what to expect we travel by convoy imbusses in the middle of the night to assemble at the sight hi shuffled roun the cold chain smoking till we were ordered into the trenches the trenches were long thin slits in the desert earth only wide enough for st to line up single file we wore our steel helmets but we are not his shue to your plugs eye coverers or any protect iv clothing then they told us to get down d not become fearful until the count down was brod cast over the loud speaker and i only became terrified when i saw the flash right enough were heven with my eyes closed i could see the bones of my hands over my eyes shock wai ave crashed over the trench top and we were ordered to stand up and lookd we did and saw the mushroom cloud glowing purple f th changing colors rising rising out te saw eight atomic blast and total all in differen t days some devices drop from their plans of some detnated from towers there was an arial burst in under ground blast as wl some times during the shok wave the trench sides caved and buried us alive we had to clawr way out from our own graves some poor doggies and jeeps were assigned to drive forward ith gagger counters and radio transmitters when clearance was radio back we ere ordered to walk forward into the blast areat at bar witness far as i could tell bearing witness was the entire reason we were there largest bon my witness was called turk ands almost three times he size of the herishemo bomb it was dropped from the five hundred foot tower an our trenches were approximately two and a half miles from ground zero the blast yield was a bigger than expected he brass ordered us to retreat to the busses where we swept each other off with kitchen brooms and hustled into our seats the next morning some of us were bust back into the area and our fatigues and fordar to walk forward tho beare witness there was still a heavy smell of ozonin theer vegetation was shredded scorched torn out by the broots and small animals an birds wor scattered dead crippled and bind lurchin about srom still trying to find a place to hide we walked past crumple the accols an our torry pieces that had been placed in the elp and he manican staked out cakes torn apart and melt that partesqly cagecheshor pigs that had been dressed and specially fit in ormy uniforms or dead or mangle the latter still shrieking theire last urds of blasted sheep and cows mangled together dead moaning staged houses and barns were splenderd scattered we never had to wrigt reports nor did any one ask us what we saw cause it turned out they were looking at ust they wanted to see our young men reacted to an atomic blast apparently that is all they wanted to do i was not selected because i was special i had no need for qualifications side from being a nineteen year old boy over the years of americas open air atomic bom testing in nevata a few thousand army men participated ies not matter any more that only feeble attempts were made by the government to find out how these experiences effected us lately i begun to realize that i am one of the last people living in america to have actually experience close up explosions of atomic bombs we are all dying now most of us are already ded i am not aware of any one's health being effected by the blasts but some years ago i did check with the veterans administration about the possible radiation tos age i receive during my participation i was in formed that the radiation fil badge that i wor throughout my four months at desert rock had been burned up in a government warehouse reckerds fire and saint louis some decades of tho now in my late years when i can conjur that brief se real period on my youth i try in vain to make some sense of it and some ways at is become my resp nsibility at least recollect and tell how that great flash and blast permanently reached into my very young mine and heart how thos enormous sounds deaden my ears and still ring in them to this day how the crush of shock waves sometimes buried us alive in our trenches i feel it my duty to tell the reckless absurdity of it all an august our president threatened to unleash fire and fury the world has never seen we keeps threatening unleash these bonds and i suspect that one day we will most of us have forgotten what we are capable of i've not john conli reading an essay by paulzemma version of this sessay was

welcome to the hubermen laponcaisu science science pace to ri mandrhubermen and ofm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin today we are discussing mental training and visualization mental training of visualization is a fascinating process that has been shown over and over again now hundreds of studies to improve our ability to learn anything when i say anything i mean the ability to learn music the ability to learn and perform mathematics the ability to learn and perform motor skills in sport in dance across essentially all domains the other incredible thing about mental training of visualization is that u seu'll soon see when you go into the literature that is the scientific studies on mental training in visualization you quickly realize that it does not take a lot of mental training of visualization in order to get better at anything however that mental training of visualization has to be performed in a very specific way and to day we will discuss exactly how to do mental training of visalization in the specific ways that allow it to complement the actual performance of a motor or cognive skill to allow you to learn more quickly and to consolidy that is to keep that information in mind and body that you can perform those cognative task music task motor tass et cetera for long periods of time without ever forgetting how to do them all of mental training of visualization relies on what i consider really the holy grail of our brain and nervous system and that is neural plasticity nerol plasticity is our nervous system which of course includes the brain the spinal cord and all the connections between the brain and spinal cord and the organs and tissues of the body and then all the neral connections back from the organs and tissues of the body to the brain and spinal cord the whole thing in both directions has the ability to change in response to experience in ways that are adaptive that is that allows us to do things that we could not do before and by doing those s hings or by being able to perform those mental operations we can do better in the world that we live in we can perform new tasks we can think new thoughts we can come up with novel solutions to preexisting problems that before really vexed us and that we could not overcome all of that is considered neural plasticity to day what i'm going to cover is a brief summary of what neural plasticity is that is how it occurs in the brain and body this is extremely important t understand if you are going to use mental training in visualization then i'm going to talk about what happens in our brain and body when we do mental visualization in a dedicated way many people have heard perhaps that when you imagine something happening that your brain does not know the difference between that imagination of the thing happening and the real thing happening turns out that is not true is simply not true however there is somewhat of an equivalents between a real experience and an imagined experience and will talk about the difference between those and how that can be leverage in order to get the most out of mental training n visualization then i will cover exactly which types of mental training ivisualization work best across all domains meaning for music learning mathematics solving puzzles motor learning sports performance et cetera et cetera to really allow you a templet in which you can plug in or designate what you are going to do each day for a brief period of time in order to accelerate your learning in whatever you choose and then i'm going to go in to a bit of what happens in the brains of different types of people ow these different types of people that ame referring to are people who have more or less of a natural ability to imagine things and visualize them becauseit turns out that we very tremendously from one indivisual to the next and turns of our ability to mentally visualize and imagine things and our ability to get better at that over time and the god news is any one can get better at mental training and visualization in ways that can serve them well also briefly touch on the fact that certain people in particular people on the autism spectrum as well as people with cynisthesias which is the combining of different perceptual experiences who you may be one of these people or you may have heard of people that for instance when they think of a number they also just naturally spontaneously think of a cullor and vice versa talk about how that relates to mental imagery ind visualization and the creative process and problem solving in general and then finally what i'll do is i'll re cap mental training of visualization from the standpoint of how best to apply mental training visualization according to specific challenges things challenges with public speaking or challenges with sports performance or challenges with test taking performane challenges with essentially anything theywil allow you to build specific mental training visualization practices that are brief that are supported by norroscience studies and that are highly effective before you begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separatefor my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost o consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back to electorolyte ratio of one thousand miligrams that one gram of sodium two hundred meligrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if iave been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elemente doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleemente doccom slash hubermen let us talk about mental training and visualization now perhaps surprisingly mental training visualization has been studie since the late eighteen hundreds setury ov paper published in eighteen eighty by gultan called the statistics of mental imagery long ago people were quantifying and trying to understand how is it that people come up with mental images and how they can apply that to learning things more quickly and more stably over time now as i mentioned earlier mental training in visualization relies on a process that we call neuro plasticity nero plasticity is a term that many people have heard and encompasses many different things broadly speaking nerrow plasticity includes develop mental plasticity which is the sort of plasticity that ccurs between about birth and age twenty five and that can be summarized very easily as passive plasticity in other words the sorts of changes that happen in one's nervous system simply by engaging in the world and experiencing life as a child as a young adult as an adolescent and as a twenty two twenty three twenty four year old et cetera now of course of course of course it is not the case that on your twenty fifth birthday you close out passive developmental plasticity and start engaging in the other type of nerol plasticity which is adult neral plasticity it is a gradual tapering off of developmental plasticity that occurs between age zero and twenty five and for some people might occur somewhere round twenty six orother people round twenty three when we say twenty five or relegious talking about the average age in which passive plasticy tapers off however starting fairly early in adolescence and extending all the way out into one's eighties or nineties or hundreds should one live that long is the other form of ner l plasticy which is adult neral plasticity adult nerrol plasticity is very different than developmental plasticity because it is the sort of plastisy that one can direct towards one's own specific desired learning if we wanted to get a little bit technical here for sake of clarity not for sake of confusion we would say adult plasticity is really about self directed adaptive plasticity and the reason we call at that as upposed to something else er simply adult plasticity is that ther many different forms of neral plasticiy there is for instance maladapted neral plasticity that occurs if one gets a really hard headhi and concussion there will be changes to the brain and nervous system but those changes the brain an nervous system do not allow it to perform better in fact it often impairs the brain and nervous systems ability to function and therefore is maladaptiv i do not want to get overly wordy with the number of different terms here but i do think its important understand that we have developmental plasticity again in which the brain nervous system changeis simply in response to experiencing specific things for better or worse and there is adult self directed adaptive plasticity in which one can direct specific changes in terms of learning things cognively or learning things in terms of motor function sport dance et cetera or a commination of the y now just to really clarify what i mean by developmental verse is self directed adaptive plasticity i mention that self directed adapted plastisy as he can start in adolescence right even though there is on going developmental plasticity an lets be really direct the brain of a fourteen year old is very different than the brain of that same individual when that person is twenty one because there is on going developmental plasticity however starting at about adolescence we can all start to decide what it is tht we want to learn and engage in self directed adaptiv plasticity now the way to engage self directed adapted plastisy regardless of whether not ere a thirteen year old fourteen year old or you are a ninety year old or anywhere in between is that it requires two things the first thing it requires is focused dedicated attention to the thing that you are trying to learn that is the first step and that actually triggers a number of different chemical and electrical prosteses in the brain that are often associate with agitation and frustration and believe are not the agitation and frustration is a reflection of the release of specific chemicals in particular nor epinepran and epinpron also called noradrenalie and a drenline in the brain and body that creates this discomfort and this heighten level of alertness and attention that many of us do not intend to back away from but it it is exactly that chemical or ishouls a nuro chemical mileu which signals to the nurons the nerve cells in the brain and elsewhere in the body that something needs to change because if you think about it if you can do something perfectly or if you try and do something and it does not cause any nuro chemical change in you arebrain and body well then there is no reason for your brain and its connections with the body to change in any particular way ocaso you need focus dedicated attention to the thingtat you are trying to learn it is often accompanied by agitation frustration et cetera that is perfectly normal in fact tha's a signal that things are going right meaning thei're headed towards learning but there is a second component that is really required for self directed adaptive plasticity and that is periods of deep rest in particular a good night sleep in particular on the night that follows that focused attention to the thing you are trying to learn there are now hundreds of studies in both animal models and in humans showing that it is really juring sleep and other states of deep relaxation things meditation and non sleep dy breast which i've talked bout before in this podcast be really juring are main night of sleep that the rewiring of nurl connections that is the actual nurl plasticity takes place the verb and nural plastosy the rearrangement of connections between nurons really curs during sleep in particular on the first night following an attempt to learn something through this focuse attention now developmental plastesy which is passive also requires good sleep its slightl y different or frankly it is a lot different in terms of the underlying mechanisms than self directed adaptie plasticity but because to day were mainly talking about how to learn faster through mental training in visualization and that really maps more closely on to self directed adaptive plasticity just really want to emphasize this two step process as to be focus dedicated attention and then there needs to be sleep and in particular sleep on the first night following that training now should you have the unfortunate experience of getting woken up inthe mill the night following trying to learn something or should you simply not be able to sleep for whatever reason on the night following a boubt of learning or an attempt to learn do not despair because it turns out that there are what are called second and third night effects also once you sleep you will learn those nurl plastic events the reordering of connections that we call synapses and the changes that occur in nural circuits that reflects what we call self directed adaptov plasticy that still will occur but ideally you got a great night sleep on the first night following trying to learn and the second ni and the third and on and on now there are few other things that are critical to understand about self directed adaptive plasticity that will become especially important when thinking about protocalls for developing the ideal mental training of visualization process for you and that is that there are different forms of plasticity that occur between nurans although the two main forms are what ar called long term potentiation and long term depression i just want o cue upright now that the word depression is a very loaded word because the moment people here the word depression they think ono that is bad but in the case of ner plastisity long term depression is simply a change in the connections between nurans and the excitability between nurans that in many ways can be excellent for learning things in particular motor skills and we get into this in more detail in a little bit but it turns out that a lot of our ability to get better at some sort of motor skill involves this thing a we call long term depression nd that is because much of what is happening when we learn a new motor skill is that we are depressing or suppressing specific actions in order to generate a very specific cordinated action some of the best examples of long term depression connectiu beborrowed from developmental plastesity for instance if youe ever sat across from an infant who is trying to eat their meal imagine a one and a half year old or a two year old trying to eat some nudles or some soup or any kind of baby suitable food with a spoon and their holding the spoon or their trying to hold the spoon wllyou will notice is that their motor movements are terribly uncordinated they often will take that spoon to their cheek or to their eye to their head we have all seeng these very amusing photos of babies with buwls of food on their head or with food all over their face are just everwetted peers that theire basily getting the food everywhere except where it is supposed to go which is in their mouth and that is because their motor movements are not very well cordinated at that age and they are not very well cordinated not because they lack sufficient numbers of nurl connection sinnaps as between their ons but rather because they have too many connections between too many different nurons the nurl circuits that control very dedicated cordinated movement are not ther yet instead too many nurons are connected to too many other nurons and they cannot generate the precise movements that are required in order to get that spoon to their mouth how over time they get better at moving the utensil to their mouth such that hopefully i ave out fought age five or six they are eating in a relatively cleaner way and hopefully by time their ten or eleven or twelve their getting the food into their mouth and not all over their face people learn this devairing degrees all you have to do as go to a restaurant and watch how people eat and you will see a vast variation in peoples cordinated movements with utensils but in general there is a theme the younger the person the more uncordinated their movement of utensils and as they get older the more cordinate now of course ind people that are very old they have challenges moving objects and their limbs in very smooth ways and that has to do with a topic that will get into when we talk about agerala cognave decline and motor related dimentios but for sake of today's discussion if you just want to think about what happens with long term depression and the development of a motor skill both as a baby as an adolescent and as an adult when you are trying to learn a new motor skill is that you are eliminating incorrect movements and when you are eliminating incorrect movements to arrive at only the correct movements in a very reflecive and repeated way think you are golf swaing your tennis serve thinks serving a volley ball think a child learning to crawl and then walk think a child learning to eat with utensils an example i gav before what is happening in all of those cases is that yes certain connections in the brain are being strengthened or what we call potentiated they are under going long term potentiation the call quoting fire together wire together montra that was popularized by the great nerobiologist doctor carloshats my colleague at stamford but in addition to that long term depression the quieting or the silencing of specific cynapses that is connections between yurons is absolutely critical for motor skill learning we have l t p long term potentiation an l t d long term depression is every bit as important as l t p long term potentiation forgetting better at some sort of motor skill anydeed at getting better at some sort of cognative skill now as we hear this this should be intuitive to all of us if you look at somebody is attempt to learn a particular dance step or at somebody is attempt to do a tennis serve the first time it is all over the place now it is not perhaps all over the place and that they are doing a jumping jack will trun to serve the tennis ball but their generally arki ng the racket too widely on one trial and then theire arking it too close to their body on the next trial if we were to draw line over each one of those trials we would see that there were lines everywhere over time whereas once they quon perfect the tennis serve it is going to be line drawn directly over line draugn directrly over line meaning the ark of that tennis serve is going to be very restricted and that without question has reflected the removal or the quieting of particular synaps as connections between nurons in the brain and body to allow that very narrow cornated and directed movement the same is true for learning anything in the cognive domain meaning if you were to learn a language it is not of course the case that every word in that language and then you simply remove certain words and arrive at the correct sentence structure that you are trying to achieve but rather you have to suppress your native language or if youare young child you have to suppress the generation of just kind of random babbling sounds turns out babbling is not random at all but the point is that you have to suppress the enunciation of particular sounds and direct the pronunciation of other sounds in order to generate that new language or your ability to speak at all casso we can really thing about narrow plasticity as both a building up process in which you increase connection call long term potentiation and a sculpting down were a removal of connections process that were going to call long term depression now i have to acknowledge that of course there are other forms of nero plasticity too i know theire pobaly some ofpysionatois listening to this who will be perhaps shouting backit a whatever a device my voice is coming out of weight what about spite timeing dependent plasticity or what about perpulse facilitation yes yes and yes there are multiple forms of communication between nurons that can strengthen those connections were weak en those connections but for to day's discussion we just broadly want to think about long tern potentiation and long term depression because it captures the two most important te eams related to mental training and visualization which is that when we perform a given cogntive or physical task in the real world actally try the dance step or the tenists serve or when we actually try a math problem or we try and learn some specific knowledge and write it down and remember it that is engaging particular nurons right theire firing the releasing chemicals but it is also actively suppressing the activity of other nurons and we are always completely unaware of the ways in which our brain is suppressing certain activity cay to day we have to keep in mind that where there is strainthining of connections there is also weakening of connections and when it comes to mental training in visualization and here is the really key point with mental training of visualization your capturing both processies both the potentiation that is the building up and strainthing of connections and the weakening of the connections that are inappropriate for the thing you are trying to learn and there are different aspects of mental training of visualization protocals that really harness the potentiation verses the depression aspect and to day we will cover mental trainin on visualization protocals that capture both the potentiation and the depression aspect of neural plasticity and in that way serve as an augment that is a omplement to the actual real world cognitive and physical training that you are doing because i'll just give this away right now turns out that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world cognitive or motor behavior again mental training o visualization cannot replace real world execution of cognive tasks or of motor task if you want to learn however mental training of visualization can an has been shown to be effective for greatly enhancing the speed at which you learn and the stability of that learning over time o casilets tike a second and really think about what is happening in the brain and body when we do mental training or visualization in fact we can do a little experiment right now that is not unlike many of the classic experiments looking at what is happening in the brain and body during mental training of visualization in which i just ask you to close your eyes and imagine a yellow cube and next to that yellow cube is a red rose and perhaps i also ask you to float or fly up above the cube and the rose and look at them from the top topdown and then i tell you to fly back around and land behind those and look at them from the perspective of behind that yellow cube and that red rose now what the data tell us is that most people will be able to do that most of you will be able to do that to some degree or another regardless of your attention span whether not you have eighty eight you or not most of you will be able to do that to some degree or another we also know from narrow imaging studies in which people are placed into a functional magnetic resonanc imaging scanner that during the sort of visualization you just did or that iscribed that your visual quartacs and associated areas cotincot light up they become very active in similar but not identical ways to how they would light up and be activated were you to actually look at a yellow cube and a red rose on a screen and perhaps fly above them virtually of course and land behind them virtually of course or if you were to actually look at a yellow cube and red rose in the real world right in front of you on a table then get up on your tippytoes and look down on them from the top and the walk round the table and look at them from the other side there is some degree of what we call perceptiabl equivalents between real world experiences digital experiences and imagined meaning with our eyes closed just in our mind's eye experiences this is true notjust of vision and what we call the visual domain but also the auditory domain caso for instance i could play for you a short motif of a song which jus pick something that i think most people know goodness om a terrible musician and even worse om singer betlis just take the opening to e c d cs back and black right i think i can do that when it is dn don do doo ke got it that is the actual sound although admittedly a dreadful version of of the great acy dycy song back in black but now ask you to close your eyes or we could keep them open and just imagine that don don don o ke or for instance i place you in a quiet room you close your eyes and ask you to imagine the opening to acy decs black and black but ask you to pause it half way through whet you would find again is that most people somewhere between ninety and ninety five per cent of people would be able to do all the sorts of things i described i cuban rose asey back an black even a sematicensery task i imagine you imagine what it is to touch felt or to touch chin chilla hair or something that achin chil as hair i deally alive chincila ssitting still those little girters move really really fast but theyare very very soft hair high haired density soft oke most people can do that about five to fifteen per cent of people are less able to do that and there is a small percentage of people in that five to fifteen per cent that simply cannot do it at all that just cannot visualize well we will talk later about these people they have what is called affentasia inability to mentally visualie but most people are actally pretty good at visualizing things when they are told what to visualize and and this is a really key point and if what they are told to visualize is very simple and the whole visualization is quite brief lasting on the order of about fifteen seconds to generate the visualization in the auditory or in the visual aspect of one's minds eye or ear if you will and if it is repeated over and over what is far harder for everybody to do and in fact what most people simply cannot do is imagine long extended scenes and story ies in their mind they go on for minutes and minutes that involve a lot of different sensory stimule this is a really key point in fact as we start to home in on ideal mental training in visualization protocals i'd to establish this as the first principle of mental training of visualization which is that if you are going to use mental training on visualization to its best effect in order to engageneral plasticity and learning you need to keep those visualiations quite brief really on the order of about fifteen to twenty seconds or and pretty darn sparse meaning not including a lot of elaborate visualization not including a lot of sequences of motor steps what i mean are motor sequences if you are trying to learn something in terms of physical movement or visual sequences or auditory sequences if you are trying to learn things terms of music or dance et cetera that can be completed and repeated in fifteen seconds or less now later i'll give you a couple of specific examples but if you want to use mental training in visualization understand this is the key first principle they have to be very short visualizations that you can repeat over and over and over again with a high degree of accuracy you do not want to embark on a mental training of visualization paradime in which it involves a lot of a laborate stimulenave to think really hard and work really hard even if you are in that category of people who can do mental visualization pretty naturally and easily nowif you are somebody who cannot do mentual visualization in fact if you are smebody who has full blown affentasia or the inability to mentally visualize will then it is especially important that you make those mental trainings and visualizations really brief and very very simple i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that they are spo swering the podcast thereason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the immun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic grens contains a number of adaptedgins viements and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastesgrigpt if you would to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road an the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a years supply of vitemen d three k too againd that is athleti green stock calm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply o vitemind thre k to now in order to develop the best mental training invisualization protocalls for you let us go a littlebit deeper into what the research says a bowed mental visualization now the classic work on mental visualization really hinges on a number of different researchers and their work but in particular roger shepard who do this work at stamford and stephen coslin whose now at harvard of course others in the field but it is really the work of shepard and coslin the lay the foundation for our understanding of what happens in the brain when we mentally visualize something shepard do these incredible experiments in which he had students mentally visualize simple objects a square a triangle and he measured how long it took them to do that of course at the time when he did these experiments there were no sophisticated brain immagine devices and machins ephemari however everythng him about to describe has been later confirmed using things ephamari what shephard did in what he found is that if people were told to visualize very simple objects they did it pretty quickly however if they were told to visualize more complex objects or importantly to rotate those objects in their mind's eye well then it took longer for them to perform those mental visualizations now many of you might think du if ihave to just imagine a triangular a cube that is going to be very easy in very fast where as if i have to rotate that triangular a cube in my mind's eye that is going to take more time and indeed that is somewhat of a du except and this is very important except that what shepherd and his colleagues found is that how long it take somebody to generate and rotate a given visual image scales directly with the complexity of that image in fact coslin did some experiments i think illustrate this even better and here is the experiment i love this experiment i think you will of it to becaus it illustrate something fundamentally important about howor brain's work not just for sake of mental training o visualization but is our brain's work at all he showed people a picture of a map a map drawn on a piece of paper this was a map of an island it included things a loading dock for some boats it had a location for getting food on the island had some trees ad some other small landmarks drawn out peoplel looked at this a memorized it or in other experiments they just had people imagine this island and the location of these different landmarks on the island did not really matter which but then he had people imagine moving or walking from one lotation on the island to another they say ocay you are at the loading dock now move to the restaurant care you are at the restaurant now move to the palm tree here on the norshore the island now go around the side of the island clock wise to arrive at the bay on the south west corner this sort of thing bhat colin found was absolutely incredible what he found was that the imount of time that it takes speople to move from one location on the map to another scaled linearly directly with the actual physical location between those objects on the map for those of you that can understand or into the importance of what shepherd in coslin showed great i'm guessing however that from most people out there still grasping it ok interesting how things happen in the real world dictates how they happen in our mind's eye but i want to make sure that i really nail home the importance of this for everybody the importance of this is that when we look at something in the real world if i look at the pen in front of me i'm holding up my pen for those be ther listening just holding up my pen in front of me i move it to the right ad back and forth what is happening is i'm activating or i'm triggering the electrical activity of nurons which we can think of kind of as pixles in my eye ok it is on leftward to rightward motion for me and back and forth and those are getting activ ate in their sending signals up to my visual quartexs and that information is process at a given speed what the visualization experiments that shepherd and coslin and others did show is that the processing speed of imagined experiences is exactly the same as the processing speed of real experiences and the spacial relationship between imagined and real experiences is exactly the same as well put simply when we imagine something in our minds eye or mind's ear we are imagining the real thing happening and when i say the real thing it is not the obvious real thing of course if your imagings onthing that is the thing you'r imagining what i mean is that your brain at the level of nurons is behaving exactly the same way and this need not have been the case ok there could have been a result for instance that if people were asked to visualize a cube and rotate it from y n a flip it from top to bottom case have put the top that is upward on the table now down on the table and forth or to migrate round the island you kow counter clockwas going from the northern coast all the way down to the southern coast clockwas and then back up to the northern coast that they could have just done it really quickly all in one second but that is not what happens they always match the speed at which they do things in their minds eye to the same speed that they do them in the real world in telling you this what i'm saying is that mental visualization at the nurl level is identical to real world events when you have heard that when we imagine something it is identical in terms of our brains experience of it and our bodies experience of it as when we actually experience something that is true at the nurl level however when it comes to learning and improving performance in the cognive or physical domain they are not equivalent this is the second qprinciple of mental training of visualization as you recall the first principle of mental training of visualization was that in order to make it effective it needs be very brief and very simple and repeated over and over again the second principle of mental training of visualization is that while yes mental training in visualization recaptures the same patterns of nurl firing in the exact same ways as real world behavior and thinking it is not as effective as real world behavior and thinking in other words if you want to learn something the ideal situation is to combine real training in the physical world with mental training and i'll talk about exactly how to do that and in what ratios a littlebit later now there is a really incredible set of experiments that illustrate why it is that mental training and visualization can be extremely effective but that it is always going to be most effective when combined with real world training and experiences the experiments that i'm talking about involved the use of what are called by stable in mages or impossible figures some of you are probably familiar with impossible figures these are figures or objects that when you look at them theyhave these odd features you are not sure where they stop and where they start where they end a one good example would be the call mobioust strip the mobioust strip is literally a strip or a line that is contiguous it goes up and it loops around and thn it curves around and then it goes back and and it just continues and continues and when you look at it you can never really tell where it starts and where it stops because it does not have any of the features that allow you to see what is the front and what is the back in any kind of stable way another example of an impossible figure would be a little am set of cubes that lok their coming out toward you maybe with a lik abendon them going up at a right angle perhaps then if you look at i a lo bit longer that low piece that is facing up looks it is in front and you cannot really tell what is in front and what is in back and it is called and impossible figure because you do not really know how to frame it in your mind to tell what is closer to you an what is further apart by stable images are somewhat similar although different in the sense that they typically are simple silhouettes for instance the faces vaces by stable image is perhaps the most famous of these where you look at this image it is very simple and it looks two vases but then you look at it a lo bit longer n you realize that you are looking at the side angle or the profile of two faces looking at one another and when you see those two faces looking at one another you cannot see the vases at the same time but then if you decide to see the vases again you can see the vases again but the faces disappear it is by stable meaning that you cannot see the faces and vaces at the same time and impossible figures and by stable images are capturing the fact that you are visual quartacs and some of the associated areas that compute visual scenes in your world are essentially trying to recreate whatever it is thit is out in front of them and that is effectively what your visual system does it is very goot at recreating visual images in your brain in your mind's eye if you think about it even with your eyes open your brain is just creating an abstract rprepresentation of what it thinksis out there but that when it comes to assigning an identity to something oh that is a face or oh that is a vase that is constrained by different noral circuits by different areas of the brain and somehow those circuits cannot be coactive we cannot see the faces and the vaces at exactly the same time we can switch back and forth really quickly just as we can switch back and forth really quickly when we arelooking at the impossible figure in think o ke that is the front of it that is the back no weight that is the back that is the front and's going back and forth but we cannot see them both at the same time no one can see them both at the same time we know this from brain imaging studies now impossible figures and by stable images can be seen rigt you could look them upright now on your phoneer computer were i could show you pictures of them on paper right in front of you and you can do these sorts of perceptional experiments of telling people look at the face look at the vase look at the front of the cube mand iw make it at the back of the cube and they can do the somewhat deliberately however andthisis i think very interesting to understanding how mental training of visualization does and does not support real world learning if you try to imagine a by stable image you cannot do it in fact no one can do it until they do something else for those eathers taing waight i can do it i can do faces vaces in my mind's eye i promise you that the nurow imaging disputes your belief and supports the idea that we can see real world by stable images we can see real world impossible figures but when we try and imagine those in our mind's eye we simply cannot do it we cannot do the perceptional shift in our mind's eye we cannot switch back and forth between faces and vaces however and i just have to chuckle ecause i think these experiments are clever if i have you trace or draw with a pen on a piece of paper an impossible figure or the faces vases by stable image and then i ask you to imagine that by stable image or impossible figure and to switch back and forth you are able to do it what that illustrates is that it is the commination of i magined and real world experiences real motor movements real perceptiale experiences combined with motor movements combined with what you imagine in your mind's eye that really gives you the most depth end flexibility over your mental visualization and in doing we can really stamp down a third principle of mental training in visualization which is that your mental training in visualization will be far more effective if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental and physical task in the real world ocaseo first principle is mental training visualization needs to be simple and brief and repeated second is that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world motor training or cognive training it is an augment it is an addition that can really help and the third principle of mental training in visualization is that you need to combine mental training in visualization with real world behaviors and experiences that are very very similar now's a brief but think really relevant aside one of the things that also makes mental training in visualization more effective is when we assign cognitive labels to what is going on when we visualiye what i mean is that people are much better at manipulating faces and vases in their mind's eye course only once they have drawn them out physically with theur hand as i mentioned before then they are manipulating abstract objects impossible figures impart because by labeling them faces and vases people are able to capture a lot of other norl machinery that is related to faces and vaces in fact we have entire brain areas on both sides of tebrain devoted to the processing effaces of colfusiform face area we have other ere is on a brin that are involved in processing of threedy objects but faces are of particular value there is t there is a value to understanding what a face is as supposed to a non face and there is a value to understanding what a particular faces in fact the simplest way to put this is that the human brain is in many ways a face recognition and expression of faces recognition machine it of course does other things but it is exceptionally good at that unless you are in a profession in which the relationships between threedy objects in your ability to manipulate them is exceedingly important youare not going to have a lot of narrl real estate specifically devoted to that some people be better at it some worse but when it comes to faces unless you have a condition propignosia which is inobility to recognize say famous faces and distinguish them from non famous faces or if you have some sort of face recognition deficit which about anywhere from one perhaps to three percent of people out there have af there is terrible recognizing faces and by the way there is about half a per cent of people out there that are what are caled superrecognizers that can recognize faces in a large crowd they can recognize specific faces even from just partial profiles by theway these people are extremely valuable to securities agencies and security agencies are very good at finding these people e machines are quickly getting better or at least as good as superrecognizers but the best superrecognizers is still better than the best a eye and machine aw grow thems out there but the point is that in your mind's eye you are better abel to manipulate specific objects or to see things more clearly and with more specificity when it has a label that you recognize from your real world experience as suppose to abstract or fictional labels again stamping home the idea that what you experience in the r eal world really serves to support your mental imagery and therefore the key importance of experiencing and doing things in the real world and supporting that with mental training in visualization and not just relying on mental training in visualization and the tangent here that silittla bit of fun and i do not think we have ever talked about before on this podcast is that of u fos unidentified flying objects if there is a lot of people out there who think that they have seen yu fos i guess technically they have because a u fo as an identifi flying object inivits i unidentified at least to them than it is indeed an u fotha i guess the question is whether not where the dispute rather is whether not those u fos are actually flown by aliens or control by aliens think that iswhere the dispute lies but you can imagine how if somebody sees an object in their environment and decides ah that is a u f o o c remember these fases vases or these impossible figures if they say oh that thing is a u f o as opposed to something else they see in other words the face not the vase wil hat stamps it down as a memory in their visual system and related systems and then in their minds eye they are seeing the u f o they are not seeing the other thing that it could possibly be o kso it stampd own a very specific memory the point here is that mental training o visualization relies on nocios the physical contours and the exact spacial profiles and the speed of movement of paricular things that we experience in the real world it also heavily depends on the cognitive labels and the decisions we make about the things that we see and this will become very important as we build up toward our fourth principle of mental training n visualization which is that our cognitive labels that is what we decide is happening when we do mental training n visualization turns out to be very important now this is not simply to say that you can decide o k i want to learn how to play piano and i am going to tell myself that a particular cord i imagine in my minds i is identical to the real world cord just because i decided is the brain does not work that way it is not possible to just l to yourself and learn better as a consequence of the lies you tell yourself however what this tells us is that it is very very important tha your mental training in visualization accurately recapitulate the real world training that you are doing we are going to stamp down a fourth principle of effective mental training in visualization based on what we know from the scientific literature is that your mental training in visualiation should assign labels to what you are doing that can be matched to real world training and experiences now these can be somewhat abstract for instance if you are trying to learn a particular aspect of the golf swing ok let us say that you are working on your golf swing seems speed ther re lot of people out their working on their golf swing and you are going to do soe mental training o visualization in order to improve your golf swing we already know again that is just march through them that youre mental training f visualization needs to be brief and simple it needs to be the same or in fact it will be we can say the same as your real world golf swing an other it will take you exactly the same amount of time to perform that golf swing in your mind's eye as it would in the real world incredible right again something that maybe has taken il bo time to sink in but once it does you beu wow the brakin is really an incredible machine and that third principle that you still have to do golf swings in the real world in addition to the mental training of golf swings and fourth that if you want that mental training n visualization to really improve your golf swing you are going to havet o name or apply an identity to the specific golf swing or aspect of the golf swing that your practicing this can be abstract you could call it mental training n visualization of golf swing one ah and you can imagine your mind's eye you ave the perfect golf swing over and over and over and over but then when you are in the real world youare also going to have to call that either out loud or just to yourself golf swing one eh ok as opposed to a put which might be one b naming and giving an identi ty to a real world skill and applying the same name or identity to the mental version of that the visualization of that can enhance the mental training of visualization insignificant ways when we apply identities or names to these mental trainings and visualizations and again provide that they are brief and repeated and on we greatly enhance the amount of nural machinery in the brain and body that we are able to recruit when we go to perform those real world gulfswings and gulf potson here just replace gulfswing en gulf put with anything tat you are trying to learn you are able to recruit a lot more nurl machinery and greatly increase the probability of proper execution before we go any further i want a share with you a couple of incredible aspects of mental visualization that really can be harnessed and applied toward mental training and visualization some of these were done by roger sheperd and his graduate sunes in postocks sai were done by steepe coslin and by others what these experiments really show is that mental training of visualization is capturing many many of the exact same features of real world behavior and perception s not all of them but many of them for instance if i tell you to close your eyes and imagine a sealing that has tiles that are black and white checker tiles now one blacktile one white tile for instance we know based on experiments where we imeasure i've movements behind closed eyelids that people tend to move their eyes up when they are imagining things above them such as a cealing whereas if i tell you to imagine things down on the floor your taking a heike and you'r looking for a rattlesnakes i sule just recently i experience because it is spring here in california rattlesnake along a hiking trail sretly quite beautiful t have to confess i enjoyed keeping my distance i do not snakes ah very much i do not dislike snakes but i prefer not interact with them unless i have to if i have you imagine that r attlesnake depending on your relationship or thoughts about rattlesnakes number of things will happen in your brain of course act vitin alimic system or not for instance but what i know is that regardless of how you feel about snakes most of you will move your eyes down when imagining a snake it might be subtle it might be fast but statistically that result shows up as supposed to when i imagine wher ask you to imagine something above you tendiwo your eyes up in addition to that if i tell you for instance to imagine an elephant and a mouse next to one another you presumably have some real world understanding about the relative sizes of elephants verses mice elephants generally are bigger than mice thank goodness mice are smaller than elephants if i ask you to tell me about the details of that mouse's face for instance can you see its whiskers the processing time required for you to do that is much longer than the processing time required if i say tell me what the position of that elephant's trunk is now why would that be ok the position of the elephant's trunk was not something that i told you was not dictated by me it is in your mind's ey maybe you do not even know when you have to go searching for it but what we do know is that if i tell you to look at a small object in your mind's eye verses a larger object for inces the mouse verses the elephant it takes longer for you to do that in other words just as with the map experment the distance between things on a map is conserved in your mind's eye as a linear relationship takes longer to go far distances between things on a map in your mind then it does to go shorter distances it is also the case that it takes you longer to look at the details of a small object verses a large object because why because you are zuming in in your mind's eye again all of which speaks to the equivalents of mental imagery with real world imagery and perception and as i mention earlier and as well see in a moment this also extends into the motor domain it takes you longer to perform complex motor sequences in your mind's eye than it does simple motor sequences just as it would in the real world and if you are saying of course of course of course will then great then we have really underscored the point which is that when you imagine things it is not exactly the same but it is very very much the same as actually doing or perceiving those things in the real world and the fifth principle of effective mental training of visualization is this notion of equivalence of mental imagery verses real world perception and behavior these are the experiments as you recall where if people are told to look for clouds in their mental visualization they tend to look up or if there looking for something on the floor they tend to look down even behind closed eyelids now this can be applied toward building and especially effective mental training of visualization proto call if you deliberately move your eyes in the direction of the thing or things that you are trying to recapitulate in your mind in your visualization that is you do not necessarily have to include this step but mental training of visualization is going to be more effective if you do because with consciously generated eye movements again even behind closed eyelids you are bringing about more of the noral circuitry that one would experience if you were to perform that particular cognive task or motor task in the real world which as i mention before in principal number threet you need to bed doing anyway separately from yere mental training in visualization what were talking out here is thus far five principles of mental training visualization that are well established from the scientific research literature in fact ihave not mention this a quite yet and i'll refer to some other references but there is a wonderful systematic review of a large number of studies that have looked at mental training of visualization what is effective what is less effective across a bunch of different disciplines that include education medicine mus ic psychology and sports we will provide a link to this paper in the shownote captions but the title of the paper is best practice for motor imagery a systematic literature view on motor imagery training elements in five different disciplines as the title suggests its mainly for motor imagery training but it extends in to music which of course involves motor training and execution but as well as education this review establishes a number of different important things i'm going to read off some of the on t key or a highlight take aways forinces i described principal one of effective mental training invisualization which is that the visualization be brief and it be simple and it be repeated may ask a how many times that very brief five to fifteen second exercise of going through some routine should be repeated well different studies have used different ranges of let us call them repetitions in a given training session but the number that seems to be most effective is somewhere between fifty and seventy five repeats per session that brings about the question of how long one should rest between each repeat this gets a little trickey depending on what you are trying to dew a remember that we have this and of threshold of about fifteen seconds for completion of the entire motor sequens let us say what you are trying to do a gulf swing takes you five seconds to imagine in your minds eye from the point where you let us you say have the ball on the tea bring the the golf club up you might reposition youre your feet just a little bit you that the counwill wiggle that golf gulfers do and then the swing if that whole thing takes five seconds in your minds eye and roughly five seconds in the real world wer then you would be able to repeat it of course three times in fifteen seconds that would be one repetition even tough you doing it three times sos one fifteen second epoch as it sometimes calld e p oc eigh epoch and then you would rest for in approximately equivalent amount of time fifteen seconds or and then repeat thand rest fifteen seconds or and then repeat rest fifteen seconds and then repeat again three gulf swings within that fifteen seconds rest fifteen seconds three gulf swings of them that fifteen seconds rest fifteen seconds truth told these epochs and these respiriods do not need to be exact you could imagine for instance that you get three repetitions of the swing within fourteen seconds will then you do another one or do you wait until the end of that fifteen seconds anchored you not to obsess too much about those sorts of points rather you want to do as many repeats as you can in about a fifteen second epoch and then rest for about fifteen seconds and then repeat for a total of fifty to seventy five repetitions which might not sound a lot to some of you might tolnd an awful lot to others of you to me it selnds a lot your fifty repetitions of something and where you trying to concentrate in your mind's eye on getting something accomplish over and over over again in exactly te same way might seem a lot we know based on the learning literature that youre ability to successfully perform something in the real world will lend itself to better performance of that thing in the imagined world within your mind's eye that is also one of the sort of does but if you are trying to get better at something that you have never performed before you really should know that the mental training visualization is probably not the best agment to that real world training until you are able to perform it successfully in the real world at least some of the time mental training visualization can be effective however at increasing the accuracy or the frequency which you can do that real world behavior if normally youare only getting the correct swaying or you only hitting the the gulf ball correctly say ten percent of the time mental training visualization can really help bring that number up but it is important that you are able susuccessfully complete that motor task in the real world similarly for performance of cognivetasks of ay for instance on a speaking in new language you might ask coschwhat in the landscape of speakingin neu language can be restricted to five to fifteen seconds where i could repeat it anywhere from ythone to three times in a given epoch and then rest than keep repeating fifty to seveny five times well there i would incourage you to pick something that you are able to do perhaps very slowly to speak a particular sentence but with some challenge in getting the accent in the enunciation right but you have completed it successfully before and you want to get more smooth and more fluid with it likewise for youn pline piano or guitar yoen you have to translate to the specific cognitive and or motor activity that you are seeking to improve that but those epochs lasting five to fifteen seconds are really the corner stone of an effective mental training in visualization practice and the repeated nature of it fifty to seventy five repetitions in a given section is also another corner stone of an effective mental training in visualization practice says this review and some of the other papers that i'man going to get to in a few moments now one of the other key components of a successful mental training in visualization practice is how often you perform that mental training in visualization practice and again number of different studies have looked at this through number different lenses meaning anywhere from to to eight times per week it does appear that performing these sessions and you where from three to five times per week is going to be effective we could perhaps even say most effective because most of the i let us just call it the strongest data really point to repeating these fifty to seventy five trials of the same thing three to five times per week you can come up with the number that is reasonable for you to do consistently and you might ask do you have to continue to perform the mental training in visualization forever and the good newsis the answer to that question is no it does seem that once you have what is called consolidated the motor performance or the cognive performance of something it can be further supported or reinforced that is consolidated in the neral circuits that are responsible por performing that mental or physical task in other words once you are performing that cognitive remotor task in a way that is satisfactory or perhaps just improved perhaps you are nt a hundred per cent but it is improved in the real world you do not need to continue to do mental training in visualization to to maintain that real world performance that is a god thing in fact the ideal situation would be then to pick a different sequence or thing that you are trying to learn and do mental training of visualization for that i perhaps might have misspoke there although i do not want to edd it this out i mis spoken the sense that again i said for the thing that you are trying to learn remember mental training f visualization is going to be most effective for building up the number of accurate trials or th you are ability to do something with the greater frequency of something that you are already capable of doing or have done at least once in the real world this is not to say that mental training of visualization cannot be used to acquire new skills it can in principle but it has been shown to be most effective for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills that one has already demonstrated some degree of prerficiency at in the real world i think that is important to point out because we often hear mental training o visualization and this equivalence of perceptial and motor experiences in our minds eye to the real world and we think oh whale we have to do as imagine doing something and we will get better at it and unfortunately that is not the case the god news is however if you can do something once even verry slowly in the real world and then you bring it to the mental imagery and visualization domain you can get much faster at it in a way that really does translate back to the real world now if you recall principal number three or what i'm calling principal number three of affactive mental training visualization which was that you have to be able to perform the thing yourethatyou are trying to get better at through visualization and imagery in the real world that should raise the question of what is the ratio of real world training verses mental training that is going to be most effective ah well here there 's really interesting data a not just in the review that i mention but in couple the other papers that were going to talk about in a few minutes but what i've done as i've synthasized the information across those papers and they really all point to the fact that real world training is more effective than mental training and mental training is more effective than no training now the mental training more effective than no training is kind of a dove except that there are people for incis people who are injured who are trying to maintain or replenish some motor skill or ability to move in a particular way or who have had a dramatic brain injury and are trying to recreate experiences in a way that safe for them while in a somewhat restricted format for instance if you have damaged a limb or youre experiencing chronic pain and you need to take a lay off from some physical activity there are now many studies and looking at stroke pations at patience that have been in accents t b e whalst people who are suffering from more conventional limb and connective tissue injuries that if they do mental training it obviously is not going to put them at risk of doing those same movements as it would in the real world might but that it cannot actually accelerate or at least maintain skill performance since pretty exciting if you think about it what this means and the reason it under scores this mental training is better than no training is that should you find yourself in the unfortunate circumstance of being injured or unable to perform a given behavior imagining the sequence of behavior that you to maintain or even build up over time provided you have done that motor sequence before in the real world well the mental training visualization can really help keep that on line or even help you improve over time fact i have a colleague th psychology department at stamford who told me an anecdote in admittedly it is just an anecdote of a student who was recruited to stamford both fortheir academic prows but also for their abilities in tennis and was injured in their first year and at first thought this was devastating but did a cognat of retrain around the idea that that let us call it extended lay off from actual tennis was going to afford them the ability to do more mental training than they would otherwise even though they were on quite sad to not be able to do actual physical training for tennis and when they came back from that injury they did indeed manage to improve beyond the initial non injured state they were in before the injury just pretty remarkable but this cally pointed out to me they were very careful to include a lot of mental training in visualization during that quitinlay off period again mental training better than no training physical training better than mental training but when we say physical training better than mental training wet were really talking about is when you allicate a certain amount of training hours for a given skill per week ocasa howwith this look what these studies have done as they said oke if people have the option of doing the real world training for ten hours a week verses mental training for ten hours a week which group performs better and turns out ats the ones do the physical traing for ten hours per week however we also know that comminations of physical training in mental training can bring about results that are greater than either one of those alone how would that work well i wish i could tell you that if you did nine hours of physical training per week plus one hour of mental training that your performance would be better than if you did ten hours of physical training and that is not the case cad this is why we can reliably say physical real world training and again this could be in the cognife domain is always going to be more effective on an hour by our basis compared to mental training if you can do real world training and perhaps we shou ould be calling a real world as suppose to physical but if you can do real world training compared to purely mental training that is going to be the best use of your time this is really important it does not underscore everythng that were talking about because here is the really cool thing if you do ten hours for week of real world physical trainin cant cold be running could be music could be mathed could be whatever it is your train of learn shootng bask walls ittengolf balls and you add one hour or even half an hour of mental training to that real world training well then the results are significantly greater than you would experience with physical training alone and of couse they would be greater than you could achieve with mental training alone because we already establish that real world training is more powerful in learning skills in retaining skills than is mental training ke if any of that was confusing let me just tay one more time just to be ultra clear if you have the option to do real world training for a cognitive and or motor skill verses mental training always go with real world trainin however if you can add to a maximum amount of real world training by doing some mental trainin and you follow the principles that we have been discussing here which are glean from the scientific literature well then you are going to get significantly greater results in terms of speed accuracy and consistency of performance of those real world behaviors and cognivabilities and of course if you are unable to do physical training for whatever reason injury travel whatever the case may be well then doing mental training is still far significantly grater then doing no training at all o case a total lay offs it turns out are a bad thing if you want to get better at something and indeed if you want to retain certain skills both cognitive and motor now a couple of other things to keep in min nd as youare thinking about how to build up skills through a commination of physical an mental training well remember back to the beginning of the episode where we talke about neural plasticity an the fact that self directed adaptofe plasticity which is really what we are talking about here in this entire episode things that you are trying to learn in a deliberate way that is as you recall a two part process requires focusts attention both when you are doing it in the real world and when you are doing mental training and it requires rest and sleep and in fact you would be very wise to try in get a good night sleep both on the days when you do physical training again also called real world training and mental training you may also be asking can you do them on the same day and this gets into some new wants in the literature but by my read of the literature here is to take away if you are doing the maximum aount of physical training that you can do according to your schedual preventing injury an all those sorts of important constraints and you are going to add mental training an imagery it does not really matter when you do it you could do it immediately after your physical training you can do it on a separate day but you do want o place it at a time in which you can try and get good sleep that night for instance believe are not studies have been done where people are doing mental training at times when they should be sleeping that is going to offset some of the degradation and performance that you would normally see but it is generally a bad idea you should do your real world training and your mental training whenever it is that you can and then should try and get as much quality sleep as you possibly can on the night following that physical and ere mental training this is true pretty much every night of your life right if i had my way that is if i had a magic wand which obviously i do not i would insure that i and everyone else in the world get sufficient amounts of quality sleep every single night but that just not realistic they are going to be times where that simply knock an happen for whatever reason and i always say if you are not going to get sufficient amounts of quality sl eep for whatever reason tryng to make it for a fun reason or a good reason but i think getting sufficient mounts of quality sleep eighty per cent the nights of your life is a reasonable goal and one that is worths driving toward and we have lots of episodes now or three really on mastering sleep on perfecting your sleep and a episode guest episode with the great matthew walker who wrote the book why why we sleep incredibly important book all of those as well as our toolkipt for sleep describe ways to improve your sleep you can refer to those episodes if your having challenges with sleep an want to improve on sleep and things non sleep dee breast which can support your ability o sleep anyur ability to learn sleep is still vitally important notjoust for inshowing naurow plastasy occurs following real world training but also following mental training and again when you place that mental training is not critical at least it does not appear to be based on the literature if any one out there has knowledge of any pure reviewed studies stating that mental training should be done either before or aft or some hours away from real world training pleace send that to me or put in the sh a mscus me put it in the comments on you tube and i'll see it there s i do read all the comments but i'm not aware of any any such data or analysis and by the way if you are interested an understanding the relationship between motor skill acquisition and retention and this first night phenomenon of sleep the first night after training verses sleep on the second night at cetera there is really wonderful paper that was published by none other than the great matthew walker when i believe you was a graduate stude maybe you was a postocueny to this in roberts stickgold's lab at harvard a the titale of the paperis sleep and time course of motor skill learning a this is a paper publishin two thousand three a still an incredibly important paper i will provide a link to it in the shownote captions it really highlights a some of the key aspects of when people sleep and how critical sleep is on the night following in the nights following that training in order to really consolidate certain types of learning and what phases of sleep relate to the consolidation of motor learning et cetera a really wonderful paper and of course but just one of matthew and robert stigolds incredible papers on sleep and learning remember the beginning of the episode when i mention that many people are good at mental training of visualization but some people are not well sex differences have been explored and age related differences have been explored in terms of peoples ability to mentally visualize and train up specific skills and while initially there were some sex differences identified really the bulk of the subsequent literature that is the majority of quality pureviewed studies on this aspect of mental training visualization point to the fact that there are no significant differences between males and females and terms of their ability to mentally visualize nor their ability to use that mental visualization toward improving cognive or motor skills that point was a covered in some detail in the review i mentioned early ar best practice for motor imagery of systematic literature view on motor imagey training elements in five different disciplines this review also looked at age related effects and perhaps the only thing that really popped out from this literature review in terms of age dependent differences that point to changes in protocols tat you might make is that for individual sixty five or older a commination of physical ind mental training may actually allow them to gain and consolidate skills better than were they to do physical training alone now whether or not that is due to some lower upper limit of physical training that they can do because of their age or whether not that something specific to do with older verse is younger neral circuits is in clear but what this review also makes clear is that for the vast majority of people out there teens people in their twenties their fortes and on physical training more effect of the mental trainin we said that before commination of physical and mental training more effective then physical training alone provided the mental training is on top of the maximum amount of physical raing that one could do and of course mental training more effective than no training it all o case we talk t about sets in reps we talked about five to fifteen second epochs with about fifteen second breaks in between or rest between sets if you will repeated from fifty to seventy five trials done threetor five times for week on the conditions of keeping it really simpleld the importance of being able to actually perform those sequences in the real world and on what we have an discussed is first person verses third person an eyes open verses eyes close what are we really talking about here well first person mental training and visualization would be where you are imagining doing something and you are seeing yourself doing something from the inside out as supposed from the outside in imagine for instance wearing a head camp on cay or a body camp and doing something with your hands ore being in virtual reality and having the sense that whatever you see in front of you and that is moving and that you are doing that is you what i mean by this is a mental training or visualization protocol for incance if you were at the piano or at a guitar where you are actually looking down at or sensing the feeling of your hands but you are not actually moving your hands a as opposed to seeing yourself from outside of your body looking at yourself say standing next to you or from cross the room you are looking yourself playing the piano or playing itar or swinging a golf club or doing a tennis serf eh first person verses third person and what the data tell us is that first person mental training visualization is generally more effective than third person mental training of visualization which perhaps raises another chorus of does out there but it need not have been the case right when you could imagine that seeing yourself doing something and doing it perfectly because you have done it perfectly once before hopefully would allow you to build up that skill more quickly because you have that third person perspective where you can really see every aspect in every element of what you are trying to perform well turns out that the first person mental training visualization is significantly more effective than that third person mental training in visualization if what you are trying to learn lends itself well to this first person mental experiencing of self as you perform the cognive and oor motor skill i suggest you do that as opposed to the third person version now what if what you are trying to learn does not lend itself well to first person visualization for instance what if you are trying to learn a specific cogntive skill that does not involve any overt motor behavior to be observed well in that case it is very clear that closing your eyes ideally and trying to perform that specific cognitive task or the statement or the uttering of a particular sentence in another language or doing some sort of computation or problem solving of some sort in your head will that itself of course is first person because it is inside your own body as opposed to and i do not know that anyone would actually do this but looking at yourself from a third person perspective in your mind's eye and seeing yourself perform that cognative challenge whatever that challenge may happen to be now we have to address eyes open verses eyes closed and this is where the literature gets pretty interesting i always thought for some reason i do not know why but i presumed that mental training visualization should always be done eyes closed but it turns out that is not how a lot of studies of mental training visualization have been done in fact many of them have arrived at really impressive protocols which are assentially the protocals that i've distilled out in im listing out during to day's episode having people either watch vidios of themselves performing a given skill and imagining themselves in that roll and again itt them again during the mental training visualization theire watching a moviv themselves ther somewhat in the third person perspective i guess we gtechnically say they are in the third person perspective but they are watching themself in doing that we know based ondero ima ging studies that when we watch ovidios of ourselves doing things we experience that more from a first person perspective than if we watch vidios of other people doing thinks use your imagination here folks if youre somebody for insetance whos trying to get better at a particular skill this could be not just spore but also public speaking watching vidios of yourself doing that can be very effective but of course we have to come back to the first principle of effective mental training an visualization which is that whatever it is that we are trying to build up or e consolidate as a skill needs to be brief and repeated what wee really talking about here is watching a vidio of ourselves on loop or listening to a audio or audiovidio recording of ourselves on loop for whatever aspect that we are trying to build up or improve upon now for people that for instance are trying to get better at dealing with public speaking and there is not a particular skill or utterance of particular sentences or words that they are trying to accomplish but rather their trying to learn to be more relaxed or to articulate better in the public speaking senario there would be one of the few instances in which i've suggest more general theme and not exact recapitulation of some specific words that you are going to say perhaps it could be a sequence of you walking out on to stage toward the podium or out from the podium and facing the audience and looking in multiple directions up and down to see people in every corner of the room and just rerepeating that on loop in your mind's eye or watching yourself do that on vidio and making yourself calm in your internal state as you are doing that this is more of mental autonomic training because what you are really trying to do is control your autonomic nervous system than nervous system aspect that controls how alert or calm you are i suppose to a specific skill however you could also translate this to dance steps or to motor sequences for playing an instrument and on the point here is that it is not as if there is zero utility to third person mental training of visualization there can be but first person mental training of visualization is going to be more effective as i mention before and if you are going to use a third person mental training o visualization ideally you would be looking at yourself either on vidio or listening to yourself and audior and orvidio that is going to be more effective than closing your eyes and trying to imagine yourself from a third person perspective in your minds eye case i just to make it really simple fierst person better than third person visualization ifyou'e gong to go a third person visualization tryiand go with real third person visualization where you are actually seen and or hearing yourself on a screen and again this was somewhote of surprise to me always thought that mental training of visualization was done with eyes close on thaw can close your eyes you imagine this you imagine that that is ic sally not the case for many many studies some of which are considered real holemarkd studies within the field of mental training of visualiation and the differen neral circuits that it recruits and alalmost lines is a really interesting study it came out not that long ago this is just a summer of twenty twenty two to discussin a low bit of detail because it really hammers home a number of the principles that we talked about the title of the article is mental practice modulates functional conactivity between the serabellum and the primary motor quartex going to tell you the essential features of the study first of all primary motor cartex sometimes alled mmauan is a relatively small but vitally important strip of nurons in or near the front of your brain the nurons there are called upper motor nerons they communicate through a set of neral connections with what are called lower motor ner ons the lower motor neron sit what is call the ventural horn of the spinal cord is al along the spinal cord you have censor imputs coming from skin and muscle and hit iscalle purperaceptive fee back that tells you where your limbs are in relation to each other and yourself and on you will have motor nerons that live in the spinal cord there actualy the ones that sen little wires that we call axons out to t muscles release to see to colling on to those muscles and allow those muscles to contract lower motornerons othe ones that actually generate movement however they are largely responsible for reflecive movements are already learned movements and they require some imput from things central pattern generators and some other circuits within the spinal uart an brainstem but it is those m juon primary motor quartex nerons that are colld upper motornrons because tey control lower motor nerons through directed action oque when i say primary motor quartex ome rearly talk about those upper motor nerons m one the sarabellum is an area an the baccier brain fyewer to look at a brang un see two loaves back there theire highly foliated foliated means at lots of lots of folds and lots of bumps in grooves back there in actualy means many brain it looks a cond of a manybrain stuffed in the back of the brain in certain animals the sarabellum is much larger than the rest of the brain inhumans the sarabellum is relatively small compared to the rest of cle neo quartex the outer shell the human brain the sarabellum is involved in balance it is also involdan ey movements its also involved in timing and motor learning nd the keything do understand is that the sarabellum communicates with the primary mototor quartex and it can do through what is called inhibition and has outputs that inhibit the activity of nurons in the motor quartexan elsewhere and that has a profound influence on the execution of motor behavior and the learning of particular motor behaviors now i do not want to get into too much detail round all this but what you need to know is that the sarabellum communicates with m one primary motor quartex amd one is primary motor quartex tos the upper motor neron atecontrol the lower motor neros and are going to control physical behavior and execution of physical movements the communication between sarabellum and primary motor quartex is in hibitory although it can activate motor quartex too and this gets into a little bit of technical detail but there can be inhibition of inhibition if you take someth ng that is a break and you inhibit that break what youwent up with its more excitation oca the take away here that key and everyone should be able tounderstand even the you may or may not be following this whole sarabellum primary motor quartects thing is that when we gain a new skill or we get more proficient at a skill faster more accurate there tends to be more net excitation of the sarabellum to motor quartex communication and that is accomplished by reducing inabition that is whe it gets a little but confusing to sum but in this paper what they did is they explored people's ability to improve on a very specific but very simple motor sequence it is one thatyou are already familiar with it is that tapping sequence hi talked about before where the thumb is didg it one in next perin nover two mindle fingr number three ring fring your number four and pink fingour number five and it is a one to one three one for one five one to one three one for one five and they had people actually perform this and they measured their speed and accuracy and then they had them do a practicesession that was either an intentional tasks tho one group just looked at an attentional cue and had to maintain a focus on that attentional cue and another group did mental practice they basely did fifty imagine trial just in their minds eye of this one to one three one for one five reon repeat oct fifty trials much in the same way as what i reference as the ideal protocal earlier fifty rounds that then they got tested again on the motor task in the real world and there were also recordings of the sarabellar to primary motor quartex communication there were a bunch of different results in the study i think ere interesting but once are most important are that quo we found that mental practice enhancs both a speed and accuracy of this one to one three one for one five performance in the real world when people did these fifty imagine trials there are many results out there diffe n papers that parallel and essentially say the same thing as what is said in this paper remember there'e been studies of mental training dating bac to the eighteen eighties but what this paper rally does it looks at the norl machinery in the changes in the nural machinery and what they found using transtranial magnetic stimulation both in the context of stimulating but also recording activity in conactivity between sarabellum and primary motor quartecs is that mental training enhanced the net excitation of sarabellum to motor quartecs communication that is it reduced the inibition in a way that a loud motor quartec to generate these movements with more accuracy and more speed what is also interesting about this papers that it showed that the improvement in performance of this task was not related to activation of the motor pathways themselves it is not the case of the sarabellum activation or inibition changed the patterns of excitation going directly to the spinal cord as those pathways actually exist through a couple of intermediate stations what it really showed is that when people do mental training and here you could say icave fifty trials that is a lot or trials but it is not actally that many trials is pretty fast learning if you think about do with task in the real world do fifty trials of the imagine task do the tral in the real world again significant improvement in speed and accuracy through now what are becoming to be establish noral circuit connections between sarabellum and primary motor quartecs cis this study is one of several but not a tremendous number studies out there that are trying to really pin point the underlying noral circuits that allow mental training ovisualization to really improve motor skill performance but again and please hear me on this in this study and in the vast majority of other studies that have shown significant improvement in motor performance in the real world by use of mental training visualization there was an ability of each in everyone in the study to perform the specific motor sequen in the real world that then they were able to enhance with mental training invisualization now thus far we have been talking mostly about performance of motor sequences and one of the things to really understand about performance of motor sequences both in the real world and in the imagine contects is that it involves the doing as we call a go action and not doing certain things i mean by not doing well for many tasks out there are even ones as simple as the one to one three one for hone five tasks that we talked abut a moment ago there is the need not just to tap those fingers in the correct sequence as quickly as possible but also to be accurate about it to not do one three one for or one three and four at the same time there is both a go component an action component and a withhold action component and the ability to withhold action is strongly constrained by the time domain in other words the faster that we need to perform a given motor sequence the more likely we are to perform incorrect components of the motor sequences well one of the key things about mental training of visualization that is really remarkable is that it can also be used and has been shown to improve not just go aspects of motor performance and cognant performance but also no go aspects of motor performance and skill learning now the go no go thing is something i've discussed before on the spodcast in reference to the cale basel ganglia basel ganglia are sub cortical that below that bumpy surface of the human brain that were most accustomed to seing when we look at it from the outside and the bazal ganglia are strongly involved in go verses no go type tasks and learning no there are only a few studies that have really looked at the learning and the improvement of no god componence of motor learning but these no go components are really really important in fact if we were to look at what is involved at improvement in a gulfswing or shooting free th rows or getting better at piano or getting better at math or language speaking i think it is fair to say that at least half and probably as much as seventy five per cent of motor learning is about restricting inappropriate movements or utterances or thoughts if what you are trying to learn is purely cognative i think that is an important point that brings us back to our initial learning when we come into this world that developmental plastesy which as you recall we have a lot of interconnected aspects of our brain and nervous system early in life remember the example f the kid trying to eat and getting the spoon of food and bowl on their head et cetera and then over time getting more accurate at bringing food to their mouth and eating in t in a clean waythings that most but not all people accomplish in at some point in the course of their lifetime well there hven't been many but there been a few very interesting studies looking at how mental training invisualization can improve the nogo aspect of motor learning and i think this is important to highlight because it really mirrors what is done in the real world as ppose tod just the finger tapping type things which are mostly go tasks again there is a lwbit of a nogo component there but there ar specific tasks that people have developed for the laboratory that really closely mimic action learning and cognive learning in the real world and one of the mor a important of those is what is called the stop signal task now the stop signal task of something that i'll explain to you i'll also provide a link in the shownote captions we can tried it is ashally a lot of fun to try this because it really gives you a sense of just ow challenging some of these laboratory tasks are tlet me just describe it for a moment the stop signal task was really developed in popularized by gordan logan and william cowan gernlogan is at vanderbilt university and has done a lot of really important work but one of the important aspects of his work is looking at motor performance and skill acquisition and the development of the stop signal task i'll describe the stop signal task for you now in broad contour you or another research s object would sit in front of a screen there are two keys on that keyboard or two keys among the other keys on that keyboard one which is designated left the other which is designated right and then on the screen you'ld be presented for instancs with a left facing or a right facing arrow in the initial trial would happen is that arrow would pop up on the screen and your job is to press the left key when the right facing arrow is presented you press the right key ipry straightforward but there is a limited amount of time in whic you can do this and the ideais that you'are going to need to do this within approximately five hundred milloseconds o the presentation of that arrow or else it is going to tell you that you miss that trial of course if you press the wrong key sof the arragos left and you press the right key than you would be told you got that one wrong ok this is a reaction time test and not one that is particularly novel what is novel and what logan and cow an developed was that in the stop signal task every once in a while not every trial but every once in a while that arro is presented and then with some delay ranging a anywhere from a hundred millseconds to may be three hundred fifty milloseconds there would be a red circle or a red axe also presented which is a stop signal and your job is to not press the key that corresponds to the direction of arrow in fact not press any key at all now you can imagine how if the stop signal shows up with a longer delay after the presentation of the arrow there is a higher probability that you will already generated the key pressing movement kaso at the link that we providein the show note caption you can actually do these two tasks and whatyou will find is that you and most people will be able to do this arrow to reaction time pressing of the left aright key somewhere in the neighborhood between three hundred milloseconds an may be as long as five hundred la second telay you will get an average of how quickly you respond and then of course if you choose to and i would hope you wouldchoose to go on n indo the stop signal task you will be told trial by trial whether not you are hitting the right keys because if you are you will be allowed to progress to the next trial or if you are told to stop that is you get the stop signal and you press the key anyway you will be told that you made an error because you did not stop now again with very short delays between the presentation of the arrow and the stop signal you are gong to be much better at inhibiting or preventing yourself from the behavior at the no go aspect of motor execution that is what you will find is that if the stop signal is presented very shortly after what is a a hundred millseconds which is very very brief mount of time after the presentation of the arrow there is a good chance that you are going to be able to withhold the key pressing behavior however if the delay is anywhere from two hundred to three hundred fifty millo seconds after the presentation of the arrow chances are that you are going to press the button even when you should not have on at least some of those trials and if you try ind game the system and wait a certain amount of time after the presentation of each arrow there wil also be times in which the stop signal does not appear and you fail to hit the button in the appropriate amount of time the fund will task it does not not cost anything or that may be a couple minutes of your time and if you have time to go to it i think it om it will give you much deeper flavor for the sorts of experiments that were talking about here and that find that these stop signals are actally pretty hard to generate when you'e trying to learn some new motor behaviore and that actully illustrates a a bigger point here if to day you send th we have been talking about studies of ou no tapping fingers and you a stopping button presses and that those examples are highly artificial and do not really translate to the real world well keep in mind that the tasks that are used in these studies really target the specific naral circuits that is the same narral circuits that you would use for the performance of essentially any motor task now of course other motor tasklic ones where you involve your feet or cognive task where you have to think really hard about specific information and search for that information assemble it in particular ways of course involve other norons and nural circuits that we have not discussd to day but the core components of these go and nogo task or the stop signal task really capture the core elements of most all of cognative end or motor learning in some way that is fundamentally important ocaso they have real world relevants the paper that had lect to just briefly described to you is entitled motor imagery combined with physical training improves response in abition in the stop signal task that titles a little bit a wordy but now what the stop signal task is and what this paper essentially found was that if people did physical training the sort of experiment that i just described verses mental training where they sat eyes open and imagine their responses to those arrows and stop signals but they did not actually generate any key presses verses a commination of the physical training the actual pressing of the buttons or with holding pressing of the buttons as the case may be plus mental training over the course of about five days using the contour described of the key principls of mental training performance we talked about ill get to the specifics in moment but it really obeyed most all of what we have talked about if not all of it repetition simple repeated over about five days and on and forth what they found was that the mental training and physical training group mental end realworld training groups perform significantly better in the stop signal reaction time that is they were able to with hold action when they needed to withhold action more frequently and with more accuracy vended either the physical training or mental training groups alone this actually spits in the face of what we said earlier which is that physical training is always better than mental training and mental training is always better than no training and it is important to point out here that both the physical training and the mental training groups experience significant improvements in their reaction time and accuracy at the stop signal task but in the case of this study which is exploring the withholding of inappropriate behaviors the commination of mental trining and physical training out performed either physical or mental training alone while earlier we said that if you have a certain amount of time in order to train something up physical training is always goingto be better then mental training will here we have somewhat of an exception where if the thing you are trying to learn involves withholding mistakes as opposed to tring it generate the right behaviors persay well then you are probably better off doing a commination of mental training and physical training let me state that lobit differently if you are finding that youre screwing up something not because you cannot initiate that particular mote of behavior but you are doing the wrong thing at the wrong time you are not able to withhold a particular action well then in that case mental training in commination with physical training becomes especially important for you coachis for you students out there keep that in mind when trying to learn how to withhold particular action sequences becausethey are not serving you well in the real world using a commination of real world training and physical training is actually better for you on an hour per our basis then is physical training alone a couple of key details about this study should you decide to implement these protocols in thes study they did approximately thirty trials of the thing that they were trying to get better at now they did those in the real world in this case the stop signal task wile actually pressing those buttons and then they had a testphase of about a hundred and forty for go trials and bout forty eight stop trials o case this is important if you are a coach ore your student or youre justcon itself direct this kind of learning in your self directed adaptive plasticity it is important tht you mix in both go and nogo trials was not always the case that there was a stop signal generated the other thng those really impressive about the study is that the changes occurred very quickly the training was performed five times over five days once a day for five days again back to this three to five times per week principle and the improvements were really significant in some cases in fact if you a decide to produce this paper you can go to a table too you can see now in some cases a near doubling in the reduction in reaction time through a combination of mental and physical training compared to physical training alone or mental training alone again however both physical training and mental training groups alone saw significant improvements but the combination of mental training of physical training was far greater than yu saw with either one of those alones that is all nicely quantified for you in this paper again a really this paper despite it not involving a huge number of subjects i think it is a key paper because it really points to such an important element of motor learning and training which is this action with holding component this nogo component that here is captured nicely in the stop signal task before we round up our de scussion about motor training of visualization whone did jis briefly touch on some of the study es that of explored why certain individuals are better or worse at motor training invisualization and what that might correlate with at the beginning of todays episode i briefly mention affantagia which is this phenomenon were some people just simply cannot or seem to have extreme challenge generating visual imagery in a number of studies exploring how affentagiics as there sometimes called al though nowadays it is a not considered polite if you will to refer to people according to their condition for instance propasagnosia is a condition in which people are unable to recognize particular faces and in the past these people wer referrd to as propasagnosics o ca as if their condition defined them a right a nowadays it is not consider polite to do that rather we say the person has propeagnosia or suffers from propasagnosia althoug there ould suffer than also has become a lofit tuchy i'm going to do my best to jistry me as clear as possible here and explain that people who have affantasia can have affantasia to varying degrees they can either have a complete absence of ability to generate mental imagery or they have a poor or count of rudimentary ability to generate visual imagery in their minds eye it was thought that people o have affantasia or not capable of what is called cynesthesia cyneshesias or when people have perceptional blending and this is not while under the influence of any kind of psychodelic or other kind of drug perceptina blending of an atypical kind or rare kind i actualy have some friends i two friends that have different forms of cynesesia one associates different keys on the piano or musical notes with specific colors in a very very one to one specific way they will tell you that e flat on the piano is a particular tone in their mind of o amber hue o ka and that i forget what other key is associate with a particular shade of red and on and forth are these people better at piano are they more perceptive of colors in their environment not necessarily this just ha perceptional blending it does not necessarily lend itself to any improved ability now you could imagine why people would hypothesize that people have affantasia specially it is eextreme form would not be capable of or have cynesthesias it turns out that is not the case a couple of ly interesting papers again we will a lengthies in the shownot captions a one is entitled what is the relationship between affantasia cynesesi and autism and the other one is affantasia the science of visual imagery extr reams and i realy the review affantasia the science of visual imagery extremes for those of youthat are interested in understanding affantasia with more depth the study addressing the relationship between affantasiou cynesesian autism found that affantasia is indeed link to weak visual imagery but that affantasious can also be cynestegics and vice versa what was also interesting about the study is they address the question of whether or not people who have affantasia that is a challenge or inability to generate mental or visual imagery ten have features associate with autism or residing somewhere on the autism spectrum and i am not trying to use ambiguous language here but the whole set of language in nomenclature around autism and autism spectrum is also undergoing revision now because we are now coming to understand that autism and nowadays its generally not considered correct to call people autistics in that sense but autism is considered one set of positions along a spectrum that includes things asperers et cetera but that may also include other aspects of cognition and even personality these are strying to be viewed not just as a spectrum or one continuum ranging from nonartistic to artistic but a lot of variation and subtlety and between and even crossing over with other aspects of a personality sycholiogy and narrow science ges sow i'm not trying o be vague here i am trying to be accurate rather by saying the whole description and caterization of artistic nonartistic et cetera is undergoing vast rovision right now but the important point i think from this paper is that indeed it was found that people who have affantasia tend to exhibit more of the features that are associated with the autism spectrum now how those things relate to one another interms of the clinical relevante is not clear and of course it is entirely unclear as to what is the chicken and what is the egg there you coal imagine nopun intended for instance that people that are on the autism spectrum might be less proficient at generating visual imagery because they are exceedingly proficient at other things you could also imagine that people are placed on to the autism spectrum is it sometimes referred to or are associate with particular features on the autism spectrum because in a causal way of the afventasia and of course it is extremely important highlight that not all people that consider themselves are that people consider autistic or that are on the autism spectrum or aspergers are anyvariation thereof necessarily ave afventasia just as it is that not all people that are on the autism spectrum completely lack or even lack what iscalled theory of mind which is the ability to sor f empathizing a bscribe feelings and motivations of others when viewing the actions and perceived feelings of others what i just describe hopefully does not come across as just a bunch of word soup what i am trying to pin point is that there does seem to be a relationship between one's ability to generate visual imagery and certain constellations of cognitive and emotional perception and behavior end vice versa in a future episode i promise to cover cynesisia and autism and some of the related cognitive and motor aspects of autism and things aspergers i am going to feature an expert guests or actually several exert guests in this area because it is a rapidly evolving and somewhat controversial field meanwhile i think it is important to at least consider how mental training in visualization might relate to certain aspects of cognition and our ability to visualized things nochust in terms of other people's behavior which is one of the common ways that people probe for autism and aspergers ferst as nonautistic and non asprgers and on the called theory of mine task in effect asking whether not children r redults can really get in th mind of others as a typical task develop by simon barren con but also whether r not children and adults or capable of generating mental imagery in a really vivid way or whether not they have miner or even extreme challenge in doing and perhaps the most direct way to explain why included this aspect of the discussion of mental training o visualization as it relates to different cognitive fenatypes or neuro cognive finatypes such as autism assburgers et cetera is because if you think about motor skill execution or cognive skill execution and the relationship between mental training o visualization and motor skills or cogniov skills that is all pretty straightforward when you'r toge about finger tapping and go nogo tasks and learning piano and things of that sort but in many many ways our learning of social cognition are learning of how to behave in certain circumstances what is considered normal or a typical neuro typical and neuro atypical if you will a lot of that is not just generated from the inside out but it also involves observation and visualization of what are considered appropriate and inappropriate definitely placed in quotes by the way folks i'm not placing judgment i'm justayn appropriate and inappropriate for given context behavior in other words social learning and social cognition is every bit as much a learned behavior and pattern of cogniven motor patterns as is tapping fingers or with holding keypresses in a go nogo task is just that it transmits into a domain that involves smiling verses frowning verses asking a question verses staying silint verses sitting still verses fidgeting what is appropriate and when what is inappropriate and when all of that is what we call social cognition and has direct parallels to everything we have been talking about up in to this point to day we did a deep dive which is often the case on this podcast in to mental training and visualization during the course of the episode i tri to lay down one by one the key components of an effective ment al training of visualization practice ything ranging from making sure that the practice involve brief epochs repeats of specific sequences of motor and ore cognive behavior that those be relatively simple tht you can imagine them even if you are somebody who is not good at doing mental trainig of visualization and i should mention that if you do mental training of visualization repeatedly over time you get better at mental training of visualization there is a what is alled met a plasticity here sois not just about engaging neural plasticity of particular circuits is also about getting better at engaging plasticity plasticity of plasticity i also describe the key importance of being able to actually execute specific movements and cognive tasks in the real world if you want the mental trining of visualization to be especially effective and we talked about the importance of naming things we talked about the importance of creating not just one but many parallels between real world training and mental training in visualization and really on the whole what we established was that cognitive and or motor learning really is something that you should do in the real world as much as possible but if you cannot do to injuryor whatever conditions using mental training is a reasonable substitute but not a complete substitute and if you cannot do real world training for whatever reason injury or otherwise that mental training is going to be better than no training at all and of course we established that at least for with holding action in order to get better at a skill a combination of physical training o mental training is going to be best but that if you are trying to learn a new skill and you'r having challenges with performing that skill because of an inability to do the skill in the first place whereon a consistent basis will then on an hour by our basis you are best off investing your time into the physical training only in corporating mental training and visualization if you are able to do that on top of the maximum amount of real world training that youare capable of doing and of course we talked about the actual neural circuits and a bit about how the actual neral plasticity occurs early in the episode i mention long term depression well in describing the improvements in nogo task those stop signal tasks a lot of what is observe during those tasks is improvement or rather an increase in long derm depression of specific neral connections my hope is that in learning about those basicneral circuits and plastesy mechanisms and in learning about the critical importance of focus and attention during learning both real world and imagin as well as the importance of sleep and deep rest for really consolidating learning and the different tools the various steps or principles of affectamental training visualization that you now have a fairly coherent or maybeven a very coherent picture of how to develop the best mental training of visualization protocols for you i realize that everyone has different goals everyone has different time constraints if you are somebody that is interested in developing a mental training of visualization protocol if your coach or teacher or simply a learner or you are trying to self direct your own adaptive plasticity i want emphasize that the key components tat we discuss today are essential to include but i would not obcess about whether or not i given epoch is fifteen or twenty seconds or even twenty five seconds i would not obsess over whether not you got thirty repetitions in and then your mind drifted or whether not you could do the full fifty to seventy five or whether not even in your mind's eye you made some errors what is been shown over and over again in this literature is that performing mental training of visualisation repeatedly and in a very restricted way that makes it easy eur to perform those trials over and over and over again and with the high degree of accuracy almost always really we can fairly say in essentially every study where it is been explored has led to improvements in real world performance of both cognitive and or physical tasks if you are trying to learn anything at all i do encourage you to explore motor training in visualization because basically all the studies out there fact i could not find one exception where some d egree of improvement was not observed when people use motor training o visualization on a consistent basis even just the three to five times for week these simple repeats over and over do not wanto over complicade or make it sound mental training on visualization has to be performed in a very precise way or that it has to be done perfectly each in every time quite to the contrary what is clear is that mental training o visualization is a very effective way to improve real world

ready because boy have i got an election for you because that is essential with this election is now going tobe as sunconme election about the issues it may not even be an election about the economy if jobidon is n't eedhenominy if he survives to actually be the nomine ligen now he is not lookin great and if donnt trump on the other side is the nominy its just going o be democrats accusing republicans of being lawbreakers an republicans acusing democrats o being lawbriakers because here is the deal jobidon's squeaky clean i'm above board image whatever image existed for those who are't watching closely o last thirty years of jobin's political creer that image is now crumbling and that is a massive problem for him as i said yesterday whatever mud you throw donal trump has no fact the man is made of mud when you throw mud at jobidon it has ha significant of fact on his poll numbers and his worst nightmarit is now coming true because all of the hunter bidon stuff is now breaking wide out into the open to understand exactly what is happening here you have to begin with jobidon's claims for the past several years here is montage of jobidan explaining his relationship two hunter bidon's business is him sang over and over and over and over again that they never talked about businesses he never knew about businessis he knew nothing nothing he know nothing here here is jobidon explaining this for years on end an you ever spokin tor son about a omer fein infi if fairing i've never sproken my fone meers inin what is your understanding of what your son was doing porn extraordinary amout i do not know what he was doing i know who was on the board i found out who as on the board after his on eboard and thot was it and there is nobody oa lot of time is not there something you want to get to the bottome no because i trust my son i have not taken of pany from any forn sore ever in my life we learn tis tresident pay fifty times to taks in china has a secret bankaccount with china does business in china and in fact is talking about me taking money i've not taken tha single penny from any country what ever ever my son has not made money in terms of this thing about a wouldhe talking bout china i have not had the only guid made money from china is this ci the only one nobody else has made money from chin anthat is a lie gat an it turns out put much all of this is lies in fact when con fronted about hunter bidon's business activities jobidentes get very very angry and that by the way is what they call the tell when jobidn gets very very angry when gets very in a huff about a thing it is likely because he did the thing yoeres peter ducey asking bidan question and bid in being a querulous old man i gri o i na o i er i e investin m inwiin ere

i co try o te ton e er smear me i everybide look a and everybody's mook adi tretors nopeny there a e ri quet ye and this enit yf fat has in whenever jobidon gets false angry that than he have whipes himself up in to actual rage it is because he probably did the things well deven archer who was hunter biden's business partner for a significant period of time when tens of millions of dollars removing through various different accounts associated with hunter bido he testified in front o congress yesterday and james komer who is the chairman of the house committee on oversighten accountability put together a statemen following a four our transcribed interview with thecommittee and here is what he says quok deven archer's testimony today confirms jobiden lige to the american people when he said he had no knowledge about has sons business dealingston was not involved jobidon was the brand his son solds around the world to enrich the biton family when jobidon was vice president of the united states he joined hunter biden for dinner with his forn business associates in person or by speakerphone over twenty times when berima's owner was facing pressur from the ucrani in prosecutor investigating the company for corruption archer testified that berizma executives asked hunter to call d c after a berizma board meeting in juby by the way that mesher's very closely with the whistle blower account to the f bi the the confidential human source accounts to the f bi that suggested that the head of berizma had said that he had paid money to joe and hunter in order to get victor shoke in the prosecurin neu crain fired said he would stope looking into berizma now by the way it could be that the head of berizma said that because hunter had told him that and that hunter did' acturally achieved that but it does not matter because the bottom line is that joe was deeply involved at least to the extent that he knew what was going on with prety much all of this comers as why dod jobidon lide to theamerican people about his family's business dealings and his involvemen begs the question what else he is hiding from the american people the house commitee on oversit an accountability will continue to follow the bidin's money trail and interview witness is to determined whether foran actors targeted the bidons present bide is compromised and corrupt in our national security is threatened here are the ky takways one deven archer testified that the value of adding hunter bidin to brizmas board was the brand and confirmed that then vice president tobiden was the brand net by te way hunter is openly said this hunter was asked why we gettin paid tons of money to be an berizma's worrisics my last name is biden archer ad mitted that berizma would have gone out of business if the brand had not been attached to it he believe that hnter bidon being on the board and the bidon brand contributed to berizma's launch tivity he bewouldhav be intimidated to mast with berisema legally because the biton brand he testified in december of twenty fifteen my ckollis lachevsky owner of brizma and va deem porcharsky and executive berizma place constant presher on hunter biden to help to get help from d c regarding you kranian proskuer victor shokin schokin was in vestigating berrysmat for corruption hunter alone with s love chewky an pocharsky called d c to discuss the matter bidon's lochewsky and pjarsky stepped away to make the call this raise the concerns that hunter was in violation of the foregn ations rengistration ac limin clearly he was it is be realed out this the gui was working on a forein bored on american polsey to benefit a foreign company i mea there is hes texbook far aviolations teven archer testified that hunter bdon put then vice presen en jobidon on the speakerphone during business metings over twenty times apparently archer tustified the jobidn was put on the phone to sall the brand thosephone calls in cluded a dinner in paris with the french energy company and in china with jonathan lee the c o b char arsher ac knowledge then vis presedet an bidon had calfy with jonathan lee c o b char in bching then vis presin an

a business dinner with this son hunter an his associates at kafin malano in washington to s alina baterina russian oligarkh was the widow of the form mayor of moscow attended tho dinner notably the bide administrations public sanctions lest for russian oligarks does not contain batterina and there is more there as welget to in just one at moment all this is very bad nes for jobine becase you head the clits of him a knew nothing bout the business has it was not involved inthe business says whatever hunter was doing as well hunterma he was on the phone he was on the phone for all of this sort of stuff and of course jo openly braggd bout getting victor schokan fired which just happen o murge with exactly what his son was lobby ing for his son wanted victor shokan fired and then bidn bragg about getting victor shokan fire now he is making the cavs that everybody wanted victor shokan fired to schokin was corrupt it welcome to you krane i mean seriously to every one in you krane his corrupt when comes to the government every's known this for deckades but only schokin was worthy of jobidon calling op and threatening to withdraw billion dollars in aid from eu krane unless they

someone who was sole i get by the way it f you do not think that jobidon is the kind of pathalogical lir who would have the gall to tell a story about how he was rooting out corruption while being corrupt ammae latching jobidon for thirty five years cajobidon is exactly that kind of person the is a gy who shamelessly lied about every element of his career for the first fifteen years of his career much ged to drop out of the presidential rays for being a platerist and for lying about is college record and for lying about everything else cobidon is the kind of person who lies about the circumstances of his former wifestaff in a car crash by by openly lawng about the other person involved in the car crash sug gesting for years that the goi was driving drunk and essentially ruining his life tobidn is a very bad person ka jobidon is not in above board honest fellow and if you think that he does not have the gall or the temerity to do this sort of stuff while openly bragging about

wealthiest women the widow of the former mayor of moscow in close ally of moscocktirent ladimer pooten according to sources jobne just happens to be beting with everybody who could possibly help out o son weard how that works super duper weird the white house is now responding to all of these alligations and hre sayng al there is nothing here an nothing is uso noticse how the gol posts they they started off moving andthen ais mollyhammin way the faerales points out they have now ben kicked into the oceon man there ther in the middle of deep sea right now an the next to that sunkin titanic a according to the white house quote it appears the house re publicans own much type witness to day testified he had never heard of presseng an by n discussing business with his son are his sons associates or doing anything wrong or doing anything wrong o key i'llexplain to saying why this is ridiculos house republicans keep promising bomshell evidence to support thei ridiculous attacts against the president but time after time that keep failing to produce anny in fact even their own witnesses appear to be debunking their allegations instead of continuing to waste time in resources on this evidence free wild goose chase house re publican should drop thesete unts and work with the presidents on the issues that actually impbet ofl case here is the reason this is insamely stupid the claim of the white house is that because daven archer testified that jobidins did not openly discuss every aspect of business with the people that hunter woul get joe on the phone with that means that joe was not involved in thebusiness that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard in my life if your influence paddling the entirer operation is based on plausible deni ability it can openly influence fetdle mn it joe on the phoneishas millic what is ha tige toget victer shokgiv kinnigamise on likht no nn i hundreds of thousands dollars and o an ofl pirers you think he is going to say that or is the conversation going to gos something thas hunter walks in th room sai lant eighty three grando mun and i'll get daddy on fu no i got my dad weve conversations we will not do it over the funks where not totally stupid he will do i ve attac on what is hapt is more on but we will not do it what we will not doang ya what wat well have coms and what you need to get on you will gets on and as proof that me am i dadt er tight let me get im on the phone right now click here is the phone joe is o i how is the weather over there in in in you cran that is how the stuff works obviously believe ofr not these slim u read that democrats are relying upon here to protect to jobidon is the idea t when joe bidon gets on the phone during business meetings with hunter is that joe actually just likes discussing weather with people ranimly tht thats actually what this is that joe ranimly a louse hunter to call him with just randos on the be andthen the you talk about the weather just happens all the time and sure it me he doesit was russin oligarcs who give a hundred million dollars to different firms with which hunter bidn associatein sure he does wit beresmo and surey does it with wide varieties o foreign companies including chinese companies and sure he writes letters for the hads of those companies kids seen do cot he does not all of those things mes all of that just because do likes talking about the weather now i know much you talking about the weather i'll tellyou this i do not ranimally call people or tick calls frm people to talk about the weather it is not a thing i do if if somebody calls me on a business phone call and his talking bout that they are not talking about the weather obviously the whole point is i can get my daddy the vice presient of the united states on the phone at any moment dad is that you ah hunters me m arthe click see ang gim mi down on the pone at any time we will solve the problem for you that is how the com and then magically it turns out that some of the promis actually get solved victor shokin the god goes away and then jobidin brags bout how he is an anti corruption fighter well his son is bagging hundreds of thousands up dollars promising that that is exactly bot wou happen is that just a giant coinciden's by the way that is realy what we are being asked to believe that is all coincidens whe're as to believe that hunter went on the board of berizma promising access to jobidon and promising that the bidin lask name would sheo berizma and tht he promise everybody apperizma that you would work i'm getting schokan fired and that just coincidensally his daddy got chokan fired that is waere no relation chinese walvves upperation nobody knows who is talking to whom i'm me sure that fhone calls iner but but no ne no that is that is wore being ask to believe and demo crats are saying tha if you ask questions about this that is because you are the problem you are pouncing you are crup actually there is nothing to see here there is absoly nothing to see here now af for five won years of stupid jabber from democrats bat how there is a smoking gun that theythat gladmer pooten and donal trumpere working together and thy were rigging the election in behalf of tong from he using festbook becauses donald trum really needed ladmer poutento in pit on face that there is all corrupt and the smoking on was around the corner and turn out all that was wise af tor five yer's that we are being told bi the ye saein exact people there is nothing to see here no one believes this no one believes this and it is impossible to look at the juxti position of hunters business activities and now what hunter's bus again this is not the first hunter bidin business partment to say this tony bobylinsky sto the exactin thing tony bobylinsky said years ago that jobin was stopping by business meetings and hang in alt with people he said this again hunter tacit his own towater saying he pays dads bills i do not no what you need others than an actual bank account wire showing money moving from hunts or two job heres thing he is n'ng have to do that because i'r n works with your parents if i got to dnnerwith my parents i jus pay for dinner out wir money my parents bank account to pay for dinner if hunter wants to pay jofs expenses ho to pay jofs expenses wy the money does not actually have to that is the beauty of being a member of a family thes wie family corruption is common by the way thee to more of this in just one second because what you'r being askd to believe is the dummest crap

started o cay again whatyour be asked to believe its the domis crap maginable and naturally democrats are trotting out when people talk about the double standard here it is really quite insane remember donal trump was impeached the first time is he schwies i's impeach the first time by the house over a phone call with the president of you crane of lotamers lensky telling him that he might withhold military aid if they did not dig up dirt on hunter bidon meanwhile the accusation here which appears to be fairly well founded is that joe bidon openly threatened you crane that you withdraw one billion dollars in aid unless they fire a prosecutor who just happen to be looking into the into his son's company that is the it is amazing and the same people who prosecuted impeachment one agains tromp those exaccient people are now rushing ywo jobidon's defence which just shows you the politics it is a game of vum it is a game of pirisonship purely and simply it is either wrong in bothcases areits wrong an neither case but tis really amazing stuff sto represent ofe dan golman again he is wone the impeachment prosecutors watch watch out are these golposte moves he is now says it is a preposterous premis you say that joe should not be talking with hunters business associates why is that preposterous you's the vice president of the united state should not he be above board and clean as the drivens know ait thi is thin tat e never talk att abot ise tots thorly talk oe botwoer wu ever b he ta ete tat is never other's cocker di ni i do not know what his comment is and if we are gon it why do not i do not think that is what he said he never said that he has never spoken to anyone he said that he had nothing to ge it with hunter bidon's business dealings if he says hello to some one on that he sees his son with what is he supposed to say hi son o no nocking ta say hullo to the other people at the taple or the other people on the phone it is kind of a preposterous premise to think that a father should not say hullo to people that the son are at dinner with the son is at dinner with and that is literally all the evidences no that 's not all the evidence is the evidence is that hunter calld dadding on thphone twenty times with different business pardners the evdence is that joe wrote letters recommendation for people with whom hunter bide was in business the evidence is that joe stopped by dinners an sat down and talked to people that is what influence peddling is they are asking you to be a more on nhere they believe your tupid that is all it is vere it is very obvious they believe that ting just gas you ininto thing nothing untoward happened here when every indicators that something on toward happened here wet tomor on this in just one second first

them pictrom proscutors he says to proposterous premise you say that yo should not be talk with hunder's business associates thes afterjoe has spent years saing he knew nothing about the business is that he never literally nothing they he not not her anything they keep moving the olpos and then dangolman emphasizes that shure hunter put john speakerphon but they were just talking about the weather an asking you to be such a more on here they wre just tigma he is easly real sweaty here because iit turns out that this notga defense they are just talking about the weather it is impossible to describe what a weak defense this is if you were prossecuting let say a rekocase against the moff ya and a low level hit man told you i talk routinely with the head of the off ya iw'ld get him on the phone and i would use him as lad i walk into a bar tinto a bar and i would i would take to the bar tender i need you to give it give me tan gran romin o shut down you ba you do not believe that 'm connected guy listen to this picks up the phone calls them mabos moblaskoes is it sonthe outsider as the raining outside they are talking about the weather is that a conversation about the weather or s that not a conversation that is not a conversation about th weather that is showing that the influence peddling is in operation that is the entire purpose but here is dan golman o well probably the ore just walking about the weather probably joidn't really just wanted to know how the weather was over in keeve socan permes thing that the speaker on conversations they do not thin concerning o you because there is noti te its about business they just see lik e res clear that it was clear ta that it was part of the daily conversations that hunter by then had with his father am and i was and and soundis most of the time a now presenent by them dideven no tho the people he was at dinner he was just asked to say hallo aand he would talk about the wat the way you described it several times they asked over and over nd over he described wut the weather was how i how what is going on on yourand he it the witness was very very consistent that none of those conversations ever had to do with any business dealings or transactions of course they did not ecause the minut you say the business youare now in clear violation of federal waw of course da yagain let them mou sess you this you parents rit you' been to busines dinner correct your parent some times call you during th business dinner this appens to me all the done i'm very close ao my parents sometimes they call me on the phone sometimes i do not pick up becaue i'm in themidle of he business dinner and sometimes if i feel a surgent i do pick up and you kno what i do i see excuse me foks and i get up and i go outside to talk to my parents because it is not relevant to the rest of the con versation that my dads on the phone het lik tt is the stupidest ofence i've ever heard the defencis that do you do that youre your parent calls you to business danelic hopim yeu my dads on the phone i pun you mon speaker you's wants to say halo and talk about the wether yad tat hows the dog doing do you do that have you ever done that why would you do such a thing lema said under what circumstances would you do this thing there is only one reason because you want everybody at the table to know about the relationship that you have with your dad because it is relevant in some way to e generalized conversation that is happening at the table it is an influence padling operation clearly openly everyone knows it hey be nownisince toningaboutlinsky hey'v knownicsons fonter about e labtop and now there studiously trying to avoid the consequences of this democrats have now moved to the next step of the defence because this is not going to last the next step of the efences there is no proof that hunter ever did anything the benefited joe there is no proof and not only that we was you shous sup looking probably we should not look at any of the ieress we souldn' look at any of the bank account records we should not tried up peersoning corporate bales we shouln't try to figure out ixactly how the money moved we should't even look at who paid joe's expenses because joe has reported way more wealth than his income would actually suggest at there is at the is several million unexplain dollars injo bidon's wealth then no one knows where came from and it is kind of weird here is democrats now claiming we do not need to know we doft need know it is all it is probably fine ises it is probably above board and totally find here yere are democrats saying there is no evidence joe ever benefited for any of this he not hen ut it was all clinkyting he never ben if by the way it is in fact a benefit when you'r children benefit from this i just just a point this out joe would not have to directly benefit in order for this to be bribery if there i've somebody said to joe hunter is etting paid a lot of money he is gain pade a lot of money in order to a shieve acts can you help axts happen and your public official he does not need to see money hit his own bank account to benefit him as a parent i care very much about my children i soon that joe cares very much about hunter and who pays hunter's bills for his crack presumably that money was either coming from joe or for some one else in the family or fromsons some outside olgarc an we k o for a fact that business associates of jobe an paying hunters businessbils his legal bills then bying his crap pintings his garbage pain things they mut panglet half a million dollet it is perfectly in line for jo bidon to have outside sorce is paying his son and his son benefiting from that and that acting as a formal bribery if you are entire family benefits from the bribery and you are over here living your life but you are the one wh's actually brokering the thing yah that still bribery ocate does notnectualake to hit his bank account but thas can o be the next offence will you can nectually sho a formal dollar being moved from this chinese yf s fon intwo jobidon's personal bank account hi's the next line they are going to use far they have been not able to prove any avenince here al ron doing house go pe members continue to trying link hunter's business dealings to the president though they have yet to produce an y con crete evident thow is aporn to c ben y be e publicns bele te te is e ti e pre hunter bys pisis telin a te presiden himself t yet to by t an hardt avidenc te the presien himself as ton e tin all owse oe oe cevens i harther ther go to me factis e teten us oa i te to have the evidence or noran erepublicans an not tide the priseten o jo bian two profiteerings from them thn did not have he evidence yad where is the evidence there is no evidence a any wrong dealing bya president there is to da i zero eviden tero evidnce en co by t presten is ta new ou what is song was doing ofl get firstof all los of evidence that he knew exactly what his son was doing literally we have a what is that message from hunter bidon to a fuorn olegarch in china saing my daddy is sitting next to mee right at this moment according dangoman probably they re are sitting there talk about the weather or something probably but by the way it is worth noting yukat ilimal to thousand twenty two jo bidon agreed to pay son hunters legalfees for his deal with the chines government controlled company e mills reveal the revelation ties the presidents even closer to hunters oversee's business dealins and makes his previous clans you never discuss them with this son even less plausible joe was able to pay those bills after earning millions of buck through his an his wife's companies after he left office as v p some o the waye of cash came from their bookdeals an speaking engagements but the presidents financial filings reveal he declared almost seven million more dollars on his tact returns then he did on his government transparency reports some tat difference can be accountsed for with salaries earned by the first lady jobidon and others soms not required on his reports but that leaves five point to million dollars earned by jofs compay not listed on his transparence y reports those are missing millions where did those come from first of all yourn't actualy ned to prove ho the money hit jobidon's bank account all youn to proves that money hit hunter bidon's bankacants that benefits jo quite obviously but where them money come from the nowning care whor is the medis can a continued run interference apparently thearingn a start by runnig interference you the een doing it the whole time there would see an and yesterday saing you kno gys really i'm not tory this to bedeal they ever talk business they were just talking about the weather that this is litter it is it is legitimately one the worst excuses for corruption i've ever heard they were talking about the weather is this ones up there with hillery clinten saying why ked with a cloth yes they were talking about the weather because i routeinely get my father on the phone during my business dealings to discuss the weather for no reason the gomins are 't explaining that archer qualified an thethe top s te discussion on these fon calls his niceties that bodin an ot tan even know who as im in on the other line with his son hunter and you na sorts in the room tellings thein an now that archer did not point the finger directlly at any sort of the connection between jo bid and and his sones for hin business dealing to rather stan said that he was that yo harter bot hm wis elling the illusion of that access course really a stunning defellowmen ack when you consider that republicans were sellingness as as they break through that would link honterhis business dealings with his father instead business was apparently never discussed according to deaven archer see the bomshow is the nothing happend they were just talking about the weather this is insane this is insane he was selling the illusion of acess the illusiont how is he what was the illusion te llusionis that he had access to the president and to t the vice president and hoe was selling that illusion by having access to the vice president that is not an illusion that is called access if i say i here i teylhywhere i've access to multipole senators i've access to them lhet me call up ha senator right now and et him on the phone and ten i callp the senter andget them on the phone that is not an illusion of acess tht's access illuion of access he calls his friend who his pretending to be jobiden and then his friend of son thefen o teaa then he hangs up that is the illusion of access actual access is when he is your father and you called him on the phonyes vice president of the united states and he is squiring you around on ariphore suits pick up bags of cashan china and also is in charge of you cranian policy overseeing the prosecutor who ise prosecuting your sons company that is not the illusion of access that is access clearly this is insane and and the meda while clearly the bomshall blew up clearly son eges can happy tokasovsin pretend that nothing is happening here something is happening here and here is the reason tht this becaus jobidon he is really turning up the i'm trestan old family man he is turng that crap up to eleaven he is really turning that seff up because the way that he is in the engoing to defend all this here is can be the final defense the final fences is going to be yes of course i was allowing my son to sell access to me of course i knew about it of would you expect me not to he was a crack at it and i love my son and how to make sure that he is taking care of that is just what a nice family thet my corruption was mandated by the fact that i love my family and jo bi an is really turning the stuff upright this is why he is now knowledge in grand children he never acknowledged until five seconds ago this is why he is doing interviews talking about what wonderful family man has he did not interview yesterday talking about his family life and mans is he look old and men he this is this is full te prepitude severey cusir for mo fiv no up sir talkifo yoevery day tacur con every day he takes om while ie does not extra call navy jonor hrmam but he acknowledge them over the week on a first i wonder why he woul do that why woud you do that did maybe he do that because otherwise it looks really cynical 'she turns out i looks really cynical if say i'm a big family man i love all of my kids in my gran cits except for that one that one who hurts honter and may hurt me politicallywhoy won's acknowledge that one the for your own it loks real bad i looks kind of if you are in the club your in the club atif you are not in the club he is not in h lihe you in the club to use the biding name again i'm not i'm never gngto get over the fact that the actual settlements the actual paternty selmet with hunter jis a lous navy jone from using the last name bidon the only thing that the biding family has trated on for decades that is what has been to niged to the grands arder but now joe says why now i have seven grankits and i love them very much will youdn't love them last week i noticed i noticed wone you d in love last week but now all the sudden you really do in the family man retin archip really really doing it i wonder why maybe it is that you can clam while ya yo hundergo oon i beg op because i love my crack autold son whos screwing pross do di i love that g e ah but it is it is insane and thn he talk more about my family tapes hat when men want to gets to me that ti messages on my mericas rol ah what in a my family whene w gan por messisto me they tapen on the mer the baster oseis not as se wak op in the mining an a ni is son er i guess i was down y onmisyb tese i gashom yee my do ashly take on myshis sos wore tak n my mer happiness is do not chars ma ton o somethin ther some telo some forit tan yo have o si well now they take messages on his mirror mamento youre the president of the united states but again the reason that he is playing the stuff up is because the closer he appears an the more he is a family man the more family cruption just appears to be an act of love and that is where this is going to go it is a more related to jobidinin just one second because that youd is extrordinarily volnorable in a presidential lectual get t that in one second first weu're days away from the jorbin a cords it is the

makes jobidon very very very vulnable why not because it means that he is open to attack fom re publicans that he certainly is but because the only way that jobidon winds is again with high voter turn out jobide and benefited from unprecedented voter turn out in twenty twenty the jump in voting numbers between twenty twenty and twenty sixteen is massive the total number of votes in twenty sixteen was something a hundred and twenty seven million voters a hundred and twenty ight million voters hay the the total number in twenty twenty was something more a hundred and fifty five million voters which is a massive jump a hundred and twenty nine to a hundred and fifty five you are talking about the biggest jump in voter turn out in modern american history and the reason for that is because democrat's blue out the early voting at the changed all the rules sate remailed in their ballats and meanwhilt demi trumplwas out there telling his bakes not to do early voting for some odd reason that no one can quite comprehent but that massive bump in voter turn out is what boosted jobidon because of course don' trump one more votes than he one in twenty sixteen in twenty twenty but this huge expansion of the voter bass men the jobidon one well what is that mean means that jobine neens to replicate high voter turn out if he gets low voter turn out in twenty twenty four he is extremely vulnerable andthisis what the washington post is pwointing out to day democrats are currently worried that black voters are not going to turn out on mass for jobidon they turned out on mass in twenty twenty in large part because the democrat's decided to make black live's matter the center piece of the campaign they decided that the black live's matter jeorge floid hubbub was going to b the the central pitch that they made equity in all things comili harris as vice presen an we will put on the cort a black female justice and all of the sort of stuff and now turns out the jobne is crrupt old white politician cand all the other crut told white politicians it is quite possible now that a lotic young black votercs are just not con t turn up he are not barakabama you do not ofe the tarm it is the same sort of thing with thillery clinton black voters deidn black voters were the margin of victory four berakamama in two thousand twelve there wer the margin of loss for hilliriclint in twenty sixteen there erethe margin victory for jobidon in twenty twenty what is can happeninh them in twenty twenty four it is not about wether republicans win fifteen per son of black voter something the real question is how many black people are going to vote in swing states because they vote this proportionatly democratan high voter turn out this hawbrakabamaan ohio into thousand twelve for example e according to the washington post democrines are really worried about this ther're worried about a potential drop next year in turn out among black voters the party's most loyal constituency there can turn stems from a ten percentage point to pline in black voter turn out in lasters mid terms compared with twentyeighteen a bigger drop than among almost any other racial ar athnae group according to a washington post analysis of the sensus buraus turn out survey s such warning signals were initially papper o over by other democrat successes in twenty twenty two becaus they picked up a seat in pennsylvania and warnock one reelection in georgia butt in key states georgia turn out in lasters midterms was much lower among younger and mail black voters according to internal party analysis the drop and black turn out has become a focus for democratic leaders as the party re orience to next years presidential contest n an't remember in george of the same year that rofio warnock one his realack effort bryan kem one the lection running away in georgia those nota clos election again stacsy abrums it is quite possible that donal trump is able to benefit from lo voter turn out in places lake georgia bidon's a lection in twenty twenty as the washington post points out hinged on narrow victories and states georgia wissconcin michigan and pennsylvania that former present in trum one in twenty sixteen tdemocratackvis are cautioning the party cannot afford to let support from black voters slip well i mean that is that is correct and thes should be worid because jobiden is not exactly in attractive candidates two young people of any sort let alone young black voters who may not be all that interested n corrupt old white man who whose son was clearing a but load moneyan avoiding jail while comitting obvious crimes i get that that iscom me a problem onn ly i jobidn's image is not with th media thin jobines images man there is a photo that emerged from gobidon in delaware your hubof beach delaware a violating theprescriptions for avoiding skin cancer in rhub of beach delaware and the media tried to play this is a big w for jobin i'm just wondering how for those who can see the photo this is jobidon shirtless in a bathing suit staring out at somebody with a camera wering sun blass says in a backwards baseball cap it is not a good look it is nothing t a you want to see is this going to draw in the young voters by the bushel over here this thing this it wuk e tee over here no the answer is nowan again yo physical attractiveness of candidates does it mater what did not for brakobama a you will recall the backin two thousand eight there is a famous photo o brokaba emerging shirt less from the ocean an the media going gagga over all of that doe that matter ye man that sort that sortof of kindot does matter which is wyjobidon being ate to crepit elderly person who obviously involved in corruption schemes with hi son is not exactly a vulder turn out jogger i mean sin tuncling to jog or in crease voter turn out for democrats which is wither freeking out at this point you kow knows this is donal trump it is also the reason mi donal trump is is at this point the most likely candidate to be the republican nomine the reason is because the man st te battering ram and republicans are thinking aboutuobide n the samething without about hillery which is is donal trump can to throw th kitchen sin o jobiton cause he has no limits rit that the fun of watching donal trump primane off the top rope against jobidon again but this time actually directed against jobidn's corruption and directed in a more maticulous way perhaps is quite real is what the poles are trung right now donal trump understands it again the man hasn'n inade understanding of the id of the republican party and he here was yesterday going after jobitonso in twenty sixteen very famously branded hillery clenton as crooked hilleryeim who is worse jobiden hillery clenton well i took the name of crook it we gol a beautiful hillere now because he that one's over with and the word crooked was every broked i think was a very good word for by no his crooked he is a crookat you must corrup president we have ever had and he is also the worst president we have ever had you looket what happened at afcanistin you look at what happened with inflatien look at the economy look what is going on now he is the worst president we have ever had if donal trump could stick to this message whader publicans believe this could be o wenning message and again thereis an element of fun to trump at does not etsist for the other candites right now what the poles show is that donal trump is in a historically strunk position to returns to the white house according to sean ens harry enton he broke down the number is according to mediite behid the curin state of plate in the jeope presidential primary he said quote trump is not only in historically strung position from non in cumet to win the republican nomination he is in a better position when the jeneral than at any point during the twenty tweny cycle and an almost any poing during the twenty sixteen cycoe he says knowone an trumps current pulling position n the modern era has lost ed open presidential primary that did not future n n cumbent he is pliny more than fifty per cents in the national primary poles more than all his competitors combined three prior candaates an open primarysal pulling in more than half the votin primary e tor res in the second half of the calender year before election algor an bush into thousan and hellry clinton in twenty sixteen anton also notes that trump is in pretty good shape in a general is ays trump was up on bine by one point in the quenipiac pole a resolithin the martion of arab an nevertheless a remarkable achievement for the former president he says one trine warning sign for democrats was that pole because that pole is from pennsylvania the tun national pots and pennsylvania a lovoter turn out could actually stop jobidon from beating donal trump well republican voters art obviously trunding toward donal trump at this point its in your times seana college polican night yesterday and it shows that if the only two choices in the primary were trump or to santis right now trump would wind sixty two to thirty one and you can see the brak down here is cenna fascinating when askd to is a strong leader thit this by the way demonstrates that poltics is now the art of the of affect it is performance art it is not atural policy beaus whon it comes to policy there is no question tha do santis is a much stronger leader tan trump just in terms of what he 's been able to get done in the state of florida firs what trump was able to get donnationally trump was hampered by his own executive branch clearly in a variety of ways ranging from the ryots to fouchy to the investigations into him by his own executive branch his own policies were thrwarded every trurn and we know all this right this truff that trump himself complains about an trums of whooz a strong leader none the less sixty nine per cent of republicans say that trump is a strong leader firsis twenty two per cent of republicans toto santis is a stronger leader when it comes to who is more moral thirty six per cent say trump forty six per cents sa to santis people understand that desantis is a significantly more moral person than trump cis on a any cirvlic basic level but then on't care fascinatingly enough when as to is more likeable tforty five per cents of republican voters actually say to santis compare to forty three per cent of republican voters who sate trump 's not that they thing to trump is likeable it is not that they thing the trump is moral is that the thing trump is strong they think that trump is able to be trobiden fifty eight to thirty i to to twenty eight they believe that done trump is better to beat jobidon which is ten fascinating when it comes to getting thingis done which clearly the answeris to santoscy lont mor things on in flora than trump is gott done nashally but does't mattics about affect trump is whenning sixty seven to twenty two in that same pole when as to is more fun an this a big one when as to is more fun fifty three per cent of republican say that donal trump is more fun only sixteen per cents say to santis again a lot of this is affect a lot of this is the imagining of a twenty twenty four race in which tronnal trump is throwing the kitchen saink at cobidon and that is likely what we are going to getcure dow trump knows this which is why he probably is not going to a participate in the debates at this point because why what he is thirty points up in the poles right now now again it is an open primary now it seems to me that he should debate because in an open primary it behoves republicans to be able to decide between candidates but trump put out on truth social last night let them debatesi can see who i might consider for vice president and it is it is it is sort of hard to see at this point how trump is is clawed down because this is really not about any of the other republican candidates being able to over trump trump trumpican have to fall in the poles nor if any of the other republicans to win what exactly could bring trump down in the poles certainly not policy there are other republicans fare attack im on pollicy ronto santis yesterday for example when after him aboute anthony fouchy he is right but does not matter there are the republicans cris cris yu been going after trump is not affecting his ponumbers at all basically the only thing that could theoredically take trump down at this point is an outside indictment which is why tru which by the way benefits trump bekas at that means that every time there is an indictmen that comes down there is publican be another one this week he can say with plosibility literally the only thing that can stop me at this point is democrats indicting me nows i'v said before two things can be tr at once he may be guilty facially of crimes miss handling of last fi documents it can also be true that democrats have a very strong interest in inviting him to stop him trump beatin in jobidon right that is a plausible argument i got one of things that i'v pointed out about rondissansis candasy an again i think the sans is better candidate than trump i think that de santus is a stronger governor than trumplas a president i think he would ake a better president than trum i've nup in shy about any of this but the big probem for rondosantas is that trump sucks all of the eir out of the room and not only that jobidon is running really really poorly at this point if jobin er runing at forty nine forty one against trump then there would be case for to santas but it is very hard fore publicans to make that case in favor of the santas when there basically running even against jobide mek as bidons just such an unbelievably we candidate speaking of these indictments donal trump com mant yesterday and he suggested that done he is going to be indicted soon he e said on truth social i sume an indictmen from doranged jacksmith and his highly pirsin gang of thugs pretaining to my peacefully in patriotically speech will be coming out any day now as yet another attempt to cover up all this bad news about bribe's pous an extortion coming from the biding camp this seems to be the way that they do it and now atlanta is bracing for possible indictments according to the washington post for more than two years people here and across the country have washed and waited for clues thathe high propfile georgia investigation into whe ther former present an trump an his allies broke the law in their attempts to overturn his twenty twenty lechion lost in the tate was winding to an end that speculation hidfever pitchen recent days with the instillation of orange security barriers neare the man entrance of the fulton county cuourt house in down town at lanta simultaneous with them setting up all that security was an appeal by donal trump to the court to besically rule out fulten county district turning fanny willis is investigation ia jodge fulnt county superior court judge robert mac burney miver saw that special grantery investigation in this particular case thasically slap downs on frumps legal efforts to stop all thatsits very likely thet that case is going to go forward in the near future meanwhile adam shift continues to be out there treated as a credible source after lying for years about the russia trump stuff he says there could still be more charges against trumpon january sex you prosicated case as do you expect that they will come out wif an anditemen before that or did they need that an order to make this trum ges case i et were all a bit blind here be cosly havent seen the body o at it ance that the special council has but i would imagine at if the target letter whan out if ther having thesly in a lastman a conversations that is mithis ready to indite i and he may just want a dot of in crossitey by bringing care a gan they may not expect to get a lot of oty obl information but he wants tomature at least he knows tif the other side called circ what would have to say i do not think it is necessary that i the invescation would wai an till then i an as we son florida if the special council gets new information there can always be a superseding indimen on these chandery six chargers ay again democrat's argan al after trumpeting an all that benefits trumpen pimerselp what'is them ein for the other candat's well as i've said before theyre not can win this this race against trump by actually going up directly an trumpeit is not possible he has too much strength inside their publican party which means they need to orient at the media i'm a encouraging ronastansto can mane agan he is the only viable competitors trumpe this point by the polling data there is no third place in this race right now if you got n york times siana collegepol the the same one tht shows trump up by weeps and bounds over the rest the field it is got to sancs it seventeen and everybody else at less than three percent really is to santster boss for anybody who wants to santis to overcom anybody t to be the not trump candidate which means there neds to be a consolidation the fel that is only going to happen if te santis stepped into unfiendly territory the desantis campaign is rolling out a bunch of proposals that rolld down in economic policy speeteh did a lot a policyal is beth orn you no does not care about polisy any one i hate to break it to every one in political sphere but here is the reality you care about pollisy i car abut pollisy the vast majority of voters do not care about polisy they care out personality which is why donal trump becan president of the united states sell s by the wy wy broccoboma became president of the united states without any sort of political experience in actually promoting policy before the gan president what is that mean it means that santis is going to have to step into unfriendly territory and his con have to throw if you punchus that is the only way he' gon to regain any sort of momentum in the race at this point o a time for a couple a thing i and then some things that i hate things i today yah i told you last week that i saw openheimer regt nrowlittoreview it because i had a forty three minute re view of barby which became the most viral thing on the internet for o a frbet im an ta and here is my actual review of openheimer it is a brilliant film because christopher nolan is just amazing chrisphernolen is the best living director there is not a question about this and tom how you turn a three our byopek about a a newclier physicist into a bloch buster movy that involves essentially one big explosion is kind of a master class ou really is anmust ton af film making level the thing is beautiful toe watch the first hour is compelling it is it is the best sort of byopicabout science ever bi by a pretty long margin here the performancis are universally fantastic there ther tons of camyos by people here can recognize aside from killing murphy turns in a great performance obviously matdaman is terrific in this pilm it is a really really really good movi what is fascinating bout from a sort of historical point of view is the way that the movi it is done the movi is is essentially two tracts what no one calls pfisshon and fusion the the fission side is is performed by rober downy junior rober downy junior is om is playing the guy who is the head of the princetin physic's program who originally got openheimer to come over there and ti and who is essentially up for a position as as the head of the departmen of commerce under white ies an our one point actually he was offered to be this real life story he was actually offer to be chief of staff for d white ican hour louis stross louis stross new openheimer the movi sort of implaes that he was jealous of of openheimer and that is the reason why he was implacably opposed to openheimer the basic thrust of the openheimer story in thisitrun real life is that o benhimer was a communust fellow traveller in the nineteen thirties there some good evidence that he was actively being used by the soviets in the early nineteen forty seven during the manhattan project inert sor facilitate trans for of information there is a fairly famous letter from a soviet agents in the united states to lorenti beria who is the head of the k g b was not alle the cage bet time of the cc b om anta about abenheimer implying thet opanheimer was in fact being used to funnal information to the soviet union or least hooking people up there is a lot of controverse about his sovie ties the man was deeply imbedded with tons of communists all around him there were a bunch of people who atually were active soviets bies were present outlos alimos during this period basically the story of opan heimerchast on a historical level is that he was granted a security clearenson or t help produce the bom there were surious security promise with him leading up to that n neverody was worried about it but they really had no choice because all the best neucleer scientists we are all in bad with communists tincluding by the way albeninsteine albanhinstein quite famously was kind of a fan of lenen he literally said about leninquot i honor lenen as a man who completely sacrificed himself and devoted all his energy to the realization of social justice i do not considerhis methods practical tbhut one thing is certain benefis tipet by the guardians and restorers of humanity and that that is what alben hinstein had to say about vladimer lenen somming a lot f these people were communst fellow travellers one reason for that is because most of europe at this plont was divided between sort of fashus and communus ra this dacloit happend in preewar germany is that there there is a divie between the communists in germany and the fasshusts in germany and the right cided wit the fashiosn or stop the communustray that is the story of the early nineteen thirties in late nineteen twenties in in germany and obviously the nosies and up rising to power a lot o peoplele oppose the notsies then fall into the communist capbicaus the communists very often wout would promis sor of equality of man an brotherhood for a lot of jewish expate trits who had been victimized on the bases of race they looked at communism which seggested equality on bases of all the stuff and that ment that they were trending toward the communis camp is why in intellectual jewish circles comunism was very populer in the nineteen thirties and nineteen forties as sort of an anti rasists routine despite its evils a albenheimer is brought into loss almost their serious suspicions about his security even at the time he is given security clenis et the bomdon after the war he becomes a big in ardent opponent of the development of the hydrogen bomb he speaks publicly about how the hydrogen bomsio not be evolopis tal lead to an arms race instead made be should sharetacnology with the russians and there be mutually sure destruction and then we will go weapons down and they are to ways to read that one is as abenhimers fans would read it which is that he was stunned by the power of the bomb they now he turns agains the use of nuwcleer weapons and the possibility of newclear weapons themselves right i'm the destroyer of almana ind the the of the m quotes about a him being yo death the other read on this is that e use perfectly fine using the bom on ge pan when the soviets wanted the bom to be used ontrp an but then as soon as the war is over he did not want the united states leaping way way way ahead of the russians in terms of newclear technology and wont to stop thedevelopment of hydrogen bob an it was these suspicions that led leuis straws to testify to it to essentially worganize a removal of openheimers security clearence in the early nineteen fiftie themovi this sis plate a sort of macarthiite scare ak everybody is it is it is overwrought it is red scare kind of stuff but again there is pretty good material suggesting that openheimer probably should not hadsecurity clearence in the aftermath of the war because he is given security clearancs as an emergency measure but he was a seria an meulic literally every woman he ever slept with the cup was comminist all his friends were communists he he gave money to communust causes he was sited in a letter that is now been uncovered to lorentibaria as a person who as used as a funnalment now mabe that is false mabe it is not true but is that enough questions to remove i scury clearencs it for sure is the movi plays it as though openheimer is clearly not in that camp and that the real reason that he sort of going through this process and respecting the processs because he wants to do repentence for having created the newcleerbum the the real problem with the movi is the time in which the movi is made the entire premise of th movi is that openheimer as created ta means for the world to destroy itself and he cannot actually deal with that and that is te entire plotline of the movi and all the counter arguments to him mutually assured destruction we have to bomgapan becauses a million men will die on the beeches of japan if we do not the notion that we have to beat to soviets all thse are treated as sort of bad concerns the problem is that history proved all of openheimer's critics basically right the reality es that neclear power has been oneof the greatest achievements in the history of science maybe thegrates sachievement in the history of science why not only becaue the development of newcleter energy which is a centially endless an clean but also because the development of the newclear bom itself has made war time death extraordinarily less of a of a mathematical issue meaning that let us take for lestake a quick example the number of american soldiers cuorte killed in world war to was sfour hundred and five thousand four hundred five thousand americans died in world were to a hundred and sixteen thousand americans died in world war one the newclear bom is developed and here are the casualty lists oca hear the deaths by war of the united states for every subsequent war thirty six thousand in the corean war an less than one third the total of world war one and less than one tenth the total of world ware to fifty eight thousand of the anomes are bloody long wars by the way really bloody really long the annom war s nineteen sixty three ninety ten vents twelve year war fifty eight thousand people dead again let us then one seven the number of people dead in world war to the persian gulf wor three hundred eighty two the aroc operations four thousand six hundred the afganistan operations two thousand four hundred and fifty six in the number of war time deaths on planned earth goes down dramatically in the afterm after the development of bom why because iver eno fight a proxy war those proxwors better not escollate into anything that approaches newclear exchange all of the sorito some of e people are plateds villains in the film and an i will not say that there played is outre villains the only person his played service in outright villain is stros by rober downy junior but all of his concerns abut openhimer are are correct openhimer was a wild egotists he was a womanizer he was a person who is deeply involved with himself and there is a pretty good argument to be made that his sort of narcicism led him to make some of the arguments that he was making there is a scene that sort of played for almost truman is the villain in which openheimer n this areal story from american prometheus the biogriphy upon which the film is base there is a a scene in movy where us at where openheimer goes to visit truman and he is telling hme does not on to do the hydrogen bom and that he is very concerned about the casualtees and he says that he is s a disturbed but that he is the person who who created the bom and truman looks at him and he says you did not drop it i dropped it nobody can remember you for dropping it thet can remember you for the science thet can remember me for droping the bom hen hes to get this cry babe out of my office truman was right truman was rih he the fact is nobody remembers openheimer for being the gt a drop the mom cas he did not drop the bom and this is sort of the the out common the movy that is that sort of weird that the movi seems to suggest that the scientists have some sort of special viewpoints into humanity because they developed the science that the politicians are sort of venal and corroped andthey have all these worldly concerns but the scientists are operating on sort of spiritual plain the cult of scientific expertiest probably went out of fashion with openheimer and it is a good thing that it did because the reality is that just because a scientists is greated science is notming they know jack bleap about politics or about human nature again albedeize tin must brillian sciencis soever lived was a fan of lenen wopenheimer was a communis fellow tdraveller an that that the fact is that anthony fauchy does not know about human nature anthony fouche does not know what sort of decisions should be made to balance all the interest of human beings is why we elect politicians this why we do not have scientific god kings and the the the're couple of messages that come away fom the film that are sort if in conflict one is that it is kan of bad that the scientists ouno did not get to run things to the politicians were venal and all this but the other one is that the scientists are really kind of screwed up becase there scrtuptjust all other human beings they 're nt a class apart from all other human beings they are not wiser or more brilliant except in the fields in which thatr wise er more brilliants which includes newclear physics but does not in clee politics i inindicate the fact that it takes on all of these issues and does in a blockbust or fashion a three hour long movy about issues politics science about the interplay of the two about communism verses freedom of speech and all that the fact you wouldo that n three aur filment is can make hundreds of millings valices testament to a while chrisopher nolan is capale of in terms of where this ranks among nolan's films it is it is a different kcind of nolan film i noan's films that you think of ar the dark night or interceller or inception of these vast sort of he is vast visual feasts that is not really what openheimer is is more along the lines of save there will be blood then it is along the lines of a his his prior work as i say it' best scientific by a pickum er made in terms where i put it in sort of the nolin panthe on it is can of strange to put in the nolan pontheon because again is such a different type of film but i'm i will say that i was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it is better than his last you film i i i wanted to love don kirkins that a count of liked dun kirk and i did not tenent i thoght tenent was amass that this one is it is it is such a good it is a filme will watch twice and that is sangalotbecauseits three hours long i caus that is the thing that i to day time for a quick thing that i hate hay ofm my friend matwalsh i he believes that he is now one the greatest of all arguments the argument over you f os he thinks that not only dou aliens exist that they are here on this planet as ho as very obtetlin me yesterday when i said that this is stupid he is very mad and he had basically two main arguments in which he cuoncle destroyed me using fact an logic which dud i've got that branded i'm sorry it is copy righted over the library congressor eady sommin a sumat for for coperarty violation of course i'd then be sooing myself but that took in any case a mat says he has to rguments one is i'm not even opens the possibility there are aliens on earth and two is there is actual proof that their binaliens and are h lets your amount articulate these arguments as he does brilliantly being a lumber jackan all admitting the preconceive byus is a front admitting that he rules out the possibility that any alience could a visited earth before looking at the evidence what is at menemyes that there is no evidence at all that could possibly convince him what what credibility does this point of you have on this if you are sayng from the begin and if i come to you i say iave evidence that alienser is ited earth iave evidence than you say to me does mater what your evidence is i do not believe i already do not believe bu ook a that e when i shuw you the evidence and then you say yet that is not tor vincent when you were already committed to that response you were openly committe to that respons before you look tatince gates that is argument number one right is that im im no evidence could convince me that aliens on earth gets om i said but the bernaproof superhigh subrak that is a big claim that alien species are now active on earth that they are flying their little plans around on earth that theys somehow conquered the distances of interstuller travel and then came to earth and according to witness testimony then morons crashed into a tree that is that is their bodies were available for for for us to peruse whuch is some pretty bad piloting but that that that is the claim hay should i be sceptical of that claim i yeeu yeat the more outlandish the claim the more evidence must be provided to support the claim if you were going to claim that a giant green monster the size of a dr agin emerge from it you are toilet and then procseedd to burn down your local city and i said imanesy some evidence of that you are well one time a guy took a shadow we photo on his rade are i might be wel that is a big claim in it is not supported by the evience you have thus far present could you present with evidence that aliens bee you are sure in fact i think the gverment sucks it prety much everything it seems to me quite plossible that if the evidence existed that not only would we know about it we would see a lot of it and woud be pretty credible which brought us to mat second arguen which is there is evidence how derry because agan i'm nothing that you could not show me evidence to convince me that alien life is is on earthen is zipping around or you could but i neednan awful lot of it now need be supercredible in their neet there again ther're several plausible explanations i say bet's take this logically for just a moment to destroy mat with facts and logic if i say to m there would bunch of dirty dishes in the kitchen i leave them in the sing a wel i lean type hi left them the saing there is the bunch of dirty dishes in the kitchen saing my wife locks in i the morning shot why are all these dirty dishes in the sing and i say an alien put them there and she says well i do not believe you as it will look here is a photo a i'm of a of an alien ship present ent at present on earth and i cannot tell you whether an alien came in here i cannot i'm just come to say that i'm it is possible is 't not it is possible and she is goin to say it is possible also wash the dishes you bade amass because on the list of possibilities this one ranks rather low when i see some of the evidence that mat has an talk man a second the possibility that this is the alien life is tenth on the list of probabilities is it possible sure petty much anything is possible is it probable i think it best it is extrordinarily highly unlikely but here is mat explaining than nunr no it is highly likely but with with with that youa pho i blunk can you missive and there is not of mos tons on enough time you havecomployer found out because the thing's traveling fast and yet in spite of those obstacles still we have hundreds ad hundreds and hundreds a photographs photage that we have seen since the fifties i mean there are compelling a you phophotofs back and the fifties that still have not been debunged people want to say that ther hos as but many of them still people of t u experts hi've been looking at them for that cates not been able to buccom am and what you expect you rexpect them if if you of usiv vis not it i you expect that in ouno back in the midtlent century when there was there is photographic pecnologe men nolican is tot in that every once a while you would see a good photograph and then you' expect that to day there would be a lot more hess exactly what was at i'm here is the thing that is true for retty much everything the records contemborainis records ave got more plentiful becausewe had beter tecnology to document those things what he sayingis that because we now have youknow more photoes ore more things the things that we cannot explain that means aliens i'm saying we cannot explain them i do not now there aliencs in fact that thing its quite unlikely that thei're aliens what he is saying is that w hen a magician makes a ball disappear the ball did disappear you do not see it maybe it' slight of hand but the high probabilities he made the ball di spi now maybe he did maybe violated the laws of physis but how do i know that the magician did not aturally just violate laws pics be cut lo number one cause i think the las of physics are real and im number tubies i think it is much more likely that the magicion is using slight of hand when man says they see objects in the sky that seem to defy the laws of physics first of all right away i'm ne go sceptical why because i think the laws of physis are things that exist and they exist here on earth and that means that if something is defying the laws of physics it is more likely that my eyes are deceiving me than the the laws of physics are being violated ri because he're laws gay if if you tell me they you saw a cup floating in the middle of the air if i told you this righpt i walked in this morning its the cup floating in te middle of the air in are in our office and here a few possibilities one somebody has rigged the thing to look the cup is loating the iddle th air and two it is defying the laws of physics which one do you think is more likely probably one rihts you believe in the laws of physics when something comes into conflict with the laws of physics one or two things has to be through either you are now claming thet not only did aliens come to earth they also defy the laws of physics and are stupid enough to get caught on camera or alternatively it is an otical illusion and your icroplane trics on you or the rate are is now functioning by the way i mean i'll take an example the indapenot rampies just earlier this year talking about on identified aereal phenomenon in the united states they say some of these highly maneuvrable you v os seem to defy physics researchers including those from the pentagons all doman anomally resolution office say these you if those do not show the tell tell scigns that normally appear when objects moving at such speeds experience friction with air the new study which remains to be pureviewed did not delve into more philosophical question such as prove of intelligent light forms another planets but from the you ape the observations the re searcheres said the friction of u ap with the surrounding air or water is expected you generate a bright opstical fire ball ionization shell unteil implying radio signatures for an object observed to be moving in such fashion at high speeds scientists say ionization and associat a radio frequency signatures are expected as they move through the atmosphere in addition to the thermal shock and associated optical signatures but in reports of such highly maneuverable u a pes there are no signs of these signatures scientist speculate the lack of thse signatures could be due to more mondane reasons including that human instruments may not be sensed enough to record these changes the lack of the signatures could imply inaccurate distance messurements for single sihe sensers without a range gate capability say researtures typical you a pcitings are too far away to get a highly resolved image of the object and determination of the objects motion is limited by lack of range data this could be a censeere induced optical lution theres arethe possibilities either there is indeed a ship violatig of the laws of physics which are laws because they are real or it could be that the censur data is now functioning if you stup on your scale this morning and it says that you are one hundred thousand pounds one of ywou things his happening either you are violating laws of biology because you is a human being cannot actually live being a hundred thousand pounds or you are scales mow functioning which onedoyou think is more likely again thes a question of likelihoods mat it is not a question of foreshores because i do not know for sore im saying is that the evidence you are presenting me is goingto have to be better than a guy saw a shadowy image that a pure to defy the laws of physics probably it is aliens maybe it is demon says michael says by the way it is seven p m eastern if you wish to see me

without further ado i will answer your questions and as always i will strive to be as thorough as possible as clear as possible and as concise as possible the first question is about i health in particular i health protocalls for people that are age ing but i health protocalls for people in general the question is i'm noticing that my vision both close and far is deteriorating what are the best i exercises i health behaviors supplements et cetera for the aging eye the answer i'm about to provide applies to everybody regardless of age which is you want to make sure that you view things both close up and far away across your day many many people nowadays spend a lot of time looking at their smartphone looking at the computer screen looking at books in paper in other words looking at things somewhere between nine inches away from their face and their eyes may be two and a half feet away from their face and eyes this is an unprecedented event in human history as far as we know because it was not until the advent of the smartphone that we have spent much time looking at screens at close range relative to looking at things at further distances from our face throughout the day in fact it should come as no surprise that the incidents of myopia of near sightedness is increasing dramatically around the world but is increasing particularly fast in children and in young adults and even an adults who are viewing things at very close range two anda half feet or less now i am not saying that viewing things that dwo and a half feet or less is bad for your eyes that is simply not the case however if you want your vision to be maintained or even improve it is going to be very important for you to view things at a distance as well for i geally several hours per day ow realise some people just simply will not accomplish this in fact i'd everyone at just take a moment and do a rough estimation in your head of how much time during your day time activities you are viewing things at say two and a half feet or three feet or less o smartphone computer screen paper books et cetera verses viewing things that are four feet away eight feet away may be conversation across the table with another human being remer those a some of us are doing that more now that we seem to be emerging from this whole nopandemic phase however many people are still mostly just viewing things within very close range and in fact if you were to ask yourself how much time do you spend looking at things at the distance of many hundreds of feet or taking a walk where you'are not looking at any screen and you are simply letting visual images where the visual imagery rather pass by on your eyes i think for moset of us that number is getting progressively smaller and smaller with each passing year this is an issue because the structure of the eye is such that the lens of the eye can move but also that the length of the eyeball from front to back is actually impacted by how close or how far you happen to view things during the course of your day especially during development there is a classic experiment that would to just briefly describe to you which has been performed in chickens it is been performed in mice it is also been performed on humans where a visual a cluder or a visual image includer is just a in a black a s or screen or piece of cardboard or in a image may be some unoblack and white checks or checkers are placed at a certain distance from the eye either up close or far away and the impact of that on the length of the eyeball and on the structure of the lens and on the quality in a cuity of vision is then measured and to make a long story short what these study show is that if during development you or an animal exclusively looks at things that are up close very close to the eye and does not ever get long range vision the eyeball lengthens and when that happens the lens which a courses in the front of the eyeball which focusses the light on to the back of the eyeball which is where the call nurl retina is where the sells that sense light ar that visual image lands in front of as oppose to directly on the light sensing portion of the eyeball we call the nurrl retina it lands too close or near the lends as upposed on the back of the eyeball and that is par of the reason what we call the consequence of that near sighted myopia in farsihtedness the opposite happens the visual images actually focussed behind the retna it does not land directly on their retna which is what you want its focuse too far behind the retina and that is due to a shortening of the eyeball what i just described actually explains pretty well why kids who look at computer screens are books up close often need glasses yen n when i was growing up they call this nerd cyndrum raising my hand for those who ther listening i read an awful lot a but i also spend time outside fortunately and running round on the sockerfield and looking things in the distance and playing in the neighborhood with my friends kids that spend the vast amount of their time looking at things up close and particular children who do that indoors for mose of their waking time well those kids develop my opia this is parther reason why we have such a am an increase of the incidents of myopia nowadays what is interesting and i think most people do not realize is that even as a young adult an adult and perhaps even as an older adult an elderly person looking at things up close too much at the expense of getting some time viewing things at a distance in particular outdoors can be very problematic because it can exascerbate myopia the short direct prescription here is to make sure that you are getting at least an hour or each day although ideally it would be more of long viewing and that can be done by walking outside and avoiding looking at yourphone while w alking does not require tht you look at a particular object in the distance although if you are scanding for and looking for objects in the distance athe way that a you might on a highache or you arelooking a out tord or off a a vista you are looking for some one in the distance all of that sort of visual scanning behaviour is going to be very good for your eye health and for maintaining vision at a distance if you are somebody who is far sighted and you have trouble seeing things up close well then you need ask yourself whether not you'r spending to much time looking at things off in the distance although i want to be very clear that near sightedness and farsightedness are not necessarily the consequence of this near far viewing there can be independent causes of near sidedness and farsideness but for many people out there who are spending progressively more and more time just looing at things up close you can get this lengthening of the eyeball or challenges in the way that the elasticity of the lends is controlled by the musculature in ways that make it hard to maintain sharp crispvision when you are looking at things at a distance are up close k i cannot because there are simply no studies to support the idea that you need exactly two hours per day of outside long vision of particular distance and or that you want a cut off or have a threshold of in four hours per day of looking at things up close but we cannot say with a hightdegree of confidence that if you want to maintain or enhance your vision at all distances that for every hour or that you spend looking at things say a distance of three feet away or less you want to get at least one hour per day total does not have to be all at once of looking at things out in the distance or looking at things beyond three feet a relative to the distance from your eye k i think for some people who are already badly my opic athis is not going to remedy that myopia you'are still going to need corrective lenses but if youare somebody similar to the person wo asked the question that theyare qotn quot noticing their vision is deturiating really trying balance out the amount of viewing that you are doing at close distance and long distance and and i would not obsess about the total numbers it does not have to be three hours in three hours but the more time that you can spend at viewing things at variable distance throughout the day the better off you are going to be in maintaining and perhaps even nhancing your vision somewhat now there is an additional behavioural tool that we can glean from the recent scientific literature exploring myopia which points to the fact that children who get two hours the day or more of time outside in sunlight ione of my favorite topics i know a many people are probably rolling their eyes right now a when they hear me say you really want you morning sunlight not through window or inshield do not where sunglasses for that trinketmuch sunlightas you can in your eyes early in the day never stare at any light bright ats painful lookot et cetera done a lot of episodes on this we have a light for health episode this is an all the sleep episodes its just such a basic foundation of circatian rhythm in health that i just keep repeating it however there are also large scale clinical trials involving thousands of subjects theyhave shown that people children in particular who get two hours or more of outside time every day have a much lower instance of myopia now whit is really interesting about these studies is that while some of those kids are looking at things further off in the distance than they would if they were indoors on their tablets or screens or with their nose in a book it does not seem to be the case that they have to be looking at things in the distance in order to see this reduced incidents of myopia what is probably happening instead is that the particular wavelengths of light that emanate from the sun that poton energy in particular is triggering the activation of these called intrinsically sensitive melonops and retinal gangling cells which we know oure importt for setting circatiang rhythm for enhancing mood focus an alertness during the day and enhancing the quality in duration of sleep at night but those melonops and intrinsically photosensitive ganglian ells are also involved in networks within the eye that relate to blood flow that relate to the a the ciliary body which is a structure within the eye that controls a the aperture and movement of some key components within the eye that also relate to the crispness of vision that is the acutya vision at both short and long range there ara lot of technical details there in fact im i really hope to get a the great rusvan gelder or doctor rusvan gelder who is the chair of opthemology at the universya washington in seattle who is a world expert in this and the various aspects both molecular and structural of the ciliary body in the lens and is an expert in uviitis a very interesting topic in its own right to come on to the podcasts and talk more about eye health and wewe will do that in tha not too distant future meanwhile if the first behavour al protocal for enhancing an maintaining eye health is to make sure that you are spending at least some time balancing out the near vision in far vision during the day it also stands to reason that you want to get outsiyde for at least two hours to day which i know sounds a lot in order to prevent my opia if your young person and offset the progression of it maybe even reverse some iopia we do not know yet based on the data but there are some indication that is possible by getting outside two hours to day and the cool thing is because many people including myself have a lot of work to do when we need to be on our phones quite a lotter we choose to be on our phones quite a lot this effect of getting sunlight outdoors during the daytime for two hours or more does not seem to require that you stay it off your phone or tableter that your looking at things far in the distance the entire time what this means is if you can get outside on to a patio or a deck or an outdoor table if you can if weather in conditions permit and do some of your phone time and computer time and reading et cetera outdoors now if you are already making an effort to get outside height place sports im take walks et cetera that of course counts towards this two hour threshold and i know thit sounds a lot this two hours and yet for most people certainly will vary depending on time of year but i think striving to get on average about two hours about door time as much as you can or opening or window which would not be as good as getting outside but opening a window and trying to get some natural light exposure to the at ed trigger the activity these intrinsically photocens of melnops and retnal gangling sells that is going to be a really good idea in trying to offset maybe even reverse some vision loss now the other behavioral protocols which you have shown to be useful in terms of maintaining or improving vision relate to the musculature around the eye and the control of the movement of the lens and actually the lens of the eye has its own cont if flexibility its a really really interesting structure am i'll geek out on this far too long if a if i do notprevent myself from doing but the lens is just incredible the fact that it has a specific structure of protines crystallins and things of that sort and that it can a still derived nourishment from blood flow but does not actually have vasculature within it it is not if you notice them men that the lens of your eyes and filled with blood vessels in capularies cause it needs light to pass through superinteresting structure am i think the only violation of what i just said is the manity i an't those bigs or under water elephant creatures that am i think were are endangered down in florida they were getting chopped up by speed boats but i think now there some effort to preserve those thig gentle giants the manity as i recall has a vasculrarized lens which is why their eyes loocopaque it looks they have cataracts a in any case you are not a manity you have no blood vessel supply to to the lens keeping that lens clear is vidal nowadays that you can they can do lens replacement is really a a pretty incredible a progress in the in the realm of opthemal g and surgical replacement of the lens or the cornia of their aspects of the eye but if you are somebody who is interest in maintaining your vision you are going to want to maintain the musculature that controls the movement an the change of shape in that lends and the movement of the eyes which allows you to transition your vision from very sharp when viewing things up close to very sharp when viewing things at a distance and this is where some of the called near far exercises can be very useful when we did a full length podcast on eye health and improving eyesight which i invite you to listen to if you talked about two different types of vision exercises that have been shown to be useful for improving vision at the level of a cuity that have a lot to do with improving the musculature and the movement to the eyes and the lens and that is what is call the smooth pursuit task you could go on to you to if you and put smooth pursuit i task and dou this for a few minutes each day if you are trying to keep your vision strong and what that task involves is as the name suggests smoothly tracking a small dot or cross hatch or arrow on the screen which is very different than the called sicod type i've movements that we often makes a cods are when you dart your eyes to a particular location to look at something that dart it to another location to look at something micros icods are little tiny versions of those that were doing most all of the time believeit or not when you look at avisual scene or image if you did not have those little micro cicods your brain would adaptor would attenuate to whatever you were looking at and the visual image would actory disappear which really speaks how important it is that your perceptions change in order to maintain them this is very similar to whereif something is placed on your a hand say a finger you will notice that change but then if you leave it there for a short while you will forget that it is there because the cells there of adapted out there is no change to your nervous system is largely responding to change this also why when you walk into a room you often notice a novel smell as hope it is a good smell after a few minutes or you do not notice the smell any more because your factory system adapted that away a lot of that adaptation is prevented by those little micro sicods and the mackrosacots the bigger socods are really for moving your eyes around to look for things in visual space smooth pursuit is a very particular kind of visual behavior that you can do in t he smooth pursuit task and zeourl cost costilelile bit of time i suppose to do this on you to and most any of them will do we can provide a link in the shown of captions of one that we or several that we by by doing that smooth pursuit task for a bit each day may be st a minute or two you are maintaining your ability through the musculature of the eye to do smooth pursuit and of course you do smooth pursuit when you move about your day but for people that are shing to offset or reverse vision lost doing some additional deliberate smooth pursuit exercises can be useful the other visual exercise that can be very useful as called near far exercise this is a best accomplished i think by you o holding out a a pen or pencil in front of u your eyes in front of your head and focussing very intensely through what is called a virgence i movement wore we bring both eyes to the tip of the pen and then moving that pen closer and closer and closer to your eyes where you get close enough that you actually have to deliberately bring your eyes i'm for those yeu listening this is what i'm doing right now to the point where it is blurrying you can no longer hold it in sharp crisp relief you cannot see it sharply that is athen you move it out a lote a distance and cannot play right around that threshold where it is hard to keep it in focus now and then move it back out again and then in doing that for even a minute or two you will find is a bit of a strain on your eyes but you can actually build up the musculature and the nurow muscular connections that allow you to do that more efficiently and that has been shown to improve certain aspects of vision specially when people are diligent about doing those exercises not asurely every day blet us a three days a week or thenk king be very fasti actuall find them kind of fun for reasons that escape me entirely a now how close you can bring that object and still maintain it in sharp focus well vary from person af person a based on a number of things first vall how healthy and well performing their nural retina is whether not they have my opia or hyperopia her sideness et cetera whether or not u for instance a you are me and you have a fairly close interpupile every distance or whether not your more wall eyed an you have your eyes set further apart all those things will will dictate the exact performance of of that task but none the less it is a very useful task to do when trying to maintain or improve vision now of course there are a lot more behavioral tools that one could use to maintainer and hancy vision merely touching on the biggest and what i consider the most important ones that are most accessible to people without the need for any fancy equipment at all and if you want to learn more about other behavioral tools that one can use to maintainer and han's vision please see the episode that we did on eyesihte yun simply go to huberman labdok com put into the search function esiht our vision aey'll take your right to t in fact everything on that wevsidt is keyward index and will take you to the various episodes in time stamps that your interested in according to that a keyward now the personwo ask this question who by the way is page singer thank you page singer and the quession got a lot about boats because apparently there is lot of interest in this understandably asked about neutrition and supplements for maintaining or improving vision i that could be a very langthy conversation belicioust summarisein with a few brief points that we know a stand based on the clinical and scientific research we have all heard that carrots are good for your eyes well it is not carrots per say that are good for your eyes it is vitem in a that is essential for the called phototransduction cascade the phototran suchian casade is the process by which the photeresceptors which are in the back of the retna at least if you are human there in the back of the retina take photons light energy and converted into electrical signals thats then conveye to the other sells and nurons within the retnan than passed into the brain to create visual percepts most people can get enough of this fact soluble vitemen we call viteman eh by making sure that they e at least some dark green leafy vegetables and that they do that in theire closest to raw form may be cooked a little bit but not overly cooked ther other sources of vid e mine out there you can look those up on line just for sources of vit e mine most people will be able to get enough vit e minne from their nutrition and will not require from a supplment provided that it is not present at excessively high levels in a foundational supplemen or vieem in mineral supplement getting in some additional vid e mine from a foundational supplement or viee min mineral supplement 'sprobably not can to be in issue unless you really taking far too much of that vid e minne and could potentily provide som insurance but again i think most people can get enough vid e min from their diet if theyare taking care to eat the foods that contain vid o mine greenleaf y vegetables being on the other food that is known to be highly enriched invit emine is liver one of my least favorite foods regardless of what animal that liver comes from liver is somewhat of a popular slash controversial aorgan meat in the nutrition space for reasons that are not interesting am forsake of this discussion anyway a i suppose for those we you that liver you could eat a la bit of liver every once in a while it is youn rich in a number of things that are beneficial to health although for you vegans out there sure you will want to avoid liver entirely i avoid livericause i just simply do not the way it tases i've maybe once or twice i've tasted liver that was appetizing to me and it can be o k but its just not a releast by my read it can be o k but it is not of food that i actively seek out order or prepare for myself on a regular basis am fortunately there are other sources of vid emine as well and again i just invite you to all a put in to a web search yo food sources of vite e mine and figure how to get your daily dose of vit emine by taking in foods that you for you and then in terms of supplementation of things that can enhance vision this is a newer area and frankly it is an area where most of the data point to some supplements that can potentially be beneficial in certain disease condition for instant in fairly progressed age related macular degeneration adrelemacular degeneration is fairly common or more common than we would we should say and it does appear that supplementing with certain things lutine which is present in eggs or egyokes in particular especially egyokes that are not overly cooked or that can be supplemented can potentially help with some instances of age related macular degeneration but the date on this are still emerging i consulted with our chair of opthemology at stanford about loutine and some of the other things theyou will see out there see aszanthine and astazanthines and these a santhines a come from certain fruits blueberries and their present and supplements and things of that sort the consencis i got talking to him and talking some other opthemologist are that if youre really aiming to get a healthy diet you are avoiding cigarette smoking and by healthy diet mean getting sufficient amounts of idomanae and loutine through food sources again you can look up where those o food sources are egyokes just being one of them well then chances are youre not going to need to supplement with loutine or the seeasanthines are the astasanthines however i have heard anecdotal reports from a number of people that they will start taking a supplement for i health their number of them out there we are not as a podcast of fhilia with any of those i hel supplements by the way and people are reporting enhance division an i perceive hemals all the time that say you notav taking this ina lutine at twenty miligrams per day and there i should mention that the dosage that is been explored in a couple of studies is ten to twenty miligrams per day again you could get that from foods you could go above that if you are ore a cavalier or you could go toward the lower at end of that ten to twenty miligrams per day aif you were somebody who tries to whose more conservative i should say well there are not people out there who are a looking at liutine they think it is fairly safe and theire taking hiher dosages of lieutines twenty thirty meligrams per day the'e also taking supplements a contains eazanthines and askeasanthines and are reporting anecdotally that their vision is enhanced i do not dispute those claims but as of now there are not many papers i could only find about four three really solid ones and then a fourth that point to the specific disease instanceis where supplementing with liutine easanthine or asoanthin can be beneficial for slowing the progression of things advanced onset agerallymacler degeneration and the degree of offset for that macle de generation was slight it was not enormous but it was ro robustan noff that it was it warrented reporting in the paper or things lebers which is a particular eye disease of packs a whole different set of systems in the eye basily what i'm trying to say is when it comes to supplements to support i health make sure you'r getting enough vitem in e from your died if you are not consider supplementation or conceder changing your diet somewhat to make sure you can get that lieutine inviteem ineh and if you are interested in it n it is within your budget i do not know of any evidence that supplementing with additional liutie eazanthine and asosanthine can be dangerous at allso for those wheither really interested in a maintaining your improving your vision that might be an airea that you want to explore i personally am not taking liutines zeasanthine or asoasanthine least not at this time i doo take a foundational supplement a which is my source of videmane in addition to my a food sources but i do not suffer from vision lost a do where readers at night and i have for a long time i have a little bit of a a muscular weakness in one of my eyes i'm that originate in childhood i'm occasionall if i get very fatigue one of my eyes will deviate a litle bit a little bit of am almost trbusimess i especiay if i've been awake for very long periods of time ittends to recover once i good nights sleep sume of you that of experiences were you have one eye that might just drift a little i couldo this for the camera if you want ocetsis w eared i use to do this im to my sister across the table when we were at a friend's houses for diners i can actually move one of my eyes in this which actually just reflects that there is a a muscle extrocular muscle a closer in my nose it is rather weak which allows me to do that i cannot do it well with the opposite eye im ima now any to blink to cat clear my vision but the point is that if your somebodywho has a slightly deviating eye slightly often if you go to the opthemol just or optomatrist thy'regin to give you a prism lens which is going to redirect the image on to that slightly deflected eyeball one thing you will really want to discuss with that opthemologist or optomatrist is whether not theire re exercises that you could do to overcome that issue without the need for a prism because what i saw in what many other people see when they put on a prism lensis that indeed it can i'm line up their vision wher the visual perception better but indeed it can lead to progress of weakening of the muscle further and further than that eyeballs are o deviate further and further and that raises a larger question which is should we wear corrective lenses in fact if you go on line you will find or hear about these examples of people that stopped wearing their corrective lenses their glasses or contacts in order to bring their vision backer in prove their vision on their own now if your vision is quite impaired you are going to need corrective lenses or contacts however there are number of people out there who find that if theire vision is somewhat impaired that forcing themselves to view things at a distance to do smith pursuit to do near far and to make sure that theire getting adequate nutrition and things of that sort can all some to help offset some of the visual impairment that would occur if they were to just pop glasses on their face and im and rely on the corrective lenses in order to focus that the light on to the correct i area within the eye on to the nurl retina 'm not telling people to throw off or or get rid of their corrective lenses and contacts but you can be overly reliant on these things a crutch in a way that perhaps you want to do a la bit of work to try and overcome and them m be work with a weaker prescription and certainly in the case of a prism lenses i what i mention before as it is a real consideration it is one i'm very familiar with as a last but i think very important and exciting feature of visual improvement is red light i talked a lowl bit about this on the episode o the hurin la potcas all bout light and health there' some really spectacular i think i considerate spectacular many other people considerate spectaculate research out of universily college london and the work i'm referring to is glen jeffreys work i've no glen for a long time these are animal studies in now two human studies exploring how exposure to red light early in the day can offset some of the vision losts related to agrelay emaculare degeneration or simply age related visual decline there is a whole mechanism here that is discussed in that episode but it haskd to do with the fact that red light and near in for red light together or maybe even separately when viewed for even just a minute to three minutes once or may be two or three times per week maximum can actually reduce the number o what are called reactive oxygen species and the photorecepters thot convert photons into electrical signals the rest of the visual system can understandso that is a mouthful basitly what they found was for people forty years or older if they viewed this red light the distance of a bout a foot and a half though i would not get two specific with us for a few minutes each week total they were able to offset some of the vision lost within a particular domain of vision and i do not have time to go into the details here but because i do that in the light for health episode but you have different types of photoreceptors cones and rods you have different types of cone photoreceptors that respond to different wave langs of light short medium and long wavelings olight called blue green and red cones are sometimes called when these people who are forty years are older viewed red light on a consistent basis early in the day and it did have to be early in the day there was a real circatian effect there there was a offset of some of the vision lost that wuld normally occur in a particular wave length of light range that resulted in better visual cuity over all if you are very concerned about your vision or into red light therapiece et cetera here are a number of different red light devices out there at some future point the hubran labpodcasts may partner with one of these red light companies a sere nomnockin a mension any of them pretula their prominent on line what youre looking for is a red light unit that provides red light and may be far an near infor red scuse me light as well something in the you six hundred and fifty to seven hundred and twenty ish ananimater range really yon scan look red or almost invisible to you if it is really really far into the infor red and you will want to view that at a distance about a foot and a half to two feet and you do not want to be bright that it is painful to look out of kickas you do not want a damage your ises but that is essentially what they used in these studies from the jeoffrey labene showed a'm some pretty impressive offset of some of the aspects of vision lost in tese people forty and older that is an area that i you may want to explore as well especially for folks forty inner older and again this red light exposure had to be done early in the day hopefully that collection of behavioral tools near far smooth pursued some of the discussion about lutine nutrician vitmanae supplementations easanthenes asked a zanthenes on getting two hours of light exposure outside sunlight exposure get outside to do some of your work and perhaps even deliberate red light exposure for certain people can be used to offset your concerns and youre actual potential vision losts maybe ven improve your vision regardless of what age you are everything i described is supported from the pure of you literature and again if you want to get the deep dive on mechanism and further information about dozages please check out the episode on eyesight and improving your eyesight and the light for health episode again at huberman lab dockcol thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the huberman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to huberman labdodcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the huberman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard huberman lapodcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every monday in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard huberman labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocals for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channes huberman labpodcast an other media channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now in especialy exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funs come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for te huberan la premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of huberman labpodcast episodes nodfound elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can s nt up for the premium channel by going to huberman labdoc calm slash premium again that suberman labdoc calm slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in science

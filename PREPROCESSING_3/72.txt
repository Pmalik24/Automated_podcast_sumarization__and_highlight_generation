the shosponserbaexpress vepianistime to stand up against bigtec protect your data express vipianti com flashmen trepublicans are nade giants losing street there arent losing street for two main reasons first republicans have disconnected themselves from data second republicans have embraced the performative over the substantive first the republican disconnection feeback is the only way to course correct when you are doing anything in life wrong if you refuse to adjust to the data you receive when you take an action yhou're likely to continue making the same mistakes over and over and over and yet republicans have decided that data r r enemy not that data ought to be questioned and examined and taken with a grain of salt all which is true republicans have entirely obliterated the feedback mechanism republicans very often seem to believe that the echochambers that we have created are some sort of reality that the republican perspective represents a sort of silent majority that the more extreme the redrick expressed the less public support received the more silent the majority the problem is not disconnection it is that nobody will express their support for the republican position which is what they actually believe now that may be trun certain issues the parent's right movement is great example a broiling under current of dhi satisfaction that broke out into the open in virginia in twenty twenty one that poles were not quite capturing but it is not true over all republicans have now created and unfalsifiable theses when we do something that is kind of un popular it is publicaction till popular because polling does not matter and as it turns out the other form of data feedback elections those do not matter either that attitude has been reinforced over and over again by donal trump because trump one in twenty sixteen despite the data republicans correctly inferred the wre systemac problems with the data and that was true in twenty sixteen but then republicans concluded that all data were not merely to be taken with a grain of salt they could be disregarded intirely and towse particularly truth regarded trump if trump one it was because the data were wrong and if you lost the data were still wrong and he had one when trump one in twenty sixteen it is because the data were not to be trusted which was true and when trump lost in twenty twenty it is because the elections were not to be trusted this why trump can keep getting away with losing therepublican party is thatafacto party of donald trump's leadership until somebody else rests it away from him that is tol politics works under that leadership republicans have on one election and they ave lost five trump's favored candidate have fared uniquely poorly hit is chosen ore an teach a ron aromnam micdaniel has presided over an unprecedented losing street theproblem is not primarily the data itself theproblem is the epublican believe that data no longer can even be used has an important in put in the political system that is reason number one that republicans are losing then there is reason number two republicans are frustrated with our institutions the publicics has become largely performative as youve olivan has pointed out our institutions used to shape our leadership class you en to congress in order to become a congress person u would learn how to doe congress you became president then you are shaped by the office you grew into the office instead oure institutions have now become platforms for more notoriety that dynamic is reinforced by a commentariat the cheers words and pays very little attention to actions saying the right thing or for get the right thing the most militant thing is deems more important than actually doing the right thing we have been told by our commentarye class that the thing republicans lack is courage will power the what we have here is anecian struggle between the dionecian power of dhestrong and the vast under class that hemmen are ston't boul leaders but that is not really how politics works posics is rarely about a lack of will power most of politics is about knowing where the levers are and how to work them toccasionally yo got a will power issue but a lot of time it is not about will power its about in sensif structure republicans seem to enjoy the losing these days they have dispaired of ever wining again because the ods are stacked against them they feel that even if they win there' still going to lose thet deep state will fight them the media will destroy them and here isthe thing republicans are't wrong about any of that but the answer to that is competans not raging not screaming not all capstueets republicans seem to have forgotten that which is why we treat candidate to make loud noisis the same way we treate candidate who actually do things and since loud noises matter most and as thet canniturns out most americans do not really love lod noises the problem of performer of politics feeds right back into the first problem the republican disregard for the thebackloup in fact republicans often treat unpopularity as they measure of virtue the more people hat you the more right you must be again that can be true on occasion but's a really bad rule of thumb what can republicans do to win again well first that can start to look at the data again and courst correct if americans keep saying over and over and over again in five straight lections that they do not something perhap's republican ought to take note perhaps they ought to attribute that not sion of various forces that they cannot control but'the things that they can that can do something about it thei'r messaging their strategy there unwillingness to stick and move second republicans can start to do things rather than just to sav things the answer to charges of malevolence of evil which his democrats favorite charge frepublicans are always either crerupt stupid or evil an they love the evil argument most the answer to that charge is over performance on behalf of the american people the answer to charges of in competans which is democrate second favorite charge is ober compitants be good at your job this is what republicans should be looking for in their presidential candidates especialy because jo biding is incompetent now donel trump is way ahead of the rest of the republican feeling way a had forty points ahead he embodies both of these republican problems twittee he disregards all the data that by the way can be one of his charms he ignores the wags and he does what he wants sometimes that is fantastic because everybody is wrong in he is right but the problem is that if you apply that rule consistently as the rule of thumb that is a strategy that actually makes defeat more likely and then second of all trump is the most performed a politician in american history which is why many people dislike him trump could theoretically learned from the data he could embrace his own record case actuly did a good jobis president rather than the performer of h aspect of his personality that seems really unlikely which means the republicans should at the very least take a look at te other candidate on the taple that is what the theird republican debate nite wit sop os to be about we will jump into that to bate night in just one second first i got tell you my

not him last long with ulick better sleep sarts right now i'll gay jumping into the debate last night iagain i will just point out the democrats are basing their entire elect torl strotigy for jobidin around tonal trumping the nominate nowther doing because the day to suggest the donald trump is likely going to be the nominate but they are also doing because they ware ill to beat donald trump with the dead man in twenty twenty when they figure is yet he is a dead man with e bad record but he still dead and re publicans are ging to ig nor the data ad re publicans are gon to be performative nd that is going to lou jobitin frtruet to the basement while donald trump takes sunter stage and the entire democratic campaign is going to be rooted in completely the wildness of donald trump in's yet hilry clinton for example yesterday shures on the view still peeved over the fact that yhou lost to donald trump which igain god's justice never sleeps and one o the things that i see an american politics over and over and over again is that everybody kind of gets what they deserve in the end a heltoclin lusted after power her entire life and then she 'lmost hand picture opponent and then her hand picked opponent the most pot the second most unpopular figure in modern american history politically defeated her i'm in she got she deserved that lade will ever be presedent but hilleryes tactic here is the democrat tactic rit small i here she is explaining an why trump is bad and this whie bidn't has to remain president what an your we would happen if he work to me me elect oh i cant even i cannot even think that because i think ofd be the end of ar con crete as we know it and i do not say that light wan i hated loosing and especially ha't a losing to him because i had things tei warning signals dran campaign but i immediately that luk we have to geve him a chance we have got to support the president we have and i meant i and i tri really hard and then literally freally an auguration on it was nothing but a cusink people of things making up fact the denying the size the crowd at is own in oguration and everything that i worried about i saw unfolding and to i i think that cannot be even worth now and then she compare him to hitler i that is going to be the democratic campagn the question is whether trump is going to swivel away from that ntelliten i was ober competent look it my presidency the stuff i did rouns presen booming economy pece in the mddle east aa hursh a harsh crack down on russian agression and all those things really good is hegen a run that campaign or is aginsteer directly into this thing with people cheering him that is can be the question and that is the question forepublicans and this is probably wi republicans my wont o take a look that is sim ther candidates now by the polling data what is you real about this the debate last night the third republican debate wats the under car debate trump has been able to fly over the rest of the field the entire republican field right now if iter a star worst cover is the cover of empire strikes back lunch of action the foregrount and giant arth vador in the background a it donald trump is looming over the entire field a huge a huge character in a movi poster and the rest ofthe field fighting with each other in the foreground that is what does looks with that said should we take a look at some of the other cant we should not only because it is worth while looking all the candiates but also because it teaches us something about how republicans are approaching matters of politics in general and what the flaws are cay the dabate open last night with the intros from each candidate the candidates who are the most voke last night it really was can a three person debate there there couple people on stationobody cares about chris christian tem scott the other three people on stage are rondo santis who is been basically holding position since the beginning of this race he has not groan his his share of the vote in any measurable way he is basedly been fairly stable since approximately ow june july of twenty twenty three i sini since july of this year he is been stuck at seventeen percent he still stuck eleke seventeen per cent nicky hayley is the person who has seen some growth she is started off con of linked with the rest of the field she is now popped to about fourteen per cent in the i walk caucases for example and then you have the vakue romasuame who is still stuck down and fore five percent in is very very loud rit he is the loud noises guy in this particular race trump by the way is stol up on therest of the field by thirty forty points and the national pulling average it goes trump fifty eight te santis fifteen hayly nine romaswuammy flor and then everybody else is blow three i here is rondo santis now again as i say i've said this before i think that of the candidates of ill ble on the stage rondo santis the bast nominy why because he is actually competete his job he can point out success is in florita and he can say i did the thing i did the thing is a pretty good campagn slogan i did it rit i made my stake better i made my state stronger at's a pretty good campaign slogan that is basically what the sans was doing last night herehe was now if you look where we are now it is lot thif from ther we were in twenty sixtee in donald trumpsa lot different guy that he was in twenty sixtee she ows it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance she should explain why hou did not ap mexico pay for the border war he should explain why he ract thup whach tat he should explain why he did not drav the swamp and he said republicans were to to get tired of wiming we saw last night i sick of republicans losing in flored up i showed u wits don on year a go her we a o wian sit right here an my ehe dad conmy right te santsis campain is basically se bunking these second prom republicans have if prom number one was ignoring the data probem number too was performative over substance to santis has posed himself as the substance guoi in one second will gan get to nickey haley's intrructory statement first

right n out ok kase the sant as introduces himself as the gui who gets things on nicky haley she introduces herself as sort of the person who is taking data into account that is really her her steck right her stick is i'm looking at the polling i'm a justing based on the polling feeling the polling i'm very durable an a lot of the swing stakes rit that she is trying to go after after republican istake number one there is no feed backloup she saing there is a fee backlop an pangattention o the fe backloop and that is why you ought to vote for me right to do sansting on prong to i do the thing halesting on prong one i look i look the data hure she was last night introducing herself everybody wants to talk about president top i can talk about president chop i can tell you that i think he was the right president at the right time i do not think he is the right president now i think that he put us eight trilliin dollars tan dat and arn kinks er never gan ta forgive us for that i think the fact that he used to be right on you train and and forn if she is now wes getting wek in the neese and trying to be friendly agan i think that we'v got a go back to the fact that we cannot livin the past we cannot lin an gother had lines weve got u tat publicing on what is gon to mak a merica strong and proud again yes she she is the i see the data i see what people want him to give it to them and then finally have t vak romswomt the vakeschik is ignoring both visturals right the data do not relly matter very much and the performative is all there is that is the vak romisuomy story i say that because a vaca shifted his position on every single issue in this campaign multible times but he knows what the base likes to hear i the vak romasuamy is the guy he he is basically a tucker carlson sweet come to flesh made flash and and you colseal last night now again ido not dis agree with with virtually anything the vake is is staying here i just wonder what exactly the vake strategy is here for winning a presidential election he is critiques are right and then he has no prescription which is the which is the essencs it really is the essence of performed o politics the essence of performin o politics burnisanders does not on laght is there is many problems let me tell you about all the promise the is somaeny promise and i hate those promises the really bad probis of publi suck man i hate those problems man i was soebody would do some bothers promise leck me that that is effectively what the vake was doing last night now again i kind of love to tis when he do this la i would mit riht again i'm a conservative i've a gutteral visteral hatred of leggasy media i think they are garbage i think they are liars and i thnk they deserve every bit of scorn thas been heaped upon them in recent years i also recognize this has nothing to d with winning an election this has to do with sort of appealing to the on line base here is he vake last night i think there is something baper going on in the republican party here and i am upset about what happened last night we bek om a party of losers at the end of the day is a cancer the republican establishment i speak the truth a mit since ronomac danio took over as cheer women to the arnse and twenty seventeen we have lost twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty two no red wave that never came we got trounced last night in twenty twenty three and i think that we have to have a count to bility in our party for that materonic you on come on stage to night you on to look the jeo pe voters in the eye and tell in you resign i will turn over my yel my time to you and trankl luk the people their cheerin for losing in the republican party think about whose moderating this tobate this should be tockor corlson jo roke and an elon most we would have ten times the vie worship asking tweskions that jeo pee primary voters actually care about the bringing wore people into our party ting the i ti teactwuld actually tire greka got fell to tos t o democratic debate they would not do it and fac the metis i e cristimit is tis tocas is actually about you in the media and the corrupt mediat establishment ask you the trunk russia collusion hokes that you pushed on this network for years was that reo or was that hilleryclintand made up disinformation answer the question go a billin because this medio rake the twenty sixteen election they rik the twenty twenty election with the hunder by laptop stores an rosanert ry this lecture imers o count obilit en turn to governor nigeter yeu sot what he says that intirecrity again the critique is largely corrc t r by way when he mentions run aron im daniel losing er job which i've been calling for for what a year at the sploin your anda half when he says that he is not wrong we should point out by the way the reason that run aron mc daniel tod not lose for job is because yhouis supported by waigt for ittonnal trump that is why she is still in her job at the are incy and the when he says that here should be it s bate moderate by tucker jorogan and elon muss that that that sort of a slightly weird take given that the only oneof those figures who actually has voted republican any time inth recent passieo mis tucker and tucker is zob shall we say controversal on forein policy inside republican halls if you are reallyan do that you need natural to verse basiv of sort of ideological people in any case the disconnect is between what he says the eaning the criteekue and then his set and then him saing at the end this is how we get our country back what by criticizeing the media i mean again i'm in that business i'm up for it a'm just wondering is that really but if we lect you president the vakromasuammy is you'r chief goal going to be criticizig med i nurtis trum to that allot and then he lost actually you are what what your actually going to need here at some point is to take stock of the first you probins data matters and performative politics is not going to be the solution o get then that abate moves on to forg policy and this was sort of fascinating the're sort of a ab try par tight division inside the republican party over forn policy you got the very hawkish ser of neo con position represented by nickey haily and the othe sort of middle of the road position presented by ronisantis and then you have the sort of fool scale quasy isolationist position presented by vak romasuammy and these are interesting to bates they really are the reality is that i think that the republican party to its great discredit cares very little at this point about policy toebates tbecause te reality is we do not know which sideof tht to bate trump is on when trump was actuall president hofs cantim aneo con and then when you talking about forign policy he sounds povay and then he sometimes looks lake he is get him all over the place 'm not sure that policy is actuate the republican party its about but it was an interesting to bayt will get to that momentarily first let us talk about again your sleep quolity the fact is poor sleep gost is waht gain mood issues pormental health lower prodativity sleep is the foundation of our mental and

and haley mired the same perspective which is that comosnes to get mash which of course is correct here is to santis last night i would be telling b b finish the job once and for all with these butures m r massicring innicent people they would wit every you off the blow if they could he cannot live with that thred right by his country that hama should release ev re hostage and they should unconditionally surrender i'm sick of hearing the media i'm sick of hearing other people blame israel just for defending itself we will stand with thisrael in word and indeed in public and in private i can tell you as govern actually did something about it gate again that is is bac pichues i did something about it that is that is always to santis pitch and then he got romasuammy sogan vevake it he is just a series of twitter impulses that are that are made real here he was talking about israel and then he suddenly swivels and talks aout the american border now i'm a big fan of of solidifying american border i meen going for th american bord to be clothesfor for years and years and years in fact as long as i can member talking about the mogration debate ive talk about th fact that the southern border has been basically unprotected i do not have any ideal at that has to do with hisrael dstrocomass but here is the vacromas wammi traings connected to with the implication being the basically cut israel loose in the face of all hits enemies because we need to protect the border or something which again to disconnected issues america can walk an yhou gum at the same times it turns out the founding vision of israel was based on the idea that they do not wante t an not any body elses sympathy or direction indefending themselves what i would tell bb is that israel has the right and the responsibility to defend itself i would tell him to smoke those terrorists on ti southern border and hen i'll tell us presenty not states ill be smok in the terrorists on our southern border that is his responsibility this is our responsibility o gay that is a complete evasion of the question is to what level of material support you wish to provide to israel which is the actual question in that to bay and then romasammy went even further again performative performative performative the vake dies not on o be presdent has now intention of being present if a vac onts to run for senate from ohio or he woncs to run for a pog cast or he wants to be in trums cabinet wont one of those things but here he was last night going off on ou crane and again i think that a lot of the criticisms of eucranes corruption are absolutely true ou crane does have serious cruption promise is had serious corruption probins for as long as you crane has has been in the postsoviat era with that sad this is some pretty wild stop here from vague you crane is not a paragon of democracy this is a country that has bandalevan opposition parties it is con solidated all media into one statevemedia on that is not democratic it is threatene not to hold elections this year unless the uess forksover more money that is not democratic it is celebrated an nots the in its right commete an cargo pents a man called solinsky do it it in their own ranks that is not democratic more facts for you that you want here from the main stream an neither party or the mainstre midia the regions of you crane that are occupied by russia riht now in the donboss lohaunts done yets these are russian speaking regions that have t not even't been part of you crane since twenty fourteen that other beople probly could not name those provinces for you those are the hard facts and the trane this is some kind of battle between good verses evil do not buy it n that that that is a wild form policy stands 'm n again you crane is indeed very corrupt i've many many probis ot ou cranian government when he says that you crane is basically honey combed with notsies in terms of its upper ranks the govenment is honey combed with notsies and calls telensky the commedian in cargo pans and when he talks about how the occupied resit regions of of you crane cremia to nats lhansk that t these are russians speaking regions and therefor what that russia had a rights to seize those regions in the first place or when it is e just is not a battle between good and evil well i mean both sides do not have to be purely good in order for a particular battle to be between good and evil and it turns out the invasion of a sovereign country and n attempt to depose the entire country's government on behalf of vemost vicious dictator in the region that is kind o nock grate that is kind oknock grte but again tevake is the sall per formative it is just performative is not anactual american formd policy no one thinks it is here is nicky haley taken him to task over this i am telling you puten and prasident shee are salivating at the thought that someone that could become pratot at first thing i'll tell you is we all remember what that got dead when he invaded you crane we all know that half a million people had died becasetut that that is the basic line that haley tok against roms one and this turned into even more performative basily anything that vvak touched in the ebate last night be cant performative and this is it is interesting just on sort of in a a political level to watch the gap between vo vake and the rest of the field the vake is playing the politics of per formance art and other people in the field are really not the santus and haley both would to be presedent again i think that there can a bumper car each other out i thnk that the logic of the election suggest that if haley were able to gain enough credibility that she knocked out tho santis a lot of his support wet then go to trumpet than the election is true well and truly over it may be over anyway but if haley were to knock out to santis again his twenty per cent is not go to haley his twenty per cent ten persen mac goes to halean ten persend mac goes to trump and thelections over if haley gets knocked out presumably nearly all for supportgoes to disantis because a lot of her support baes is rooted in not perticulaly warm feeling towar trump but whatever you thing of that internal logect the the sort of gap between the sansin haley on the one hand who actually have been governor is sactually do things on occasion and tevake is really really wide and you can you can see this i mean last night va vake and hailey we are going at each other wit wit with hammer and tongs he an he he throwgouts am insalts about hurt her wearing heels and then he made n implication that the san to swore heels which is just can very on line pen of garbage bot dont but then he went even further and he went after nickey haley's daughter elge is this guysic are even serious here here ego why y la whin ni calin ing a your question which is about looking at families in the eye an the last te bathe made fimy for acty joining tic tock whall her own daughter was actually using the at for a long toxy bout wi ti care your family first le wa fi here is the truth yo tiosan tur is actually to say that we are just con ban one at we got to go further it is o you have the candidates calling chother scom and all the rest of this sort of sufflic is that what re publicans one a myeu ad t certain poin pukins can have to mak truss cud turns out the american people do not ashil of the performative if there is one message from this debate and from all of politics for the last several years it is that performative politics only works when you are running against tillory clinton that is the only time it works i'm sorry maybe the outlier here is not trump maybe the outlier here is hillery is that hillery with such it dam dislikeable politician and every one hated her for very good reason that literally any per formed of politician could scor points offifer from barokobama in two thousand eight to burny sanders in to thousand sixteen two donal trump in two thousand sixteen but that is not actually a case for per formant of politics as a mode of of getting things done back o the original message if trump is t a nominy or if the tant whoever is t e nominy but assume that its trum for second he is gon have to go back to the drawing board and he is ginto have to actually think about what do the data tell him what do the day tell him because he did lose in twenty twenty and our lek she him not lose if he is thenominate in twenty twenty four an he is in a half to go back to what is heis record what did he do what will he do from here on in not the performative the actual material can just one second again i dn't a lot what vakesat last night what he seid about the meedea's a hundred cent urom the media are absolute hot disgusting garbage i mean they are just a dumbstore fire of horror i'll explain why i say that particularly in just one second first there is a lot at stake this november do not be a chicken and shop at the grocery store usual instead heat on over two good ranchers they'r black friday your way sail is live it is something yo no imis yes theyave great meat pons but theyhave even better meats

good ranchers dod com and use prumocod chipero all meanwhile as i've said when vavake criticized the media honesly ay i i discgrive with the vak on many many things but when he comes to his criticisms of the ress they are if anything not actually strong enough for example over in th malies commas is friends in the press have now hit upon a new strategy the're now claiming the israelis targning journalist according to the washington post quote for weeks hundreds of locally base journalists in the gossistrip have provided the world with intimate views of the devastation on palisinian lives and homes while trying to find ways to survive themselves and keep their family safe yes we are told journalists in gaza are under assalt and it is the journalists are telling us this but there is another story here it is another far mornifarious story and here is the real story it goes this journalist in the gosistrip ore typically propagandus for comas that is how they got in tat's why they been allwed to operate comas deliberately places these seudto journalists in areas designd to shield comas military resources that is how t goes over there yesterday honest reporting which is a five ones he threwweps i dedicated to uncovering prejudice in journalism ran a pretty damned shocking story they reported that during the october seventh massacr of one thousand four hundred as railees in the kinnapping another two hundred and forty gaza base photo journalists working for the associated press and roiders called stringers for the major wire service were present a stringer is an

the journalistic accuracy of the work he has done for us we have decided to spend all tizes with him no reason to doubt his journalistic accuracy i mean other than the fact that he is a terrorist supporter and all and literally haw by the way that the terroratack was going to happen otherwise why was he there journalist do not just stand around on the gossa border the only reason quotan quote journalists are there is because they are in league with komass if there is a surprise attack on a particular sights and journalists are there it is because the journalists knew about that inadvance the other the reasuto journalist were theire as well prepared to take pictures of komasta trocities and then the wire services paid them for it and give them photocredits now this un fortunately is nothing new the quotiquot journalists station in gossa either work directly forkomass or under the thumb of komass all way back in twenty fourteen the times of israel reported the journalists had been questioned and threatend by komas photographers who tok pictures comsstin thad their cameros confiscated and were kicked out ofthe goss's trip the washington posts reported in the same year that iall shefa hospitl had quote become a to facto head quarters for comas leaders who can be seen in the hallways and offices the midalieast correspondent for the waltre journal actually wrote on twitter at the time that comas used all shifa as a safe place to see media but then they inexplicably removed the post y say inexplicably we know exactly why thet remove the post if the post had remain they have ben kicked out ofthe gosse trip one french reporter printed a story about being threatened by komas and then had remove the story for his own safety now these reporters are all claiming that if israel hits the allshifa hospital its not a military sit tdespite tefact they 've all reported over the corse of a decade that this is in fact a military site used as a prop frunts by komass when you see journalism from the gossi stript just understand there are no free journalists in gossa either the journalists are living under kmas's thumb and doing their work or they work directly with comas as one spanish reporter sad quote we saw the coms men hiding behind civillions but had we dared point to cameras at them they would open fireadus an killed ists here is a big question for you would qone quat journalistic outlets the a p and roiders ou stringers associated with say white to premisist groups in order to tic pictures at charlottesvill let said there a ckk fellow traveller who showed up at that big march in charlottesviltine pictures wild the a p have just used hm as te trunger or are they only willing to use strungers who associate openly with terras and voice their support for hittler long as the hte jews and are slomigraticals what moral culpability to the a p and roiders and sianen bere for printing the propaganda of koms and it is minions the answeris they bear in awful lot of responsibility they are making the world a lot more dangerous they 're promoting komasses propaganza and that of course is prolonging the war as usual that reality is obscured via projection it is comos threaten journalis borse post to believe that it is israel threading journalists projection is the name of the game in this conflict always it is why we see idiots or moral purverts playing silly samantic games obviously meant t ' tir israel wit the crimes of its enemies we see morons making vague statements about opposing genicide from all sides which the bilt saing after you watch oj simpson butcher his tatslive and then you watch the police arrest him that you are agans violencs from both oj simpson and the police on all sides got a watch out for that cruel herrific violents only one side in this conflict is pursuing genicide it is not israel and h implication to the contrary is either idiocy or evil it is wy we see idiots or moral purverts at tempting to reflect from comasses crimes with talk about israel's treatment of arabs in israel despite the fact that twenty per cent thof israel population is arab that any jou who wanders intoe goza orginine will be summarily murdered it iswhy we see idiots for moral purperts pointing to civilian casual ties ind goza and murd civilians in isrally villages and pretending that these are somehow exactly the same thing the value of every human life is absolutely infinite that does not mean that the cuausits of every death are equivalents for israel's enemies and for commosses most ardent advocates every single thing is

equivocation the projection has an impact the impact is tpeople who literally believe that is morally acceptable to stand with cmmas this is why you see congressional staffers walking out of congress to demand a sease fire yesterday here is what that looked we a ato a a a ha o e an we a noo a o e th ere or o ethe rere e e a o really teillion an we are or o ethe overemin wort o ytereally novermen

not they'e not give me a break el get by the way they can tell that these are people who do not astury stand by the curch of their con victions because they wont toke off their masks the reason t theyr wearing mass and his now habit out iwas the universty witsconton and i'm schmuck got up wearing a mas ask a really dumb question about a i generated image is that these railies were putting out or some such nonsense and the reason theire hiding their faces is because they should be ashamed of the positions they are taking by the way they are congressable m exactly they are weare staffers are in congress f yoe're still employing moreons corse whoare doing the propagando work of commass tyou might wont to think about whether that is a good idea or not meanwhile pro palistinian protestors tdisrrupted the house judiciary committe on free speech agan what what lends these people the moral credibility is the media commass is playing a game the game is if they can get the mediat to parret their propaganza they can push fraease fire here is only one party that wants seae fire here an it is the party that is losing that would be comms sey hereis the disruption yesterday the you yeure me yourgin e cin mmber me ler i members bt hy woul be in order mthe woull be in orer sorts of distormantses are happening all the time all the time i love when they say that this guise sinse is propal sinians is not equal antisemitism whell mot it is being procomas that equals antisemitism and that is exactly what you are doing that distinction beteen propal sanian an procomass have been utterly obliterated by the movement in favor of commass how many of these protestors are willing to to the comashould surrender the answer of course is zero zero they do not exist where are they they will not say it why will not they say it because if they did then they ould have to admid that israel is right and they cannot do that that is who mit that isrel has a reason to exist they cannot you that either it will never ever tadmit that commoss ought to surrender instead what they will do as you will say things it is commos o terriscripnago cme osso the terrascrup and is real is evil gate that false moral equivocation es the entire desin they do not have to prove hi's been the game all long for those who wish to se the jewish they destroyed the game all long has never been to prove that palisinian authority is loniche hotcomass that these are in any way good liberty seeking organizations or even that th palisinian people whoare in gaza or ingenine that those people desperately want western style liberty and democracy they do not they there is no pulling to suggest they do zero zero it is evident that it is an evidence free proposition they never make that case instead what they do as they sire will condemnterrism but the real terras are tese railies that is the game that they to play and then that allows them to engage in whatever a sort of evil they want to engagin it is laus at concortioa university last night here is one studen were the massae just off here she is screaming what you really things which has this about the jews se screaming afing heyward and then ar astuns at concortiate university who are a hare trying to rip up in his raily flad an starting a physical altercation over it that is not the only phycical altercation is gen get worse by the wiy last night there were a procomss protestors who attact people outside a showing of a film that was compiled from all the go procameras from the commoss terrase israel putget of this film that ben showing it is to journalist bt the duing an secret why because it is astonishingly awful that it is simply cannot be released to th public what id procomoss protesters do they sare to tryig to beat people up outside the showing at the museum of tolerance in loss angelist an no well when tie scal literally nextstories to be in the museum of tolerants premach everyday they would that youknow insane insanely evil and perverse you have to be to beat people up outside a showing of atrocities that were pursued by a terror scrup it that is exactly what happened last night here they were as gal could do was showing this thing and apparently the best way to do piare for your own side is to beat up people quar seeking to learn about what commoss did the the other day and the moral equivalents the mora equivocationthat has been promoted by the media here is absolutely vile it is absoluevile and it is what is causing a prolonging of the conflict it is what commos is hoping for in the same way that the veicong hoped that the media would do their dirty work and eventually undercun american sport for the warn veanom commoss is hoping that the media do their dirty work and eventually undercut support for israel that is their entire goal m meanwhile the american administration is already sor making overturers to the bad guise base on this moral equivalente nonsense but they are doing is theyre trying to now distinguishin comass and the rest of everythng going on in the at eleast oll lother the palcining people the hate comas they now again i wish i really wish i wish tat the palicinging people hate to comemoso much the overthrew them in actully puttin place a government thet wanted to build things instead of bom things they'ld be amazing it are not true i'm sorry it are not the same thing happens to be true with regard to the west bank you ain' tomaria the fact is that people inginine are not looking to an elect to elect a san francisco mayor they are looking to an elect a another terrorist government which is why there is assassination an time that makmotabas the ad of palcinian authority other day mockwon boss by theways a holocostonier who actively pays terrists it is a it a part of palicinan authority wal that anyone who kills a jew fit they are family gets a stipent they get a sipen from the palcinian authority haid for a large pry bi your tax pair dollars mely that where is the avenent but if you can craft in your own mind this bizar false narrative then this allows you to provide some sort of middle ground between evil and not evil right that is which is what many people are looking for this is why there is now in open debate that is broken o over over what happens in gaza after all of this is over israel has said that there is going to need to be some form of military occupationa gozip obviously that is true in the same way that if there is a massive crime outbreak in a major city anywhere in the west police arent on need to go in and theyre there n e state for quite a while that is just the way that it works but twenty blink an saing do not now we cannot have that we can have that instead they are preferred solution its unified palicinian authority rule in gaza and westbank i'm sorry this ridiculous the reason tat's how do i nothes ridiculus the palicing auruthorty baridly even governs should ain somaria the last time the palicingan authorities put up for election in two thousand five to thousand six in the gazistript not only d they lose they were then submit somarily murdered by hamas they have lost the election and ten iom mos killed all of them the reason again the makmabas has not held an election in anywher in in the palconian occupied areas at he is not held than election since ywo thousand at why he is afraid he will lose is the population is extremely radicalize that is just a reality we try to walk your way through this but that happens to be the case fecretarya tate antan blank an tinking out on the coplat a a rat at thavn tok ant a pan no reoccupation gozao the cote es no tor lohato teseive gus no regonin te ter or o gas we must all oture no ter sir than arinate wes tat i'll get well i'm in ord for that to happen guess what israel 's going to have to actually retain military presence in all of these areas but because the press why about this sort of stuff because they pretend that israel is somehow the equivalent of its enemies that is hw you end up wit the solution that israel should not be in these areas to retain actual security and it is a lie theres that believer not thir's natural good piecet cian and a come i know i was shock byt also by aguidam john spenser he is chief of urban warfor studies that modern war institute west point and coterector of

violate the laws of arm conflict rules distilled from a complicated pathwork of international treaties cortrulings and historic conventions scenes of devistation israel strikes on the tabalia refugee camp in northern gaza earlier this week quickly spark accusations israels engaging in war crimes but war crimes must be assessed on the evidence and the standards of arm conflict not a quick glims at the heroing aftermath of an attack he says i have seen it nothing that shows that israily defense forces are not following the laws ofwars and gaza particularly when the charges that the idea of its cmitting war crime often come too quickly for theire to have been in examination of the factors that determined weather and attack and the resulting civillin casualties are lawful the factors that need to be ascessed are the major dimentions of the most commonly agreed to international humanitari an law principles military necessity proportionalid distinction humanity and honor israel has pledged to obey international law proportionality is ar requirements takeinto account how much civilian harm is anticipated in comparison to the expected con crete and direct military advantage according to you and proticalls and otherwards a high civilian death count ingibalia quick potentually be considered legal under international law long is the military objective is of high value the israly defenseforces said the intended target in that case was a senior commas commander who oversaw all military operations in northern gaza neutralizing him is an objected the most likely clears the proportional bar he says that frankly the idea has been implementing and in some cases going beyond many of the best practice is developed to minimize the harm of civildians in similar large skille or ben battles these ideaf practices include calling every one in a building to alurk them of a pending air strike and giving them time to evacuate attactic have never seen elsewhere anywhere in my decades of experience as it also notifies the enemy of the attack tan sometimes even dropping small munitions on top of the building to provide additional warning that been conducting multiful weeks of requests that civilians vacuate certain parts of gaza using multing media broad cast tectan flier drops they provided rootes that will not be targeted civilians have paths to non combat areas bhoug thereve been some tragic reporte the palistinians from northern gaza b have relocated o the south bor subsequently killed as the war rages throughout the strip when commos uses a hospital schol armounts for military purpose it can lose its protected statusin become a legal military target israel must still make clear attempts to get is many civilians out as possible but the cites do not need to be clear of civilians before being attack again this is a military expert who saing israel's not violating the loss war but that is not with he media say the media in all f their wisdom all these morons whove never spent five minutes examining military stratige or even international law accusing israel of warcrins and the goal there is to do the work of hamas to do the propaganda of hamas to do the projection that hamas wants people to do what is that contend with off the media got their way iould in with mostow an power if the meda got their way itw' one with more people dead in the long run is it turns out whn you protect terroris that become more plentiful it turns out that hope is the actual soil from which terrorism grows not to spare oneof the great lies the media is that it is to spare that breeds terrism that is absolutely untrue it is hope immediate hope that what you are doing is going to make a difference that breeds terrorism that is why people do it and the media are providing that hope by propagating the lies of hamas and contracting with actual terroris where shooting film when the're not shooting is realy civilians already coming up will be joined by senator
